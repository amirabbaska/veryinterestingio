			<div class="markdown"><p>That's usually because for most kinds of caves, where there is one, there are likely many more. Due to the ease of communication and available technology today, all it takes is a random hiker tweeting about some weird cave they saw to attract the attention of the right people to start researching the area.</p>
<p>I know the lava tube caves near Mt St Helens are a crazy expansive network, many of them closed off with no openings. Some of them have been mapped, but for the most part I think people just guess that there must be hundreds of them.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I was staying in Phong Nha-Ke Bang Ntl Park, Vietnam and went to a talk about Hang Son Doong cave by a leader of the British Cave Research Association.</p>
<p>They found it because an illegal logger noticed a large cave entrance with a large river flowing out of it in 1991. 18 Years later his guidance (through trial and error) led the BCRA to the right spot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For every single cave we have found... there are probably a few thousand we haven't.  Most of the super large caves have probably been found because of ground penetrating radar and other recent satellite technologies. Crawl space sized caves hard harder to find and probably number in the 100s of millions.</p>
<p>The truth is that nobody knows how many there are, but we keep finding caves everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None that I know of. You could probably calculate a theoretical average for a given small area of a uniform geological condition, but there are soon many variables to take into account. Take mount saint Helens basalt geography for example. Many of the lava tubes are empty, others became water channels. some of the older ones mineralized and filled in over eons. Definitely a promising area to install a subterranean volcano lair though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The third method is called Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), a decent primer on how it works is here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_tomography" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistivity_tomography</a></p>
<p>Ground penetrating radar is limited by several factors, size of the radar array, amount of power available, type of material of the ground (highly reflective metallic soil doesn't work well) and generally has about a 0 to 40 foot accurate depth from what I have seen personally, others may go much deeper. Seismographic scans mentioned above go deeper still and I forgot about those. That's one of the ways we know we have continental plates and different core materials. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As with any wavefield imaging method, there is always the trade-off between resolution and penetration depth. Because high frequencies are attenuated more in almost any material, deep studies of the subsurface can only resolve subsurface characteristics on very big scales.  High frequencies are instrumental to high resolution imaging.</p>
<p>The deep methods for inner earth are not at all suited for any local characterization, for the energy provided to probe the earth that deep is usually generated by earthquakes. Too much energy I'd say for local exploration, and one would have to know that earthquake occurence beforehand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>GPR can theoretically penetrate 60'+ using the 12 to 80 MHz range, but the resolution gets pretty bad so you'reâ€‹ going to have trouble picking out smaller features.  The general rule is 1&quot; for 1'.  So at 60 feet any feature less than 60 inches wide relative to your scan path is not likely to show up and that is under good conditions.  GPR is also very open to interpretation for geophysical examination.  If you are looking for relatively shallow utilities, reinforcing steel in concrete, or shallow rock formations it is pretty good and very cost effective.  So it is a popular tool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how close it is to the surface. There are very deep burrowing earthworm species, the Giant Palouse (sp?) earthworm may be one such. It's certainly possible things like that have made it in there. If water has flowerd into it, it's possible there may be microbes and bacteria, If its an underground cavern fed by an underground stream that is at any point on the surface there may be fish or insects. A truly sealed rock cave would be unlikely to have much in it though. It is possible for trees with very deep roots to penetrate cave roofs. But generally it would be unlikely for much life to be in one unless there was some sort of access to food and whatnot.  </p></div>		</li>
