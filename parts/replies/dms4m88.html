			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh God. Long comment, but a lot of badhistory here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dark Ages</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dark ages are though of as having never happened, being an outdated historical idea. As matter of fact, if the term is used it refers only to the paucity of the historical record, not the lack of technology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>abolition of Paganism by the rising Holy Roman Church, most notably with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria under Bishop Cyril</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You mess up varying historical events here.</p>
<p>The Library of Alexandria was burned by Julius Caesar in 48 Before Christ. The area in which is stood was then burned again by Aurelius in 270-275 AD.</p>
<p>The closing of Pagan Temples occured in 391.</p>
<p>Hypathia was killed in 415.</p>
<p>Though the mistake is often made in pop culture, the Great Library didn't exist anymore when Hypathia was killed, and likely hadn't existed for nearly hundreds of years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These ideas were widespread in the church, and with Rome's political power waning it was less and less likely to find practical support for academia, for classical arts, music, math, etc. The church very much accepted the idea that came to signify the middle ages--that the road to holiness involved rejecting empirical study, aesthetic pleasure, fine art, practical trades, and pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A complete and utter amount of nonsense you've written here. </p>
<p>It would hard to get further from the truth.</p>
<p>It was the Catholic Church that founded schools and universities, it was Catholic church that sponsored many world famous artists. Catholic scientists developped what would eventually become the scientific method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although I am just an armchair historian, I agree with you.  The common mistake being made in this thread is the conflating of the Dark Ages (400-800: invasion &amp; settling of Europe by warlord tribes) with the Middle Ages (900-1300: peaceful empires, stable ruling houses, universities, technology, hospitals, pilgrimages, increase in trade &amp; exploration, general law &amp; order).<br />
Unfortunately it is far to easy to look back and call everything between Rome and Renaissance &quot;the Dark Ages&quot; but that is just lazy history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entire notion that the collapse of Rome was the collapse of European culture is asinine.  Part of a stagnant Mediterranean empire collapsed.  It's impact was negligible to most of Europe.  If anything, though, it liberated the former Roman vassal states to develop their own unique cultures.  There are 51 distinct European nations.  Compare that to East Asia which has been dominated by Chinese empires for 3000 years, you have 6 nations.  It's clear evidence that there was massive cultural development in the period following the collapse of Rome.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting the intellectual developments of the period.  Hell, the Carolingian Renaissance predates the actual Renaissance by 600 years.  On top of that, we also saw the introduction into Europe of crop rotation, the horse collar, the highback saddle, and the iron plow.  They might not be exciting to modern museum-goers but their importance to agriculture, warfare, and political structure cannot be overstated.  And we can't ignore the contributions the Vikings made to shipbuilding and commerce either.</p>
<p>Without all those developments in the Early Middle Ages, Europe would have never been able to go on to develop/obtain gunpowder and the printing press which were necessary for the development of chemistry, the heat engine, and the Industrial Revolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, complete and utter nonsense. One look at a medieval cathedral will tell you that 'empirical study, aesthetic pleasure, fine art, practical trades and pursuit of knowledge' were alive and well under the church. </p>
<p>More broadly it's nonsense to suggest that the church at the time stifled intellectual endeavours in any way. </p>
<p>I'd recommend Isidore's etymologies to get an insight into the pre-modern intellectual sphere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lack of dark ages in America, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Australia etc and yet no exponential progress in those places casts some doubt that the one prevented the other.

<p>That mysticism and withdrawal from study of the empirical was the way to salvation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The separation of church and state was a major change too, probably because the kings and bishops had got too out of control. The state could have independent view &amp; make laws for the common good, replacing paganism with secularism. You could have new or unpopular ideas without being burned at the stake.</p></div>		</li>
