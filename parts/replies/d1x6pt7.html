			<p>Just defining what consciousness is without having valid counter-arguments thrown against the definition is probably a nigh-impossible task.<br><br>But I think it is probably more useful to think of it as a spectrum of functions within a brain that have varying degrees of power and applicability. We tend of think of humans as being the &quot;most conscious&quot; animals, but that probably doesn't even apply to all humans, and what is it we're measuring? You might also be able to argue that we are the most unconscious animals as well - that is, we have some of the most incredibly advanced 'autopilot' and 'muscle memory' systems in our brain you are likely to find.<br><br>My understanding is that conscious overriding thought is but a tiny fraction of our brain activity and is also the least efficient processing mode in terms of time-and-energy required to complete a task.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; My understanding is that conscious overriding thought is but a tiny fraction of our brain activity and is also the least efficient processing mode in terms of time-and-energy required to complete a task.<br><br>There should be no need for it at all.<br><br>If evolution is in full swing, we don't need consciousness.<br><br>Our robotic selves would have mastered mating, survival, interactions, etc without needing to be &quot;alive&quot;.<br><br>Which of course begs the question ... if you have a universe full of unconscious matter, what is the point of anything existing in the first place?  Who is observing the universe, if it can't observe itself?<br><br>That last part is where the mystery starts.  There is no need for it, seemingly other than for us to be able to actually &quot;experience life&quot;.<br><br>But I'll leave it at that, since that gets into a totally different subject area (a mix of quantum physics tossed in with &quot;something bigger going on&quot;).</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Viruses? Probably not.<br><br>Make that <em>definitely</em> not.  Viruses aren't even alive.  They're essentially DNA attached to a syringe.  The DNA contains instructions on how to make more viruses, but it needs a living cell to &quot;execute&quot; the code.</p>		</li>

			<p>That study does nothing to suggest that viruses are alive.  It shows that their DNA has a common ancestor to cells, but that's it.  Nothing about viruses' ancestors will change the definition of the word &quot;alive&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>What exactly defines &quot;alive&quot;?<br><br>Now we're veering off topic here, as my original post was saying that viruses aren't conscious (that I still strongly believe), however when we are talking about &quot;alive&quot; that's an entirely different thing.<br><br>This is a good article on it from Scientific American that explains it better than I can:<br><br><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-viruses-alive-2004/" target="_blank">Are Viruses Alive?</a></p>		</li>

			<p>So genetics are the code. When the code compiles different hardware gets built. Its the hardware that is responsible for the actions we see every living thing make.<br><br>Different algorthims lead to seemingly more or less conscious Behavior. An ant needs a counter to navigate to and from its nest. <br><br>A human probably contains more machine learning based algorithms like what a self driving car has. Given input data we learn but are capable of making mistakes. A virus lacks almost any real hardware and is basically a copy and past type of action.<br><br>Is this a pseudo accurate analogy? Maybe.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Evolution could produce more sophisticated &quot;robots&quot; that could handle this.&quot;<br><br>You say this yet clearly we have the contrary. We have various animals with varying degrees of consciousness. We think we are so &quot;conscious&quot; but we might not even be scratching the surface of just how conscious a living thing can get. <br><br>If we simulate behaviors such as choose left if A is true and choose right if B is true then to some extent the entity making the selection is conscious. I think consciousness has to do with the amount of information one has to work with.<br><br>We are creating conscious programs and machines all the time, but for some reason because those programs or machines consciousness don't match up to ours we dismiss it. <br><br>An ant computes all the time, it probably isn't questions its existence like we do because it doesn't have the hardware or the programming to view life at such a universal scope. </p>		</li>

			<p>Which is why there is a theory called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_information_theory" target="_blank">Integrated information theory</a><br><br>I see what it is your saying. Even [Christof Koch] (<a href="https://theproblemofconsciousness.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/the-problem-of-consciousness/" target="_blank">https://theproblemofconsciousness.wordpress.com/2015/01/03/the-problem-of-consciousness/</a>) says &quot;You can simulate weather in a computer, but it will never be ‘wet’.&quot; in regards to his theory which states there are degrees of consciousness. <br><br>However, I have a problem with that statement. 'Wet' is relative. Wet exists in our reality. For a simulation, we've created another reality, we can't possibly expect the machines consciousness to understand our &quot;wet&quot;. However, it could understand the concept of wet we give it and assuming we make that resemble what wet is to us, the similarity would be to close to differentiate.<br><br>The same could go for us. The universe is currently expanding into &quot;The Other&quot;. Scientists don't have a better name because its impossible for us to define. The universe contains all of space and time. To try and understand something outside of our space and time is futile. Logically something must exist for the universe to grow inside but we can never be conscious of it, but that doesn't make us any less conscious of what we do know. </p>		</li>
