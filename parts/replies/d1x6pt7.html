<p>There is some dividing line between machine-like behavior (viruses) and conscious decision-making.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the result is exactly the same every time, I'd say it's machine.  If it's different given the same general conditions, I'd say it's learned.</p>
<p>For example:  scream at someone, and likely 99% of the time, that person will jump.  However, that's assuming the first time.  If you do it again a few seconds later, much fewer will jump.  Third time even less.  </p>
<p>But shine a light at their face and their pupils will constrict.  Do it again, and it'll do it again.  Every time.  That's a machine response.  </p>
<p>Viruses do the same thing everytime.  I'm pretty sure cells do as well.  But at a multicellular level, I feel like they'll make different choices.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We now have machines that learn, however. Even ones that learn in non-deterministic fashions, such as genetic algorithms. However, I think it's a stretch to say these algorithms &quot;make choices.&quot; They simply do exactly what they were programmed to do. Complex life forms may be the same way, but the problem is that there are just so many variables that it is literally impossible to repeat any experiment from the same starting conditions. For the moment, we can't know if we are machines or something more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That depends on how you look at what they are programmed to do. <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.nl/2016/01/alphago-machine-learning-game-go.html" target="_blank">AlpaGo</a> was built to play Go, which it did. But, the specific moves and strategies weren't programmed. It learned how to play by studying games played by human experts, then by playing against itself thousands of times. It found new strategies that no human knew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing magical about making choices, it is simply a learned response with humans having able to create more complicated conceptilaztions for our choices. We are machines because we are made of atoms and obey the laws of physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've thought about this a lot lately. If our individual cells always respond to stimuli the same way, then how do we actually control our actions? What if everything we do is just a machine response with an unbelievably large number of variables that prevents us from seeing the pattern?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because there is no free will, not as we've been taught. The immediate reaction most have to this is to jump directly into fatalism, which is an amusing mistake as well. Not everything you do has to be taught to you. Do you know how you beat your own heart? You didn't have to learn, you just do it. Likewise, did you have to learn how to be conscious? You didn't, you just are. Do you know what <em>wills</em> you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you can't control your actions and free will is an illusion. The concept of being responsible for your actions, law; these are all just (learned?) mechanisms which aid survival as a species or a community.</p>
<p>I think it's healthier to live your life as though you are in fact responsible for your actions though. The machine that is you and the ones around you might have a more dopamine and oxytocin enriched life that way, and I think another (limbic) part of the machine that is you would favor that.
Your brains have likely learned to process and act as if it is responsible for its actions anyway so knowing that it's unlikely we really have free will won't influence that, hopefully.</p>
<p>Not that you have a choice in any of this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this criterion a lot, though it would seem to imply that plants are also conscious -- which actually sounds fascinating, if a bit far-fetched.</p>
<p>I'm talking about an experiment conducted by a biologist Monica Gagliano, where she would drop Mimosas pudicas, which collapse their leaves when disturbed, and they would stop reacting to the drops after a few times, 'learning' to filter them out as irritant that do not represent any danger.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still feel like the plants aren't really consciously deciding what to do.  Like...  even with humans, if you keep hitting them, eventually their pain sensors will dull the pain due to repeated stimulation.  I dunno though, I'm not a biologist since I gave up on the bio degree I was working on after the second or third year lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would suggest that spiders are basically robots, but more intelligent animals require function-specific brain domains that can result in different levels of consciousness emerging.</p>
<p>Creative problem solving requires the ability to maintain a mental model of the world, and to conduct thought experiments within this model, so that a solution can be found without having to do extensive trial and error in the physical world. This requires a concept of an objective, and what it would mean for that objective to be met. It is also a requirement for the concept of a 'choice', or decision, with different outcomes depending on what is chosen. You can't believe that your decisions are meaningful unless you understand this. Some mammals and birds can solve problems like this. </p>
<p>Beyond this, I think that for a true 'self-concept', significant social intelligence is required. Only by understanding that there are other beings with their own objectives, independent of your own, can you begin to see yourself as a conscious being, and then question your own desires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would suggest consciousness is an emergent phenomenon, nothing more than a &quot;more complex&quot; version of the &quot;robot&quot; version of life.</p>
<p>I personally don't believe that, and think there is more underlying consciousness then just a particular arrangement of atoms.  But I have no proof, as there is no proof on either side.</p>
<p>Exactly when does it pass from &quot;robot&quot; to &quot;conscious observer&quot;?  Is there some specific threshold that makes this happen?</p>
<p>If you want to dig really deep into this (I have, sort of a weird hobby of mine) ... you can bring in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics\)" target="_blank">Observer Effect</a> ... which, while not requiring consciousness per se, starts to get very strange very quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that being an observer is significant. The threshold would be between an unconscious being and a conscious being, but I wouldn't like to try and define it. </p>
<p>Consciousness could be 'more' than simply mass/energy in some way, while still emerging naturally from certain physical systems. It may lay in the some abstract realm, like the laws of mathematics, for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ha-ha, this reminds me of psycho history and Hari Seldon.</p></div>		</li>
