			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only tangentially related, but it relates to how different radiation passes through material. How dangerous is gamma radiation? Obviously, in high quantities, it's very dangerous. But how dangerous is it at a given quantity compared to alpha or beta radiation?</p>
<p>I recognize that in terms of actual radiation poisoning, the answer is more complicated, as it involves a lot more chemistry, but in terms of a thought experiment, where something sits inside your body for the rest of your life, would it be better for it to emit alpha, beta, or gamma radiation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The classic &quot;science prof&quot; example of the differences goes something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have three radiation sources. One each for alpha, beta and gamma sources. You have to eat one, put one in your pocket and put one in a lead safe. What is the safest combination?</li>
</ul>
<p>The answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gamma radiation source passes through you with the least effect, so it's the &quot;safest&quot; one to eat. (It also has the most penetrating power - many of the particles will just go through you without stopping.)</li>
<li>Alpha radiation is very harmful, but is also easily stopped, so the source can be &quot;safely&quot; carried in your pocket.</li>
<li>Beta radiation is less harmful than alpha, but penetrates much more easily, so it is stored in the lead safe.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>You have four sources: alpha, beta, gamma, and neutron. You have to eat one, throw one, put one in your pocket and hold one in your hand. </p>
<p>Hold the alpha emitter, as it can't penetrate your skin. Put the beta in your pocket because the denim from your jeans will stop it. Eat the gamma since it won't hurt you much. Throw the neutron emitter because neutrons are bad. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I am wrong but wouldn't it be better to avoid storing a beta source in a led container? From my understanding, wouldn't that effectively turn the beta source into a gamma source due to bremsstrahlung?</p>
<p>The higher Z the shielding material is the stronger coulombic interactions between the beta particle and the nucleus of the shield are. So it would be better to store in a low Z material such as plastic.</p>
<p>I definitely understand the thought experiment but I just wanted to discuss your last point. I'm finishing up a Radiation Health Physics degree so I want to double check my knowledge!</p></div>		</li>

<p>The order of &quot;dangerousness&quot; inside the body is alpha &gt; beta &gt; gamma. If the source is outside of the body, alpha isn't too bad as it won't penetrate the skin. It hitting your skin is still <em>bad</em>, but not as bad as hitting vital organs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small doses don't cause radiation poisoning, but do have a tiny cancer risk.</p>
<p>Gamma and beta are about the same because gammas deposit their dose by knocking electrons around anyway.  Though a gamma might end up exiting your body without depositing dose.</p>
<p>For a given amount of physical dose, alphas are about 20x more likely to cause cancer, so are much worse.  They do damage more densely because they are slower-moving and carry more charge.</p></div>		</li>

If we were able to reliably synthesize macroscopic quantities, enough to power an annihilation based rocket engine, and built that engine, how would we dump the energy into our spacecraft?

<p>We call that device a &quot;mirror&quot;.</p>
<p>Seriously: photons carry momentum, and reflecting them with a parabolic mirror in the &quot;back-there&quot; direction will produce a forward thrust.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each pair of gamma photons goes off in opposite directions but each pair will go off in a different direction compared to any other pair. It's not as trivial as a mirror (which also would need to be a fancy gamma ray mirror). You need a photon nozzle, a device which takes all of the different momenta and adds them all up, same way a rocket nozzle does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't actually optically reflect gamma rays like you can with low energy light.  Their wavelength is so small that they just interact with individual electrons, so every material looks pretty much the same to gammas except for the electron density.  </p>
<p>What you could do is have matter and antimatter annihilate in a chamber where 'backwards' is open to space and 'forwards' is covered by the ship, so all backwards gammas would leave (thrust) and all forwards gammas would deposit their momentum in the spaceship (internal, no net thrust).</p>
<p>Your efficiency would then be 1/4pi for transfer of created momentum to thrust.  </p>
<p>With relativity, your thrust for an energetic particle is
p=sqrt(e^2 / c^2 + 2em) where e is your kinetic energy.  For gammas this is p=e/c where e is a good fraction if Mc^2 where M is the mass of fuel, so you get 1/4pi <em> Mc </em> (whatever fraction of annihilation make gammas), which seems pretty good even with the huge losses (as long as a lot of the antimatter fuel is fuel and not just heavy containment).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL/DR: Your &quot;mirror&quot; needs to be far thicker than a planet to handle the energy a proton-anitproton annihilation produces.</strong></p>
<p>Antimatter is not very efficient fuel for a rocket because much of the energy (about half) released is in neutrinos spewed in random directions, and there's no way to make a mirror with walls thick enough (far thicker than a planet) to direct that energy in a way to make that energy useful for thrust.</p>

<p><strong>NASA</strong></p>

<p>...</p>
<p>... various muon and electron
neutrino particle–antiparticle pairs carry off ~50% of the available
annihilation ...   Antiproton ... The energy appears to be
about equally distributed among the three particles with the
neutrinos carrying off ~2/3 of the available energy ...</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And while the rest of the energy is at least theoretically possible to harvest, it has its own challenges since much of it is also absurdly high energy gamma-rays, etc: </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Conclusion ...    </p>
<p>.. Furthermore, the p‾ LCR is outperformed by the radiator-cooled, fission GCR in
terms of IMEO ...  In addition to a substantial radiation shield and magnet mass, an
antimatter gas core design would require a large space radiator
to dissipate unwanted gamma-ray power. Regenerative cooling
of the shield/pressure vessel configuration requires a significant
propellant flow rate into the cavity due to the large gamma
power component. <em>This quickly overwhelms the high
I-sp feature of the gaseous core concept.</em></p>

<p>In contrast, fusion reactors seem much better: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Inertial fusion rockets with αp&gt;100 kW/kg and Isp &gt; 10^5 s offer outstandingly good performance over a wide range of interplanetary destinations and round-trip times</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes. PET works by incorporating short-lived radioisotopes that undergo Positive Beta Decay (aka positron emission decay) into organic compounds and allowing those to disperse into the tissues of interest before you image.</p>
<p>Isotopes like Carbon-11, Nitrogen-13, Oxygen-15, Fluorine-18 (most common) can be added to compounds like glucose (or mimics), water, ammonia or - if you want to be REALLY specific - compounds that bind a particular receptor or feature of a cell.</p>
<p>Typically the easiest thing to do is to get some Fluorodeoxyglucose - glucose where one of the oxygens is replaced by a radioactive fluorine - and inject that into your patient. Then you simply need to wait about an hour to let it disperse throughout the body and begin the scan - which is just making a heatmap for the gamma rays that result when the position produced by the beta decay annihilates with an electron.</p>
<p>Of course, figuring out the exact source of the decay is a bit tricky, and there's a ton of math and statistics involved in making the image... but that's for someone else to talk about.</p></div>		</li>
