			<div class="markdown"><p>Hunger is driven by hormones as well. If you eat a lot and then inject insulin - your sugar will drop and you will want to eat more, despite being fed. (danger, never play with insulin, may lead to death).
There is also ghrelin that may make you hungry, even when you still do not actually need the food. </p></div>		</li>
