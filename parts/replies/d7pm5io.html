			<div class="markdown"><p>i was going to comment similiar to this, there's actually been studies on smallmouth that you can move them up to like 5 miles away from where you caught them in a river and they just go right back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be pedantic, but I think what you might be describing is the difference between largemouth bass, which are more often found in slow moving water likes ponds and lakes, and smallmouth bass, which are found in fast-moving water.</p>
<p>Smallmouth bass are, pound for pound, much more tenacious and better &quot;fighters&quot; when they're hooked than largemouth bass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong about the difference in large and smallmouth bass' fighting abilities but I'm familiar with the differences.  We have plenty of largemouth and spotted bass but not many places with bronzebacks around here.  Spotted bass are more likely to be in a river if given the opportunity, and they fight more like a smallie than a largemouth but I still recognize the different species and their different fighting abilities in a river versus a lake.  Like I said, it's just my observations and there are other factors that could and probably do contribute.  I'm not the only one that's noticed the difference between them in a river vs lake around here.  We're lucky enough to have redeye and suwannee bass in some of the mountain creeks and rivers but they barely make it to legal size for some reason.  And there's mean mouth in a couple mountain lakes (because of the smallmouth population) but I don't think they have an official species distinction.  Just a smallmouth crossed with a largemouth or spotted bass.  About the only species we don't have within a couple hours drive are Florida strain largemouth and shoal bass.  Just a little too cold in the winter I suppose for them to thrive here.   Although there was a stocking of &quot;Tiger Bass&quot; (trademarked name) in Smith Mountain Lake last year I believe.  These Tiger Bass are a hybrid of northern and Florida strain largemouth that are supposed to have the ability to grow very fast like a Florida strain but the ability to thrive in the cooler waters like a northern strain.  I'm not sure how they're doing in Smith Mountain but they are supposed to be THE bass for stocking private lakes and ponds to produce trophy bass in just a few years.  Sorry for rambling.  But no, I'm not confusing largemouth and smallmouth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool, that was a very informative read! It sounds awesome to have such a diversity of bass to be able to catch. I'm happy pulling 14 or 16 inch smallmouths of out the river. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like you.  I wish more people were like you.</p>
<p>Sorry, that was just random, but I just got out of a threat with a bunch of nutters talking about ghosts and &quot;astral projection&quot;, and your non-expert, but extremely well worded and considered post was pleasant to read.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p></div>		</li>
