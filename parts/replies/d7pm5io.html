			<p>Dude, what you said was gold. If I wasn't broke, I'd had done it too. No such thing as too much advice when you're fishing.<br><br>Also, you explained it really well. That helps too.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's really cool insight on bass!! People interacting with nature regularly get first hand knowledge of that kind of thing that scientists might not be aware of yet, which is exciting.</p>		</li>

			<p>very interesting to hear about the differing strengths of river vs calm water bass. Have you been able to discern a difference in muscle/fat composition or taste? I realize this question isn't valid if you're strictly catch and release:)</p>		</li>

			<p>Can't comment on the taste.  Not that I'm above eating bass but there are better tasting freshwater options.  As far as muscle/fat composition, I can't really tell that specifically, but river fish tend to be leaner looking and I rarely catch a big, fat, really heavy bass in a river.  They seem to be more streamlined I guess like you would expect for their situation.  But I don't know if that's because fighting the current keeps them trim, or if because they move to slack water for an easier lifestyle once they get old/smart enough to realize they can have an easier life elsewhere.  My guess is their size/body type is determined by their location/conditions/available food.  Something that is interesting, I've heard first hand of large bass (10-12lbs) being caught in a lake and moved to a private lake/pond where there is an abundance of food and the fish have actually lost weight.  It seems that as they grow in their environment, they learn how to become efficient at eating in that environment's conditions.  Taking them and dropping them into a place with an overabundance of food, that is easier to catch, doesn't mean they immediately learn how to take advantage of that situation.  They may learn over time, but within the first two years (in the scenarios I have witnessed) they hadn't adjusted well enough to even maintain their original release weight.  It's a strange world to try and figure out. </p>		</li>

			<p>Wow, that is a interesting scenario.  I don't fish much anymore, but as a kid I was at it all the time.  Pulling a 6lb bass from a small pond is one of my fondest memories.  I used to mess with my parents' small pond a lot and introduced a lot of small stream species like Green Sunfish and Pumpkinseeds thinking it would produce more big bass.  The little guys pretty much just took over, and I wondered why there wasn't this TRex largemouth dominating the pond..... fond memories all around though!</p>		</li>
