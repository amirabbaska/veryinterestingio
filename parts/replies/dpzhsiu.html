<p>2/10 not nearly as cute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the fuuuuuck. That’s so interesting. There was one at the zoo but the placard made no mention of this. </p>
<p>So they are able to breed in the before stage? What I’m asking is, do axlotls come from salamanders or other axlotls?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that axolotl are far enough into maturity (imagine them to be the pollywog - the tadpole with shrunken tail and legs) of this salamander species. They're far enough along in the life cycle to be able to reproduce.</p>
<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but the fully metamorphosed axolotl doesn't actually exist in the wild anymore, so it's actually just this strange pseudo-larval stage that has managed to adapt and thrive without actually moving on to its final stage. It's a natural function of survival for a frog to need to get on to land eventually and feed on what's up there. These guys have just managed to keep things running just fine in this lower stage.</p>
<p>It's like if we suddenly realized humans actually have another form above us, but we just adapted to this oxygen rich environment and had no need to move on past this, but that as soon as we move to a methane-rich atmosphere, we suddenly begin to metamorphose into Ripley's Aliens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Axolotls are their own species. It's actually very rare for them to metamorphose, and it only really happens when exposed to iodine in captivity.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK axolotl have approximately the same lifespan as the closely related tiger salamanders, which do metamorphose.</p>
<p>However,if you force an axolotl to metamorphose, it will probably only live a year from then on. On the off chance that an axolotl metamorphoses naturally, its lifespan will usually not be cut short. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The legs are definitely too short. At least for artists, an ideal (male) figure is 8 &quot;heads&quot; tall and the legs are 4 heads long, with the crotch being a midpoint. The example shows the adult being 8 head lengths tall with the legs being only 3. It's really strange because if they did the proper 4 head lengths it would emphasize the point even further.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.drawinghowtodraw.com/stepbystepdrawinglessons/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ideal-proportions-male.jpg" target="_blank">There are a lot of charts like this showing body proportion</a> some even displaying the <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/a1/ff/38/a1ff387678ef404f519c124b9619f9f0--drawing-techniques-drawing-tutorials.jpg" target="_blank">change in proportion by age</a>.</p>
<p>edit: It seems like the<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Human_development_neoteny_body_and_head_proportions_pedomorphy_maturation_aging_growth.png" target="_blank"> example on the wikipedia page</a> was a traced and colored version of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Neoteny_body_proportion_heterochrony_human.png" target="_blank">a diagram published in a Journal in 1921.</a> The original has a lot of ambiguity about where the crotch is due to the center vertical line on the older figures, and I think the artist decided the crotch was where the thighs first touch.</p></div>		</li>
