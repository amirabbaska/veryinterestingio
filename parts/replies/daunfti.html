			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in Finland only &lt;1% of lithium is recycled even though lots of it is collected and my estimate is that it isn't much better in other countries. Currently there are some projects involving this but there is so little amount of lithium in batteries that it's far from economical enough to start recycling it.</p>
