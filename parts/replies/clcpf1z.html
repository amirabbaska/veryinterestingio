			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for your illumination!</p>
<p>if i may suggest one small word choice edit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The private and black arms market is incredibly complicated and incredibly, well, <strong>immoral</strong>. Money talks, not your ideology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>are you maybe shooting for <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/amoral" target="_blank">amoral</a>?</p>
<p>thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Within the context of the majority of black market arms trading, immoral is still the word I am looking for. Amoral is not having a sense of right and wrong. Immoral is having a sense of the concepts and acting wrongly. I consider brokers who knowingly arm groups like ISIS to fit that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You really think arms merchants who sell to groups like ISIS aren't <em>immoral</em>?</p>
<p>Amoral seems to be letting them off lightly. They know what they are doing and what the outcomes will be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think their actions, to us, are immoral. i think they are acting amorally - putting currency overtop any sort of ideology. knowing what they're doing and what the outcomes will be, and disregarding that, is exactly what amoral is getting at - they're acting without regard to any sense of morals, be they ISIS' or society at large's. </p>
<p>i offer the arms dealers no quarter or leinency. regardless of word choice they're becoming needlessly wealthy by directly fueling conflict involving dropping chemical weapons on civilians, among countless other atrocities. </p></div>		</li>
