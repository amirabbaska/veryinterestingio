			<div class="markdown"><p>I work overnights.  Midnight to noon. </p>
<p>Everything shifts to as it was during the day shift:  </p>
<ul>
<li>The times I am most productive tend to be about 4 hours after arriving at work.  </li>
<li>My afternoon dump is about 5 hours after arriving at work.  </li>
<li>My sleepiest time is about 6 hours after arriving at work.    </li>
<li>Morning wood has shifted to when I wake up at night (it was still at 6 in the morning when I started the night shift, very inconvenient).  </li>
<li>I can take a 15 minute nap at anytime, 3am, 6am, 9am - even in daylight with windows.  </li>
<li>When I get hungry is a little off because I eat when I am tired, which is more often.  But breakfast 12:30am, lunch 6am, Dinner is after noon.</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an ex night shift worker, you are forever slightly tired and could always nap if you're not needing to wake up.  I slept way too long when working nights constantly.  </p>
<p>But the body will be tired in the day if it has been up too long also, so that is why your friend(s) were able to sleep during the day.  But immediately the body won't switch to &quot;daytime equals sleep&quot;.  Also the lack of melatonin from sleeping at weird times disallows a deep, full sleep.  Probably why I was ALWAYS able to fall asleep whenever I was home.</p>
<p>Edit: Clarified the two seperate facts, and elaborated on day sleeping more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's true for some people but I loved it. I worked from 9 pm to 6 am for three years and thrived. For me, it was key to have a fixed sleep time (noon to around 7 pm), which a lot of the other workers didn't do, and to maintain that schedule even on weekends. It kind of sucks for the social life but changing up your sleep schedule on weekends will really mess you up.</p>
<p>The job later morphed to 5:30 pm to 2:30 am, which worked better  for a social life as I could change my sleep schedule from 3 am to 10 am, which is a little more normal to other people.</p>
<p>For the last 22 years, I've worked a job that goes from 5 am to 3 pm and I still haven't gotten used to that. I'm just too much of a night owl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work overnights, and I've been doing so full-time for most of a decade.</p>
<p>My sleep cycle is set so that if I go to sleep between 2pm and 10pm I'll sleep until 12:30am-3:30am. I almost never sleep past 3:30am. </p>
<p>However if I go to sleep any time between 4am and noon? That's &quot;Nap&quot; time and I'll rarely sleep for more than 2 hours. </p>
<p>My &quot;Normal&quot; sleep cycle is 3pm-11pm, so I guess 4AM-12PM is considered &quot;Afternoon Nap&quot; by my body clock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long would you reckon it took you to get use to this cycle, ie. you mentioned doing this full-time for almost a decade, so if I had to start swopping my day and night sleeps around, how long would it take me to adjust? Also what do you do for work that requires these times?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here, been working nights &amp; overnights for 20 years. I'm used to sleeping when the sun is up, and as a consequence, being around bright lights for too long makes me sleepy. I have to take breaks staring at my computer screen or I end up needing a nap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow graveyard worker of about a year here.</p>
<p>My body doesn't know what a nap is.  It's either a full rest or nothin'.  Only reason I manage to wake up early is if I set an alarm or am worken by loud noises, and even then, after only an hour or two, I feel worse than I did when I fell asleep like my body isn't close to being finished yet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really sure why this answer is upvoted so highly, but there are other factors at work here and melatonin is only the tip of the iceberg.  What about other hormones like hypocrine, growth hormone, cortisol, or the amine hormones of the thyroid?  The <em>biggest</em> factor affecting sleep is usually the circadian rhythm (any body pattern on a 24 hour clock), and this is controlled by quite a few different hormones.  If your answer was correct, then it would be physically almost impossible for anyone to work a night shift/graveyard shift.  If melatonin is the key factor in sleep, then why does grave's disease (hyperthyroidism) cause insomnia?</p>
<p>Melatonin does affect sleep, but to say it has a <em>lot</em> to do with sleep relative to everything else involved is gratuitous at best.</p></div>		</li>
