			<div class="markdown"><p>There are forgiveness plans for exactly that with student loans. They have 10, 20, and 30 year forgiveness plans. You have to call them up and talk to them about it to arrange it. If you can show you've been making student loan payments in good faith for 10+ years without missing a payment there's a good chance they'll forgive the loan. </p>
<p>Look in to it, man. It's worth pursuing!</p></div>		</li>
