<p>The essence of OP's argument is correct, but it doesn't linearly increase the chroma resolution for all color, just horizontally for the individual Cb and Cr subsamples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't end up with increased color resolution, it's still a 4:2:0 image.  You would have to re-encode, and try to interpolate the correct color information, at the downsampled resolution, based on your higher sampled 4k data.  This requires error-diffusion and dithering.  This is not done on the fly when you look at Youtube 4k videos on a 1080p screen.</p>
<p>4K videos simply look better because the bit rate is way higher than 1080p is usually streamed at.  Even after accounting for the extra resolution, the bitrate is a lot more.</p></div>		</li>
