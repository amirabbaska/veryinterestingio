			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on the distance between the marble and the bowling ball. For circular orbits (which I will assume since the mass of the bowling ball is much greater than the mass of the marble), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_two-body_problem" target="_blank">r*v^2 = G(m1+m2)</a>. The maximum velocity the marble could have corresponds to its closest possible orbit to the bowling ball (the marble is orbiting just above the surface of the bowling ball). This maximum velocity is about 60 micrometers per second. Smaller velocities are possible for larger orbital radii.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the decay is primarily caused due to gravitational radiation, it would take a reeeeeally long time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tidal drag might actually be significant if the bowling bowl were not spinning initially. A very low orbit might decay and cause a collision. I'm at work though, so can't do the math at the moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is my understanding that the marble would not crash into the bowling ball as long as the orbit is stable. The bowling ball has no atmosphere so orbital decay would not occur. I would like somebody else to jump in and explain gravitational decay, however since no theory of quantum gravity exists there may not be a solid answer to this but I am extremely interested if somebody can provide some insight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly true except that all orbiting bodies radiate away tiny amounts of gravitational energy as gravitational waves. In this scenario it might take many many trillions of years, but eventually the marble will crash into the bowling ball due to it losing orbital energy incredibly slowly via gravitational radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the the other comments, there would also be tidal forces due to the fact that the bowling ball is not initially spinning. Energy would be lost from the orbit as the marble exerted a gravitational force on the bowling ball to radially accelerate it until the spin of the bowling ball matched the orbital velocity of the marble. </p>
<p>If the marble were below a synchronous orbit, the orbit would still decay causing an eventual collision, if it were above a synchronous orbit, it would steadily accelerate away from the bowling ball, similar to the way in which our own moon is gradually leaving us...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definetly could, but I believe under pefect conditions, no. </p>
<p>There was actually a calculation done recently that concluded that with each complete orbit the earth is some miniscule amount closer to the sun, maybe 3 inches. Perfect orbits are possible, but tricky</p></div>		</li>

<p>The marble and the bowling ball would just gravitate towards one another...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm wondering what happens if they start with no initial force, a lot of distance, and they are then allowed to collide. Would the marble eventually be moving very quickly?</p>
<p>If so, and if our imperfect marble hit our imperfect bowling ball head on but at the point of a scuff mark or a chip in the surface or on the edge of one of the finger holes, is it possible for the marble to ricochet in such a way that it eventually gets trapped in a stable orbit?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats actually an interesting idea. My gut reaction is no. I know very little about the process by which we launch satellites into orbit, but my understanding is that we usually launch straight up or at a very slight angle, and at the vertex of its ascent, it begins a second stage that fires perpendicular to the planet, creating the orbital motion. </p>
<p>We usually do this to avoid losing efficiency to air resistance. In space however there obviously wouldnt be any. I suppose with a sizeable irregularity in the marble or the bowling ball, it might be possible for it to bounce off the bowling ball onto at least a semi-orbital path (i.e. Not a perfect circle). Its not likely, but I would say certainly possible.</p></div>		</li>
