			<div class="markdown"><p>Other related note: That study is essentially a replication of an earlier study by Carrano and Biewener which had the opposite effect of what you would predict. I suspect no one tried again for 20 years because the original results were so weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has generally been thought that the reduction of the tail drove a shift of the center of mass (CoM) forward from non-avian dinosaurs to birds, with a correlated shift from a more vertical to horizontal femur orientation. The idea is that the foot should be under the center of mass, and birds solve this by flexing the femur. As a result, we think birds walk differently from non-avian dinosaurs, with more knee motion and less hip motion; this makes them less ideal as models of non-avian theropods. </p>
<p>Carrano and Biewener figured that adding weight behind the hip of birds should shift the CoM back, and thus make them extend the femur and walk more like non-avian dinosaurs. This might be a better analogue for non-avian dinosaur locomotion. So that's what they did- give chickens tails that should shift the CoM. The results were bizarre. The chickens didn't extend the femur more. They didn't even maintain the same posture. They actually ended up more crouched, with a more flexed femur. It was weird.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, in the Grossi et al. 2014 study, the birds do end up with more vertical femurs when the tails were added. Those authors think the difference might be that they started with young chicks, and let them grow up with a tail that was a certain percentage of their mass, whereas Carrano and Biewener used adults. </p></div>		</li>
