Using your example, wouldn't a <em>lot</em> more people be able to buy the $17,000 car tab the $200,000 one? (And thus get the parent companies equal or greater profit?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but you won't sell a lot of cool looking 17,000 cars, because looking like a lambo also means that it would be incredibly impractical.  Most people looking at $17,000 cars need some kind of practicality. </p>
<p>Not to mention that the hardware that allows a car to look like that in the first place is expensive:  mid engine is $$$, the suspension that allows such a low hood line is expensive, etc. etc.</p>
<p>You also can't really use the platform for other types of cars. When a company like BMW uses two platforms for their entire line-up, having an entire platform that only works with one low volume vehicle is very challenging. The BRZ is the closest thing we have today of this concept, and it has been a very slow seller. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely not. The margins on the cheap cars are in the hundreds of dollars (a 17k car certainly nets them less than a grand; closer to 200 bucks), and they'd <em>kill</em> their high-end market entirely. The high-end market <em>wants</em> to look different than the cheap cars. If you take that from them, you'd immediately remove a major selling point of the high-end cars. </p>
<p>Cheap cars that look like expensive ones aren't drawing buyers from the expensive pool to the cheap pool--they're driving people from the expensive pool, for a fleeting advantage in the small pool. If everyone has a car that looks cool, the appeal of them is much diminished. </p>
<p>It's not at all worth it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Closer to 200-300 bucks. The margins on typical cars is pretty tight; the luxury end is much more profitable.</p>
<p>What you're getting at, kind of, is that they'd <em>kill</em> their high-end market entirely by doing what OP asks: why buy a lambo if it looks like every other car on the road? The <em>status</em> of it is immediately removed, and the draw of the car is immensely removed. You can't exactly drive 120 mph on most roads without winding up with felony charges (actually happened in Minneapolis/St Paul last year), can you? But you <em>can</em> drive envy in all those who see your car.</p>
<p>If you suddenly remove that envy, why buy an expensive car? No one's really able to tell the difference, so there's no draw.</p>
<p>You'd <em>tank</em> the sales of the high-end market, and have no real increase in sales on the standard market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was just pulling those numbers out of thin air. I kinda felt it would be lower than I cited in the comment at first, but $200 is even less than I had been thinking.</p>
<p>Still, just about anyone remotely into cars is likely to have a better idea of the real numbers than me, so I'll take your word for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^ Furthermore, it's assuming that people only buy these cars based on performance. Since we know that isn't true, people would select the cheaper option and drive it normally in freeway traffic like the rest of us and never need to compare it to the abilities of the higher end models.</p></div>		</li>
