			<div class="markdown"><p>We learn about these these things every day.
We still use plastic bottles. However it has been known. And some countries are already taking action, on the fact that platic CAN cause cancer. Especially when you have been in contact with it sinds a very early age. It disturbes the hormones, which can cause cancer later in life. For both men and women. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right because nothing manufactures put in our beverages is toxic... oh wait... they do.  We have a clear understanding but people ignore facts and companies pay off the fda to keep pumping toxic chemicals into foods/beverages. Most stainless steel.
Always look for the material used in the bottle, you’re looking for #304 or 18/8 food grade stainless steel. If it doesn’t say that you likely are holding one with aluminum or non-food grade Stainless. Those also often have plastic liners that often contain bpa and/or other chemicals that are dangerous.
The best one I’ve found is food grade stainless on the outside with a ceramic interior. No metal leaching even from good quality food grade stainless and the steel protects the ceramic from breakage.
Cheapest I found was $20. Just one word of note. Don’t leave fluid in them with the lid closed over long periods, I accidentally did and now it tastes and smells like drinking from a  spider nest as a water bottle. At least what I think it would taste like drinking from one. We’ve tried everything to clean it and clear the mildew to no avail. (So if anyone knows how to beat that from experience please tell me). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. I wonder if there's any galvanic action going on? Metallic taste is very similar(or maybe the actual same thing) as the sensation of electric current on your tongue, i.e. licking a battery. Maybe putting a metal bottle to your mouth causes a very slight electrical potential to form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this thought as well. With a well constructed, homogeneous piece of steel this should not be an issue in theory. If the bottle was welded or soldered with another metal or the steel is not manufactured with care this could definitely happen. This is sort of related, but I found that when I use my yeti stainless can coozy it has a funny “licking a battery” taste on the rim of the can. To remedy this I place a paper towel in the coozy before locking in the can. The paper towel creates enough of a barrier between the metals to have no effect on taste. I think this is especially an issue with this yeti can coozy product because the turning and locking action of the rim can grind the aluminum against the bottom of the coozy. This serves to grind away any oxides on the surface of both metals, allowing the two metals to come into direct contact and create a galvanic reaction. To me it is unacceptable design oversight for such an expensive product, and I was pretty miffed before I found a work around. They should line the bottom with epoxy or something for the 40 bucks you pay for the damn thing. Works great now, but cmon yeti guys anyone would have found this out using the product for like a day or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if there would need to be two metals i  the actual product for this to be a thing. I think licking copper for example can cause very small galvanic potentials to form, because your body is always gonna contain a whole bunch of trace metal amounts and just that may be enough. But I'm just guessing here.</p></div>		</li>
