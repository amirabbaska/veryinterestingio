			<div class="markdown"><p>same here (though, crohns rather than general IBS). if you're still dealing with acne, try out witch hazel, wash your face twice a day, and use preparation h cooling gel (NOT any other kind of preparation h! those have steroids that will destroy your skin) for spot treatment. took me from multiple active cysts at all times, to pretty much zero acne (3 pimples in 6 months, all of which went away in a day).</p>
<p>not sure how much help your gastro doc has been, but make sure you're regularly taking a good probiotic, it helps to mitigate symptoms for me.  I (and other docs I have talked to, as well as researchers--including the guy that invented the method that led to the development of humira, the drug I use to mitigate my crohns) believe the root of the issue is a microflora imbalance, where the antibiotics killed off the good bacteria and was replaced with bad bacteria. for me, I notice the sugar tends to make things worse (pretty sure the bad bacteria feed off that), so I try my best to avoid it. other foods cause issue, but I believe that is due to lacking the bacteria to properly digest it, as it shows up later if you know what I mean. best of luck in dealing with your IBS!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im using the Canadian equivalent of epiduo, (tactupump) and I found that it worked at first, but now my faces doesnt even get sensitive from it and the acne doesnt go away like it use to, could it have built up a tolerance? I heard this is the best, and my derm keeps me on it even though Im still getting acne as this is apparently the best</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used epiduo for a time and I too developed a tolerance to it. hell, I've used pretty much everything on the market--they all either did not work, or worked for a month or two before no longer working. dealt with cystic acne for a decade, had my digestive tract screwed up by antibiotics, had no other options a derm could offer. did my own research, read about witch hazel, have been using that as a face wash twice a day, and using preparation h cooling gel for spot treatment (<em>cooling gel</em>, not any other type of preparation h as the rest have steroids which will destroy your skin). last major pimple was 6 months ago, have had 3 since then that were all so tiny I didn't even care, but those went away in a day.</p>
<p>not trying to make this stuff sound like magic, but it is the only thing that actually worked for me for more than a couple months. I went from multiple active cysts at all times to a clear face after consistent use of witch hazel for a couple months. your acne might get worse initially as it forces out all of the garbage in your pores, but after that it will clear up. just remain consistent with using it twice a day. (if your face is especially oily, you could probably use it 3 times a day--I give my face a rinse if I notice it looks oily, which tends to be 2 sometimes 3 times a day).</p>
<p>best of luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think youre set then. I dont think it ever got me to the point of blemish free, but it has just lost its effectiveness for me. used to work miracles in a matter of hours, now its more like a chore and takes days to run its course</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmmm, I've got epiduo too! I don't think it is a &quot;permanent&quot; solution though like you're saying. Together with acné-plus, this is one of the best creams. The best thing against acné for me is changing my eating habits. One week of &quot;diet&quot; (just not too much fatty food) does wonders!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah it maybe isn't a cure for all x as is so often the case. Just for me i used it a few times and that was it.i maybe put it on one baby spot about 2-4 times a year that's it now. Yes well done with the diet...illimination diets can be quite amazing. I have a thyroid disorder and without going into detail - although doc says i have no problem with gluten- if i avoid it completely my thyroxine levels increase themselves by 50% and i have to reduce my medication (fake thyroxine). I found this all out by reading a book on illimination diets for auto immune deseases.  (Not to be confused with anti immune deficiency ).</p></div>		</li>
