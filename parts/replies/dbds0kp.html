			<div class="markdown"><p>Good comment.  I thought I'd just provide a real life example to illustrate how expensive some science can be.  </p>
<p>I do a lot of the purchasing for a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) lab at a university.  Our newest and most powerful spectrometer is 850MHz, which a couple years ago, cost around 5 million dollars.  At the time, we also got 5 different probes (used for looking at different elements or solids vs liquids) with prices ranging from about $50,000 - $150,000.  These magnets must be kept very cold to function at their best, so they are filled with liquid helium and liquid nitrogen, which boil off fairly rapidly and must be topped up on a monthly and weekly basis, respectively.  These costs along with those for minor maintenance and upkeep cost about another $35,000 a year.  And this is only 1 of 10 spectrometers that we have on campus (though some of the smaller field spectrometers are much cheaper to maintain).  The maintenance of this facility requires 3 faculty all of which are getting paid PhD wages (probably $60-120k per year).</p>
<p>And this is only getting us started.  One of the worst costs are the nuclear isotopes required for preparing our samples.  A 1L bottle of D2O can go for over $1000.  We just bought 6 recently and I'm sure that won't last us more than a couple months.  We also commonly use 13C glucose and 15N ammonium chloride which also go over the $1000 mark for small bottles that that can only prepare a small number of samples.  And then there are hordes of other costs for lab consumables, reagents and student wages.  Shit is not cheap.  And a lot of common lab equipment is pretty old and worn down.  Since each instrument, even something as simple as a shaker or water bath, are incredibly expensive to purchase new we try to use the old ones as long as possible and end up having regular breakdowns which require additional money to fix.</p>
<p>TL;DW It's fairly common for most scientific labs to have yearly operating costs in the hundreds of thousands with equipment, that when purchased new, can cost millions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife did research at a university </p>
<p>Most professors have to bring in a certain amount of grant $$$$$</p>
<p>Of all that $$$$ the professor only gets to use less than a quarter of it</p>
<p>Most of it goes to the school </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Just started a masters program, saw the grant breakdown for my research and another friend of mine in the lab. I was shocked that over 75% of it wasn't even going towards the research/my professor. (and then a portion of that remaining 25% is my paycheck...Sort of makes sense as to why grad students get paid so poorly despite basically working a full time job.)  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parents still don't realize that getting my PhD is a full time school and work commitment. I was told by my father that I should get a part time job too. While some people have done that, the STEM research environment has become way too competitive to do that IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say that science is &quot;expensive&quot; as much as it is simply a long-term investment.  The government has no problems at all spending trillions on things that will go &quot;boom&quot; today, or might make a more efficient &quot;boom&quot; tomorrow.  But they'll not shift a penny of today's &quot;boom&quot; budget to fund next week's breathing air, because the elections are today.</p></div>		</li>
