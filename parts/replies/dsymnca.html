			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing about alcohol: it is a very potent neurotoxin and cancerogen, and can damage many things. For example, if alcohol is drunk warm for a long time, the combination can be throat and esophagus cancer (numbers are high in areas where sake is drunk hot, or hot slivovic). Stomach ulcers are quite common, too, because the alcohol removes the protective mucus layer (pro tip: no NSAIDS with alcohol. Major outch).
And what I have seen in the ER a twice so far, but I am unsure about the pathology of, is acute pancreatitis after a binge. Not a nice view, and painful: vomiting, diarrhea, pain, all hormones out of whack (pancreas is responsible for sugar metabolism), and active digestive enzymes in the blood stream and inside the pancreas. Jaundice, too. And the two I have seen were younger than 20. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Very potent neurotoxin&quot; needs qualification. Botulinum toxin is another neurotoxin, and even a microgram of that will kill you. A microgram of alcohol will be nowhere near noticeable, and people routinely ingest millions of times that much. A &quot;standard drink&quot; is 8 grams of ethanol.</p>
<p>Ethanol is really fairly benign, the only reason we see serious health effects is that many of us ingest bulk quantities of it repeatedly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's incredibly depressing. I was under the impression that alcohol issues take time to manifest...there shouldn't be acute symptoms for someone in that age group without essentially a crippling abuse dynamic, no? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! If your body couldn't metabolize alcohol, it would likely die the first time you consume any reasonable amount. I have a friend who is (likely) lacking alcohol dehydrogenase, and thus passed out from a few sips of wine during his church proceedings a number of years ago.</p>
<p>If you're looking for more of a neurochemical rather than metabolic selection pressure, I believe that is more along the lines of simple homeostasis and upregulation of opposing systems - see the gilded comment above for a fantastic analysis of this process.</p></div>		</li>
