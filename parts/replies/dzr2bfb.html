			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats true, i actually forget to mention, Organochlorines like lindane or DDT should only be detectable in traceable amounts and in some form of metabolites. Anyway, the treatments also worked for more modern organophosphanes, so the results can be applied for most pesticides. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Organochlorines are now pretty heavily used in developing countries so it’s kind of a global environmental health problem. </p>
<p>I can’t say for sure if it’s worse or less worse than all the superfund waste dump sites that leech into surface water in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are farm fields everywhere around some of my companies water wells.  We test these semi-annually for contaminants.  One in particular showed up in elevated ammounts Metolachlor.  Its a herbicide from the chloroacetanilide family.  Apparently the chemicals have slowly but surely started to show up in our ground water.  The state does not have a limit on this chemical so they said it is still safe to drink.  The safe drinking water site has a &quot;watch&quot; level for this chemical which we are still below, but its scary to think how we could slowly be contaminating our drinking water supplies.  Our wells draw from a level of about 75'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the alternative is letting millions of people die from malaria. In reality, we really don't know how dangerous or environmentally harmful compounds like DDT actually are. Silent spring started a hysteria in the mid twentieth century and now we think of it like some evil poison. </p>
<p>Studies have shown it persisting in the body and environment without decomposing but the actual long term health side effects are poorly documented. Of course, we know drinking the shit will kill you, but other than that it's hard to say. </p>
<p>In public health, everything is a cost/benefit analysis, and the known benefits of DDT significantly outweigh the known costs. The environmentally conscious narrative is in the right place, but many countries absolutely depend on these pesticides with their lives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the regulations of the country you‘re living. In every developed country the residue limits are extremely low and still residues in products are rarely higher. Farmer normally have quite a strict plan, how pesticides are allowed to be applied (eg couple of weeks before harvesting) so most of the stuff is depleted when sold. </p>
<p>There should be some information about it [here] (<a href="http://npic.orst.edu/reg/laws.html" target="_blank">http://npic.orst.edu/reg/laws.html</a>) for USA, for europe look up (EC) 396/2005. </p>
<p>Edit: I see, i didn‘t really answer your question. The dangers from these residues should be really low, the typical way how residue-limits are calculated is by determing the [LOAEL] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest-observed-adverse-effect_level" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest-observed-adverse-effect_level</a>) for a typical daily intake and divide this level by 100, as a safety factor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in the EU and thank you for this answer! I've always believed that the risks of pesticides are grossly overstated (<em>thanks</em>, organic marketing!). It's extremely frustrating when I try to reason with crazy people who lack basic understanding of chemistry and biology but are assured as hell that the modern world is &quot;killing them&quot;. Beyond doubt, there's a lot to be desired from our contemporary lifestyle but falling for advertisement stated as fact is absurd. Thanks again, u/hoppelfuss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Organophosphates are dangerous to anything that is alive but it is really the dose that makes the poison. The low doses that would occur from pesticide residues would make them pretty harmless unless they are bio-accumulators. </p>
<p>This is not true for farmers, the pesticides they are exposed to have been linked to cancers such as leukaemia and even diabetes and Parkinson’s disease. They are also likely linked to damaging male fertility. It should also be noted that many pesticides can have an effect upon fetal development. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They make some special fruit/veggie spray solutions for washing.  If you can find one that is citrus based or acidic as OP mentioned that would probably be better than other soaps.  Most soaps are basic (I think), but also they are for killing bacteria, not specifically for removing chemical residue (I'm sure they can do it too, but I don't know if they are as effective).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a related note, Dont wash your apples the minute you bring them home from the store, that thin waxy coating helps slow down the ripening process. If you wait to wash each apple just before you eat it, they last a lot longer.</p></div>		</li>
