			<div class="markdown"><p>We have actually already found these planets. </p>
<p>Gliese 667 C, which has an 0.84 rating on the ESI (Earth Similarity Index) is 23 light years away, much much shorter distance than other potentially habitable planets. This would be the type of planet that most telescpopes will be for in the future, as it is a prime example of close-to-Earth extrasolar planets that can be further researched or (eventually) potentially colonized by us. </p>
<p>Other examples are: </p>
<p>Gliece 832 C - 16.1 Light years, 0.81 ESI </p>
<p>Tau Ceti E - Unconfirmed, 11.9 light years, 0.78 ESI </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of interest, how similar <em>is</em> 0.84? Similar enough that we could inhabit? that we could inhabit with oxygen tanks? so different that we couldn't survive there except in some kind of home-made atmosphere/lab?</p></div>		</li>
