			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I've got all sorts of funny, scary, or gross stories as a result of renting for the past decade. </p>
<p>Oh! And to tack on to your original post, I remembered a comment that came from a native Louisianan: &quot;you could have an entire dinner party full of people in your home, and a gigantic palmetto bug crawls across the floor and no one bats an eye. But if a little one walks into the room, that's when people stop eating.&quot; </p>
<p>The thought there is that &quot;palmetto bugs&quot; (which, along with &quot;water bugs,&quot; is a nice name southerners call them to pretend in their head that they're not in fact cockroaches) are commonplace in the south where it's humid, warm, and the climate is agreeable. Cockroaches are like any other bug. They go where they please. But when you see little ones, that means they're breeding. Laying eggs. In your house. </p>
<p>That's put a lot into perspective for me when I see adult ones in the city. </p></div>		</li>

One fell off the ceiling and landed on my face while I was about to fall asleep, but the nightmare started when the thing found its way into my ear. I've never felt so violated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The saying is also probably about german cockroaches. Palmetto bugs  are generally easy to get rid of and aren't an issue. But the small fast german cockroaches breed like motherfuckers and once a place is infested with them they are difficult to get rid of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can sympathize. I used to live in a place that didn't have roaches but was overrun by <a href="http://imgur.com/H1BkhVO" target="_blank">house centipedes</a>. I thought roaches were fast, but these things were ridiculous. They can grow to be enormous and they love to climb the walls. I'd often wake in the morning and open my eyes to the sight of one of these huge bastards chilling on the wall. Or I'd be sitting around and catch a glimpse of one scurrying across the floor towards my legs.                 </p>
<p>It's been almost 10 years since I lived there, and I still have minor PTSD from those fuckers. To this day, if I catch what I think is a little bit of movement out of the corner of my eye, my heat skips a beat, expecting to turn and see centipedes running around. I'm not really all that squeamish about bugs, but those things look unearthly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Saw one clumsily crawling on my wall above my bed the other night after I turned out the lights.  I got up out of bed, grabbed a paper cup and a piece of paper and was able to trap this 3” beast in the cup and cover the end of the cup with the paper.  I emptied the cup into the toilet.  The smell that came out of the cup was so sickening and nasty.  It was the roach’s defensive odor, much like what a skunk would do when threatened.  Hopefully the smell warned off any of his friends.  I have not seen another one since.  </p></div>		</li>
