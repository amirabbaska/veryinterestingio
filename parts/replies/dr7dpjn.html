			<div class="markdown"><p>I got sucked into the unsafe to reheat rice discussion... But this is really the correct answer to the original question. </p>
<p>The ready to heat up (precooked) meals are essentially sterile. There is nothing there to grow until you open them. So they can sit out at room temperature until other chemical processes (like oxidation) reduce the quality to below acceptable levels or until the packaging is compromised.</p>
<p>If it's dry rice there is simply not enough water to support micro growth and anything that happens to be there will be killed when you cook it.  It can still spoil via oxidation or absorbing odors but that really is more of a sensory quality issue than a food safety issue.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>usually when i cook anything that has leftovers, i'll serve it, eat, then when i'm done eating it put everything in containers and put it in the fridge. sometimes i'll put it in containers immediately after i'm done putting it on my plate. then it goes right into the fridge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You dont need to do that for most things, it's an American obsession to put everything away. Wouldn't be surprised if it was some giant conspiracy by refrtigerator companies from the 50s to get people to buy bigger better fridges. I'm American, used to be this way. Married an indian, things only get put in the fridge if you're gonna eat it the next day. Some curries even taste better if they sit out for a long time. The human body isn't supposed to be so sheltered, you end up weakening your immune system, then any little plain jane bacteria ends up getting you sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key to getting sick is it has to be exposed to bacteria for it to be able to become an incubator.  If any food is left at room temperature and not exposed to harmful bacteria, it can be safely consumed.  The problem is, bacteria doesn't necessarily change the food in any noticeable way.  You have no idea if/when your going to get sick. There's no way of knowing if it's &quot;safe&quot; so it's best to be cautious instead of sick.  </p>
<p>Certain foods are more prone to being contaminated because of their path to the table.  Spinach isn't usually considered dangerous until it's downstream from a cattle operation where it's watered with e-coli contaminated water.  Ground beef is dangerous because the act of grinding can introduce bacteria from the outside to the inside.  That's why it needs to be fully cooked but a steak can be rare. </p></div>		</li>
