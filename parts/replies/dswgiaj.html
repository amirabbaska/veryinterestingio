			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the sutures themselves made of? I'm guessing they're of the kind that get absorbed by the body, but I'm curious what material has this attribute while still durable enough to reliably keep it closed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Valves aren’t really an issue in the large, short veins we use in liver and kidney transplant. When cirrhosis gets bad you sometimes actually see reversal of flow in the portal vein. Similar situation with the outflow (hepatic veins)</p>
<p>Couple other things to clarify:</p>
<ol>
<li>The cava is actually a low pressure vessel. During Transplant the pressure in the cava is usually only 5-10 mm Mercury. It is the biggest blood vessel in the body and very high flow. It’s also very thin walled compared to any artery. Bleeding can happen. Air embolus can happen, particularly during laparoscopic liver surgery where the abdominal cavity is insuflated  with CO2. </li>
</ol>
<p>CO2 is highly dissolvable in the blood so rarely causes embolisms (but I’ve seen it). Nitrogen (atmosphere) is not dissolvable. Air embolism is rare during a Transplant but probably not unheard of. </p>
<ol>
<li>The size of the suture we use depends on which vessel we are sewing. Most surgeons use polypropylene suture for vascular anastomoses. Suture size is classified in the “0” system. A surgeon will use 0 suture or 2-0, 3-0, etc. the more “0”s the finer the suture. A surgeon will ask for “three oh prolene”</li>
</ol>
<p>We sew cava with 3-0 or 4-0. Portal vein I use 6-0. Hepatic artery we use 7-0. Some unusual reconstructions or pediatric cases might call for 8-0. I think 6-0 is about as fine as my hair. I wear special loupes to see well. Not all surgeons do. </p>
<ol>
<li>We use special instruments to hold the needles to through the stitches. Some are called needle drivers, some are call castroviejos or “Castro’s”</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He might be talking about the portal vein, where the natural flow of blood is from the gastro-intestinal tract to the liver (it works this way so that both nutrients and toxins we eat and drink are first processed in the liver). The portal vein and veins that pump their blood into it have no valves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those valves are only in the deep veins of the legs. </p>
<p>So hypothetically if you cut open a leg vein below the valve, you probably won't have a ton of blood backflowing from the abdomen, but you'll still have forward flow from below the incision. </p>
<p>However preventing blood loss during a surgery is one of the most important things surgeons do, so place where they can feasibly prevent it, they will, and preventing venous blood loss is very very easy, you just clamp above and below the incision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a nurse that does intra-op CRRT for livers, watching the transplant really helped me understand. My surgeon had me stand on a stool so he could point out all the vessels and highlight the areas that usually cause issues post-op. Super cool doc, really appreciate him for being so willing to teach. </p></div>		</li>
