I can do pretty much anything with my eyes, I can focus wherever I want whether there's something there to focus on or not, and I can move my eyes independently of each other (keep one eye stationary while the other moves), but I can't do smooth pursuit over stationary objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even stationary objects, your brain is telling you to focus on the object and follow it, thus the circuit that is activated will be the &quot;smooth pursuit&quot; circuit. Just a extra bit of information, whenever you want to move any muscle in your body, your brain has to reconstruct it into 100 ms intervals. Your cerebellum (the very back part of your brain) stitches the information of where you are in the body, to where you want to go, and allows for a smooth motion to occur. This is true of even the extra-ocular muscles (those muscles in your eyes). And so, even when you're fixated on an object, your brain is constantly, every 100 ms thinking where is the object going to go, and making necessary adjustments based on that. So yes, people technically do perform smooth pursuit on stationary objects.</p></div>		</li>
