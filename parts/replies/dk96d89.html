			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same thing, but it's pretty mild. I only wear my glasses for heavy reading, and most people I know don't even know I have them. I see double when I'm exhausted or drinking, and the only real symptom is that I'm a slow reader, which is less of an issue in the age of audio books.</p></div>		</li>
