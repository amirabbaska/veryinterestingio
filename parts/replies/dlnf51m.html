<p>Oh I know. I wasn't trying to imply one was more correct than the other. </p>
<p>I'm just curious how the two different branches ended up with this difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm bilingual in BRE and German.</p>
<p>In my experience there is a distinct difference between &quot;<em>I'm in prison</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>I'm in</em> <strong>the</strong> <em>prison</em>&quot; and other such examples such as university, school, and hospital. I'm honestly surprised that no-one here has mentioned this.</p>
<p>When the &quot;the&quot; is omitted it signifies that you are in the state of being there (attending), while if the &quot;the&quot; is not omitted it simply signifies the location or group.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm in university/college/school = I'm a university/college/school student</p>
<p>I'm in hospital = I'm hospitalised</p>
<p>I'm in prison = I'm an inmate</p>
<p>I'm in class = I'm currently attending a lesson</p>
</blockquote>
<p>VS</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm in the university/college/school = I'm inside the university (building or complex)</p>
<p>I'm in the hospital = I'm inside the hospital (building or complex)</p>
<p>I'm in the prison = I'm inside the prison (building or complex, but not necessarily as a prisoner)</p>
<p>I'm in the class = I'm currently part of the class (group)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is akin to &quot;<em>I'm in education</em>&quot; meaning &quot;<em>I work in something that has to do with education</em>&quot;, but you can't say &quot;<em>I'm in the education</em>&quot;. Or, to take your example:</p>
<p>&quot;<em>I'm in groceries</em>&quot; meaning &quot;<em>I work with grocery products</em>&quot;, though I'm not sure anyone would ever say it that way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That quote made me smile. In &quot;lower class&quot; German it is rather common for people to say &quot;I was ALDI&quot; when they mean to say &quot;I was at ALDI&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not exactly true. The English spoken by British people 300 years ago is very different to the English spoken by modern day British people.</p>
<p>Both British and US English have significantly diverged since then. There are certain things which US English has retained which British English hasn't.</p>
<p>So as you say, both are correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly looking at the Google ngram viewer for &quot;in hospital&quot; and &quot;in the hospital&quot; for British English has &quot;in the hospital&quot; leading in usage until about 1900. Then &quot;in hospital&quot; begins to dominate. In American English &quot;in the hospital&quot; just dominates the whole time. Of course I don't think Google's corpus is perfect and I don't think they have a huge amount of pre-1900 books included plus context is of course removed.</p>
