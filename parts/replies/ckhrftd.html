			<div class="markdown"><p>IRC there's heart disease risk that kicks in from about 5 cups upwards, but there's no strong evidence that a single cup per day is harmful, indeed there's evidence that it may reduce the incidence of alzheimers and diabetes.</p>
<p>But it does remind me of the joke: &quot;Coffee is a slow poison.&quot; &quot;It must be, I've been drinking it for decades and I'm still not dead.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>In general terms though, this is a drug used daily worldwide by a significant percentage of the population for several centuries - if it was harmful over long periods, we would know by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The consumption of coffee has increased at the same time that many other things did.  Disentangling them is hard,  and without long term careful randomized studies,  it's hard to know if there are subtle or longer term effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its comparable to red wine in that for most people 1 or 2 cups a day is actually good for you.  people seem to think coffee is somehow dangerous yet they'll guzzle sodas and iced teas every day and not realize theres caffeine in there too</p></div>		</li>
