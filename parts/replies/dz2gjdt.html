			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ll reword the question to make it a bit more specific to what I think op was asking.</p>
<p>You’ve got one grid coordinate. You plot a second grid coordinate. You use a protractor to measure the azimuth between the two. You use your iPhone to shoot that azimuth (let’s say 296 degrees) and you also use a lensatic compass of decent quality to shoot a 296 degree azimuth. Will they both be pointing in the same direction?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a tangent, the phone compass is likely a 3 axis magnetometer, and can sense North in any orientation. A normal compass must be held level. Both are susceptible to external fields, and an electrical sensor is additionally susceptible to noise from within the phone.</p>
<p>Also, it is possible to recalibrate a phone sensor, you may have seen google maps suggesting you wave your device in a figure 8. This rotates the device around all three axes, and recalibrates the magnetometer compass. You can't do this with a simple compass, which can gain errors from shocks or applying strong magnetic fields to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correction, the sensor in a smartphone is a 3-axis device. It measures the magnetic field in three directions. Download an app like Sensor Kinetics to see the output of the sensor in X, Y, Z format.</p>
<p>Interesting note: The earth's magnetic field isn't level with the ground in most places. It's direction is a 3-dimensional thing, pointing up or down as well. The downward part is galled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_dip" target="_blank">magnetic inclination</a> or magnetic dip. The traditional compass ignores this third, up and down direction. The compass app ignores it as well to mimic a traditional compass.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Some games that use the position of the phone as a controller use the magnetometer data (along with accelerometer and gravity data) to understand the phone's position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People already addressed for small currents, but for the metal in a phone, the compass can be calibrated to compensate for the hard iron offset. That's why a phone might prompt you to move it in figure-eight patterns.</p>
<p>It basically just calculates a vector to put the circle (or sphere for 3-axis) back on the relative origin so the max and min x-values line up with the x axis, and similarly for y, z.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only the magnetometer will be effected. The Gyro and Accelerometer won't be as one is affected by rotational speed and gravity, respectively.
Of course they are effected by things like electrical fields temperature and the likes but can compensate to some degree, nothing is perfect but they all compliment each other to get an accurate enough reading to do their job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dumb question in case anyone can answer it, how does one figure out if a phone actually has this , and things like a proper accelerometer? I've had so many phones that claim to but then like it doesn't work in apps (rip my dreams of using a fancy star map app) and then when you try check the specs online a bunch of them are actually really vague. Is this just a case of bad luck with not finding solid info on phones I've happened to have, or is there some big conspiracy to fudge the info to make cheap phones sound more kitted out than they actually are for the sake of sales?</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://joyofandroid.com/android-secret-codes-hidden-menu-dialler-codes/" target="_blank">http://joyofandroid.com/android-secret-codes-hidden-menu-dialler-codes/</a></p>
<p>For instance, I use *#0*# (called General Test Mode) when I need to access raw sensor data and recalibrate the compass.</p>
<p>So you type that code into your phone like a phone number, a menu pops up, you click &quot;Sensor&quot;, and you'll see sensor data listed. </p>
<p>Magnetic sensor is the compass, you'll see a black circle with a radius line in it. If it says 0, 1, or 2, than the compass needs to be calibrated. To calibrate, just rotate the phone in a bunch of weird ways, the phone will buzz and the screen will turn green. Then the line in the circle will be blue with a 3. That's calibrated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What you're looking for is a gyroscope (gyro for short). Some apps use software to simlate a gyro using the accelerometer, but that doesn't always work very well.</p>
<p>Original Moto G had no gyro, using Sky map sucked, no Google cardboard either. Moto G 4G (mostly same thing, but with 4G capability and gyro): worked great!</p>
<p>Wikipedia and phonearena are usually pretty correct, always double check the specs before buying!</p></div>		</li>

A magnetometer measures earths magnetic field (compass).
Accelerometers measure movement (and gravity, therefore orientation)</p></div>		</li>
