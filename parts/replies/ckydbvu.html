<p>Of course the ironing is easy for us because the solvent creates far fewer wrinkles than soap and water would, and we use huge expensive specialized presses that make getting out the wrinkles fast and easy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what happens if I ask for pressing only? Like you said, I really just want to outsource the ironing part of the process and I actually prefer to wash my dress shirts at home in the normal laundry. But when I have asked for this I suspect that the cleaner just dry cleaned my shirts anyway rather than put them through a separate process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do press only on dry clean items, but you only save a dollar per piece. Because eliminating the dry clean step is a fairly minor part of it. We don't offer &quot;press only&quot; on men's dress shirts because the machines that press then need for the shirts to be still wet from washing. So we have to wash the men's dress shirts anyways even if you already did. Also, the starching of men's dress shirts is added during the washing. Starch makes the shirts look crisper. </p>
<p>And you are right that often the &quot;press only&quot; goes through the same dry clean process. The exception would be an evening gown or judges robe or any other &quot;precious&quot; garment that you want to take no chance at harming. Ladies dresses and sweaters are not even pressed they go on a special form machine that steams them gently and blows air through to remove wrinkles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your cleaners sounds a lot like my family's. Weve been in business for almost 15 years, ive been there since I was 13. everything you explain and the way you describe your business sounds almost exactly like ours. I commend you for taking the time to educate people. Just out of curiousity, how many shirts do you press in an hour not including touch ups? We have a standard collar/cuff machine with just a single feed presser. My best is 88 shirts in an hour and usually between 78-85. Im kinda proud of that because I dont think weve ever had anyone press more than a shirt a minute. Also I manage to match most of the shirts while I press and touchups are minimal. Overall ive cut almost 2 hours off our work day and weve become much more efficient. My family is all korean and its all family owned/operated so I get 0 recognition for any of it. Idc though, im proud of myself for it even if my family doesnt appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do my starched shirts always look great at first, but horribly wrinkled soon after putting them on? It is like they become ultra sensitive. I have since stopped asking for it because it seems to do the opposite of what I'm hoping for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was that particularly with cheaper fused suits and some dresses, there's much more wear and tear on the support material from the cleaning process than from the pressing alone - and that usually, trousers and jackets aren't dirty, just wrinkled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most drycleaners actually launder your shirts unless you ask them to dryclean them.  Basically, you're trusting them to do the most cost effective thing for your clothes.  Though, if you have a dryclean only shirt, it might be a good idea to point it out.  </p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>To get petroleum-type stains (like motor oil, or grease) out, am I better off taking the item directly to the dry cleaner or is there any value in trying something like dish soap and water, Shout, or Resolve? What about automotive brake cleaner?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If with petroleum-type stains, I first try one of those home methods, am I &quot;setting&quot; the stain, making it less able to come out via dry cleaning?</p>
</li>
<li>What is the best way to get rid of ring-around-the-collar? Wash at home with an oxidizing detergent? Use dish soap or something else designed to get rid of grease? Dry clean? Pre-treat the shirt with something like Scotchgard around the collar and cuffs?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing you put on a stain is going to make my job any easier. The best thing you can do is bring it in as soon as you can. The longer it sits the less likely it is to come out completely. We use Shout on ring around the collar with good results. But I have a friend who uses Simple Green at his cleaners. There are also many other spray on's that work better than nothing. Even a little liquid detergent rubbed in will help. On the really tough ones we dry clean the shirt before we wash it. That usually knocks out as much of the ring around the collar as is possible with any method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great questions.  I've been experimenting with a splash of concentrated industrial degreaser on greasy items like this.  But so far I haven't found it any more effective than a scoop of regular laundry detergent.</p>
<p>Both get the oil out, but leave behind the burned smell of dirty motor oil.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But in reality the clothes get plenty &quot;wet&quot;, just not with water. There are many solvents that we use now other than the old traditional tetrachlorethylene. They are all safer and less toxic. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you elaborate on how the solvents get out of the 'wet' clothes? </p>
<p>Can they just evaporate like water (and unlike most tensides) would? Do you 'catch' and recycle the solvents that are still in the 'wet' clothes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The clothes are dried in special machines that recapture the solvents by condensation so we can reuse it. Some modern dry cleaning machines have this drying and reclaimation step built into the same machine that does the cleaning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is for the drained solvent. This is asking about the solvent left in the clothes.</p>
<p>Presumably it would be filtered and reused too, but it has to be collected first.</p></div>		</li>
