			<p>Both of these statements are wrong. First off, all of the energy in the universe would still not be enough to accelerate something to the speed of light since no matter how much energy was put into the system, more of that energy would be converted to mass the closer and closer you got to the speed of light. <br><br>Secondly, time would not run backwards at the speed of light. Relative time slows the closer and closer you get to luminal speeds but even at the speed of light it wouldn't run backwards. There is some conjecture on reverse time travel at supra-luminal speeds, you can read about it here <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2015/08/can-you-really-go-back-in-time-by-breaking-the-speed-of-light/" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/blogs/physics/2015/08/can-you-really-go-back-in-time-by-breaking-the-speed-of-light/</a>, but this is all conjecture and completely impossible with anything made of mass.</p>		</li>

			<p><a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/space-and-time-warps.html" target="_blank">I beg to differ, citing Stephen Hawking.</a>There was a young lady of Wight,<br>Who traveled much faster than light,<br>She departed one day,<br>In a relative way,<br>And arrived on the previous night. <br><br>So all we need for time travel, is a space ship that will go faster than light. Unfortunately, in the same paper, Einstein showed that the rocket power needed to accelerate a space ship, got greater and greater, the nearer it got to the speed of light. So it would take an infinite amount of power, to accelerate past the speed of light. </p>		</li>
