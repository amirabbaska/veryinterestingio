			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly this,  power plant operator here,  what really helped me get it was visualizing magnetic field strength rotating from full pull, to kinda pull kinda push, to full push,  and back round again. </p>
<p>Advanced mental model visualisation exercise:  3 phase electro-magnetic rotation 120° out from each other.   Here in freedom land tm, each at 60 revolutions a second!  What you end up getting are  powerlines very quickly vibrating electrons carrying huge amounts of rotational electro-magnetic potential. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, may I just point out that the actual electron speed is greatly less than 0.1 cm/s.
I meant to calculate it myself but instead I found a wikipedia article &quot;drift velocity&quot; where they calculate it for us: for a copper wire 2 mm in diameter, a current of one amp corresponds to average electron speed of 23 µm/s or 8.28 cm per hour.</p>
<p>It just shows how much charge there is in relatively few electrons...</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I may be misunderstanding you, but it still sounds like you are conflating electron movement and charge movement.</p>
<p>The 1am amp of power is not being carried by the electrons. Its being transferred as an electromagnetic wave through the wire. The .1cm/s electron drift (using your number) is a result of the wave as well, it's not producing the charge transfer. The electrons are being <em>induced</em> to flow by the electrical flow, basically a side effect (like the heat also produced in the wire).</p>
<p>We know quite preciesly how much charge an electron carries: 1.6e-19 coulombs. 1 A is 1 coulomb/sec, so if electrons were doing the charge carrying then to get 1 amp you'd 16000000000000000000 free electrons to come out out that wire a second. Thats almost the total free electrons in a cubic meter of copper, well beyond the cross-sectional density in a wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm but then, what if you were just firing electrons (with an electron gun)? At 1amp, how many electrons are coming out every second?</p>
<p>Edit: I just looked it up, and you are incorrect. 1 m3 of copper contains ~10^29 free electrons. Using some quick maths (so it might be off by a factor of 10 or so), in a 2mm copper wire, 1 coulomb is the equivalent of 30um of copper, which is very close to the original 23um/s (that answer is probably more accurate than mine). Not exactly sure what you thought was producing the charge transfer, or where that charge was coming from/going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just look at an empty bottle, bobbing on the waves. The waves come in repeatedly, at much faster speeds, than the bottle. But the bottle will, time and tide allowing, eventually reach the beach. </p>
<p>The waves are the electric field, and the bottle is an electron, in this analogy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although /u/IAmNotANumber37 was wrong about the number of electrons in copper, they are correct saying that most people would consider 10^19 electrons to be quite a large number</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but only in a component that requires a magnetic field to operate. </p>
<p>There are also things like heaters (coil heaters rely on resistance), light emitters (LED lights rely on the change/dissipation of electron energy), chemical (think charging a battery), transistors etc</p></div>		</li>
