			<div class="markdown"><p>Just in correction, the cause of Down Syndrome is the inheritance of 3 copies of chromosome 21 instead of two. It’s an error during formation of reproductive cells. The genetics are pretty well characterized. If you mean in terms of predicting whether two individuals will conceive a Down Syndrome child then yeah, we’re pretty much stumped</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Advanced maternal age is the only &quot;risk factor&quot; we can identify. This has no real impact on the incidence at large though because younger women have so many more babies than older women that it swamps the statistics. So even if older women are more likely to have children in the West (and I don't think that's true), it is still almost certainly the social factors already mentioned. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older women most definitely do have more kids in the west. Or, the average age of a woman giving birth is higher in the west than developing countries, as many women don't have kids until their late 20s/early 30s, or even into their 40s, whereas in most developing countries there is a greater proportion of women having children in their teens and early 20s. There's also the fact that it's harder to get pregnant at an older age, and modern reproductive medicine can help. But only if you have access to it, which people don't in developing countries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also an education/modern lifestyle thing. We only end up in a stable career or finishing studies at a more advanced age, so generally begin to choose to have children once we’re financially stable, have travelled a bit, etc. Modern medicine and access to it give us that freedom of choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many women continue to get pregnant naturally in their late thirties and into their forties. Women in the West definitely have a higher age at the birth of their first child, but this doesnt mean women who had a first child at 18 cant also have a child at 40, and the effects of Down Syndrome rates are very noticeable by mid 30s.</p>
<p>In any event, younger women still account for the overwhelming number of births in every country. So this can't account for a noticeable difference in numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The average of a mother at first birth is 30 now in most western nations.  In India it's 20. </p>
<p>Here's the frequency of downs vs maternal age:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ds-health.com/risk.htm" target="_blank">http://www.ds-health.com/risk.htm</a></p>
<p>At 20, it's 1/1400 (.07%)</p>
<p>At 30, it's 1/900 (0.11%)</p>
<p>So yes, maternal age is enough to account for at least a 60% increase in downs. Likely more, because the rate increase is not a linear function with age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First birth is irrelevant. What about 10th or 13th birth? The question is how many children are born to women in their 30s and older, not how old that woman in her 30s was when she had her first child. Considering that birth rates are higher in the developing world there should be MORE cases of Down Sybdrome, at birth at least, especially when considering the wider availability of abortion in the West. Your 60% increase number assumes that there are equal numbers of births at all ages, when there are not. .07 % of births to 20 year olds in Africa is a larger total number than .11% of births to 30 year olds in Europe. Obviously mortality rates are much higher in the developing world, but in terms if births, higher maternal age in the West is not the major factor creating this difference.</p></div>		</li>
