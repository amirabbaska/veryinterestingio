<p>Do you know that is you see a nasty threat (mad tiger jumps from around  the corner), your body's fight or flight response will be trigger before  &quot;you&quot; even realize/coprehwnd what you're seeing. </p>

<p>This is interesting. Do you have any links or studies where I can read more about this?</p>
<p>I remember a while back reading about decisions for arm movement supposedly occurring before you even thought about moving it. The body prepares itself for action before it even enters into conscious thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you pick up something hot, you have a reflex arc that causes you to open your hand that doesn't even use your brain. The sensory information travels into your spinal cord via a nerve then triggers a motor neurone to open your hand. Not going to the brain saves precious milliseconds in which you could have been burnt. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Involuntary reflexes that require instant activation will usually bypass conscious decision making.</p></div>		</li>
