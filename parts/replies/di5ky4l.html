			<div class="markdown"><p>A wavevector basically tells us where in space you will have peaks and throughs of your wave, and what the distance between peaks is (wavelength). This value might be different for each direction in space, so your wavevector needs to have more than one dimension.<br />
Wavevector space is just a vector space where each wavevector occupies exactly one point. Imagine a ball, if you want to describe where in space your ball is you need the coordinates of that ball. Now if you have a wave all you need to describe this wave is the wavevector, which has one unique position in the wavevector space. If you have several waves with different wavevectors you can see all their different positions in wavevector space. </p></div>		</li>
