<p>Ought it not to be the responsibility of our judicial system to get as close to the truth as possible - moreso than treating justice like an adversarial game of legal chess between counsels?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are describing the debate between prosecutorial and inquisitorial judicial systems. The US and generally common law systems tend to be prosecutorial and, as you say, emphasize the skill of the counsel over the notion of getting as close to the truth as possible. Continental (EU for instance) systems usually go the other way around; the judge has much more say in the process, there is no jury in the meaning that itâ€™s given to it in the US, and the skill of the counsel matters less. </p>
<p>N.B. The notion that a prosecutorial system is actually the better way to get as close to the truth as possible, although by indirect means, is reasonable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And the main argument for this system, as I understand it, is the fact that the vast majority of cases in the US, under an adversarial system, never go to trial because an under-privileged person may not be able to retain a counsel with the time and experience and resources to go up against a more wealthy opponent. So they settle out of court. Even if they're in the right. Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So jurors with no legal experience are somehow likely to do better than trained lawyers?</p>

<p>That is exactly how you get the best outcomes in the context of justice, along with a jury and judge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The jurors wouldn't be competing with the lawyers. They would be complimenting their efforts. The idea is that if a lawyer for whatever reason doesn't ask a pertinent question that might impact the case (because of incompetence, corruption, case load, what have you) someone else can.</p>
<p>Again that means that whether or not you are found guilty of a crime doesn't just come down to the skill of the representation you can afford. I don't know how you reach the conclusion that this is the best way to reach just outcomes, or approximate the truth...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If by &quot;justice&quot; you mean &quot;the better chess player wins&quot; then yeah, I imagine it does.</p>
<p>What if you have some perverse idea of justice where you think it should depend on whether or not you did the thing you're accused of?</p>
<p>Edit: This was really directed at the notion of &quot;an adversarial game of legal chess between counsels&quot; being a good thing rather than at the actual state of the system, but I do appreciate all the informative and interesting insights into the American legal system </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The disparity between trained lawyers and juries of average citizens is kind of the point here: what if jurors need something clarified because the way it was explained was too complex? Also, both prosecution and defense offer extremely biased points of view. There is definitely the occasional need to reconcile the two with clarifying questions. </p></div>		</li>
