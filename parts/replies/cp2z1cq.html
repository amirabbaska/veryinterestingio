			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate slightly: This is essentially because the sense of touch is far &quot;blurrier&quot; than vision. So if you have lettering that is printed vs. embossed (at the same physical size), and you look at it vs. feel it, what you feel would essentially be like the thing you saw + a blurring filter applied.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pc.rhul.ac.uk/staff/J.Zanker/PS1061/L7/braille2.jpg" target="_blank">This image</a> is a good demonstration of what I'm trying to say. Braille in the top half, Roman letters in the bottom half, with an equal blurring filter applied to both. So the blurred version is essentially a visual metaphor for what you'd feel if each of the sets of letters were embossed and you ran your fingers over them.</p>
<p>Hopefully it's obvious from the diagram that if the representation is sharp, like in vision, the Roman letters are easier to distinguish from each other... but if it's blurry, like in touch, then the Braille characters are easier to distinguish. They're probably still not as easily distinguished as printed Roman letters are to the sighted, but it's way better than embossed Roman letters, which would basically all feel like spherical bumps unless you printed them really huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other commenters who replied already made some good points, but just to add on to theirs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I took a quick look at the actual scientific article they linked. It's not in a super-great journal and there are some aspects of it that are kind of funky (i.e., they don't seem to have as many statistical tests to back up their claims as you would normally expect), but for the moment let's ignore those issues and assume their claims are valid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the other commenters pointed out, there is a big difference between being able to detect something at all, versus being able to recover useful information from it. In that paper, the people could tell the difference between a totally smooth surface and a surface with very tiny ridges on it -- but that was basically from feeling a difference in friction when sliding their fingers across it. Which is very different from actually being able to feel the individual ridges -- and you'd have to make the ridges much, much bigger if you wanted them to be able to do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's also the issue of reliability. In that paper, it was a little hard to tell what the threshold was to determine if people could really tell the difference between the types of materials due to the way they described their methods (or maybe I just didn't read close enough), but usually with these sorts of things, you calculate what's known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-noticeable_difference" target="_blank">just-noticeable difference</a>, which is the smallest you can make the difference between two things before people's performance is no different from random guessing. But that doesn't mean that if you're above the just-noticeable difference, people are always able to sense the thing -- it just means that maybe they guess correctly 51% of the time as opposed to a chance level of 50%. (Usually, as Wikipedia notes, you use something a bit higher, like 75% correct, as your threshold.) This is useful for testing sensory abilities in scientific studies, but obviously not great for things like Braille -- you don't want to have your bumps at a size that people can only detect 75% of the time! So for any real-life application, you'd usually make your signal way, way bigger than the just-noticeable size.</p>
</li>
<li>To put both of those points into a visual metaphor: It is theoretically possible for just a <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/see_a_photon.html" target="_blank">handful of photons</a> to produce enough of a response in the eye that subjects are able to report seeing the light about 60% of the time. But obviously you'd never design an LCD screen that only emits a few photons -- you'd want many, many photons so that people are able to see the light emitting from the screen 100% of the time, without any doubt. And of course you don't want them to just detect a flash of light -- you want them to recognize patterns that correspond to letters or whatnot. So that requires still more photons!</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlikely -- I'm closer to the professor side than the student side! But it's common-ish to use that image for this topic -- I used to teach a series of sensation/perception lectures and I either used that one, or a very similar one. (I forget which, and I didn't have my old slides handy, so I just Googled around until I found one that looked similar to what I remembered teaching.)</p></div>		</li>
