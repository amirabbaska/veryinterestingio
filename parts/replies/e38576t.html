<p>Of note on smaller boats (think recreational fishing boats) at slow speeds we do use a prop on the front. With a trolling motor the thrust is directional. And some tugboats have been designed with directional thrust in places other than the aft end. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct! That improves some maneuverability but gives up speed, and the hull on those boats are shallower to accommodate that! Trolling motors are sweet. A friend of mine has one on his fishing boat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reversing thing is also true in small boat maneuvering. When I'm backing my sailboat out of her slip, the best way to do so it's too pulse the engine up pretty high to get myself up to about 1.5kt in reverse so that my rudder actually has steerage. Going forward, I have good steerage down to about half a knot due to the stream flowing over the rudder.</p></div>		</li>
