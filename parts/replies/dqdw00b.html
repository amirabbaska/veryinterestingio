			<div class="markdown"><p>i know using exponents is faster and better, but multiplying 'manually' gives you the opportunity to see how fast the numbers grow, it's only a few minutes and it's a nice little experiment to conduct </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_and_chessboard_problem" target="_blank">wheat and chessboard problem</a> and the <a href="http://mathforum.org/sanders/geometry/GP11Fable.html" target="_blank">legend of the ruler of India</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story goes that the ruler or India was so pleased with one of his palace wise men, who had invented the game of chess, that he offered this wise man a reward of his own choosing.</p>
<p>The wise man, who was also a wise mathematician, told his Master that he would like just one grain of rice on the first square of the chess board, double that number of grains of rice on the second square, and so on: double the number of grains of rice on each of the next 62 squares on the chess board.</p>
<p>This seemed to the ruler to be a modest request, so he called for his servants to bring the rice. How surprised he was to find that the rice quickly covered the chess board, then filled the palace! Let's stop here, and see just how many grains of rice this is.</p>
<p>The number of grains of rice on the last square can be written as &quot;2 to the 63th power&quot;, which looks like this:</p>
<p>2^63</p>

<li>
<p>Paper is composed primarily of cellulose, with other components being dismissed as insignificant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cellulose has a molar mass of 162.14g/mol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mass of a sheet of paper is 4.5g</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One sheet of paper is 0.02775mol</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Avagadro's Constant: .02775mol * 6.022x10^23 mol^-1 , there are 1.07x10^22 cellulose molecules in a sheet of paper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given 21 atoms in a cellulose molecule, there are 2.247x10^23 atoms in a sheet of paper</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the width of an atom is approximately 2.2x10^-8 cm, 2.247x10^23 atoms in a row breaks down into 4,943,400,000,000,000cm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This breaks down into 49,434,000,000km</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The width of the observable universe (assuming a diameter of 27.4 billion light years) is (approximately) 260,000,000,000,000,000,000,000km.</p>
</li>
<li>It would take the combined atoms of roughly 5,250,000,000,000 to stretch across the observable universe.</li>
