			<div class="markdown"><p>In the late 1800's, Tesla used his coil as a means of promoting himself, much like a magician. He was amazed by electricity and wanted to share what he'd learned with the world. The tuned circuits he created are in practical use all around us everyday for they are the basis of radio. As far as a practical use for a coil like you see in the video, outside of making an awesome spectacle, they really serve no other purpose than education, novelty and amusement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Built two coils before myself. Short answer: absolutely no use for them.</p>
<p>Long answer, it was basically a tech demo Tesla made to show off Alternating Current systems. He wanted to use the technology to create a system where electricity could be wirelessly transferred between two locations. While it could work, it never caught on because it was to costly an easily exploited. In the modern day, they do not have much use anymore. They are still sometimes used in old radio receivers. They can also be used to change voltage, but modern day transformers are able to do it much better. They also don't see much use today because they create an electromagnetic field that can damage electronics and can work as a powerful signal jammer if not set up properly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inductance doesn't really encompass all that a Tesla coil is. Tesla coils are tuned circuits which achieve resonance. Inductance is just one of the factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I beg to disagree. Car ignition coils use what is essentially a tesla coil like method to generate sparks. The ignition coil primary is always energized, with a static magnetic field. When a spark is needed, the power to the primary is abruptly switched off. The magnetic field collapses and generates a high voltage in the secondary, and the secondary rings at it's only natural frequency like the secondary of a tesla coil until it dissipates all the energy into the spark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have found some practical use for my Tesla coils, in different ways. These are solid state high frequency circuits though, and not these big cap pulses to create mini lightning. While power can be transmitted using them, it's less practical than the resonant coupled chargers these days things like phones are using. </p>
<p>I have some small coils that I run from cheap USB power banks and from time to time I use the plasma coming out of them as lighters lol. Also, throwing a small fluorescent on there turns it into a pretty decent light in a power outage.<br />
I have a larger tower than runs from a small 12v 1.3 Ah battery that can put out a lot more light from a tube for a good duration and I've used the plasma before to burn writing into wood, it can become a plasma ball on demand with use of an incandescent bulb, and I've even used it to light large strings of xmas leds as opposed to using the outlet.  </p>
<p>While it was indeed at some point conceived to transfer large amounts of energy, I don't think the FCC would like people doing that. While Tesla certainly flirted with the idea of 'free' energy from the wheel work of nature or the 'ether', his early tower demonstrations simply involved wireless distribution. He still had to use a massive amount of generators running fossil fuel to produce the input energy. </p>
<p>While it may be possible we can see a variation of his wireless distribution ideas in the future (beyond radio), as far as electromagnetic radiation is concerned it will probably lean more toward magnetic than electric. That is to say, while there really isn't any danger being around a live Tesla coil, it may not play well with other waves in the area.</p></div>		</li>
