			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean solar panels require a tiny current to essentially jumpstart the process? Or if enough electrons are excited will it sort of spontaneously do it itself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are electrons available in a solar cell even without a current. Remember that a current is a net flow of electrons. IF there is no current flowing, the electrons are still there, there's just no net flow, usually because the flows in all directions cancel out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electric fields are &quot;built in&quot; to the panel via doping. You can add small amounts of elements that have different numbers of valent electrons than the base element to make an intrinsic field.</p>
<p>For example, Si has 4 valence electrons. If you add in an element that has 3, you essentially created a positive charge next to that specific atom since it has one less electron (i.e. you just made a hole). You can add in elements that have 5 atoms, which creates an effective negative charge. If you do this in the right amounts and in the right positions you create a region of positive charge and a region of negative charge with some electric field between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was misleading. The solar cell has a &quot;built-in&quot; voltage that results from joining p-doped (excess holes) and n-doped (excess electrons) semiconductors together.

			<div class="markdown"><p>There aren't necessarily free ions that float around. You're freeing up individual electrons from the atoms, not the atoms themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Help me understand this a bit more. I can't understand how a solar panel can permanently provide power over a long period. Once all the atoms are excited by photons and all electrons are on the move and the ions have nade their way to the electrodes,  how does the system refresh itself and begin the cycle again? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't fully correct. Solar cells do not require external voltage to function. The electric field that separates charge is intrinsic to the material. </p></div>		</li>
