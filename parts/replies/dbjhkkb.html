<p><strong>Logic and Math:</strong></p>
<p>Why did we even build computers?</p>
<p>Computers essentially do two things: mathematics and logic. The kind of math and logic they do is based on some fairly high level theory that came from a crisis in mathematics in the late 19th and early 20th century.</p>
<p>In math and logic, absolute certainty is the most important thing. Every time you add 1 and 1, you end up with 2. There are no exceptions. If 1 and 1 don't always add up to 2, then you can't rely on mathematics to build bridges, launch space ships, or build computers.</p>
<p>As the 20th century was approaching, mathematicians were struggling with some new ideas that seemed to show that mathematics might not give us the absolute certainty we thought it did. More and more unsolvable math problems were appearing, and this became a huge worry for people in mathematics or anyone who heavily depended on math.</p>
<p>In the early 20th century, Bertrand Russel and Alfred North Whitehead came up with a method to prove that absolute certainty could be found in mathematics. They published a book called <em>Principia Mathematica</em> that used logic to prove the absolute certainty of math. It took 162 pages to prove &quot;1 + 1 = 2&quot; using this logic. For a short time, this was seen as a success.</p>
<p>Then Kurt GÃ¶del came along with a mathematical proof that showed that you could use the logic in <em>Principia Mathematica</em> to prove that mathematics doesn't give you absolute certainty. This created a tricky situation. Mathematics was proven to be both certain and uncertain, but that didn't make any sense at all!</p>
<p>Mathematicians really wanted absolute certainty, but we had approached the limits of what humans could compute. The mathematical problems had just become too large for us to handle, so an idea was born. Maybe we could make machines that would do the work for us and show, once and for all, whether or not we could have absolute certainty in mathematics.</p>
<p>The famous World War II code breaker Alan Turing came up with a machine that could do just that. They were called computers, because they were built to compute math problems, and they used logic based on <em>Principia Mathematica</em> to try to solve the problems that plagued mathematicians.</p>
<p>We would soon know whether or not mathematics could give us absolute certainty. We just had to wait for the computers to give us an answer, if they could. You see, the problem with these unsolvable math problems is that if they are truly unsolvable, the computer will work at them forever without finding a solution. So, we could only turn them on and wait.</p>
<p>Over the decades, computers became faster and faster at computing. Today, computers can do in the fraction of a second what would take one of Alan Turing's machines days to do. In that time we've abandoned the idea of using them to see if mathematics can give us absolute certainty. Even today, if you try to use a computer to calculate one of those unsolvable math problems, it will work forever to find a solution. If they are solvable, they are not solvable using the logic of computers.</p>
<p>At the same time, the reliability by which computers perform their tasks seems to have given us a lot of faith in mathematic's ability to create technologies that function as intended. So few people care anymore whether or not math gives us absolute certainty. It's close enough to be useful in our daily lives.</p>
<p>Note: I have simplified this explanation to the best of my ability in the hopes that I haven't oversimplified it to the point of misleading the reader. I just wanted to share my best attempt to ELI5 this topic because I think it's incredibly interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Omg man, I'd give you gold, but I'm a broke ass student. This Godel guy seems like an interesting person though. I have read about Godel's Theorem that a system cannot describe itself within itself in a context of human consciousness(we can never know what it is, because we're it), but I have yet to dig into it.<br />
Edit: Holy shit, we might be talking about the same theorem here. Do you know any friendly resources I could learn this stuff from? I study engineering and I do like maths, but I don't necessarily like the academic style of it(what's the use of memorizing formulas or why aren't I allowed to use a freaking calculator? No one cares about understanding or the beauty of it, man. Most common learning style is doing shitloads of problems until you start to do them automatically, no wonder people don't like maths)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a nice read on Godel is in <em>Godel, Escher, Bach</em> by Douglas Hofstadter. It's a book all about self reference in art, math, and music. Ultimately it's about whether or not consciousness is just an illusion created by self reference in the mind. I really like this book. It's follow up, <em>I am a Strange Loop</em>, is also really good and I think it has a fairly comprehensive and detailed explanation on what was going on under the hood in Godel's incompleteness theorems, so that might interest you.</p>
<p>If you're really daring, you could try diving into Ludwig Wittgenstein's <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, but that is extremely heavy and academic despite ultimately turning its nose up on academia and philosophy. I'm hesitant to recommend it, but it's the next step if writers like Hofstadter don't sate your curiosity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation. Also though, a good way to visually understand this super basic level of it is to mess around with redstone in Minecraft. If you search on youtube, you'll find tutorials for all of this explaining it. But basically, you create this type of incredibly simple computing and memory (and I/O) out of blocks, it really lets you see how it works (over-simplified, of course).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg72sN7Qb4Y&amp;ab_channel=Generikb" target="_blank">An example</a>... this is the 4th video in the series, so you can start at the beginning if you want. But this is where it gets to logic gates, which are the things discussed under computation above. Basically visually represents how computers take different things and combine them. If you get far enough into this, you can see how everything comes together. I've only ever built a calculator in minecraft, but people can build pretty complex computers in there.</p></div>		</li>
