			<div class="markdown"><p>People seem to confuse the fact that there are two separate types of marriage. Religious, which the government doesn't give a shite about, and legal, which the government does give a shite about. </p>
<p>Religious marriage can be what every want. But with out that bit of paper from the county clerk's office religious marriage don't mean shite to anyone else. </p>
<p>This whole thing is about legal marriage. Many of the retarded arguments leveled against same sex marriage were based on religious doctrine, which again, don't mean shite when you're trying to get health insurance for your sloppy bear. </p>
<p>This ruling fixes that. Huzzah! </p>
<p>The arguments used to make gay marriages illegal were very similar to arguments made to make interracial marriages illegal for decades. </p>
<p>Now the only way to change this ruling would be with a constitutional amendment. And good luck with that.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It is not a church's responsibility to uphold equality - it's the state's.</p>
<p>Tax exemptions are entirely separate. Further, the opinion today exprsssly states that requiring religious institutions to perform same sex marriage is a violation of the 1st ammendment. </p>
<p>In essence - all 50 states are required to grant same sex marriage licenses, and a civil officiant must be available to enact it. But that officiant need not be religious.   </p>
<p>All states have a 'courthouse' marriage option now - but not all people who get married use it (i might even say most don't, but I have no numbers).  This ruling, however, only affects the courthouse marriage option. You have the right to enter the institution of marriage. You don't have the right to a marriage ceremony in a church.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Can you point me to where they said that? Because a cornerstone of CJ Roberts' dissent was that the majority markedly did NOT state anything about religious people being allowed to continue practicing as they see fit - merely that they don't have to believe any differently. I may have misread or misremembered, though, which is why I'm asking for a source to prove me wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tax exemptions can be revoked if a church endorses or condemns a political candidate for an election. It has been argued (though there has been no court cases yet, IIRC) this is an unconsitutional restriction on speech. So I am not sure if the 1st amendment may protect a Church in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Churches refuse to perform/provide space for marriages for all sorts of reasons relating to their particular doctrines.  Some won't even do ceremonies for a member if that person is marrying a non-believer (and that's true for more religions than just Christianity).  </p>
<p>And you have to understand the person performing the ceremony (the pastor) is not &quot;the church&quot;--you can't force that person to perform a ceremony they don't agree with.  Like an imam performing a Christian wedding.  Those people are still citizens with individual rights.  And while churches are tax-exempt, they are still private property, not public, so you can't force them to rent out their space any more than you can be forced to rent your home to the public because you get a tax credit on the mortgage interest.</p>
<p>TL;DR It's more complicated than that, and why would you want someone performing your wedding who doesn't agree with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But couldn't the same thing be said about the bakery who refused to serve the gay couple? That gay couple went out of there way to make that bakery get out of business, when most likely, there was another bakery that would have easily and happily accepted there service. I still don't understand that whole situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A church can refuse to marry anyone they want.   The Catholic Church refused to marry my wife and me because we wanted to do it by a certain date and apparently the date was too soon for them.   </p>
<p>Basically this law just says gays have the right to get married in the courthouse with the atheists.   :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of how SCOTUS works is that technically they did not &quot;extend&quot; the right of marriage to same-sex couples. Rather, they said that the Constitutional right to same-sex marriage has existed since the passage of the 14th Amendment. It was, until now, being wrongfully and unconstitutionally denied to same sex-marriage.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court cannot make law. They can only interpret it.  SCOTUS did not legalize same-sex marriage. Congress and the States did 150 years ago with the passage of the 14th Amendment to our Constitution.</p>
<p>Is my interpretation correct, or have I misunderstood the scope of the Supreme Court's powers.</p></div>		</li>
