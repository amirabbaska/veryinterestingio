<p>Source my grandpa was rich, always went to the vault. Never stood in line or in the main store area for more than a minute or two. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pop also had a good relationship with his jeweler. The pride is being asked into the back where he shows you his rare merchandise one because he thinks you can afford it but, also he doesnt sell that to anyone just based on money he actually likes you.</p>
<p>My dad passed and he even called me to express his condolences. When I bought my wifes ring he was kind enough to actually take me in the back and show me what to look for in diamonds and scolded me when I couldn't find the imperfections. He is a good dude and now has a customer for life.</p>
<p>But, to answer the question the stores are propped up by jewelers who buy them for thier shops. I don't think those places are making a profit for the most part but it is a status symbol to have a store on a Rodeo Drive type place. The only thing I can think of is they have some of the super rare pieces so they only need to lets say clear 10 watches a quarter if they are making a profit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not a status symbol,  but a symbol of legitimacy?  A billionaire wont trust his Rolex is legit if he is buying it from a small shop sandwiched between two bowling alleys.  The store has to be big and impressive and in the rich store area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well since there are already two perfectly acceptable ways to refer to the game in the English language I still find the use of futbol weird. In the US it's refered to as soccer already no need to further confuse the issue. </p></div>		</li>
