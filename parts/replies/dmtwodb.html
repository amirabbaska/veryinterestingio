			<div class="markdown"><p>You joke, but I've read that theoretically you could terraform (in a very rudimentary way) Mars with our technology today by nuking its pole caps and releasing the water there into the atmosphere. I don't know how true that is but it sounds like a horrible idea even if it would work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard some interesting ideas about Venus, some people think it's more viable than Mars. I think they're crazy but there's a couple of reasonable arguments for it.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJ5KV3rzuag" target="_blank">PBS Space Time</a> video that explains it better than I can.</p>
<p>Essentially Venus has a similar gravity to Earth, so we wouldn't have to worry about bodies deteriorating; it has a strong magnetic field and an atmosphere that can protect us from radiation; and apparently if we can somehow come up with a buoyant settlement that floats high enough above the surface the air around us gets a lot chillier and a lot less violently dangerous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea is to build stations that float tens of kilometers off the surface. It would be like insanely resource-dense water at that point</p></div>		</li>
