			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how it works for a lot of farm ponds in the Midwest.  My dad and grandpa put in three ponds on our farm over 40 years ago and stocked them with two types of fish.  Today, we have 4-5 types, even though no other species have been added by man and the ponds originate from natural springs &amp; rain run-off (ie. nothing flowing down from &quot;up-stream&quot;).  My dad always said that those two other types of fish came in on the feet of or in the gullets of the cranes and other water fowl that hop from pond to pond in the countryside, carrying eggs or small fish with them as they go.  It's the only explanation I know of.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I  helped a friend dig a pond on his property, and a year later, he had never got around to getting it filled.  His 5 yr. old was casting in it, because he loved fishing, and had a pole.  We were all shocked when he pulled a 6 inch cat out of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes me happy that you know this now.  I helped the fish hatchery make a delivery at my old job and on top of that my 8 year old had a field trip with her school where they went out and stocked fish.  I thought it was common knowledge but I guess not.  Makes me happy that somebody learned something new.  :)</p></div>		</li>
