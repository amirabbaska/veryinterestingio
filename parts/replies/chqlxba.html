			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand it, the wave nature of light is a factor in path determination, but the individual photon will always collide at a single point, even if other photons effect the path of that photon backwards or forwards in time (such as is seen with firing single photons at the double slit screen). So yes, if you had a source of light with a wide enough diffusion pattern, which was firing individual photons, it could entirely miss the planet. In practical terms, the strength of the light in gross terms is going to determine whether a detectable amount of light hits the far away body, and the reality is unless you are using an immensely powerful laser you probably won't be able to pick out your light from the background noise (ambient light from stars, our Sun) anyways. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't read the links posted below, but to directly answer your question about what happens when the average power incident on a target drops to low levels, it just means that the RATE at which photons arrive, on average, gets really low.  You could have a scenario where some photon detector waits for an hour or a year to catch a single photon. The photons arrive according to Poisson statistics (you can link to that on wikipedia yourself, I'm lazy).  But that's what happens- photon rush hour stops, and it becomes a trickle of photons, then an occasional photon here or there. </p>

<p>Wouldn't that mean that at a certain distance the energy of the beam will fall bellow the energy of a single quanta (photon)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mostly. A beam has power (energy delivered per amount of time). And a photon has an amount of energy. Just for clarity, think a photon is a gallon bucket. And the Beam has a flow rate of XX gallons per hour. So we know roughly how many buckets to expect, knowing that partially full and overfull buckets don't exist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Word fairy here: It would actually be a &quot;a single quantum&quot;. &quot;Quanta&quot; is the plural.</p>
<p>&quot;Quantum&quot; sounds weird here because we're so used to hearing it as an adjective, but it started as the singular noun.</p></div>		</li>
