			<div class="markdown"><p>Babies also generally start with the sounds: ga, da, ma, pa, and na. It makes a lot of sense that we'd use these simple sounds to identify close familial relations, as these are some of the most important nouns a baby encounters.</p>
<p>Babies also like repeating sounds in succession, as they develop early language, hence why mama, papa, nana, dada, etc. are all generally parent/grandparent names in different languages.</p>
<p>If I recall correctly, I think a tonal variant of &quot;ma&quot; means &quot;mom&quot; in Mandarin, suggesting that this is pretty universal across vastly different languages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article recently that suggested the near universality of the word for mothers, eg mama, stems from the sounds nursing babies make, mmm mmm becomes mama (or some variation) when babies start to speak.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dolphins showed up 50mya, Parrots roughly during that time as well, and humans only showed up in bipedal form 3.6mya.</p>
<p>So I'd say odds are you're correct by several million years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could totally be the correct answer but maybe something to consider is the societal or social aspect of the child rearing responsibilities. </p>
<p>Meaning, early humans most likely lived like today's mammals in the sense the &quot;children&quot; were raised by the pack or pride or the conglomerate of the group. Simply because it was better/easier for long term survival. </p>
<p>Once, finally, our species evolved into a familial structure in which &quot;individual family&quot; became more prevalent or worthy than the pack structure did this naming system begin.</p></div>		</li>
