			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I'm not sure how there are so many highly voted comments with no one mentioning this. But you're actually underselling it. </p>
<p>In geosynchronous orbit, you would be in the shadow of the earth for a relatively short time each day. There is never weather to worry about. The energy hitting you is ~35% greater than the best spots on the ground. There is a stupid amount of power available. If you could get an ultra thin photovoltaic &quot;sail&quot; up there that covered 10km^2, that was only 5% efficient, and you would get a 650 million watt generator. </p>
<p>Beaming the energy back to Earth is really the most trivial part. Beam it back to Earth using microwaves that don't interact with the atmosphere. The receiver is just a bunch of wires strung across a large piece of land. You can prevent the beam from hitting the wrong place by using a carrier signal. Basically, a laser shoots from the satellite and hits a receiver, which shoots a laser back at the satellite as long as it is receiving. If the satellite drifts, the laser won't hit the right spot on the ground, which will stop transmitting, and the satellite will stop sending the microwaves. </p>
<p>Of course, there are a lot of challenges. How to make a photovoltaic &quot;panel&quot; big enough to be useful. How to get it there. How to deal with damage to the panels (micro meteorites, radiation, etc). Deal with reductions in efficiency as the panels age. And so on. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Except for the part that involves politics. Then expect phrases like &quot;Orbital Death Ray&quot; to be used in petitions to prevent it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a professor back when I was in college who was part of this research project. To expand a little bit, the idea they had back then was to microwave the energy to a high altitude platform of some kind, then transport it via another method (laser? physically moving batteries? its been so long I can't recall now) to the ground. DARPA had funded them and already inquiried about &quot;what would happen to things on the ground if the microwave beam were to miss the high altitude platform?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>microwave power transmission, especially over the 35,768km between a geosynchronous satellite and the ground. hell <em>earth's</em> diameter is 7,917.5km, so you are looking at transmitting power 4.5x to diameter of earth.</p>
<p>aside from your focusing area, which will be pretty large because <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beam_divergence" target="_blank">even perfect lasers diverge</a>, you have to deal with atmospheric effects like dissipation, scattering, opacity, and probably a number more i don't know about.</p>
<p><em>nothing</em> about this problem is trivial. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/equator/" target="_blank">Earth's average diameter is ~12,742km (+-30km)</a>, and not 7915km.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't even need GSO.</p>
<p>You can put them near the Lagrange points, or even much closer as they double as solar sails with &quot;free&quot; active positioning, particularly designs that use reflector concentrators like Mylar to reduce their mass, good for launch costs too.</p>
<p>Different arrays could service different receivers as the planet spins below as well enabling a world wide market, particularly night side. Place a receiver next to a Tesla industrial powerpack and it could be targeted for a top up if things go over power budget. On demand is also the highest prices, so you don't have to complete with coal, as long as you can undercut dragging in a generator you got it made. Ultimately it's a purely economics question.</p></div>		</li>
