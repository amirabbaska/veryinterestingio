<p>Christopher Cross won five grammies for his debut album</p>

<p>While that is true, it is the most often given example of the Grammies really getting it wrong, and how out of touch they are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree. If Beyonce never wins another Grammy, they will still beg her to perform there when she has a CD out.  She is bigger than the award at this point. Also, she has won a ton already, so what is a couple more?</p>
<p>Aside from maybe Meryl Streep, that just isn't the case for movies</p></div>		</li>
