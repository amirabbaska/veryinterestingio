			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe someone will post this to the top comment. Cheap vacuums make a lot of noise because they don't have sound dampening materials like premium vacs do.</p>
<p>Vacuums are loud because they use high-speed motors with fans attached to move air. The motors make their own noise, the brush roller systems can also be noisy. Finally, air being rushed into a narrow duct system will also create noise by itself.</p>
<p>The best vacs try to minimize all the reasons vacuums are noisy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh while I have you, what's your opinion on Shark ? My mam just bought one to replace her Dyson, I tried to get her to get a bagged but she wouldn't, so she picked up a Shark from costco. It seems alright..but it's new. I found a mixed bag online; half horror, half jubilation</p></div>		</li>
