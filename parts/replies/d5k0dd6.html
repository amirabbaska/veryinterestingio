			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually if industrially managed honeybees are doing bad, wild bees are doing even worse - they are susceptible to the same pressures (pesticides, disease, not enough floral resources)... Not to mention that they are understudied (don't provide economic value = no big money to study them), they exist ambiantly in the environment (as opposed to in colonies) and so are hard to study / conserve, etc . </p>
<p>Fun fact: introduced honeybee colonies can actually steal the resources of wild bees, spread diseases to wild bees, and more. that's why more beekeeping is not the solution. Planting more flowers is.</p>
<p>There are over 4,000 types of wild native bees in the US. You have mason bees, bumble bees, sweat bees, and COUNTLESS more. They have each evolved to feed from different types flowers and so have very different pollination styles, etc. The introduced European honeybee is not one of the wild bees. They are introduced, and arguably invasive in places where they steal resources from native wild bees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be voted up higher. When people talk about trying to keep bees to help the bee problem, I have to remind them that honeybees are not from the North American continent. Commercially they are quite necessary, but they wreak havoc on the local pollinators</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Habitat protection is another important aspect as well. Some wild bee generalists follow humans without problems, while some rare species need special environmental conditions (eg sandy heated areas, certain soil types, no floral pauses at specific times) to propagate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In at least some countries, bees are counted in ecological surveys and it shows the same downward trend. Of course no one is literally counting every bee, but it's unlikely that loads of commercial bees are hiding out in the wild. </p>
<p>Fun bee fact: there are around 250 species of bee in the UK, and only one of those species is a honey bee! 24 are bumblebees and the rest are solitary bees.</p>
<p>Not so fun bee fact: in the last 75 years, 25 types of bee native to the UK have died out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have two apple trees in my front yard. Bees from all over come and eat the ones on the ground. By fall we have over 100 seemingly drunk bees just living and eating these apples. When we move the apple they crawl out looking like the drunk man leaving the bar at 6am.</p>
<p>I find it amusing.</p></div>		</li>
