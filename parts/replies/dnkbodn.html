			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here. Gas turbines are used in Naval ships for one reason only, they are fast and small. However they are woefully inefficient and a diesel electric or direct drive diesel can squash it in that aspect. They also don't provide a very pleasant sound if they are not muffled/isolated properly which might annoy residents near the tracks (I live near one, diesel trains are barely audible when they pass by.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they are also fuel efficient. They just use alot. But make alot of power too.</p>
<p>In the same way a F1 engine is one of the most efficient engines around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They aren't efficient, compared to diesel. They actually suck pretty badly in fuel consumption.</p>
<p>Their advantage is huge power output per unit weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are once you move above he 50mw range. Modern stationary gas turbines getting to the 60% thermal efficiency.</p>
<p>The thing is they are only fuel efficient at there rated load. Wich is a very small range right on the edge of power production. Best suited to continuous full power loads. Like electrical generation or pumping task in pipelines (especially natural gas pipelines where the gas is the fuel.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas turbines are the most fuel efficient combustion engine known to exist. They have this perception of using lots of fuel because they make lots of power and are typically used in applications that need it. Because they are so compact people grossly underestimate their power output and assume that this little engine is using tons of fuel when it shouldn't be because it's so much smaller than the equivalent diesel, but a 1000hp gas turbine uses less fuel than a 1000hp diesel and both use less fuel than a 1000hp Otto engine.</p>
<p>Edit: of course this is at peak. Gas turbines at 50% output are way less efficient than other engines at 50% output, especially diesels which shine in this area. Gas turbines are great for hybrid electric systems where a battery can do the work when low power is needed then you can fire up the noisy engine and run it at its peak when you need lots of power (and divert any excess to charging the battery).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas turbines are not the most efficient. Combine cycle systems at power stations are. A piston engine is more efficient than a gas turbine for similar scale, they just fail more often so we don't use them a ton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-combined cycle gas turbines are definitely not the most efficient.</p>
<p>Both gas turbines and diesels gain efficiency as they scale up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brake_specific_fuel_consumption#Examples_of_values_of_BSFC_for_shaft_engines" target="_blank">but diesels beat out gas turbines at every stage</a> simply because of their higher heat of combustion. </p>
<p>This is because a turbine engine's combustion chambers have to tolerate combustion constantly whereas a reciprocating engine does combustion in pulses. This makes the piston engine less powerful for a given size but allows the combustion to be hotter without melting things, and the greater the temperature difference between the combustion chamber and the outside the more efficient a heat engine is.</p></div>		</li>
