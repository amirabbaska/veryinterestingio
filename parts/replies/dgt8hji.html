			<div class="markdown"><p>Do something else why you keep them on the phone.   </p>
<p>Go make that cup of tea you were putting off from doing, dust your dvd shelf, go and completely drain out every bit of poo from your system, so you wont need to poop again for the next week.   </p>
<p>Waiting their time is the only way to combat the problem, so gain the time back by taking care of something you needed to do anyway, while  you 'hunt for your CC' or some other bull.   </p>
<p>Not only does it put them off from calling you again, but it stops them calling someone else, perhaps you might have just saved someone more vulnerable from being ripped off.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Be very forgetful about the details
Spend a long time looking for your credit card
Tell them about your grandkids
Tell them about your swollen glands

Also, if scamming becomes less profitable <em>everyone</em> gets fewer scam calls. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to use the religious sales pitch that I had to learn as a kid growing up in an extremely religious evangelical family.  I don't mean any offense to anyone's religion, or to cheapen anyone's faith, but I can literally go on for hours and hours about how someone should devote their lives to Protestant Christianity, despite not having any faith myself.</p>
<p>&quot;This all very fascinating, but have you heard the good news about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ?!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
