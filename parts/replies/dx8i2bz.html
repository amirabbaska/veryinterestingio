			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered about that dolphin thing too. Does that also affect their sensory and motor cortices? Or just the frontal lobe (Or whatever equivalent)? That'd be strange to sense from one half of your body and not the other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm more interested in the dolphin brain now. Do they have redundancies in their brain then if one half sleeps while the other is awake? I'd imagine some functions suffering if this was the case without redundancies. Or am I not understanding at all how brains work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Count me interested; does that suggest that dolphins could be capable of having even more intelligence than they already have, should they be rewired to just sleep normally? </p>
<p>Yes, I know it's not that simple, but if someone would humor me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you back that up with facts. Most of what I'm reading says 4 hours in captivity, but even animal planet, or Discovery if you'd prefer, even says 30 minutes to 2.5 hours in the wild. So if it's true I'd genuinely like to know.</p></div>		</li>
