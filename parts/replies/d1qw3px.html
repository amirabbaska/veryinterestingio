<p>Short term sales rules the business world, because it's easier to trick people into buying a product that they don't need, is overpriced, and with terrible support, than it is to sell a high-quality, well maintained product, with great support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely, since the ReCAPTCHA submission involves sending data to Google, you have a cookie that identifies you to the system. Then, using a range of factors, such as IP address, your pass rate and solve time, number of CAPTCHAs solved, etc, it  determines the likelihood of you being human, and if it's not sure enough, it will ask you to solve.</p>
<p>Factors I've noticed affect it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether your IP is blacklisted and/or generates a lot of automated traffic (VPN, Tor, infected corporate network, etc)</li>
<li>How long you've been using your current ReCAPTCHA session</li>
<li>How frequently your session changes countries (indication of botnet use or VPN switching)</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Although it's less about assuming you're a bot and more about not assuming you're human. It sounds like the same thing, but there's a subtle difference in the way it determines confidence.</p></div>		</li>
