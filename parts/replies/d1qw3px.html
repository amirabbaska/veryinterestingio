			<p>Why is this prevalent? because companies are chasing the short term sale, rather than the long term retention.<br><br>Imagine how the business world would change if, when a customer LEFT the company, the salesman was forced to give BACK their commission (or have commissions given out after a year, and if people leave within a year, have it subtract out of that). <br><br>Fact remains, most executives come from a Sales and Marketing enviornment, and currently, companies reward short term gains and will sacrifice customer loyalty, as they often either are big enough to hold an effective monopoly (usually maintained through campaign contributions to ensure that they'll KEEP their monopoly), or are chasing the immediate bottom line, as that is what stockholders reward.<br><br>This attitude is changing, at least in smaller companies, who are run with an Operations Focus, rather than a Sales Focus, but the big companies have so much hold over the business world, and have so far to fall, with the small companies having so far to go to get to the top, that I doubt that we'll see a significant change, unless major political and societal change happens.<br><br>Edit, one thing i recommend is for people to read the article &quot;<a href="http://www.ou.edu/russell/UGcomp/Kerr.pdf" target="_blank">On the Folly of Rewarding A, While Hoping for B</a>&quot;. Issue is that rewards are set to benefit the current group of people in power, making them look good, and a short term gain makes them look good now. Why care about what happens in 2 years, when they probably wont be at that position anymore (keep being promoted up, or moved to another department).</p>		</li>

			<p>A lot of companies offer residual income based on your customer base (insurance agents, for instance), but this is actually intended more to retain agents than anything else. If you have a big residual income from existing clients, you're less likely to jump ship to work for a competitor.<br><br>One major problem is this is actually forced on executives by shareholders. If shareholders don't receive immediate returns (within a quarter), they will pull their investment, which reduces the company's ability to operate and grow. You <strong>have</strong> to grow aggressively, and take on a large amount of debt, in order to produce the necessary profits to continue receiving more investments, and continue to grow.</p>		</li>

			<p>If you want to get rid of sales commissions you can, but then you can be assured all your best salespeople will immediately pack up and leave for another company. You'll be left only with employees who make more on salary than they would on commission--meaning all the bottom reps.<br><br>At best, you can offer as salary the commission of a median sales rep (otherwise you're increasing costs). This means the top half of your sales force is taking a pay cut, while the bottom half receives a raise. That's completely counterproductive and counterintuitive. The top half will either leave or stop working as hard, since their hard work is no longer rewarded, and the bottom half will continue doing as they've always done (or slow down as well, knowing it won't cost them anything).</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't help larger companies that when they're publicly held the executives frequently interpret their fiduciary duty to protect the interests of shareholders as a directive to sacrifice everything for even the smallest gain on their quarterly revenue and net profit growth numbers. Future negative consequences or collateral damage be damned. This dynamic is further exacerbated by activist shareholders who acquire a large number of voting shares, extort executives into issuing dividends, then dump the stock when the future growth potential of the company has been completely decimated by financial shortsightedness and the well runs dry.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't think it's so much a better of &quot;small firms have so far to go,&quot; as much as that is the competitive advantage small firms have. When a firm is small, they target a specific customer, and they provide that customer a more tailored experience. People that seek out small firms are typically willing to (or have to) pay more for that experience. As a firm grows, their clientele changes and their advantages change. Typically, through economies of scale, their advantage comes from price and overall reliability. We might have a bad widget from company a, that doesn't mean the millions of other widgets from company a have similar flaws. A smaller firm cares about each customer's experience, whereas a larger firm can afford to lose that customer if it costs more to make them happy. As small companies grow, they inevitably adopt the practices of the big companies. <br><br>Though monopolies exist, I wouldn't say that every large company has a monopoly.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, yes, yes. If you want happy customers, pay bonuses on customer satisfaction. If you want quality, pay bonuses on the outcome of the thing you delivered. If you want sales at the expense of the first two, pay bonuses on sales.<br><br>I think that this is unique to tech and similar service-oriented sectors where the sales force is helping the customer choose a solution that fits their need. If you're selling washing machines, you don't have much control of the processes that result in that thing you've sold. If you're selling IT, you have to carefully select the right solution from a portfolio of products and services to answer the customer's ask. You also need to tell the customer when what they are asking for isn't really what they need. It's a nuanced business and sales cycle. <br><br>BTW, I believe Microsoft pays bonuses to their sales staff only upon successful delivery. </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm an engineering manager. I have two hard and fast rules for outsourcing. <br><br>1. Never outsource the core business. We always own every line of code for our core business. Not because of this decree, but because that's reality: it doesn't matter who wrote it, our customers will hold us accountable for it. We want to impose our own quality control and vision on the core business so that we can maintain it going forward. We do not want a contractor holding us hostage over the core business, nor in house talent dealing with code that a contractor treated as once-off. <br><br>2. Never outsource what can be crowd sourced. That is, aggressively leverage open source and the open source community for anything we can't or don't want to write ourselves. Bounties are one tool here. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Most likely, since the ReCAPTCHA submission involves sending data to Google, you have a cookie that identifies you to the system. Then, using a range of factors, such as IP address, your pass rate and solve time, number of CAPTCHAs solved, etc, it  determines the likelihood of you being human, and if it's not sure enough, it will ask you to solve.<br><br>Factors I've noticed affect it:<br><br><em> Whether your IP is blacklisted and/or generates a lot of automated traffic (VPN, Tor, infected corporate network, etc)<br></em> How long you've been using your current ReCAPTCHA session<br>* How frequently your session changes countries (indication of botnet use or VPN switching)<br></p>		</li>

			<p>I have always wondered something: many times the captcha is obviously a house number that I'm asked to enter. In the past I've tried to enter an incorrect number and still was let through, leading me to come up with the tinfoil theory that Google is actually using the masses as manual text recognition/data entry for their Maps project.  Is this a thing? Because it seems to me like it'd be a good idea from their end. </p>		</li>

			<p>That is correct.  It's their older version of captcha but that's exactly what it was doing.  Digitizing information.
<br>
<br>You would usually be presented with two pictures and have to type them both.  The first is the actual captcha, the second is them trying to get you to digitize numbers or text.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fun fact, if /u/without_traverse has repeatedly input incorrect info on those captchas then Google has marked him as untrustworthy. It shows the same address to many people, and only uses the data once there is sufficient agreement. The less often a person inputs what other people have input, the less Google trusts him.</p>		</li>

That was part of another explanation I heard for the &quot;new&quot; captcha system, and it made sense to me: a human will be less precise and a bot may even exhibit unusual patterns, like always taking exactly X amount of time.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are already services that will help you solve the text captchas, and they promise good response times. The output from such services are a text string that you can use bots to enter into the text box.<br><br>The &quot;problem&quot; with the new &quot;select all squares that are street signs&quot; is that it is not static, and you are clicking on part of the page, while it is possible to use offsets to direct the bot to click on a certain part of the page, it will take a little extra effort to get the co-ordinates right. Note that when you click on the square a new image is created in place which may or may not need to be clicked. You also need to remember what you are trying to click (street signs, water bodies, street numbers, dogs, cats), so you might require the &quot;solver&quot; (low cost data center) to get you a dedicated line to person till the captcha is resolved. Currently these solving services are not setup to do that kind of a response. Eventually they will, and then google will change the behavior, and the &quot;service&quot; providers will adapt to that too. The cat and mouse game will continue. </p>		</li>

			<p>A bot can just as easily delay the time it takes and even if the developer needs to, they can send mouse movement events in a way that looks like a human (assuming that this method is employed). <br><br>That being said I beleive you are correct, Google will only display the tick box captcha if you are &quot;trusted&quot;. They have a lot of data on users since so many developers use the captcha system, if you are sending a ton of correct captcha requests then they can challenge you further by providing the text version or the version where you have to select various images that look like the word they are describing.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Presumably, google could create a captcha that is just a button, and that could trigger a submit on the actual page. But that would get confusing for the user. Styling would be an issue. As well as the times when a more traditional captcha is required.<br><br>The last point in particular would be an issue.  By and large, &quot;submit&quot; buttons execute a &quot;POST&quot; request to the server, which means that if the CAPTCHA failed, it would either have to redirect to a failure page, or stop the execution before submission and show an error on the page.<br><br>Not that it would be impossible, but it would be difficult and probably cause a greater burden on the developer implementing ReCAPTCHA.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>I learned this in class today it's my shining moment! In addition to this answer the inventor of captcha realized that each person spends 10 seconds typing the letters to prove they are human. He felt that these 10 seconds could be used in a more productive way so he invented re-captcha which takes words from scanned books and are shown at a security checkpoint just like captcha. Except every time a human writes the word they see from the scanned image they are helping digitize books into ebooks. He explains it way better in a Ted talk which I will post later when I'm not on my phone. </p>		</li>

			<p>For the simple checkbox case, I could make a java app that mimics typical user control and movement. The app could tab through the form, fills out the fields, and moves the mouse over the box and clicks the mouse. It wouldn't be near as fast as methods that work directly on the field elements and DOM, but it would still be effective. Predictability leads to easier automation. Certainly, this approach wouldn't work against the graphical &quot;Choose all [something]&quot; captcha that can appear sometimes. For that you'd need something that could detect the popup, send the a picture of the popup to a human, and have the human select where the mouse would click, and in which order. All of this would have to happen pretty quickly to avoid timeout issues. One could probably sneak this into a crowd-sourced game under the guise of fast-thinking test. </p>		</li>
