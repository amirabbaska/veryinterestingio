			<p>After moving into the sales world, it's shocking how strongly this attitude is rewarded at every single level. Truly unbelievable. If you as an individual sales agent want to ensure your customers have a decent experience, you can--but your paycheck will suffer and you'll be passed up for promotions.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why is this prevalent? because companies are chasing the short term sale, rather than the long term retention.<br><br>Imagine how the business world would change if, when a customer LEFT the company, the salesman was forced to give BACK their commission (or have commissions given out after a year, and if people leave within a year, have it subtract out of that). <br><br>Fact remains, most executives come from a Sales and Marketing enviornment, and currently, companies reward short term gains and will sacrifice customer loyalty, as they often either are big enough to hold an effective monopoly (usually maintained through campaign contributions to ensure that they'll KEEP their monopoly), or are chasing the immediate bottom line, as that is what stockholders reward.<br><br>This attitude is changing, at least in smaller companies, who are run with an Operations Focus, rather than a Sales Focus, but the big companies have so much hold over the business world, and have so far to fall, with the small companies having so far to go to get to the top, that I doubt that we'll see a significant change, unless major political and societal change happens.<br><br>Edit, one thing i recommend is for people to read the article &quot;<a href="http://www.ou.edu/russell/UGcomp/Kerr.pdf" target="_blank">On the Folly of Rewarding A, While Hoping for B</a>&quot;. Issue is that rewards are set to benefit the current group of people in power, making them look good, and a short term gain makes them look good now. Why care about what happens in 2 years, when they probably wont be at that position anymore (keep being promoted up, or moved to another department).</p>		</li>

			<p>A lot of companies offer residual income based on your customer base (insurance agents, for instance), but this is actually intended more to retain agents than anything else. If you have a big residual income from existing clients, you're less likely to jump ship to work for a competitor.<br><br>One major problem is this is actually forced on executives by shareholders. If shareholders don't receive immediate returns (within a quarter), they will pull their investment, which reduces the company's ability to operate and grow. You <strong>have</strong> to grow aggressively, and take on a large amount of debt, in order to produce the necessary profits to continue receiving more investments, and continue to grow.</p>		</li>

			<p>If you want to get rid of sales commissions you can, but then you can be assured all your best salespeople will immediately pack up and leave for another company. You'll be left only with employees who make more on salary than they would on commission--meaning all the bottom reps.<br><br>At best, you can offer as salary the commission of a median sales rep (otherwise you're increasing costs). This means the top half of your sales force is taking a pay cut, while the bottom half receives a raise. That's completely counterproductive and counterintuitive. The top half will either leave or stop working as hard, since their hard work is no longer rewarded, and the bottom half will continue doing as they've always done (or slow down as well, knowing it won't cost them anything).</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't help larger companies that when they're publicly held the executives frequently interpret their fiduciary duty to protect the interests of shareholders as a directive to sacrifice everything for even the smallest gain on their quarterly revenue and net profit growth numbers. Future negative consequences or collateral damage be damned. This dynamic is further exacerbated by activist shareholders who acquire a large number of voting shares, extort executives into issuing dividends, then dump the stock when the future growth potential of the company has been completely decimated by financial shortsightedness and the well runs dry.</p>		</li>

			<p>Amazon, Tesla, and others seem to have done fairly well avoiding any profit as long as they can demonstrate that they are investing in future profits. Creating customer loyalty should easily be argued as an investment in future profits. Also, companies like Costco and Nordstrom have built strong businesses on a customer first mentality. Like Amazon they will do pretty much anything to maintain your business.</p>		</li>

			<p>Tesla and Amazon's current valuations are largely driven by cult-like followings. <br><br>Whether they grow into those valuations moving forward is a different matter, but both companies are VERY sensitively priced to investor's perceptions of future growth. </p>		</li>

			<p>We're not vertically integrated enough for that to be a major focus. Almost nobody is in this field. Components are 100% sourced in SE Asia, we just do sales, setup, and maintenance.<br><br>I used to work for the top company in the field, and it was far worse. Sales agents were given very poor quality training material, the process was unnecessarily complicated and confusing (for the customer), and pay was only 1/3 to 1/2 what it is with my current company while actually providing less benefit to the customer (more expensive identical product with an inferior warranty).<br><br>I feel I'm with the company offering the best customer experience overall at this point, however I still know that when things go wrong, any time I take to correct a problem is time away from getting my next sale, which translates to money out of my paycheck.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm an engineering manager. I have two hard and fast rules for outsourcing. <br><br>1. Never outsource the core business. We always own every line of code for our core business. Not because of this decree, but because that's reality: it doesn't matter who wrote it, our customers will hold us accountable for it. We want to impose our own quality control and vision on the core business so that we can maintain it going forward. We do not want a contractor holding us hostage over the core business, nor in house talent dealing with code that a contractor treated as once-off. <br><br>2. Never outsource what can be crowd sourced. That is, aggressively leverage open source and the open source community for anything we can't or don't want to write ourselves. Bounties are one tool here. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>You raise a good point, but I'd argue it's still more important for humans to be able to read it because while a human who can understand it can fix the syntax or even the logic, a computer that can understand it can't fix it for a human. We have greater agency than the processors we program for. So code first for humans, second for computers - same reason you put the oxygen mask on yourself first, before your children.</p>		</li>

			<p>Most likely, since the ReCAPTCHA submission involves sending data to Google, you have a cookie that identifies you to the system. Then, using a range of factors, such as IP address, your pass rate and solve time, number of CAPTCHAs solved, etc, it  determines the likelihood of you being human, and if it's not sure enough, it will ask you to solve.<br><br>Factors I've noticed affect it:<br><br><em> Whether your IP is blacklisted and/or generates a lot of automated traffic (VPN, Tor, infected corporate network, etc)<br></em> How long you've been using your current ReCAPTCHA session<br>* How frequently your session changes countries (indication of botnet use or VPN switching)<br></p>		</li>

			<p>This is because of how bots tend to act: clicking the same button over and over and over again trying to access a site.  Unfortunately, that's exactly what you, as a developer, were doing as well.  Since your behavior was very bot-like, the captcha forced you to provide more data to prove that you were a human</p>		</li>
