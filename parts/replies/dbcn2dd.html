			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot an important one - in case someone locks themselves in a stall and is injured/passed out, you can crawl under the door/walls to get to them. It's a lot safer than breaking down the door and risking further injury to the person inside.</p>
<p>Semi-related: A buddy of mine couldn't get out of his stall once because the lock jammed on him. He was freaking out and I told him to just crawl under the door. He said no way; the floor was too gross. I considered leaving him and letting him decide when he was desperate enough to crawl under the door. But I ended up crawling under myself and helping him unjam his door.     </p></div>		</li>

<p>Two, it's so that people can see what you're doing in there</p>

<p>Wtf is the point of putting a door in front of the toilet if you want people to see what you're doing in there? Might as well have it all out in the open like a urinal. Or just put a proper door on it and have some privacy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They can't see your naughty bits or anything, just your feet. It also makes it obvious at a glance if a stall is occupied.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It may also just discourage people for sitting in there for longer than necessary.</p>
