			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: If this is purely a refractive index issue, could we wear contact lenses, or have glasses in front of our eyes (with water inbetween, not swim goggles) that correct this and grant sharp vision underwater?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To seriously answer your question, I believe the problem with light ending would still exist. </p>
<p>In the case of wearing glasses, the light would still pass through water before entering your eyes and thus the angle of refraction would be different than the normal angle in air. </p>
<p>As for wearing contacts, they are designed to focus light coming from the medium air. The water would bend light at a different angle than what normally renters contacts before going to your eye and the vision would still be blurry. </p>
<p>But, if you designed contacts to bend light coming from the medium water, then I suspect you could possibly see as clearly as wearing goggles underwater. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup the refraction between glass and water is very small. They would not bend the light near enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contact lenses won't work, because their front surface is still curved. With contact lenses, correct focus still depends on the air-lens interface in front of the contact lens.</p>
<p>All the <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/eyescal.html" target="_blank">parts of your eye</a> have an index of refraction between 1.33 and 1.40. Air has an index of refraction of ~1, while water is 1.33. That means that the majority of the focusing power of the eye is in fact due to the air-cornea interface. Put your eyes underwater, and most of that disappears. You wind up with eyes that are probably focusing only 20% as strongly as you need. That's not something a regular prescription can fix!</p>
<p>Glass has an index of refraction of 1.52, so it's still good enough to use underwater. I imagine that you could probably correct for vision underwater with a pretty thick and horrible glass lens, but I haven't done the math to figure out how feasible it would be, and what it would look like.</p>
<p>Edit: Wikipedia says the total optical power of the eye is 60 diopters, of which ~40 are at the air-cornea interface. Assuming most of that goes away, you'd need 40 diopters of correction to see underwater. Plus those 40 diopters would have to be a much larger glass lens than 40 diopters in air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for a great answer. So much &quot;but contacts aren't practical underwater?&quot;. That's not the point obviously. </p>
<p>Holy crap 60 diopters? So the imo pretty strong -4 diopter glasses I have only change the focusing power by a pretty small fraction...</p>
<p>40 diopter glasses would be a tiny bit bulky lol.</p></div>		</li>
