<p>Now I re-read it I’m not sure why I thought this was relevant to your comment. :)</p>
<p>But, for what it’s worth, data is stored like a record (going around the disk, though I think it’s concentric circles not a spiral, and starts on inside not outside). So a radial scratch crosses lots of lines of data (small damage to many parts) so it can be corrected — but an arcing scratch does lots of damage to a small part so it can’t be corrected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely true, btw. You'd notice that it seems easy to read lsat, but if you see this:</p>
<p>eoteucnnr aainsgt mtnsoer</p>
<p>you'd have a very hard time to realize that it means encounter against monster</p>
<p>That's because those jumbled word examples always consist of words carefully arranged such that the way you read it isn't too far off</p>
<p>for example: you'd read remarkably as &quot;re-mark-ab-ly&quot;</p>
<p>If you see rmeakrbaly, you'd read it as &quot;re-meek-ar-baly&quot;</p></div>		</li>
