			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not American, I'm from NZ but I do wonder how it would feel to not be economically impacted by unemployment. Is that what you're saying? We have a benefit system here, (better than nothing) but its mostly built for a short term stay (hardly pays the rent, espesh in Auckland). Too bad if you're permanently disabled I guess.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's anything like Belgium, unemployment and disability are two different systems. If you're unemployed due to a disability sustained at work you will be on the unemployment system until your disability is confirmed as long-term and then you will switch to disability benefits. Unemployment benefits are unlimited in time as long as you can prove you're either looking for work or unable to find work fit for you. Not sure how it is now but disability benefits used to be higher than unemployment benefits five years ago. Source: am social worker in Belgium. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you get economically impacted by unemployment depends on what you work was. If you had a high paying job and as such live in a large and expensive house, you will most definitely be impacted. Just because the government looks out for you doesn't mean they are willing to pay you the same as you used to be paid.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's also worth noting that you might not even be eligible for any sort of payment, for instance in cases where you have a spouse with a job that pays enough.</p>
<p>I also want to dispel any notion that in Denmark if you don't have a job you can just sit at home, that's not the case at all. While you are unemployed and receiving money from the state, there are requirements for you. You're required to fill out and send out job applications, and (not sure how often it is) there is activation (uh, not sure, hard to figure out an English word for it), which basically means you'll go somewhere and do a job for a little while. As an example of the latter, my mom worked in a church for a while. Also worth noting is that if you choose to pursue a different type of career and as such will go back to school instead of pursuing employment, you won't opt into this system at all and you'll instead be paid by the SU system which is the program that pays students.</p>
<p>There's one last issue to tackle, and that's disablement, whether physically or physiologically. It's in the same system as unemployment, because you and your caseworker need to figure out the answer to the question of if you potentially at some point could work a full time job or if not then a part time job with state benefits to round it out so you get paid the same as a full time job. If either of those two are achieved, your case is solved. The third option is that you and your caseworker reach the conclusion that you won't ever be able to work a day in your life, whether the problems are physical or psychological is irrelevant, in which case early retirement is an option.</p>
<p>As a final, I'd like to add that I've simplified things a bit and skipped over troublesome fringe cases, but in essence this is how the system work. There's a lot more to it, and it can be quite a bit complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm that Switzerland has this too. You can be fired at any time for almost any reason. However, national unemployment is really low(1-3%) even though unemployment benefits are 80% of your last salary for 18 months.  </p>
<p>Some cantons have protection periods that require your employer to give you advance notice of contract termination. In this case your employer has to keep sending you a full paycheck for a few weeks. If youâ€™re working or not during that time is up to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short, they do. Probably face the same issues as well regarding wages. In the comment above I mentioned different reasons for persistent unemployment forgetting the biggest issue - in Denmark being able to speak danish is very important when applying for a job and that might be difficult for especially older immigrants. </p>
<p>Recentley we've seen a strong antiliberal trend (backed by a large majority in the parliament) to curb immigration and enforce language education,  labour market participation (for women especially) and &quot;danish&quot; cultural norms (burka outlawed and recently a major brawl about  hand shaking when receiving citizenship etc). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sweden follows that model too, but it varies a bit from country to country with how things are done. In Sweden there aren't that many laws around work. A lot of the rules are rules set by the unins, but as different unions will have different rules, it's hard to speak broadly. </p>
<p>Now, being fired on the spot needs to have a reason here, and it needs to be able to be proven by the employer. Even so the employee lawfully allowed to both try to overturn the decision, and seek compensation (damages?) from the employer.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah fellow Nordic who now lives in the US. </p>
<p>Hoisting the welfare problem on to the company is... silly and reckless, because it really is a contextual problem. A company in truly dire straits should be able to fire people very quickly. A company where the employee is just a huge asshole should be able to fire them very quickly. But then again in certain cases it's really unfair. But looking in to the situation as an external is a <em>ridiculous</em> overhead. Imagine having some federal people having to show up because you're firing your Subway franchise employees. </p>
<p>The only way around this is by making firing very easy (companies don't get killed by this, bad employees <em>can</em> indeed be fired) BUT making sure none of your benefits are really tied to the employer (healthcare, ability to pay rent in the short &amp; medium term).</p>
<p>Everyone wins.</p></div>		</li>
