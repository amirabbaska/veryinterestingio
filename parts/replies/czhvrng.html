			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only purity, but there was also considerable struggle for power in the Communist Party in the 60s. The cultural revolution was his answer to Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping trying to put Mao from a position of power into a more representative 'status' symbol. An exact list of priorities Mao might have had is disputed by scholars though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah when Nixon met Mao he said &quot;You have made great change in your country&quot; Mao replied &quot;I haven’t been able to change it. I’ve only been able to change a few places in the vicinity of Peking.&quot;</p>
<p>So Mao wanted Communism to stick, and not revert back to the old ways once he died (Just look at China today!)  In Kissenger's On China book, he said that Mao saw how Russia went back to it's old ways after Stalin's death, and he did not want the same thing to happen to China.</p></div>		</li>
