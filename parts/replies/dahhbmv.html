			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was 18 i suddenly started to get these every few days. Pretty sharp pain on one side of my chest (it alternated each time, but was never both) which would sometimes spread to the nearest arm. Usually left me short of breath too. Got told it was heartburn, but it felt nothing like it. Then got told it was stress, but I'm a pretty laid back person, especially back then.</p>
<p>Eventually went to get it checked out (took a stupidly long time about it tbh). Everything turned out normal - heart's fine, blood's normal, all hoopy. After about 10 months it suddenly stopped and I haven't had it since. Weirdest thing. Scary in hindsight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd get those a lot when I was a teenager, however I also have panic disorder and pretty severe anxiety so that was why. It's always fun when getting random chest pains is a symptom of panic attacks <em>and</em> a cause for panic attacks. </p></div>		</li>
