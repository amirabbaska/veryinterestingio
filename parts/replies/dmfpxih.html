			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got a lot of facts wrong there. </p>
<p>The average lifespan of consoles has typically been 6 years, not 3. </p>
<p>Alos, the 360 was released in late 2005, not 2004. It was succeeded by the Xbox One exactly 8 years to the day after release - giving it an 8-year cycle (not 7), though it remained in production until 2016 giving it a total lifespan of 11 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of console games were $60 in the mid 90s.  Chronotrigger and Doom for SNES were $80, if I recall right.  Cartridge-based games did tend to run $5-10 more than disc based games like PlayStation and 3DO.  There was more price variety, though, as most games aimed at a lower price tier than the upper end &quot;$60&quot; price that expected hit titles would price at, with plenty of games at a $40(disc)/$50(cartridge) price.  PC games saw a wider range, of $30-$40 (and occasional $50).</p>
<p>It was a 5 year lifecycle for systems, not 3 year - you can see this with NES/SNES/N64/GC/Wii were all 5 years apart (NES-&gt;SNES was 6 years); PSone, PS2, PS3 were 5 years; Xbox and Xbox360 were 5 years.</p>
<p>Xbox360 might have been 5 years as well, but the recession in 2008 affected the game industry heavily - right about the time development on the next system would be picking up.  It's usually the opposite, the game industry has been fairly immune to recessions, as video games are escapist entertainment and relatively cheaper than many hobbies.  This likely contributed to a 2- to 3-year setback in investment towards new systems.</p></div>		</li>
