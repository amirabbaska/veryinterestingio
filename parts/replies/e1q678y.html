			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, and the answer is 'Yes.'  The two main detectors at the Large Hadron Collider, for example (ATLAS and CMS) both reconstruct &quot;Missing Energy&quot; as one of the variables they look for in each collision.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If one of these hypothetical candidates really is the dark matter, which whizzes around and could be all over the place, then there is probably some passing through your room right now, streaming through the earth like a ghost.</p>

<p>That sounds like neutrinos to me.  How have physicists eliminated neutrinos as the missing matter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of matter/energy in the universe from the neutrinos we know about (electron, tau, muon) are all accounted for and don't come anywhere close the contribution of dark matter.  There are several theories that a fourth kind of neutrino, the &quot;sterile&quot; neutrino, would be heavier, colder, and a possible candidate.  But we've had very conflicting experiments recently as to whether they even exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos haven't been entirely eliminated as an explanation for dark matter - however, I believe that we have not detected enough of them to explain observations around dark matter. There may be other, yet-undetectable forms of neutrinos (such as sterile neutrinos) which will solve the puzzle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand, neutrinos all move at very close to the speed of light.  If dark matter is neutrinos, would those neutrinos have to me moving at slower speeds?  Otherwise they wouldn't hang around galaxies and cause the gravitational effects of dark matter that we can observe, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are indeed basically looking for something like a neutrino, but fatter.</p>
<p>The problem with neutrinos as the main component of dark matter are (a) it looks like there's not enough of them, and (b) neutrinos are too fast and too light, so they will &quot;free stream&quot; and not collapse into nice galaxy sized haloes.</p></div>		</li>
