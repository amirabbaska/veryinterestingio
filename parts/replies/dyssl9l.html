			<div class="markdown"><p>Acid in the stomach is also needed to activate various digestive enzymes that actively work to break down certain components of food. For example, a major enzyme is pepsin which is used to break down various things in the stomach. The acid doesn't break down proteins, but it can cause them to denature, allowing enzymes either in the stomach or later in the intestines, to do the actual work of tearing various molecules apart.</p></div>		</li>
