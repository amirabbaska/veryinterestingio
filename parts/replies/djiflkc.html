			<div class="markdown"><p>it doesnt suck in mass very fast. It only has the gravitational attraction of an atom. Thats next to nothing. There could be one inside you right now and you would notice nothing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An atomic sized black hole should have more mass than an atom, as it has higher density than common baryonic matter (like atoms). But the gravitational attraction will be low nevertheless
@OP: black holes are <strong>no</strong> vacuum cleaners which are &quot;sucking everything in&quot;, from far enough distance they will appear like conventional matter of the same mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes don't 'suck'. They define a point (well, specifically the event horizon does) beyond which its gravity is inescapable. Unless something is already travelling into that space nothing would get pulled in. If our sun was replaced by a black hole the same mass earth wouldn't get pulled towards it, our orbit sound remain exactly the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough, but wouldn't a black hole the size of our sun have a greater gravitational pull on all the planets so maybe the orbits would be a lot closer together?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean there is a fine line where a black hole becomes self-sustainable? What size is this? Could it depend on environment, so that a black hole forming in a gaseous cloud would need less mass because there is a higher concentration of mass than in &quot;empty&quot; space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black holes gain mass-energy from cosmic microwave background radiation (currently at a temperature of 2.7 Kelvin).  Black holes lose mass-energy through Hawking radiation.  Very small black holes have a net loss of mass-energy; at a larger size they have a net gain of mass-energy and so can sustain themselves.  From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation#Overview" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A black hole of 4.5×10^22 kg (about the mass of the Moon, or about 13 µm across) would be in equilibrium at 2.7 K, absorbing as much radiation as it emits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Small black holes will not really attract any mass from a gas cloud.  A black hole with a 13 µm wide event horizon (Moon-mass) will only be as gravitationally attractive as the Moon, which is to say, not very.  They gain their mass instead from background radiation, which is highly uniform throughout the observable universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you ever read that Larry Niven story where explorers on Mars find some ancient alien ruins which contain a communication device centered around a tiny black hole?</p>
<p>Not to spoil it but it gets dropped on one character, who dies from the tidal effects wrecking his body as the black hole passes through him, and from there it just oscillates around the center of Mars until presumably one day it will consume the entire planet.</p>
<p>How plausible is this?  If you wandered into a Moon-mass black hole, would you just get crushed into it or would it pass right through you with minimal effects?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does depend on the environment, it is ultimately predicted that all black holes will eventually evaporate, currently the cosmic microwave background radiation is hot enough to overcome hawking radiation for any stellar size or greater black hole.  But the CMB is cooling with time and this will not always be the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Self-sustainable is probably the wrong way to look at it. Think of a black hole as always dying since it became itself. The more massive it is, the longer it will take to die. Hawking radiation would contribute to or cause these deaths (or being absorbed by a bigger black hole). I believe the current working theory, if I remember correctly from a Startalk podcast, is that while Hawking radiation will slowly kill black holes, this process will take a long long time - longer than the current age of the universe. But, you can see how this might kill the smaller ones (atomic sized) in an instant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. If you mean production via stellar evolution (just massive enough to be a bit past a neutron star at the end of it's life) then probably between 2.5 and 3.2 solar masses. Likely that will depend on specifics of the star and how it performs at the end of it's life (spin rate, how much it sheds and so on).</p></div>		</li>
