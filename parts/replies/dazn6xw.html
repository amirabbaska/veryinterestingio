			<div class="markdown"><p>Im gonna argue with you on this one. Not cuz I think you're wrong, but because I think it's not realistic. The problem is our individual impact on the environment is so small that most people give up trying to reduce their own CO2 emissions. </p>
<p>The thought process goes &quot;the earth is gonna get fucked by factories and cars anyway, why am I gonna inconvenience myself when some company in Michigan is gonna undo it all?&quot; It might be economically cheaper and easier to fight climate change by having everybody cut back, but it's still HARDER. </p>
<p>If we could increase taxes and total government revenue by 10% for one year and use all that extra money to fight climate change, we would have $700 Billion to figure out some centralized way to &quot;make the drain bigger.&quot; </p>
<p>It would suck and it would be unpopular, but it's more realistic than expecting everybody to make a conscious decision to reduce their own emissions. Let's face it, people are selfish assholes and sometimes it's necessary for somebody to kick em in the balls until they do the right thing. </p>
<p>Just my thoughts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you that government action is almost certainly needed to actually address climate change, but it seemed like the OP was asking for steps they could take personally to fix things.  In the US, unfortunately, there will be no action on climate for two years, and probably none for four, but if you want to make a difference, vote for candidates that accept climate science and want to address climate change.  For most races in the US, that means voting for the Democrat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe tax beef? It's a win win, higher price means its less consumed and the money can be used for clean technologies. </p>
<p>When we are at it maybe also tax things like flights and burning coal. I'll call my great invention the carbon tax. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Everything that's being said here about reducing CO2 should be collected into a big wad and sent back to 1990, when it wasn't too late.</p>
<p>It's too late now. It's over. It's done. We're past the point of no return. Why bother conserving now?</p>
<p>The only thing we can do now is work on vast, technological-epoch-defining hyper-engineering projects to either sink the carbon that's already in the atmosphere at an insane rate, reflect sunlight (careful not to get a snowball Earth going with this one), or otherwise bleed heat, or possibly dope the atmosphere with some substance that could do several of these tasks at once.</p>
<p>We altered the climate, we can alter it back, given enough effort (and insane, idiotic, regret-filled expense, goddammit). But using less energy now is closing the barn door after the horse has been set on fire. Don't shut the door, throw water on the flaming horse.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We need to mitigate the damage, the difference between a 4c rise and a 2c rise is huge. The climate is fucked, and everyone (except the super rich) will pay the price, but we can reduce how bad it is. We need to find solutions, but conservation will buy us time to do this, and prevent a total collapse. </p></div>		</li>
