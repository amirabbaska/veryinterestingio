			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really ELI5 but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function" target="_blank">exponential function page of wikipedia</a> contains a definition of sin and cos as an infinite sum, derived from a definition of the exponential function as an infinite sum.</p>
<p>I find that those representations make it more clear what it means to have imaginary exponent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you don't have to use imaginary numbers. Sine and cosine have Taylor series expansions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Personally, I think that imaginary numbers are simpler than power series. But in fairness, you really do need power series for a deep understanding of the exponential function e^(x), which my explanation just takes as a given.</p></div>		</li>
