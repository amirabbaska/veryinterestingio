Then, when you get so high up that it has filled it's g-orbitals, you will add another line bellow the f-block and add 14 electrons there. Then you can go on to the main PS and fill the 5 d-orbitals and 3 p-orbitals. This means that the next &quot;noble gas&quot; will be the element Unsexoctium.</p></div>		</li>
