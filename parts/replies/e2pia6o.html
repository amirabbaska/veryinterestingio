<p>First off, water is weird. It's unlike most other liquids in that the high temperature actually decreases the freezing point. For most liquids, it would actually increase it. </p>
<p>So why is water so weird? First, think of a normal liquid as a bunch of spheres. When you want to freeze the spheres and get them to stop moving, you can either lower the temperature to take energy out, or you can mash them together by increasing the pressure. For those spheres, the solid they're making is pretty simple, so it's easier to freeze them when you increase the pressure. </p>
<p>Water, though, is way more complicated than those spheres. Each molecule hydrogen bonds - most simply, the oxygen in one molecule wants to be by the hydrogen of another. Since there are 2 hydrogens and one oxygen on each molecule, this makes the solid have a much more complex arrangement than those spheres. In water, that arrangement has a bunch of molecular-scale holes, which leads to the less-dense ice. Now, when the water freezes, it is trying to push away from its neighbors, so increasing the pressure actually hinders the ice forming. Because of this, you have to take out even more energy by lowering the temperature, which decreases the freezing point at the high pressures. </p></div>		</li>
