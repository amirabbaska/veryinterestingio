<p>Slashdot did the same thing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Slashdot predated the concept of a userbase being valuable in and of itself.  They didn't have comments to begin with, then after they had comments they didn't have users.  They saw commenting as a nice extra for a long, long time.</p>

But my net.celeb status ended when someone figured out the cookies for the site was a php session id and they brute forced it while I was logged in, changed the e-mail and did a password reset before proceeding to spam the site with hundreds of shitposts. Account ban. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm of the mind that we should simply nuke the entire site from orbit (only way to be sure), then drop Zucker into a volcano and call it a day. Nothing good ever comes out of Facebook. I mean, tell me a story where someone starts with &quot;So, I was on Facebook...&quot; and it doesn't end in some kind of dramatic shit show complete with industrial-grade fans blowing it around just to make sure it gets ground up into a fine mist and sprayed as far and wide as possible. And I say this in full knowledge of the kind of cat fights that the lesbian community inspires. Guys... you think YOU have crazy exes? Oh... if only you knew. <em>if only...</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>or Hangouts, which is yet another attempt by Google to shove something down people's throats that totally isn't working out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? Hangouts is working out and it's awesome, and has, as far as I've known, not even been advertised. The only way I found out about it was because it used to be Google Talk and they just changed the name (And many other things on the backend, but it was backwards compatible until very recently).</p></div>		</li>
