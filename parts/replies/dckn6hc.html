<p>I feel like the difference here from other examples is that there is no way get &quot;proof&quot; because all of the evidence is behind a wall of classification. Furthermore, the victims may not even know they are having their rights violated. Because of this, it may take way longer then normal for it to go through the court system and be realistically judged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh, also, it was touched in earlier, but there actually is no such thing as a constitutional right to privacy per se. </p>
<p>it's an &quot;invented&quot; (i don't mean to say that in a loaded way) concept that was implied into existence in the constitution to remedy what some justices saw as clearly unconstitutional laws that weren't directly forbidden by other constitutional provisions. </p>
<p>i'm not debating the propriety of it, but what that means is that the &quot;right to privacy&quot; is a highly specific, additive set of rights that isn't specifically listed anywhere. </p>
<p>this means that it may or may not be appropriate to discuss a &quot;right to privacy&quot; in the sense of the NSA being forbidden from doing what it's doing - prior right to privacy (constitutional) matter deal with direct governmental control over the body of a person (forcing them to a public school and forcing them to (not) have an abortion). I'm not a privacy rights or constitutional scholar, so maybe lesser courts have found constitutional rights of privacy that bear on governmental spying activity. </p>
<p>the other component of this is that privacy must be guarded furiously in order to receive legal protection. as discussed elsewhere, the &quot;shit&quot; that you freely and voluntarily publish to the world or your internet service provider very rapidly makes any privacy rights you have evaporate. </p>
<p>lastly, it bears note that violations of the 4th amendment specifically carry a relatively &quot;weak&quot; punishment to the government - they just don't get to use the evidence at trial. this is important with NSA stuff because the government in many of these cases won't care about taking the suspects to trial as they are largely concerned with foreign actions and actors which rapidly takes the whole set-up out of the domestic court system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;classified&quot; isn't necessarily an obstacle to obtaining proof - the judicial system isn't entirely bound by it (but that gets hypertechnical, and fast) and judges can (and do) routinely examine classified/secret documents to determine whether they should be turned over to the requesting party. </p>
<p>your second point, though, gets to the entire essence of standing. </p>
<p>how are you, specifically, suffering if you aren't even aware that your rights are violated? how do you even begin to conceive that a redress must be made to you if you can't even perceive an injury? it doesn't even do you any good to say &quot;i'm theoretically prevented from sending this conspiratorial e-mail to my buddy because i'm afraid the NSA will find out&quot; since there are other aspects of standing apart from injury-in-fact. one of which is causality - you need to prove that the government's illegal act caused you to abstain from your (illegal?) act. </p>
<p>there is a bit of a chicken-and-egg bit to this, in that you can't demonstrate your harm unless you have standing to sue to find out exactly and specifically how you're getting harmed, but like i said, this is a relatively young area of litigation and at some point it may very well be that the supreme court allows national organizations to challenge unlawful laws that are being broadly enforced to great collective harm but to minimal individualized harm. </p>
<p>but something to point out: i don't think you'd get a large portion of the population to agree that they are being collectively harmed by NSA activity. you'd need to change that popular sentiment before a court will go along with it, i'd think. </p></div>		</li>
