<p>A key parameter in the mathematical description of the Big Bang is the curvature of the universe:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe</a></p>
<p>We've done lots of observations and experiments to try and measure the curvature and we've found it to be zero within experimental limits.  </p>
<p>IF the curvature were positive then the universe would be closed/finite, something like a ring (but in 3D) where there is a finite distance you can travel in one direction and end up where you started. So similarly, discovery of a closed universe implies that there is a curvature.</p>
<p>The curvature is a CRUCIAL determiner of whether all of this is heading towards: Heat death, Big Crunch or something else.</p>
<p>So yes, if we consider the fate of the universe to be an important question then whether the universe is finite vs. infinite is absolutely pivotal information and is hugely important.</p>

<p>When people talk about a finite universe, they generally mean a periodic universe (i.e. something where the point x and x+L are the same, so you can loop back to where you started and the &quot;size&quot; is L), not like &quot;an end&quot;, like there's a wall out there some place.</p>

<p>We can only ever know about the observable universe, as far as we can tell it's homogenous and isotropic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are closed 3-Manifolds with curvature ≤ 0, they are not
isotropic though.  Anyways, if they are large enough it’s unlikely
that these anisotropies would have any measurable effect.  So it’s
possible to have a closed universe and no big crunch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A finite universe wouldn't need to have a boundary. If the universe was finite, we'd expect it to be finite in the same way that the Earth's surface is finite - there's only so much of it, but there's no boundary and you can travel as far as you like in any direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Layman here, I vaguely recall learning that photons can only have energy levels that are a multiple of &quot;planck energy&quot; (or planck &quot;something&quot;, again, layman here). Is this related in any way? Or do photons not count as &quot;particles&quot; in this sense?</p>
<p>Any insight would be helpful :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Plank energy is 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 electronvolts. It is a very, very, very, very large energy.  But it also has nothing to do with anything here.  Here we're talking about the SMALLEST possible energy a photon can have.  Which appears to be arbitrarily small.</p>
<p>Also, see the FAQ about &quot;Planck&quot; anythings.  As far as we know none of the Planck units have any physical meaning.  But regardless, I think you're confusing high energies with low energies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apologies, looks like I was actually thinking about Planck's constant, and I found the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzRCDLre1b4" target="_blank">video</a> where I heard this from, about 11:48 in. I'm probably still misunderstanding something here, but at least I figured out what my own thoughts were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we looked at infinite and finite spaces. But what about periodic spaces, modules over fields: those that relate to our (+, -, -, -) 4 dimensional space as <strong>Z**<em>n</em> does to </strong>Z**? </p></div>		</li>
