			<div class="markdown"><p>I was watching some show where it was a three-way military skills competition, and one of the groups was &quot;mercenaries&quot;, like Blackwater contractors. One of the events was a &quot;room clearing&quot; where you had to shoot bad guy targets mixed in with civilian targets. The mercenaries straight up said that in a real situation like that, if you killed a civilian then you would be subject to the law in that country, no matter who hired you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's because you don't just get to do shit like that. Being a contractor isn't a free license to operate however you see fit, wherever you may be. That's Hollywood movie bullshit. You are an employee of a highly regulated company working a very specific contract inside of a sovereign nation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While technically you are subject to the law of the country you are in all the time, they have to catch you to do anything about it. </p>
<p>If you are hired by the government of somewhere to work there you would of course negotiate something like the US military has, a status of force agreement that lays out what you can and can't do, that's the same as any business negotiating a contract. If you are say paid by Kenya to invade Somalia and you shoot a Somali civilian, the Somalis would need a police force to arrest you at all.</p></div>		</li>
