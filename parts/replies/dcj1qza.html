<p>The best method I've found, which works for all humans regardless of ethnicity, is to use a safety razor and shaving cream. Shave very lightly in the direction of the grain only. This cuts the hair off flat and flush with the skin. </p>

<p>I've never had an issue with in grown hair (blessed with straight hair), but going against the grain always seemed to give a much closer shave. I would usually do with, then against. Do you have a problem getting a close shave?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll never recommend a safety razor to anyone. The irritation and breakouts that occured after I used a safety razor has left permenent scarring on my face that i'm uncomfortable with years later. They're way too rigid for everyones face, the new razors are soft and bend/contour around your lips nose and chin without putting extra pressure on certain areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't be applying pressure with a safety razor at all, it should just be lightly gripped and basically be able to wiggle in your grip fairly easily. </p>
<p>Being able to get the tricky areas and a consistent shave is a question of technique, not manufacturing(so long as you get a blade sampler and find one that fits you). It's rare to get it right every time for a long while and if you caused actually permanent scarring you were <em>definitely</em> doing something wrong and should have noticed that while shaving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i know how to shave. It's the design of the razor that is the problem. They're too rigid and heavy, getting your top lip or the corners of your mouth nicely is almost impossible. Just because it works for you doesn't mean it'll work for everyone. Sure you can get nice sweeping motions on your cheek, but god forbid you have a zit you have to go around. New blades are designed to work with the contours of your face and effortlessly shave the area. I know with a newer blade, going over a mole on my face won't cause it to bleed for two hours. </p></div>		</li>
