<p>What it's saying is that quivering and a screwed up face are the natural state we would be in, if we didn't expend effort and energy on maintaining control of our faces! </p>
<p>When upset, the energy is being used elsewhere. </p>
<p>This is an evolved trait since facial expressions and recognition are a part of our species. </p></div>		</li>
