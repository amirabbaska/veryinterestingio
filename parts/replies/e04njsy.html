			<div class="markdown"><p>Take your dryer apart and clean it. Pull it from the wall and stick your cell phone in the duct and take a picture. Is it clogged? Clean it. </p>
<p>Where I live, all the new houses are being built with ducts going through the attic instead of right outside, so the dryer really has to work hard to get rid of the moist air. This is bad.</p>
<p>The best thing you can do is make sure your exhaust hose (between the dryer and the wall) is tight and not kinked (and not clogged). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely; once a year <strong>unplug your dryer</strong> and unscrew the screws on the back. </p>
<p>Get a vacuum with a hose and clean it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The important things to do is clean the lint screen every time and make sure the dryer vent is made of rigid metal and is short.</p>
<p>If the vent is short and lint screen is kept clean, the exhaust velocity is high enough to keep lint particles entrained in the air and blown out of the vent. When the dryer exhaust is restricted for some reason (too long, crushed, too many elbows, lint screen plugged etc), the lint starts depositing in the dryer and the vent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, no. it is flammable because it is. dryer lint makes excellent tinder for lighting with flint and steel, and very few substances work well for that. the reason is that it is formed by knocking individual fibers from cloth, blowing them through the air and then collecting them loosely. it's pretty much the the most flammable form of cotton/whatever there is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It is very flammable. You actually answer the question op asked better than I did. I just answered the question of why is actually catches fire!</p>
<p>Of course lots of things are very flammable which are never intended to be burned (hairspray, wd-40, dryer lint...) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a business like yours.  This is the exact thing i was taught as to why it's so important to clean dryer vents.  also chimneys! Unkept chimneys fill with creosote and are crazy dangerous.  (I also used to clean chimneys)</p></div>		</li>
