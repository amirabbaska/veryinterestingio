			<div class="markdown"><p>I played the clarinet and the bassoon. As far as the clarinet goes, good luck fighting through the billions of clarinet players out there to get any sort of solo part. Holy crap there are at least twenty in any one band I've been in. I can't vouch for guitar, but you're either a pianist or you know how to play piano. As far as the world is concerned, there is a major pianist shortage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was surprised on my first day of band practice when I saw there were 20-30 clarinet's with maybe 12 on trumpets, 12 in percussion, then &lt;5 on the other instruments (sax, flute, etc..). I still don't understand, why do so many people want to learn the clarinet? I wanted to learn trumpet, but clarinet wouldn't even be in my top 5 of instruments I'd want to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Yes of course there are exceptions. I'm just making a general point as it applies to individual working/gigging musicians. There are many great bands founded and lead by musicians who don't play piano or guitar. It's just generally more convenient if you happen to play piano or guitar. </p>
<p>For sure but it's just so much more convenient to be able to run your own show/perform solo. As a former professional bassist who eventually transitioned into solo acoustic guitar/singer, I know exactly what he means. Having to always rely on the rest of the band being there for rehearsals and gigs can be frustrating. Also having little control over the decisions and direction. When you play a lead polyphonic/melodic instrument you don't necessarily need a band to rehearse and book gigs. You can do it all on your own time/schedule. Also, try writing a song on a drumkit or just a bass guitar or sax, or something. It's doable but not nearly as productive as writing on a piano or guitar, where you can even work out the other instruments parts as well, and lead the band as you rehearse and perform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually find it easier to write the bass part first and allowing it to govern the beats, the chord progression, and parts of the melody if I'm lucky.  If I try to write on guitar, I have to think too hard about the chord progression and it always comes out too rigid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well put man. I'm a professional guitarist &amp; bassist.</p>
<p>Give the bass ago. Drummers make great bassists because playing bass is all about rhythm, texture &amp; frequencies. Just like playing percussion. You can make a two-note baseline sound amazing with ghost notes.</p>
<p>Also is really easy to learn the notes and positions.</p>
<p>I forgot to mention, i began spending more time on classical guitar around 5 years ago. It's usually the the type is guitar most people ignore, but I really felt I was missing out on how expressive you can be on it. So I begun playing around with flamenco type percussion which I developed into just percussion. I figured that if I could play a flamenco rhythm, then why couldn't I play a 'fall to the floor' or drum &amp; bass? So I did.</p>
<p>So now, I can play precision, even if it is on a guitar, the skills are transferable. Its improved my understanding of rhythm with not just myself, but we the other musicians I may be working with e.g. I really notice what the drummer and bassist are doing and can spot any minor detail which may be causing an issue.</p>
<p>I really recommend you guys to try out the instrument you wished you had. You would be surprised at how quickly you would pick and also notice how it could improve your composition, phrasing etc..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a great part in the new James Brown movie, get up, where he is yelling at his band asking what instrument they play and isn't happy until every one admits they are all playing drums. Like 22 people with horns. And he says, that's right. Now grab your drums and let's go. Or something like that. Makes sense given the music he made. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eddie Van Halen was originally the drummer while his brother who now plays drums was on guitar. EVH has an amazing sense of rhythm and that's why his playing sounds unique and like he's playing with a metronome</p>
<p>Refused wind up having really intricate rhythmic patterns in their music because the guitarist, Kristofer Steen, is a drummer as well and he along with the drummer, David Sandström, write all the music.</p>
<p>Honestly, I've thought of getting a cheap set myself and trying to learn. I think it'd help my playing, especially since my playing has taken a new turn after getting a bass</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I didn't know that and EVH!</p>
<p>With percussion, you don't necessarily have to play drums. Just tapping with your hands is enough. A cajon as really good idea as it's easy to pickup.</p>
<p>Best advice would be to listen to some tracks which you are familiar with and tap out the rhythm. You can use the bass if your palm where your wrist meets on a table for the kick, and your fingers for detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied Percussion Arts at University. Our study requirements included other instruments, such as marimba, string bass, and piano.</p>
<p>If I could give only one piece of advice to any drummer, it would be to pick up a second instrument, such as guitar or piano, and play it. You don't have to become a virtuoso. Just play it enough to get a feel and an understanding. It will help you play drums and write drum parts in a way that makes the other instruments sound good.</p>
<p>EDIT: Clarity</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this advice a lot. I don't know if it's really the same thing in other genres, but for jazz the drummer isn't actually the person determining time. That's the bassist. The drummer is the one determining style, general feel, and accenting the things the melody players are playing</p>
<p>And the reverse goes for melody players. Learn drums. It's not the instrument determining the time, but you do need to have good time to play it well, and it's really easy to let time go to the wayside as a melodic instrument.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Learned guitar as a kid and only ever played solo stuff until I hit high school and played in bands. Wasn't until one of our drummers got me behind a kit that I understood that I didn't need to play  something on my guitar every minute of every song; understanding how drummers feel out the space between the sounds their drums helped me say more with my guitar while actually playing less. </p>
<p>I dunno if that makes sense but learning the drums (even to a basic extent), as you guys have said, definitely improved my understanding of how better to use my guitar than I did when I was younger. </p></div>		</li>
