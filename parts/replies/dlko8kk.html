			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't a mosquito recognize us as a living creature since they feed on us.  Also, I'm pretty sure most insects know the avoid us since they do their best to (i.e., not crawl on us while we're sleep.... otherwise, roaches and other crawly insects would be on us all the time)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're asleep, how do you know they aren't crawling on you all the time? When I'm awake I catch bugs on me quite often really; ants, flies, grasshoppers, even spiders.  Who's to say they aren't in your bed at the foot of your sheets waiting for you tonight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I've seen roaches around my apartment sometimes but never on my bed.  I just assume that insects, like mice, can sense humans (perhaps by smell) and avoid them.  </p>
<p>This is all anecdotal of course, but it just seemed to make sense that they try to avoid you when they can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am no expert, but I think mosquitoes are simply attracted by smell or something. And... I envy you for insects trying to avoid you because I definitely can't say they do they same with me:D
But yeah, all I can say really is: I do not know, you might be right and I might be wrong. But I would like to find out more about the topic so if anyone out there really knows their insect brains, this is the moment you have been training for!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does a mosquito need to recognize you as a &quot;living creature&quot; to feed on you? It doesn't need to have any concept like &quot;living creature&quot;, or categorize you as one, in order to feed on you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You shouldn't assume that having their nervous system in a different place of more decentralized makes them less rational somehow. That would be a bit anthropocentric, and in some cases incorrect. Also, spiders specifically are not insects.</p></div>		</li>
