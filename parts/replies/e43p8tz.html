			<div class="markdown"><p>What about geostationary orbits? Since the rocket has the horizontal velocity already wouldn't it be possible to thrust enough where apogee is at geostationary orbit and not put in any horizontal speed? Of course ignoring the extra deltaV that might be required. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except if you thrust directly up, you won't end up at geostationary altitude directly above where you started, because that same initial horizontal velocity will be carrying you off course, and when you do cross geostationary altitude you're velocity will be in the wrong direction for an orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is possible, but burning at the lowest possible distance from earth is more Delta v effective. Low altitude has higher speed and thus more energy so it is better to get to a low earth orbit and then burn in space to raise your apoapsis to geostationary altitude. </p></div>		</li>
