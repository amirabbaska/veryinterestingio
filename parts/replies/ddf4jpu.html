			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to point out that an FBI agent approached them with the idea of getting weapons and sending them back to Iraq.  They did not begin or come up with any plan themselves.  They agreed to the under cover agent's on the condition of being paid.</p>
<p>So the were agreeing to be arms dealers.  They weren't planning a terrorist attack.  </p>
<p>Still shit human beings to do something like that, but let's not pretend like this thing was their idea. </p></div>		</li>

<p>2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees = ban on all Muslims coming into the country in 2017... 6 years to take (the wrong) action. If there were a real problem we'd all be dead now.</p></div>		</li>
