			<div class="markdown"><p>I would not recommend it if you are still young...You are forced to become very good at multi-tasking, but at the same time it's also frustrating because it's hard to go deep on something. There is always 10 fires to extinguish. I barely code anymore, something which I sorely miss. I do read papers (in the train to and from work) and talk my students to keep up to speed. It's interesting to note that your thinking becomes more high level and intuitive (which is a good skill to have). And then there is the incessant email flood that you are constantly trying to keep up with. So don't go there when you still have the change to focus and go deep. It will come later anyways....</p></div>		</li>
