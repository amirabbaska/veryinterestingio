			<div class="markdown"><p>Very nice analysis, you obviously have a lot of space understanding.</p>
<p>For the 45 minute problem, on the Earth there is a lot of natural shade variables from clouds/trees/etc, so the 45 minutes on/off theoretically should be survivable for plants. But i'm not a botanist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does a plant care if day and night occur more frequently? And continuing down your post, please explain why it is necessary to have a 12 hour cycle. I'm assuming you are aware of polar summers on Earth... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used 12 hour cycle as an example, it varies by latitude. Nothing grows at the pole though.</p>
<p>But nowhere on earth do you have a growing season with 45 minute day/night cycles. This is important because plants do different chemistry in the light and in the dark. They need time to switch reactions, and switching costs energy. </p>
<p>You may have seen flowers and leaves unfurl in the morning, close at night. Look more deeply and you'll microscopic pores called stomata open and close. If you have 45 minute cycles, plants are constantly switching between light and dark, they never get time to ramp up glucose production.</p>
<p>Most plants will die with such short cycles. Some may survive, but they won't thrive. Since real estate for growing plants is so extremely expensive in space, why would you waste it on a suboptimal cycle? Specially when all it takes to fix it are some LED lights and a battery? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't say specifically at the poles. I said polar summer, which if you look at the arctic regions in the summer, you will find a profusion of plant growth. 24 hours of light does not cause issues since plants don't need to have a night cycle, as you call it. In fact, greenhouses in Alaska can be quite prodigious during this season. Indoor hydroponics are another example of extended light exposure.</p>
<p>But I'm more curious about these short cycles and whether they actually require energy of from the plant or if it is a function of natural constriction of cellular walls due to temperature, but regardless there's a spectrum of plant types and since we would likely be more interested in growing beets and potatoes than we are roses and orchids, surely some food bearing plants would be more tolerant than others. If so, then that tolerance can be exploited via bioengineering, assuming of course that this isn't all speculation to begin with. 45 minutes on and 45 minutes off sounds like a 12 hour day to me. If there's an energy cost to the average food-bearing plant, then is it equivalent to an 8 hour day, a 2 hour day, or some other value? </p>
<p>And to get to your other point, wouldn't using fiber optics and an exterior light accumulator be less expensive from an energy, maintenance, and weight perspective than LEDs and batteries? That system could also be tuned using passive filtering to limit the wavelengths emitted and wouldn't cause the temperature fluctuation of direct lighting. Just a thought...</p></div>		</li>
