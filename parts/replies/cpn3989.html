			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the slower heat loss offset the increase in surface area caused by an increase in total volume (by adding milk)? If the cup was square, the addition of an equal volume of milk to coffee would cause a 66% increase in surface area, provided that the cup itself does not offer any insulation and the milk was at ambient temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't that lead us to expect the milk-added-first to be cooler after a certain time? But... Though the rate is faster, the temperature difference is wider and thus there is more cooling to occur... Differential equations make my head spin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Aside from increased convection, higher temperature also means increased IR radiation and thus more energy leaving the probe over the same amount of time. Though I am not sure if the quantity of the energy carried away with IR is actually significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so since you are posting this I am going to assume you read/understood that thing, (I have to excuse myself for not doing that, since my theoretical understanding of physics is not the greatest and english is not my first language either) but do you know the reasons for why it changes when the milk is &quot;significantly above room temperature&quot;?
I ask, because I personally tried listing off all the negligible factors, looking for all situations (realistic or not) in which method A would not be faster and this seems to be one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Thermodynamik, if you want to know the rate the temperature drops you measure the objekt (the tea) and it's surounding medium (the room). The bigger the difference between them both is, the faster the temperature will fall. So by adding cold milk you drop the temp. of the tea sharper, hence it will fall in temp hereafter weaker than the hot tea. By exchanging the milk with warmer milk you reduce this effekt. sry for the long text and the bad english. I hope i could help</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's to do with the fact that adding cold milk gives a sharp drop in temperature. If the milk is warm, however, adding milk at a later time after the coffee has cooled, the drop will be smaller - at some point, you would even increase the temperature of the coffee.</p>
<p>However, they do point out that you need to add a lot of milk at a high temperature to cause Method A not to be faster. Their example is that a 66%/33% coffee-milk mixture requires milk at a temperature of 43C for it not to work, for a room temperature of 20C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the milk is significantly warmer than room temp, it doesn't lower the temp of the tea significantly. That means the tea with the milk added first still has a large temperature gradient compared to the air. It gives heat off similarly to the tea that hasn't had the milk added yet.</p></div>		</li>
