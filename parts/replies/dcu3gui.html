			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. However you would be
SHOCKED how strong this myth is. I have been a Mechanic for 20 years now, and while I work for myself now, I spent 15 years working in all manner of shops. No matter how many times I explained this to my bosses, they ALL forced me to put a piece of wood under batteries whenever they were placed on the floor. Many shops will still actually have special wood panels just for this purpose. And I have sat down and explained to them that this is from the 20's and even then took quite some time to have any effect. Nope still with the piece of wood. Even now one of the guys who works for me swears by his little wood battery panel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is standard for all hazardous material containers. They require a secondary containment in case the primary one leaks.</p>
<p>The only other explanation I have heard for placing the battery on wood is during charging out of the car. The claim is the heat generated from the charging would set up a thermal gradient from top (hot) to bottom (cold concrete) and cause warping of the electrodes or case. But I have never seen this in normal, out of car charging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I was an RSS at the Irish parts store for a few years and at a lot of locations where space is limited they'll have the large batteries on cement and some of those will sit a while in between rotations. I could def see how that would be a thing but I'm surprised at the prevalence of it. </p>
<p>I mean I never had faith in the myth, even knowing how cement can be like acid to some materials. Plastics homes </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would suggest this is because the issue was not so prevalent or familiar in the earlier 1900s, but that is not likely true because the industries were close enough in their development to be well understood by all (Ford Motor Co. notwithstanding, European industry quickly caught up).</p>
<p>But my guess as a teacher is rather that at some pivotal time in the industry, the change in battery manufacture was accompanied by education about how this was no longer relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a federal agency that has hundreds of thousands of batteries deployed, and without fail any that sit on a concrete slab for extended periods fail. They do and no reddit comment will actually change that. SOmeone from Exide explained to us that it has to do with the temperature differential between the bottom and top of the battery changing and effectively causing the battery chemistry to deteriorate.  Simply elevating them on wood is usually enough. The mistake people make is storing unused batteries on concrete floors. Pretty much a death sentence. VRLA fare slightly better, but in the end they still fail. The unequal temperature in flooded batteries will eventually cause the bottoms ends of the plates to fail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why did I have to go so far down to find this post?</p>
<p>Look in any proper Automotive Technology Textbook, and you will find that the temperature differential between the concrete floor and the top of the battery is the reason that you shouldn't store a battery on the floor. Even with modern batteries. There were other concerns with older batteries, but modern batteries still shouldn't be stored on a concrete floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dude. got me. I was shocked how many allegedly &quot;authoratative&quot; comments here were proclaiming this a myth. Does putting your battery on the floor for a week kill it? prolly not with modern batteries. Does keeping it on the floor destroy it? yes. Most cases it will take a year for a VRLA and maybe 6 months for a flooded battery if they arent used. keeping them trickled helps some, but in the end they will still fail. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've always heard that temperature was the reason you don't put a battery on concrete.  There are a lot of posts here about cold temperatures extending battery life, but all of them seem to assume a uniform temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/antisoshal" target="_blank">antisoshal</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. its the differential between the bottom and top, and the fact that it will change. Concrete on the ground will remain comparatively stable in temperature. The air will warm and cool the battery, as will the small amount of heat created by the battery itself. Its just fact that we have been working around for decades. You could say dont put a battery on a giant aluminum block too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood is a pretty good insulator. It slows the transfer of heat to the concrete dramatically and gives the whole battery a chance to equalize the temperature. Even in the summer, a medium size concrete slab on the ground is going to be 60F or lower. Its just like caves are always 54F or near there. when you put the battery on the concrete its basically an infinate heat sink trynig to draw the battery temp to between 50 and 60F. When the air is warmer, the top of the battery draws heat in constantly but never fast enough to offset the heat going out the bottom. You create a heat gradient across the battery. Over a long period of time that deteriorates the battery chemistry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that while a great deal of this may be anecdotal, typically, concrete floors are cold. I have been told that this can be unsuitable storage for batteries and have negative long term effects, but it has also been my observation that car batteries should not be left anywhere for long periods of time, unused, anyway.</p>
<p>I have some electrical knowledge and Battery University has told me that car and motorcycle batteries should be left on trickle chargers if not being used for long periods.</p>
<p><a href="http://batteryuniversity.com" target="_blank">http://batteryuniversity.com</a></p>
<p>Is where you should start, though, because there are a wide variety of battery types and all have dissimilar properties and ideals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all correct, except for the part about cold being bad for batteries: all things being equal, <a href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/how_to_store_batteries" target="_blank">colder is better than warmer</a> for storing batteries.  The article I linked states that the optimum temperature for storing batteries is 15 degrees C (59F), but if you look at the estimated recoverable capacity for batteries after being stored for one year, colder is definitely better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Storing yes, as the lifetime is increased if they are not run too warm. However maximum OUTPUT does not occur when they are cold. This is why a battery is quoted with an Ah rating and a cold cranking amps rating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Good to know, battery chargers usually say on them to not leave it once the battery is fully charged, and &quot;common wisdom&quot; (pre-internet days) was that it would degrade the battery to do this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you got some good replies... just want to be a little more specific. something like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deltran-Battery-Tender-021-0128-Charger/dp/B00068XCQU" target="_blank">battery tender</a> is good to leave connected. it will cycle on and off to keep the battery charged... <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Schumacher-SE-2352-Manual-Battery-Charger/dp/B00030BFNI/ref=sr_1_54?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1485274518&amp;sr=1-54&amp;keywords=trickle+charger" target="_blank">Trickle chargers</a> are manual and push a constant amount of amps until you turn them off.</p>
<p>the manual type are still not obsolite... for one you can charge a battery quicker because you can choose the amperage to charge at. Another benefit is if you have a very discharged battery, the newer battery tender types will not charge it because it's measuring too low of voltage and is programed to assume it's damaged... the manual type, sometimes you can set it very low and charge it up enough to switch to back to the battery tender type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trickle chargers left on batteries are horrid, what you're looking for is a float charger. Trickle chargers constantly apply voltage, which slowly kills batteries. Float chargers charge, then turn off to let the battery slowly lose charge, then turn the charger back on to return it to full. </p></div>		</li>
