			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect explanation. </p>
<p>If there are financial or political reasons for the sister cities to be involved, there may be a large amount of support from local government. </p>
<p>Example : Oil producing sister cities. Lots of money involved, so lots of support involved. </p>
<p>If there's no money involved or the partnership is not important politically, it may just be an &quot;on paper&quot; sister city. </p></div>		</li>
