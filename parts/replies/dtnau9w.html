			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of, but kind of not.  There are two types of days.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>solar days, with respect to the sun.  That is, the average time it takes to go from noon on one day to noon on the next.  This is our normal 24 hours on Earth. It's 116.75 days long on Venus</p>
</li>
<li>sidereal days, with respect to the stars.  This is how long it takes the planet to make a 360Â° rotation.  Since the planet has moved around the sun partways in this time, it doesn't equal one solar day.  This is about 23 hours and 56 minutes on Earth, 4 minutes shorter than a normal solar day.  It's 243 days on Venus.  </li>
</ul>
<p>A Venusian year is 224 days long.  So by our normal definition of days (solar), a Venus day is shorter than its year.  But a sidereal day on Venus is indeed longer than a year.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is great. Thanks for the 10 minutes of thought it took me to understand this and use it to figure out which direction of spin is &quot;the right way&quot; as opposed to &quot;backwards&quot;</p></div>		</li>
