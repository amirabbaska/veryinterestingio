			<div class="markdown"><p>What's really neat is that you can even watch this process happen in real time. For example when you take two small crystalline chunks of a metal and you put them together, when they touch in the right geometry, they will simply snap together to form one solid crystal, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgsuxEHxFjY" target="_blank">as shown in this video</a> for two nanowires. As Feynman so nicely put it, from that point on as far as the electrons are concerned they only see one continuous network of atoms (the lattice) that they can zig-zag through. </p>
<p>The trick to getting this welding to work is just that you need very clean and well-defined surfaces so that the atoms on the surface of each bit of metal can come into contact with each other. On Earth we can get there by using a high vacuum, as shown in the video. Doing the same thing in space is even easier since you automatically get an ultrahigh vacuum without even trying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does grain structure affect this process? Is it easier with two single grains than it is with polycrystals? If you're joining two single grains, is it easier if they're oriented the same way? And if they're oriented differently, does a grain boundary spontaneously form between the two?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ideal scenario for cold welding is that you have two atomically flat and crystalline pieces of the same material that come together into the right orientation. In that case, welding is easy as it requires very little change in the position of the atoms that come together. </p>
<p>Once you get away from this ideal case, something has to give because you now have to rearrange the atoms for the weld to work well. For example, think of the structure of a typical polycrystalline material <a href="http://i.imgur.com/mjMKy2m.jpg" target="_blank">as shown in this cartoon</a>. During the formation of the material the individual grains keep growing until they physically block other and become locked in place. Clearly you have no chance of two pieces of such a polycrystalline material having the right structure at the surface that the grains at the surface lining up nicely as happens for perfect single crystals. In practice you solve this problem in a very elegant way by simply jamming one piece on top of the other at high pressures. The pressure will disrupt the atoms in the grains at the surface until the interface rearranges enough to produce something that more or less resembles the bulk material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know what you mean by &quot;easier&quot;, but energy-wise it should prefer single crystals touching in the same orientation.
But this doesn't mean it won't work with polycrystals, because in polycrystals all those grains do stick together quite well, there is no reason it should be different for cold welding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they stop things welding together by accident while in space?<br />
Are they just really careful with what can move around, or is it a bit more tricky than &quot;This piece of material hit another piece and now they're stuck&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: it can be a problem. Generally if you have a moving part that needs to stay moving it's very important for it to be lubricated. The lubricant forms a very thin film on the surface that keeps things from getting stuck.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some metals bond with others more or less well, but the distances and alignments between the atoms at the interface between the metals are extremely important in forming a bond. Imagine you have a border of atoms that are 2.22 angstroms apart (crystalline silicon), and a border of a bunch of atoms of a different metal (copper?) that 3.615 angstroms apart. They are not going to line up nicely for connecting; it'd be like trying to get Lego and off-brand Duplo blocks to fit together.</p>
<p>This is extremely important in a bunch of thin-film semiconductor manufacturing, as you often need some kind of intermediary layer (or layers) that has a better alignment with the layer below or you are not going to be able to get the layer you actually want to &quot;stick.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>it has to do with chemistry. the same metal will share its electrons throughout its mass. 2 different metals are likely to have some kind of electrical or chemical interaction. electronegativity and the like. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And why just metals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the sharing of electrons is one of the things that <em>defines</em> something as a metal and it's what allows for this to happen. </p></div>		</li>
