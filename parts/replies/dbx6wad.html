<p>Of course we now do that with extraordinary accuracy with satellites, so accurate they measure the swelling and shrinking of continents like Australia. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LOL. Somehow I think I'd trust Tesla's claims more than I'd trust yours.</p>
<p>Hope you get your three-fiddy one day.</p>
<p>Oh by the way if you know anything about electronics you would know about impedance matching. Without it you get 'reflection' its very likely Tesla was aiming to use the reflection (impedance mismatch) to determine the geography. I doubt very much that the computing power (pencil and notebook) was enough at the time but I am guessing it could be done now. If you are not sure about what I mean by impedance matching and reflection just think of sonar. The same principal applies except it follows the curvature of the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean would it actually create surface waves?  I don't know.  <a href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/59/jresv59n6p365_A1b.pdf" target="_blank">You need someone to do the math.</a>  I was never good enough to do it.</p></div>		</li>
