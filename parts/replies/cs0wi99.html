			<div class="markdown"><p>If the electric shock itself isn't enough to kill but enough to cause major muscle groups to seize, even without interrupting breathing or heartbeat, the subject would likely die of one or a combination of dehydration or hyperthermia. Fixed position, and seized muscles along with the two mentioned above could cause a condition called rhabdomyolysis which is extremely life threatening if left untreated. It results from toxic proteins being released by dying muscle tissue and will shut down the kidneys resulting in death. There are multiple other conditions that could arise from such torture but of all of them the quickest onset would likely be the one that proves fatal, it would take a climate controlled room to keep the subject from dying of hyper/hypothermia, and an IV drip to keep them hydrated. Being shocked continuously would be like running all out nonstop. Your heart would begin suffering from a condition known as demand ischemia whereby the heart cannot keep up with the demand and is damaged by its inability to both deliver enough oxygen to the body and to feed itself, eventually leading to a heart-attack. Dehydration would play a pivotal role in this as well.</p>
<p>Tldr the subject would die a long and excruciating death if no major life sustaining systems were compromised by the shock. Death would primarily occur from hyperthermia, dehydration, and strain on the heart, if the subject were artificially kept alive with fluids and cooling, muscle would break down and and shut down the subjects kidneys leading to an even more prolonged and painful death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was no arc in the scene what so ever. Current was running through his body. There also no short circuit because his body was acting as a resistor. The human body is an excellent conductor, yes but it may have enough resistance to not trip an overcurrent device. Being said, electricity takes the easiest path to ground or the greater difference in polarity. All those things you posted May or May not happen but more than likely your organs would cease before &quot;blunt force trauma&quot;. Depending on the voltage/current/phase but what most likely would happen is you would literally cook inside out where ever the current would decide to flow. If it were in the abdomen like you said, it could do a full loop up to your head before deciding to go to its return path, its unpredictable. I'm an electrician and you seem to going out on a limb with your expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I know it's top comment and all but that was straight up bull-shit level wrongness. Arcing had nothing to do with it, and assuming he's wet inside (we all are) his innards would boil very quickly... like well-under a minute. He wouldn't suffer for long though, the shock itself would cause his heart to stop and render him unconscious after a few seconds. (Source: I teach a utility electric safety course.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I said, depending on voltage and current it's anyone's guess what it'll do. I met a lineman safety rep who had shorted two phases with his arm. It went in his hand and blew off the back of his arm and nothing damaging touched his torso. He had to get the rest of his arm amputated but he was that lucky. But under slightly different circumstances his body could have been blown in half. Like I said it's unpredictable and must be respected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My back of the envelope math assuming blood has a resistivity 93.5ohms and assuming length is approx 10 time diameter that gives us a resistance of 935ohm</p>
<p>I=E/R
I=230/935= .25amps
P=IE
P=230(.25)
P=57.5 watts</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You realize that you can get watts directly from resistance and voltage using ohms law, right?</p>
<p>P = E^2 / R</p>
<p>P = 220^2 / 935 = 51.76 watts</p>
<p>You were off by over 10% in your calculations because you rounded the value in between steps. </p>
<p>Regardless, since he is literally being turned into a human resistor at that point he must dissipate all that power into heat.  I don't think humans make great heatsinks, and even with complete guesstimation and poor precision I would put 50:1 down on him not lasting more than a few tens of seconds, and if he does then it is because he is dying of being internally burned alive and not because of critical organ failure. </p></div>		</li>
