<p>Absolutely, and it's been going on for a while, I can only speak to since I've moved to the US (Clinton Era):</p>
<p>Ensuring the wealthiest citizens benefit from your policies and are exempt from prosecution for the laws they break</p>
<ul>
<li>NAFTA (D-Clinton), Deregulation (R-all)</li>
</ul>
<p>Surrounding yourself with corrupt people who financially gain from your policies, and who in return provide you with &quot;donations&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Every administration ever.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changing laws to marginalize opposition</p>
<ul>
<li>Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Clinton), Patriot Act (R-Bush), Patriot Act expansions / NSA(D-Obama)</li>
</ul>
<p>Silencing journalists</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikileaks (Both)</li>
</ul>
<p>Employing state media to control the narrative</p>
<ul>
<li>Telecommunications act of 1996 (Clinton law, but helped both sides)</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating nationalist fervor through a perceived outside threat from foreigners</p>
<ul>
<li>Serbians / Illegal immigrants (Clinton), Saddam (Bush), Ghaddafi/Asad/ISIS (Obama), ISIS / Illegal Immigrants (Trump)</li>
</ul>
<p>Indoctrination of ideology in schoolchildren</p>
<ul>
<li>Both sides but is more bound by locality</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>No this is not an exhaustive list, just showing it happens on both sides. yes I did leave President Trump mostly  out of it, only because he is only 4 months into his presidency so there has not been time for things to be completed / analyzed yet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes.. &quot;Pledge of Allegiance&quot;...<em>Shiffers</em></p>
<p>From Wiki: Congressional sessions open with the recital of the Pledge, as do many government meetings at local levels, and meetings held by many private organizations. It is also commonly recited in school at the beginning of every <strong>school day</strong></p>
<p>They have kids pledge allegiance every morning. When I heard about this my mind instantly shouted Indoctrination! And it scared the shit out of me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact, you do <strong>NOT</strong> have to acknowledge the pledge of allegiance in any way shape or form. And you can <strong>NOT</strong> be punished for it.</p>
<p>This was decided by SCOTUS in <em>West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette</em> under freedom of speech laws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is being phased out actually. Some schools certainly still do it but this very reaction and the fact you are not constitutionally required to means that a lot of schools have stopped to avoid awkward situations with parents.</p>
<p>That being said there are definite positive aspects to it. I have heard a lot of teachers promote it in younger children simply because it creates a sense of order and marks a definite beginning to the school day, allowing them to calm down and shift into learning mode. If removed from these children the teachers would probably recommend it be replaced by a local school motto or something, simply because all education requires a certain amount of indoctrination and preparing students for learning is important. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Deregulation can be a good or bad thing <em>depending on what regulations you are removing</em> not all regulations are as effective as hoped. For example, If I passed a law to protect deer populations in NJ and years later the deer population came back and became so large that deer suddenly became a significant problem for towns (lyme disease, fatal car accidents from hitting deer etc) would deregulating hunting laws protecting deer in NJ be a bad idea?  </p>
<p>Somethings, like the Clean Air/Water Acts, have both positive and negative elements once implemented. Shouldn't we refine legislation to make it better?  </p>
<p>NAFTA was beneficial overall. Free trade is a net good thing for MOST people in a society.  There is a reason why the overwhelming majority of economists support free trade.  Trade is a vastly complex subject and if you haven't studied macro it's easy to get caught in illogical traps like thinking free trade is bad. NAFTA has benefitted all the nations involved. Dropping out of the TPP was a huge mistake on Trump's part IMO. </p>
<p>I'm not sure how NAFTA enables people to avoid prosecution for crimes they commit that poorer people would be tried for. </p>

<p>That isn't what is meant by changing laws to marginalize opposition. None of these change the way people get elected. A better example of what would constitute changing laws to suppress opposition would be if the GOP changed the requirements for voting in states they ran such that majority votes got you elected POTUS or if they deprived you of the right to publish pro-opposition party materials. Look at what Zimbabwe does/did surrounding their elections or what Russia does to get an idea of what that means. The USA does not get close to checking this box ATM.  </p>

<p>Has wikileaks been silenced?  I can get on just fine. This would not be the case in China with the firewall. Again this box remains unchecked ATM BUT Obama has brought us closer to checking it off.</p>
<p>The only box that IS checked is the nationalist fervor box as there has been a movement to view certain forms of Islam the enemy since the fall of the USSR.  As a side note I was an adult for all of Clinton's term in office at no point did they try to instill fear in the population regarding Serbians invading the USA. </p>
<p>Take a macro course and read academic history/poli sci not pop versions of this stuff. </p></div>		</li>
