			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's wrong. Ice Ih (&quot;regular&quot; ice) and ice VI cannot exist at the same pressure.</p>
<p>You get ice VI when you compress water at 0 C, i.e. an isothermal (constant temperature) process. You don't get any ice Ih, only liquid water and ice VI. Here you start from ambient pressure in a perfectly sealed container and cool, i.e. it is an isochoric (constant volume) process. The behavior is different and you'd still get a mixture of two phases, but no ice VI.</p>
<p>As ice starts forming, pressure increases and water is compressed. Water density at 20 MPa is 1.01 g cm^(-3). 10% ice and 90% water can coexist at that pressure at approximately 0 C.</p>
<p>As you keep cooling the water, more of the remaining liquid water will freeze, and pressure will increase. When you reach the same pressure you have at the bottom of the Mariana Trench (about 110 MPa), you can get 30% ice and 70% water. But because of the increased pressure, the liquid water will have started cooling substantially below 0 C without freezing. So you can get as low as 250 K and still have a mixture of ice Ih and liquid water.</p>
<p>If you can cool the water below 250 K, pressure will keep increasing until you'll reach a triple point between ice Ih, ice III and liquid water. That is, ice III will start to form and you'll have ice Ih, ice III and liquid water at the same time in your container.</p>
<p>At this point there's no reason why pressure should increase to the levels required to produce ice VI. Even if you keep cooling the system, ice III is denser than 1 g cm^(-3) and can provide the required &quot;breathing room&quot; for ice Ih. Liquid water will disappear and the ice Ih will be mixed with ice III first and then ice II (which is also denser than 1 g cm^(-3)).</p>
<p>To sum up, you'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>first a mixture of ice Ih and (compressed) liquid water until liquid water reaches -21.985 C (at 209.9 Mpa).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at that point you'll have a mixture of ice Ih, ice III and liquid water</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then liquid water will go away and you'll get a mixture of ice Ih and ice III. Pressure will increase very slowly at this point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>then you'll reach another triple point, with ice Ih, ice III and ice II (-34.7 C, 212.9 Mpa)</p>
</li>
<li>then finally a mixture ice Ih and ice II if you keep cooling.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's think about the numbers. If water and ice have a bulk modulus of about 2 GPa and we're opposing an expansion of about 10%, that's a hydrostatic pressure of 200 MPa, or a force of 20 kN on each face of a 1 mL sample. That same axial 20 kN applied to a cross section of steel of area 400 cm^2 corresponds to an axial stress of 500 kPa, which is far below the strength of steel, which is generally hundreds of MPa. So you've got a factor of safety of about a thousand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that case the hard part would be sealing your container against that high a pressure (29,000 psi in 'Merica units). The steel could definitely take it, but you'll need some industrial-level seals to make it happen. If I were going to try this experiment I would probably use <a href="https://www.highpressure.com/products/valves-fittings-tubing/high-pressure-valves-fittings-and-tubing/glandssleevesplugselbowsteescrosses/" target="_blank">High Pressure Fittings</a> or something similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the contraction of the outside of the vessel due to the cold play a part? Seems like the inside of the container will end up smaller than before so the water would actually have to shrink as it froze</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that axial stress is the failure mechanism of choice here; I think bending stress in the side walls would be more likely. If you conservatively assume the 20kN force is at the centre-point of each wall, the bending stress is a max of 6MPa at the outer surface, giving ~40 safety factor for normal 250 grade steel. Still not a risk, but significantly smaller safety factor than what you said.</p>
<p>Bearing pressure / compressive yielding is the other issue - 200MPa bearing pressure will come close to yielding grade 250 steel. I'm not sure of the exact failure mechanism but maybe tearing at the corners of the cube.</p></div>		</li>
