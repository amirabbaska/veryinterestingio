			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m surprised your answer didn’t get more votes. That’s the correct answer. Further more, SMSC’s retry mechanism is not meant to be very frequent. There is an interface between the home location register to the SMSC, so when a mobile come online, it’s status is updated in the home location register (through radio towers and a bunch of servers) which triggers a check to grab any unread messages. That’s why when you turn on your phone you’ll get all your messages at once.</p>
<p>But nowadays (I think due to the amount of SMS being used) the duration for keeping unread messages on the server is getting shorter and shorter. One of the major carrier we work with has set it to 3 days only. That means if you forgot to turn your phone on for more than 3 days you’ll lose some SMS forever.</p></div>		</li>
