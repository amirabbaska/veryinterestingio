			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied pulp and paper technology for a year in college when I thought I wanted to work in a paper mill and this is the correct answer. It sounds like some municipalities are either having them sorted out at a facility or are doing something else with the cardboard recycling. The city I'm currently living in just accepts them along with other cardboard at the transfer station so I'm not sure what they're doing with it all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, that sounds ridiculous but I really don't have any way of proving you wrong i guess.  Who dreams of going to college to work in a paper mill?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The places that would be picky enough not to be able to use that stuff don't buy from recycling centers though. </p>
<p>It's almost exclusively mills that make tubeboard and edgeboard that buy it, and even then we have other clean suppliers and have various mixes to ensure the pulp will have the right properties for the grade of paper we're making.  </p>
<p>Also, the paper isn't dried until it's already formed into a sheet.</p></div>		</li>
