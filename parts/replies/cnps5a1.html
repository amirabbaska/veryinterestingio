			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of interest, why do you work a 24 hour shift? I can understand your job requires 24 hour coverage but most industries do that with a day shift and a night shift. You would imagine having someone work for 24 hours is quite inefficient as for a good part of that they're going to be over tired, and in a skilled profession like yours that can't be a good thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in our city, staffing plays a part.  With 3 rotating shifts all working 24 hours on and 48 hours off, you can get by with fewer workers, saving the city money.  Also Firefighting/EMS have some strong traditions, one being a 24 hour shift.</p>
<p>Its not all bad though, having 2 free days to accomplish whatever needs to be done is really nice.</p>
<p>And you are correct, patient care and competency do take a hit with the lack of sleep.  We are taught though to double check and triple check with our partners medication doses, procedures and what not.  However, mistakes do happen unfortunately.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does working 1/3 of a 72 hour cycle differ from working 1/3 of a 24 hour cycle in terms of staffing?  I can't imagine many health experts would suggest that 24 hours of continuous work is a positive thing relative to physical and mental health. Are there any statistics comparing EMT performance during the 1st hour of their shift and their 24th?  I can't imagine the 24th hour would be the best. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An important thing to understand is that during these 24hr shifts, we (paramedics/firefighters/EMTS)  are allowed to sleep during typical sleeping hours. Now you may not get to sleep for a solid 8 or 9 hours every night, but its pretty rare where we go a whole shift without some sleep or nap. If we do get a night without rest, at least we have 2 days off to recuperate. In a normal 8-10 hour shift setup, you may not be able to rest well enough if you really get jammed up with calls. </p>
<p>Its more common(but not a rule)  to see 24 hour shifts in areas with less call volume, usually rural areas. Here you can ALMOST be guaranteed a decent nights sleep 9 out of 10 shifts due to the low amount of calls. In more urban areas, or at least city centers, you'll see shorter 10 to 12 hour shifts due to the high call volume and need for fresh and rested crews.</p>
<p>Now for the tradition everyone keeps mentioning. Its no secret that those in this line of work get paid shit, so for many years, firefighters have picked up second jobs, usually something like plumbing or electrical work that they do on their own on their days off. With a 24/48 schedule, they can work their second job on a full day instead of cramming it in between a 12 or 16 hour break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my understanding, the reason is that changing shifts 3 times a day can cause more consistency issues as it relates to answering calls.  </p>
<p>If the shifts were 8-4, 4-12, and 12-8, that leaves for 3 times a day where one of the firemen may be late, where there is small chitchat between the passing shifts, and also 3 times a day where there could be a call right at one of those junctions.  </p>
<p>So if a call comes in at 3:59 before the 4pm shift is ready to go, then the first shift gets a dramatically longer shift.</p>
<Edit>  People are funny.  My post is just food for thought of the logic that likely went on when they were originally discussing having 24/48 time schedules.  I never stated anything for fact, nor do I pretend to know everything.  Of course the 3:59 thing is over exaggerated.... It was meant for conceptual example giving....  Yowzers</div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a police dispatch.  Your understanding is a little dramatic.  </p>
<p>We had 12 hour shifts on a two week rotation.  Two days on, Two days off, Three days on, then reversed.  Two off, Two on Three off.  The switch happened at 7:00 Am and PM.  You weren't late to switch over as your shift technically started at 6:45 for a squad meeting before the switch over.  So even if you were running 10 minutes late to work that day, you were still good for the switch over (though trouble with your boss because you probably missed the meeting).  On top of that, the squad would be staffed enough that people could take rotating breaks.  So even if one or two people were out first thing on a shift, we could still relieve the previous squad.  When the late people got in, we would then start rotating the breaks.</p>
<p>Now as for the actual deputies on the road.  They had THREE 12 hours shifts.  One from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM, one from 3 PM to 3 AM and one from 7 PM to 7 AM.  Not to mention, there were plenty of non zone'd deputies that would work various other schedules that were out and about and could assist in an emergency.  Needless to say, there was plenty of overlap!  In your example, if a call were to come in at 5:58 PM, just before first shift was about to go home for the night, it would simply go to someone on shift 2.  If someone on Shift 1 was tied up and going to be a while, someone on shift 2 would come in to take over.  If need be, we could get a non-zoned unit to respond (for instance a K-9 or Traffic unit). It really wasn't a big deal at all and the deputies would either comp out or get paid overtime if they did for some reason work overtime.  The crappy part is that it would typically be at the end of the work week when the comping would happen which means sometimes Sunday's early morning/overnight would be a little sparse.  But in the greater scheme of things, one or two less deputies on the road for an hour or two doesn't make a big difference on a Sunday.</p>
<p>Now, I assume that EMS and Fire work differently, but the point is that they could easily call it a 24 hour shift and actually be a 24.5 hour shift (minus a 30 minute break somewhere in the middle) to include times for switch over, and different people could start at different times to induce needed overlaps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UK Police officer here. I realise the US operates differently, but the 3:59pm thing surely is over-exaggerated!</p>
<p>In the UK, our shift patterns are:</p>
<p>1 block of Dayshift: 7am to 5pm. These are 3 / 4 days of this.</p>
<p>2 / 3 days off depending on the length of the shift block (2 days off for 3 days on, 3 days off for 4 days on).</p>
<p>1 block of Nightshift: 10pm - 7am. 3 / 4 days of this with 2 / 3 days off. USUALLY we get 3 days off no matter what because nightshift.</p>
<p>1 block of Backshift: 2pm - midnight or 5pm - 3am if it is a Friday / Saturday to accommodate for pubs and clubs and drunk people. Followed by 2 / 3 days off.</p>
<p>Those are the 'official' shift times (for my constabulary), but we have our 'parade' at 6:30am for dayshift, 1:30pm for backshift, and 9:30pm for nightshift. This is so that we can pick up any jobs that come in from 6:45am, 1:45pm, or 9:45pm so that the shift who are leaving don't have to get tied up. This is also to provide an overlap so that there is NO time when there are no police on the streets - criminals realised in the past that there was a period of zero police presence during shift changes, so we sorted that out. We also have 'drop backs' where a few officers will operate on a completely different time to the rest for that block such as a 6pm - 3am so that there is absolutely no chance that there's nobody out and about.</p>
<p>This does mean, however, that my body clock is always being fucked about. Monday to Thursday I could be working 6:30am to 5pm (I hate dayshift) then the Monday following I'm suddenly a 9:30pm start. Then Saturday I'm a 5pm start. Then Wednesday I'm a 6:30am start... your body gets thrown out of whack constantly.</p>
<p>This leads to some major health issues such as sleep deprivation, dietary issues, insomnia... a shitload of problems. I combat mine through meals - dayshift I'll have a big breakfast, a good lunch, and a small dinner. Backshift I'll have a small breakfast, big lunch, decent dinner. Nightshift I'll eat a big dinner before going to work, a salad at about 3am, and nothing after that. Doing this keeps my body in a decent rhythm for food, and makes sure my metabolism is operating at least on something steady and routine even though my body isn't. It means I can sleep well after nightshift, I go to bed and get up at the right time on dayshift, and I have enough energy to chase after drunken idiots on backshift.</p>
<p>On backshift Friday and Saturday I'll have a hearty meal before going out on foot in the city centre, its more of a family meal thing at the station, it's really nice - usually one or two of the better chefs on the shift will do a meal for everyone!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if it's the same idea with paramedics but my friend who is an ER doctor in NYC says their hours are so long because a huge percentage of mistakes happen when you pass the patient to someone else, so long shifts cut down on that. Again, may not work with paramedics but maybe that is part of the thought process. You bring someone in and need to be available to give any relevant information down the line perhaps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EMT here. I'm not sure if this varies by state, but when we bring a patient to the ER we pass along all the info we have and that usually finishes our care with that patient. Say we get to the ER and there are no beds available, we have to actually wait with the patient until one opens up. If we were to just leave them before properly transferring them then it's considered abandonment.</p>
<p>This is especially an issue right now because as of late the hospitals around here have been extremely overcrowded (maybe new insurance kicking in?) and as a result we end up with several units out of service because they're all on bed delay :( And this could be hours, I'm not sure what the longest bed delay is but I knew one person who had to wait almost 8 hours for a bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I get that (I used to work 3 14 hour shifts a week, all in a row), I'm much happier not being a damn zombie for three or four days. </p>
<p>And really, your day before a 24h is neutered as fuck, as you're trying to sleep as much as you can, and the day after you're a total zombie. Two shifts a week can cost you 6 days. </p>
<p>It might work for some people, but certainly not for me. Not to mention the ever not-so-subtle physical and emotional changes that comes with crazy shift work.
After working the Monday to Friday grind, I've come to appreciate it. Easier on me, easier on the family. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stay up 24 hours straight on a regular basis for no reason at all. I take night classes so my schedule is already pretty backwards. But for the most part I spend all night and day playing games and watching movies. It has gotten to the point where staying awake 24 hours is just normal. As soon as I start getting that weird euphoric feeling of exhaustion there is no better sleep in the world. Your last bit about the .10 BAC is spot on. That's pretty much exactly what it feels like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha, I do something similar. I typically sleep 2-3 hours, stay up for 36ish hours, then sleep for 6-7 hours of amazing sleep. Then that night I get 2-3 hours of sleep, rinse, repeat. </p>
<p>It happened after I lost my last job. Unlike a lot of people, depression doesn't drive me to sleep. When I'm really depressed, I <em>can't</em> sleep. </p>
<p>Now I work night-shift (fucking love it), so I usually work two shifts before I sleep. </p>
<p>I love that euphoric, lack of sleep, feeling. Makes work go by super quick. And there's no better feeling than eating a nice breakfast and passing out from exhaustion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From experience, I advise you to stop doing this for two reasons. Firstly, there will come a time when you are getting to that 'euphoric' stage, but then there's some emergency or other event that forces you to stay awake. Having to stay awake at that point can cause brain damage. The second problem is that eventually you stop feeling tired and it becomes harder to get good sleep. Whether or not this is a bad thing I don't know, but I would advise taking some cognitive tests as a benchmark before regularly depriving yourself of sleep.</p></div>		</li>
