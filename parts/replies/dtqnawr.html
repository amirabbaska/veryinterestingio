			<div class="markdown"><p>Apple juice is more acidic than carbonated drinks, yet pretty much everyone can chug juice without pain. It's not the acid present in the drink that creates the pain, it's caused by enzymes that convert dissolved CO2 to H2CO3 on contact, lowering the pH of mucous surfaces beyond the pH of the drink itself. It's also why you feel pain when burping thru your nose. There are even medications which block these enzymes, causing fresh carbonated drinks to feel flat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Super interested to know if it was my medicine doing that, and thanks for sharing!</p></div>		</li>
