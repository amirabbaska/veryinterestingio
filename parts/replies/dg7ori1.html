			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, WWII was heavily filmed and documented. Korea, not so much; the &quot;Fate of the Free World&quot; did not hinge on Korea like in WWII. Neither of these wars were televised though. Vietnam brought the atrocities of war into the American living room. So while it did not have the same impact as WWII, Vietnam footage was broadcast daily to the public, and by then TVs had become a common household appliance. TVs were not in as many homes during Korea, otherwise it might have been covered the same way.</p></div>		</li>
