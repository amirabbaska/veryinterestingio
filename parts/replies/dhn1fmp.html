			<div class="markdown"><p>no, AI is just better than most other ATC realize. its not like there is an automatic system ready to be deployed right now, but one COULD be developed, and it would be better than us. The job can be hard, intensely hard on bad days, but I think an AI could be trained to keep air traffic separated without incident, but it'd be whole hell of a lot easier if it also flew the planes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>Source: I'm a controller. 80-90% of what we do can absolutely be automated. A lot of the folks in here are being a bit over the top, or just speaking out of genuine ignorance about the current and near-future capabilities of automation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. The assumption I believe I see here is that you are not addressing machines to have any problems. If planes flew in a vacuum then I'd say you're very correct. But they don't. And as long as we use them for transport and utility,  we have to deal with anomalies that are out of a current machine's role. </p>
<p>We can go with prop strike, loss of electricity to navigation, vertical rising air, icing of instruments leading to failure, fire due to electrical short due to in flight entertainment displays, severe gust loads upon landing, wind shear 50 feet above ground...</p>
<p>Do these sound like pilot errors? Cause these have all killed people. The FARs are written in blood. For every Harrison Ford there are a 1000 other problems that happen everyday that pilots deal with. And guess what? Crazier shot is gonna happen before we let planes go solo with even one soul onboard, let alone hundreds.</p>
<p>Hell. The flap gauge on my school's Cessna 172 is busted. Can you guess how quick it would throw itself into the ground if it didn't have a human sit back and say, &quot;you know this gauge is busted. I'm not gonna trust it because it doesn't match my airspeed gauge. I've got a gut feeling here..&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, humans are so good because they can formulate a null hypothesis which does solve a problem. Can you truly build a computer that can encompass all logic and prove all math?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope it won't prove all math, I only have to build it to fail less than humans and unmanned drones already do this more reliably than humans both on the ground and in the air. Go look up the numbers for how often mechanical failure is the cause of an air crash compared with human error. FAA says that for commercial flights it's 80% human error and that most of the mechanical failures are due to lack of maintenance which is more human error. That's not a high mark to be able to lower the number of accidents by more than half. Just take the human out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I think of it as the same reason we cant write software for a robot to play a videogame. Too complex. </p></div>		</li>
