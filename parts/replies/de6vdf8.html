			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very true. I work in a convenience store in the downtown area where I live and it happens to be a hot spot for the homeless, hookers and drugs, especially meth. We are the only shop in the area that sell these &quot;incense burners&quot; but what they really are, is meth pipes or &quot;globe pipes&quot;.
People from all walks of life come in and buy those and they either never look me in the eye or look ashamed and don't want anybody seeing them buy it. That or they start telling me it's for a friend or other excuses. Sometimes I feel like everyone is doing it. I'll get the regular homeless meth head, a clean cut lawyer or probably a public attorney and many construction guys seem to do it regularly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those pipes are also the best way to consume DMT so there's a chance some of them may have just been trippers. </p>
<p>Also crack. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also sell crack pipes. They are sold and marketed as &quot;love roses&quot;, its a glass stem about 3 1/2 inches long and inside it has a tiny plastic rose but you just pull that out and its a crack pipe or dmt pipe. They usually buy the copper brillo along with a love rose. I have a buddy who produced DMT and i smoked it a few times, a glass stem with brillo is better than a globe pipe (for powder formulation) because it allows full consumption and leaves less residue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be careful man... One of my close friends did that.  He eventually fell off and ended up being a degenerate,  he tried rehab multiple times after ODing a few times.  He was clean for a few months and his heroin friend lost her bf to a motorcycle accident.  He ended up with the monkry back on his back street hanging with her for a while, ODed and never came back.  So sad, he was a good friend.  I suspect he got some fentanyl, didn't realize it, and improperly dosed.</p>
<p>It's all fun and games until you lose control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the shit that scares me. I wouldn't be against trying shit, but you just don't know what you're getting. All I've ever done is smoked some week and drank. Was around other stuff but never trusted that it was what they said it was. Beyond that, it's easy to lose count of how much you've had. Kid down the road just OD'd on pain pills, 22 years old. Only child of a farmer, had a 500 acre beef farm that his dad was giving him. Story I heard is that they didn't realize just how many pills he had taken that night until after he was in the hospital and they looked at how many were left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been curious about the experience, but with everything we know about the adverse affects... There's the potential of death, sure, but that doesn't even strike me as the worst potential outcome. The way drugs can mess you up for life if you're unlucky is what has made me stay very far away from it all. It only takes one time, and my curiosity isn't greater than my fear by a long shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great post. I used heroine regularly IV for about 4 or 5 years (some in between rehabs) and easily looked 10 years older simply bc I didn't take care of myself on any level. I finally managed to kick it and have over 5 years clean, eat right, gym regular, etc and now people don't believe I'm my age, I look at least 5 years younger. In cases like that it seems the aged look is a product of complete health and hygiene neglect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Second OP original comment. The lifestyle does far more damage to physical appearance than the drugs. Plenty of Hollywood celebs w habits (the guy from glee Cory Matheson or whatever, heath ledger come to mind).</p>
<p>I know a heroin addict that dated a girl for almost 3 years, lived with her for 1 and she had no idea. There are people that make enough money to afford their habit, food, and housing and take care of themselves to the point where no one has a clue.</p></div>		</li>
