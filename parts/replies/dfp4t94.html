			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. There'sâ€‹ a whole field of research devoted to HERV as mentioned above. Specifically, the bits on the env gene which is expressed during the differentiation of trophoblasts actually indicate some very important contribution to the syncytium formation.</p>
<p>Source: worked in a lab that does HERV genetics. These genes are expressed mainly in the first 8-21 days of trophoblasts differentiation. Then they start to be silenced (very quickly). Very interesting things to look at. And quite speculative. All the best for your microbiology degree!</p></div>		</li>
