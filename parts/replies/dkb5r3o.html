<p>where bubbles of dissolved gas can precipitate out of solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not completely correct, because the &quot;nucleation sites&quot; themselves are bubbles: small air pockets trapped in surface-scratches and microscopic fractures.   In other words, no <em>bubbles</em> have to precipitate out.   Instead, <em>dissolved gas</em> can leave the liquid surface and enter the bubble-seed, causing the existing bubble to inflate.</p>
<p>Think: the nucleation site for crystal growth isn't mysterious.  It just provides a liquid-solid interface in the form of a tiny crystal, a &quot;seed.&quot;  The &quot;nucleation site&quot; for bubble growth is no more mysterious.  It's an air-liquid interface: a microscopic trapped bubble.  The bubble resides in a tiny cave, or sometimes trapped in a speck of dried gunk.</p>
<p>In chemistry we quickly find that boiling chips only work once.  &quot;Used&quot; chips won't work.   That's because after cooling, their steam-filled micro-bubble air pockets contract to nothing.  They will work again if thoroughly dried out, or if heated well above 100C (bake in a glassware oven.)</p>
<p>Knowing this, some mysteries are solved.  For example, the bubble-sites on beer glasses persist, and will still produce bubble-streams no matter how much we scrub them.  The only way to remove them is to get rid of the trapped bubble (fill up the micro-fracture up with liquid, etc.)   Yet this doesn't apply to boiling chips and hot glassware.  That's because the tiny fractures in hot glassware aren't filled with CO2.  They're filled with live steam, and any original air had diffused away into the stream of steam-bubbles.  When cooled, the steam-pocket contracts to zero vollumne, filling the micro-fracture with water.  Boil it again, while the clefts are still filled with water, and the former &quot;nucleation sites&quot; stop working.   Baking it dry restores the air to the tiny pocket.</p>

<p>Even with no air trapped, nucleation is more likely to happen in cracks and crevices though, because of the lower air-liquid surface created and thus the lower surface energy associated with it, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But &quot;no air trapped&quot; is unlikely.</p>
<p>When a container is suddenly filled, the advancing wave of liquid could only invade a crevice if the surface was extremely hydrophylic, and the growing water film would force the usual bubble to depart.   To observe true nucleation effects, all trapped microbubbles would first have to be cleared out, by thorough boiling followed by full cooling.  (That's what &quot;kills&quot; boiling chips.  The porous rough chips won't &quot;nucleate&quot; unless their internal pores contain air pockets.)</p>
<p>You'd be right for extremely superheated liquids.   Probably the boiling-explosions in microwave ovens are caused by crevice-nucleation.  (Or, perhaps an air pocket within a surface-scratch eventually heats to 100C, expands and launches a bubble, which then hits the 130C water outside the boundary layer.  Heh, or maybe it's a cosmic-ray strike, as with liquid hydrogen bubble chambers.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen glasses that have no apparent nucleation sites. I'm not sure if this is due to uncleanliness or what. But it is terribly weird, no bubbles coming up unless you agitate it. But still has full carbonation in the mouth, I don't like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, but also it's losing significant CO2 from the top surface (like one giant bubble.)  A narrow-neck bottle would be better, so the area of fluid contact with the atmosphere is small.</p>
<p>Better: a glass bottle which has been used to boil water in a microwave, then cooled.  All of its gas pockets will be filled.  Don't let it dry out, instead fill it with cola.</p>
<p>Also, that's the recipe for producing violent explosions of superheated water in microwave ovens.  With no gas pockets, the temperature easily passes 130C (monitored with an IR meter,) rising constantly until something sets it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome! So basically a small defect or particle allows the formation of dissolved CO2 to break hydration and begin diffusing out of solution. I assume then once gas breaks out of solution at this point it kind of starts a chain reaction where it just keeps going. Maybe following some kind of gradient caused by the previous bubble or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the defect just allow the carbon dioxide to accumulate, without re-dissolving. When the bubble gets big enough, it dettaches and floats. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the nucleation has already been explain by other posters, I thought I might provide some more information as too the importance of bubbles.</p>
<p>Next time you are at a pub and order a schooner/pint of beer check out the bottom of the glass. Chances are it has some sort of etching on the bottom on the inside of the glass. Either of a logo (if the pub is fancy, or the beer has a branded glass) or just a simple crisscross grid of lines which provide the nucleation sites.</p>
<p>Both serve the same purpose to make your beer appear more carbonated and to maintain he appearance of the head on the beer as you drink it which <a href="http://sci-hub.io/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2002.tb08801.x" target="_blank">according to research</a> is one of the most important visual cues that influence consumers perception of quality.</p>
<p>Also further side note there are quite a few papers out there on beer bubbles. Which really pleases me.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting story = this past winter I got in my car in subzero temoperatures, grabbed an unopened bottle of water, and drank it - it was extremely cold. I looked down and the water in the bottle had frozen instantly. The water was super-cooled and could not turn into ice because the inside of the water bottle was perfectly smooth - no scratches to serve as a nucleation site. I grabbed another unopened bottle, gave it a shake and bam! Froze solid right before my eyes. Pressure waves, including sound waves, can act as nucleation &quot;sites&quot; if the water is cold enough. I think the world record for low temperature for liquid water is minus 7-9 degrees C.</p>
<p>Anyway I told my sons to come outside. Minds were blown that morning.</p></div>		</li>
