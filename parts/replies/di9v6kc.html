			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that it was a design flaw with the batteries and their internal structure which led to short circuits. It wasn't a failure of the chargers, but rather the batteries themselves and either a quality control problem with the supplier or just a flat out flaw in the design.</p>
<p>Edit: I found <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-note-7-return-exchange-faq/" target="_blank">this</a> which not only explains why the batteries were failing but also has a pretty nice diagram of the internal structure of a LiOn battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultracapacitors, whenever they are going to be perfected, are going to be able to take a near-instant charge, because they are essentially just capacitors and hence do not rely on chemistry.</p>
<p>Even then, there might be practical limits to what &quot;instant charge&quot; really means. Let's say you're aiming for 2000 mAh capacity, which is rather common these days for smartphones. That means your battery or capacitor can deliver, on average, about 2000 mA (or 2 A) of current for 1 hour (or 3600 seconds) before expiring.</p>
<p>Assuming a lot of simplifying hypotheses, that's equivalent to 20 A for 360 seconds. Or 200 A for 36 seconds.</p>
<p>But charging is the opposite of discharging. So, to charge that thing, you'd need to provide it with 200 A of charge current for 36 seconds.</p>
<p>200 A is <em>a heck of a lot</em> of current. It's what my TIG welder does. Have you seen the cables coming out of a welder? That's what you need to safely run 200 A to your phone. Multiply that by, say, 5 V, and it's 1 kW of power. Your &quot;phone charger&quot; now looks about as bulky as a TIG welder.</p>
<p>And then, of course, there's the issue of having cables inside the phone that can withstand 200 A, which is going to be extremely tricky at least. Maybe just expose the capacitor's plates directly on the outside shell.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, even when ultracapacitors will finally become a reality, you should probably not expect instant charge, or at least not any time soon. It's a pretty difficult thing to do, because, frankly, it's a big chunk of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why not have a charging station which holds a supercapacitor, and your phone which holds a supercapacitor, touch the two together to have one discharge into the other? The charging station can then recharge its internal supercapacitor more slowly, until the next 'instant charge' is needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just ignore all the mentions of capacitors in here. There are several distinct differences between batteries and capacitors. A super capacitor will still not be very useful in a phone. </p>
<p>What you really want is something like a carbon - carbon battery. Because the charging and discharging reactions of this chemistry do not produce heat, they can be charged much much faster. Unfortunately that technology has not left the lab yet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What would be useful is a hybrid cap/battery. Supercharge the cap, and have it charge the main battery over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fast chargers use the same electronics as mentioned before to prevent heat build up and overcharging. They are capable of delivering higher doses of amperage but are still limited if the battery says it's getting too hot.</p>
<p>Basically, fast chargers have the <em>capability</em> to charge faster, but are still limited by the battery. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The battery is only one limiting factor, and with modern phones and batteries the real limitation is the USB specification. USB provides 5 volts of power at up to 500mA normally; multiplying these together, you get a charge rate of 2.5W max. Now, plenty of chargers and phones bend the rules, and can get up to about 2.1A, for around 10W, but that's about the limit - higher than that and the resistance of the USB cable's wires becomes a real issue.</p>
<p>To work around this, some fast chargers support negotiating with the phone to provide a higher <em>voltage</em> - often 9, 12, or 15 volts. This causes a corresponding increase in power delivered, as you can still run the same 2.1A but you're multiplying by a higher voltage; however it requires more expensive and complex circuits on both the phone and charger to handle the higher (and variable) voltage.</p>
<p>Note that in all cases the phone is in charge of how much power it's actually consuming - the adapter merely sets the upper limit. If your battery is heating up, the phone will reduce charge rate, and likewise will reduce charge rate, often quite dramatically, when the battery is either nearly empty or nearly full to reduce stress on the battery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the phone chargers you see are 5V@2A because the standard micro usb connectors are only rated up to 2A per pin. The li-ion batteries inside the cell phones are capable of charging at higher currents than that. But if you aren't able to increase the current to get more power, the only other option you have is to increase the voltage. </p>
<p>The Samsung charger in the link is capable of 5V@2A(10W) or 9V @1.67A(15W). The current is still under the 2A rating of the connector, but we're able to deliver 5 more watts to the phone to charge the batteries that much faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what about a capacitor? I don't know much about them, but from what I understand, they actually do hold electricity rather than using a chemical reaction. </p>
<p>So is it right to say that a capacitor could be (or is) charged almost instantly? </p>
<p>Also, how big of a charge could a capacitor potentially hold on paper? Are they limited to short bursts of energy or could they be built up to hold the capacity of a battery?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Capacitors can't hold much charge like a battery can. You would need a capacitor the size of your microwave to hold the charge in your phone. </p>
<p>Capacitors also drop in voltage linearly to the current. Li-ion batteries go from 3.7 to 3.5 through their entire discharge cycle. </p>
<p>That being said, what capacitors are good at is charging and discharging very quickly. They just don't hold much energy when they do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The most common type of lithium-ion goes from 4.2v down to 3.0v... in applications that really squeeze every drop of capacity, the range can extend towards 4.3v down to 2.8v or even lower... at the expense of long-term battery life.</p>
<p>The range is big enough it's a major engineering concern, if you want high efficiency and full performance throughout the charge cycle.</p>
<p>However, you're correct that this is wayyyy easier to deal with than a capacitor which has significant energy remaining down to 0v. As you get anywhere close to that, say 1v or lower, it's extremely hard to use or convert that voltage up to something useful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to what others have said, I think it's easy to see in a <a href="http://berc.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Supercapacitors_chart.png" target="_blank">graph</a>.  Energy density is just the total amount of energy held, where power density is a measure of how quickly you can deliver that energy.  They each have different uses but don't have a great amount of overlap unfortunately.  The dream is to make a supercapacitor that has comparable energy density, but it requires a great dielectric (which ensures the charge stays separated so you can use it) and a porous material to get the most amount of surface area in the smallest volume to be useful.</p>
<p>Ultracapacitors are getting there, but you'll notice the graph is logarithmic so there's still a long way to go.</p></div>		</li>
