			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where I got confused for a long time. I had heard &quot;quark&quot; used to describe elementary particles.</p>
<p>Quarks are elementary particles, but not all elementary particles are quarks. Like squares and rectangles. Electrons being another type of rectangle, different from quarks (to abuse the metaphor I'm working with).</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<p>Also, is &quot;fundamental particle&quot; a different word from &quot;elementary particle&quot;? I feel like I hear those used interchangeably. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Fundamental and Elementary are referring to the same thing here: the basic building blocks of literally everything. </p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/75MefeW.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/75MefeW.png</a></p>
<p>Everything in that image is an &quot;elementary particle&quot;. (Anti-matter has anti- versions of all of the fermions (the quarks and leptons).) All normal matter is up and down quarks and electrons (with gluons and photons and z/w bosons gluing everything together with the strong nuclear, electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces respectively).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Within the standard model, assuming we are discussing only the &quot;matter&quot; particles (fermions), you can define quarks as those elementary particles that experience the strong force, and leptons as those which don't. Both quarks and leptons experience the electro-weak force and gravity as well, so the strong force being constrained to quarks is a distinguishing feature.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/cm/lb/7864318/data/standard-model-of-physics-data.jpg" target="_blank">Here's an image with the elementary particles we've observed so far.</a> They're sorted into their own groups.  Electrons and quarks are different, as you can see, despite the fact that they're both a type of fermion (particles with half-integer spin, e.g. 1/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc., that obey the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle" target="_blank">Pauli exclusion principle.</a>) Side note: You don't see any fermions with spin greater than 1/2 on the list of elementary particles because only composite particles made up of multiple fermions have half-integer spin greater than one-half. (Fun fact: a helium-3 nucleus, a neutron and 2 protons, is a composite fermion while a helium-4 nucleus, 2 protons and 2 neutrons, is a boson (integer spin, e.g. 0, 1, 2, etc., don't have to obey Pauli exclusion) since protons and neutrons each have spin +- 1/2 )</p>
<p>Quarks are always part of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement" target="_blank">color neutral</a> combination. Either red, blue and green all together or red-antired, green-antigreen, or blue-antiblue. (Don't let the name fool you, color charge doesn't have anything to do with actual colors as we know them, it's just a name.) They cannot exist outside of color-neutral combinations. Any energy that goes towards pulling quarks apart going into making new quarks to pair with the quarks that are being separated, resulting in 2 color-neutral pairs the instant the original 2 are split. Electrons do not have this constraint. Electrons are just their own thing entirely.</p>
<p>Interactions between quarks are governed almost entirely by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction" target="_blank">strong force</a> (mediated by gluons, the vector bosons that are the force carrier for the strong force.) They are affected by all forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces), but the strong force many many orders of magnitude larger at the scale quarks are at (Wikipedia puts it well: &quot; At the range of 10^(−15) m (1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtometer" target="_blank">femtometer</a>), the strong force is approximately 137 times as strong as electromagnetism, a million times as strong as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction" target="_blank">weak interaction</a>, and 10^(38) times as strong as gravitation. &quot; from the strong interaction page linked above.) The strong force is the interactions between particles with color charge (just like the electromagnetic force is the interactions between two particles with electric charge). Things without color charge don't participate in strong interactions.</p>
<p>Electrons are only affected by the electromagnetic, weak, and gravitational forces, though electromagnetic forces greatly dominate the vast majority of their interactions.</p>
<p>This is a lot more information than you asked for, but I hope it helps.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Both He-4 and He-3 exhibit superfluid properties, but He-4 does it at much higher temperatures than He-3. He-3 pairs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_pair" target="_blank">with itself</a> to form a boson which then exhibits the properties, but He-4 is already there, so it can do it at much higher temperatures. ( 2.172 K for He-4 vs 2.491 mK for He-3). He-3 is much much more interesting than He-4, imo. I could rave forever, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-3#Cryogenics" target="_blank">this section of the He-3 wiki</a> does a good job of telling how neat it is.</p></div>		</li>
