			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a genetics tutor I had talking about this. Someone had asked him some speculative question about organisms in higher radiation environments and whether they'd evolve faster and his answer was along the lines of &quot;.... probably not, organisms seem to be able to dial up or down their DNA repair mechanisms to an almost arbitrary extent, there seems to be some happy-medium mutation rate that organisms tend towards&quot;</p>
<p>Even humans living in areas with very high natural background radiation appear to respond differently to radiation exposure:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11769138" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11769138</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>People in some areas of Ramsar, a city in northern Iran, receive an annual radiation absorbed dose from background radiation that is up to 260 mSv y(-1), substantially higher than the 20 mSv y(-1) that is permitted for radiation workers. Inhabitants of Ramsar have lived for many generations in these high background areas. Cytogenetic studies show no significant differences between people in the high background compared to people in normal background areas. An in vitro challenge dose of 1.5 Gy of gamma rays was administered to the lymphocytes, which showed significantly reduced frequency for chromosome aberrations of people living in high background compared to those in normal background areas in and near Ramsar. <strong>Specifically, inhabitants of high background radiation areas had about 56% the average number of induced chromosomal abnormalities of normal background radiation area inhabitants following this exposure.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are organisms that were found living inside a running nuclear reactor, extremely radioresistant and capable of using some kind of melanin-like compound to harvest energy from the radiation. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermococcus_gammatolerans" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermococcus_gammatolerans</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While a dose of 5 Gy is sufficient to kill a human, and a dose of 60 Gy is able to kill all cells in a colony of E. coli, Thermococcus gammatolerans can withstand doses of up to 30,000 Gy, and an instantaneous dose of up to 5,000 Gy with no loss of viability. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>(on a related note there's at least one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermophile" target="_blank">hyperthermophile</a> bacteria that can not only survive autoclave themperatures but can reproduce while the autoclave is still running. )</p>
<blockquote>
<p>able to double its population during 24 hours in an autoclave at 121 °C </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly radiation exposure in deep space is 500 to 1000 mSv / year.  It blows me away that we have people living, apparently unharmed at half to a forth of that.  We might someday be able to genetically engineer ourselves to be more resistant to radiation to become a true space-faring species.  That's amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation can be measured in a lot of different ways, especially when measuring its effects on things. Radioactive materials both emit some level of radiation as well as decay at some rate, living organisms have a tolerance for both a momentary dose of radiation as well as accumulating radiation over time, and  there's different wavelengths to work with too.</p>
<p>For different reasons, but to a similar effect, electricity has a ton of units too. Because of all the ways it can affect other things and be affected, and how different properties of it will be responsible for different effects, it's impractical to measure it by just one or two units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic difference is between physics and biology.
And there are different standards, like between Centigrade and Fahrenheit for temperature.</p>
<p>Physical units:</p>
<p>The original unit was the roentgen, which measured ionization in air of x-rays = 2.58×10e−4 Coulombs/kg. It's now obsolete.</p>
<p>1 rad is physical, defined as 100 ergs deposited per gram in CGS units. In animal tissue, it's about 1.04 Roentgens</p>
<p>The SI (International System, more common in Europe)) preferred to measure the same thing as Joules/Kg, and called it the Gray, which is equivalent to 100 rads.</p>
<p>But more relevant for biology:</p>
<p>Different kinds and energies of radiation (eg alpha, beta, and gamma rays) can have very different effects, mainly related to density of ionization.</p>
<p>So they defined the rem, (roentgen equivalent man) as the dose of any kind of radiation that will give about the same biological effect as 1 rad of x or gamma rays. Each kind of radiation has a conversion factor from rads to rem called the RBE (Relative Biological Effectiveness) </p>
<p>And the SI unit for that is called the Sievert, which = 100 rem.</p>
<p>Other units are used just to describe how active  radioactive isotopes are:</p>
<p>the curie (Ci) is 3.7×10e10 decays/second, but the SI system defined the  becquerel (Bq) as 1 decay/second , so they're usually talking about Giga Bequrels (GBq)</p>
<p>Eventually they ran out of dead physicists to name things after, so they quit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, it's tempting to think the presence of a chitinous exoskeleton might have some influence too. Alas, I've failed to find any evidence to support the claim. If anything, according to <a href="https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/Publications/PDF/P1731_web.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> sourced from <a href="https://inis.iaea.org/search/searchsinglerecord.aspx?recordsFor=SingleRecord&amp;RN=26023735" target="_blank">here</a>, marine invertebrate chitin shells readily degrade under exposure to ionising radiation; though a contradictory claim by <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2FBF02515335.pdf" target="_blank">this material science paper</a> seems to suggest the material itself is quite resistant (in either case, structural resistance doesn't mean it blocks its passage, or anything). I'm a bit out of my depth on this, so haven't really a clue, sorry!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could degradation under exposure be beneficial?  Like ablative armor, it's absorbing the radiation so the living cells underneath don't.  Or does the chitin itself then become radioactive and then pass it inwards anyway?</p>
<p>Edit: Even if the chitin became radioactive, wouldn't half of the subsequent radiation be emitted outwards?  Seems like that would cut the radiation that reaches the inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering that the most common form of DNA-damaging radiation on Earth is ultraviolet light, and UV has very little penetration into biological tissue, it's quite plausible that a thin carapace would greatly mitigate DNA damage from the Sun.</p>
<p>That said, most of the strongly-ionizing radiation comes from cosmic sources or inhaled/ingested sources. Cosmic rays are very deeply penetrating and no realistic amount of biological tissue is going to block them. Inhaled and ingested sources deliver a dose from within, so skin/carapace thickness is irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both papers appear to be in vitro tests, so the presence of a carapace wouldn't matter. But a thicker outer shell would reduce exposure to radiation for internal cells, though given how small insects are, it probably wouldn't be by a lot.</p></div>		</li>
