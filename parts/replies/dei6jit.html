			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly the intuition that should be instilled. I'll use degrees because I think most people are more familiar with degrees than radians. You start on the ferris wheel at the very right (horizontally) and middle (vertically). We don't start at the bottom. We call this place on the right 0 degrees. Now the ferris wheel turns counterclockwise. If you got on at 0 degrees, and now it's turned 90 degrees counterclockwise, what's your vertical position, and what's your horizontal position? Well, you're now at the very top and horizontally centered. So sin(90 degrees) = 1 (that's the highest you can be) and cos(90 degrees) = 0 (right in the middle). If you keep turning to get to 180 degrees, you're at the left now. So sin(180 degrees) = 0, and cos(180 degrees) = -1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People might be more familiar with degrees than radians, but my opinion is that degrees are to radians what feet are to meters. Radians are just so much better for everything and so much easier to understand. Radians are so much more useful for engineering and physics calculations. And things like trig I think are easier with Radians. We should be teaching kids Radians from the start rather than try to convert them in high school after they've spent years learning degrees. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radians and degrees are not the same though. Feet and metres both measure length. However, the difference between degrees and radians exist at a far more &quot;basic&quot; level.  </p>
<p>Degrees measure the divergence of a point w.r.t another point, line or a plane. For example, how much rotation should be applied to your neck to view the top of a building is easier if measured in degrees. Because the divergence can be easily visualised.  </p>
<p>Radians on the other hand measure how much a point has travelled along the curve of a unit circle. It measures, in a way, the impact of a divergence. If the divergence is 180^o , then the point has travelled <strong>pi</strong> radians. It is useful in rotational dynamics, structural analysis etc when the effect of torque etc are studied. For example, a cylinder is given some fixed torque, how many times will it rotate,  can be better represented using radians because distance travelled along the circumference and the number of rotations are closely linked. Degrees on the other hand, measures divergence from the centre of the cylinder and therefore this measure has to be converted into a &quot;distance&quot; (hint : it's radians) in order to find the number of rotations.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently in my last year of high school, and it's only been since last year that we've been taught radians.</p>
<p>Objectively, I can see that radians are a better system, but I find it hard to actually work in radians due to the low amount of exposure to them, and the fact that I have to visualise a unit circle to try and convert fractions into a location rather than degrees which are easy to visualise the quadrants for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radians are better unless you are using them in a computer. Due to how computers handle numbers with decimal places you can get tounding errors and in some cases a completly wrong answer (cos of 90 degrees in radians put into sbcl is anexample of this)</p></div>		</li>

Specifically the first one is a nice visualisation of what you describe, with the sine motion in red, cosine in blue, and combined for circular motion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good intuition but it could be misleading if we don't put a bit of thought into it!</p>
<p>If we follow the example carelessly we may be brought to believe that since an angle of 45° is exactly halfway between 0° and 90° its sine and cosine should both be 0.5 (halfway between 0 and the maximum value)... but this isn't true, since they both evaluate to ~0.7 (1 over square root of 2).</p>
<p>This happens because we have to take into account that we are travelling aboard the Ferris wheel! This means that, starting at 0°, when the wheel starts turning we don't only travel upwards but also backwards. So, at the beginning we'll go up very fast, but when we'll reach 45° (at height 0.7) we'll start travelling more backwards than upwards, &quot;wasting&quot; the remaining 45° to cover just the last 0.3. The same happens with cosine, but reversed (the first 45° are slow, the last are fast).</p>
<p>Maybe this was already very obvious, but I thing it's an important point to be aware of!</p></div>		</li>
