			<div class="markdown"><p>Folding usually refers to protein structure; unlike DNA, whose function is <em>primarily</em> dictated by its sequence, most proteins get their function from the way they fold (their structure), which is a very complex process dependent on temperature, pH, salt concentration, interactions with other proteins, the presence of metal ions which act as cofactors, and probably 1000 other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is said that our DNA contains the latent genetic information for all of our past genetic ancestors, down to the lowliest of aquatic lifeforms... It holds to reason that with precise genetic manipulation/activation, some of those genes could be unlocked...</p>
<p>Gills anyone? I've always wanted gills...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sort of yes, but no, not really. DNA itself is slowly garbage collected.</p>
<p>It's a big book, and during the ages the language evolved too, so most of it is garbage. Eventually, when a mutation occurs that leaves out some garbage a tiny bit less resources are needed to copy the DNA, less chance of mutation on those bits, and so it eventually could get cut out. (Because if important parts get cut out, the embryo dies, or the adult will have problems reproducing because it won't find mates. Cruel, cruel thing that nature plays with her conscious social beings.)</p>
<p>That said, gills are probably doable, because we are very close to fish in evolutionary timescales, about 340 million years ago some tetrapods started to live on land and lose their gills. But the basics of animal planning started waay before that about 590 million years ago. And morphogenesis, the baisc techniques, DNA coding and so on are ~2 billion year old stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe for some small subset of genes...part of the problem for many genes, though, is that once they aren't expressed, there's little or no selective pressure to keep them in their current state. The gene sequence, which includes the sequence that directs regulation of the gene, then drifts due to random mutation. A cursory glance at the human genome shows a large number of so-called 'pseudogenes' which resemble human or ancestral genes, but have clearly been subject to random mutations over millions of years.</p>
<p>Also, there's no correlation between genome size and genetic complexity. Many plants have genomes much much bigger than humans, which would seem to suggest that minimizing genome size isn't potently selected for, and also doesn't dictate complexity.</p></div>		</li>
