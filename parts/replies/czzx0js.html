			<div class="markdown"><p>The latest measurements of the curvature of spacetime (planck mission from 2013) has measured spacetime to be as flat as is measurable. I don't see any good rational reason to assume anything else. Probably there are just a lot of people who are uncomfortable with the idea of infinite versions of them doing the most digusting porn imaginable a couple googolplex lightyears from here...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because we 'measure' it to be flat doesn't mean it is so. We can only see so far across the cosmos. It may be the fact that our reality exists in a 3D dimension, but overall the universe is much larger and curved.</p>
<p>Quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does the Universe look flat? This was one of the perplexing questions in cosmology for a long time. Today, most astronomers believe in the theory of inflation (and there are pieces of evidence supporting this). According to this theory, the Universe underwent exponential expansion about 10-30 seconds after the Big Bang. The result was that something of the size of an atom expanded to the size of the solar system by the end of the inflationary epoch.</p>
<p>If this were the case, irrespective of the original geometry of the Universe, it would appear flat to us. The analogy will be to take a balloon; we can easily see it to be rounded; now blow the balloon to a very large volume and then put a small ant on its surface. The ant will think that it is on a sheet; it cannot detect the curvature. To put this in another way, the distances that we probe are way too small to detect any possible curvature in the Universe.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That puts an awful lot of faith in our measuring ability. Given that 85% of the universe is made up of dark matter... which is dark because we admittedly don't have the technology to measure it, I don't know that I have that kind of faith.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who's &quot;making shit up&quot; here? This is a mathematical theory about a 4th dimension that we can't see and that currently can't be refuted because we don't have the capability to measure far enough to see a possible curve (if even our measurements could detect that curve, being designed/built within our own 3D universal plane of existence). </p>
