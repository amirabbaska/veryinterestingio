			<div class="markdown"><p>We shouldn't forget the Algerian uprising in the 50s or the fact that suicide bombing started with the Tamil Tigers. A lot of this has to do with the de-colonization of French and British colonies and it wasn't always an easy process. Especially when Cold War politics got entangled with it. </p>
<p>Also the Middle East and many Muslim countries have had a pretty big slide into more conservative political stances such as with women. In the 50s and 60s, many women would never dream of wearing a veil- that it was a rural or older generation thing, and I've met several who are completely frustrated that it's shifted so much. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. It's less a &quot;change in culture&quot; and more a situation of &quot;rural/working-class people or their spokespeople gaining control of government and imposing their mores on the wealthier urban classes who had traditionally held most of the power.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the difference between the Middle East of today and the 50s is huge. A while ago I stumbled upon pictures of Kabul, Afghanistan in the 1950s and honestly, I was shocked at how westernized it appeared.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127914602" target="_blank">This NPR article</a> is a good example. That first picture alone shows how much Afghans were leaning toward western culture - it looks like it could have easily been taken in a store in a U.S. city.</p>
<p>And the first photo in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2013/07/afghanistan-in-the-1950s-and-60s/100544/" target="_blank">this article</a> - two female medical students and their female professor - is a great example, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but we also have to keep in mind that many of these pictures are from the most westernized, upper class places and what the intentions of those pictures were trying to convey. Afghanistan, weirdly enough, was one of the few places in the world that actually made money during the war and didn't get saddled with massive amounts of debt and destruction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of colonialism practices completely ruined internal government infrastructures as well as destroying internal cultures and economices. It's not that they're not ready, it's that they were destroyed originally and pretty much dumped when they pulled out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, but people keep forgetting one major thing, the west never had a romanticized view of Islam. We had a romanticized view of the middle-eastern culture, specifically Arabian which is the general template we use when we fantasize about the region(camels, desert nomads, exotic palaces located in oasis, the keffiyeh), its also why some people believe arab/Muslim are interchangeable and this is the general attitude Hollywood took when it came to the region, the western view of the middle-east in popular culture is generally based on the golden era of Hollywood films that set the standard.</p>
<p>Couple this with the simple fact the west for lack of a better word, has had amnesia with the middle-east for quite some time, with the gradual decline of the ottoman empire, lack of the previous conflicts between Islam and Christendom that plagued Europe for centuries, you begin to see how this romanticism developed. With the lack of frequent interaction, political conflict outside of eastern Europe and with the advent of the enlightenment movement it tore down much of the past resentment, bad blood and hatred that existed in the west when it came to Islam. If anything the west now has a more romanticized view of Islam than any point in the last 4-600 years if we were going by the more open and accepting if not overtly politically correct attitude. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Mohammed Ali got out of being drafted for Vietnam because he was a Muslim and convinced the courts it was a religion of peace. You could never get away with that now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lmao that's not remotely what happened, the military has this thing called conscientious objector where you could avoid the draft either by claiming a moral, intellectual or religious objection to it. While he did claim that war not in service to allah was forbidden, the court did not buy the bullshit and he was found guilty, his boxing license was suspended and he could not fight for 3 years when he was originally compelled to do the draft this is what resonated with those opposed to the war &quot;I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong ... They never called me nigger.&quot; and as the civil rights movement continued to gain moment while the wars popularity continued to hit all time lows, he went before the supreme court and they overturned his former conviction 8-0. Of course not the draft ended. </p></div>		</li>
