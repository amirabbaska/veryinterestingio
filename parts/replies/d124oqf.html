			<div class="markdown"><p>The human hand is not negatively charged.  The human body can store capacitance, and it will be positive or negative depending on circumstance. Furthermore, if this was the correct answer, the human body would need to be charged more than the CRT in respect to whatever voltage it's charged too, which is impossible.</p>
<p>What you are actually doing when you wipe the screen is removing dust from the surface.  Those small particles are attracted to the screen because they themselves are slightly charged.  Any that are charged opposite in respect to the static electricity put out by the CRT will stick to the surface.  </p>
<p>When you wipe the screen you're removing those particles of dust, and for a few minutes it's gone until it builds  back up again.  Sometimes, especially in drier climates, these particles can be very small and build up quite a charge.</p>
<p>If you'd like to see this in action, shake out a feather duster post dusting over the front of a CRT.  You'll see most of the particles attract directly to the screen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The human body can act like a capacitor, storing positive or negative <em>charges</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>coated with phosphorus</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>phosphors</em>.   A substance that emits light (glows) when struck by electrons.  In old black and white TVs, the back of the screen was coated with a phosphorescent material.  In colour TVs, you had to have 3 different phosphors behind the screen (R/G/B). The electron guns in the rear of the TV fired through a thin metal grill full of tiny holes, called a <em>shadow mask</em> which ensured that only the right phosphors were hit by the right gun.</p>
<p>Edit: Corrected the shadowmask reference. Thanks all!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a poorly designed TV that did this to itself.  The built-in speaker was too close to the screen and it discolored everything in that corner.  Since the speaker couldn't be moved, there was no way to fix it.</p>
<p>Probably more annoying in retrospect than at the time, since I was just excited to have a TV in my bedroom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THere's something nostalgic about watching tv or playing games on a crt that's got one or more problems with the image. Like you said, you're just thankful to have something to watch and don't complain too much. I had this piece of shit, brick of a tv that I had to turn the brightness almost all the way up just to see anything, after a few years lines would slowly descend down the screen distorting the image every now and then. It was awesome! I feel old :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember having an old tv with an opposite problem. The more the screen was white the louder the static would be on the speakers. I'm not sure what the reason was, but as long as you watched mostly dark shows you'd be fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My little brother and I discovered the purple and green effects created by a horse shoe magnet on my parents' TV when we were kids. No big deal until we held it in one spot for awhile and the color blurs remained. We claimed ignorance when my Dad asked about it. Ha. They eventually went away after a couple weeks. Looking back, SMH at 8yr old me. </p></div>		</li>
