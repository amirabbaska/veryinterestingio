			<div class="markdown"><p>Without going into the maths, just think of this. The whole of earths gravity pulls down a paperclip, but one tiny magnetic is enough to overcome the gravity and pick it up. That's how wildly weak gravity is compared to electromagnetism</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also without going into the maths, from the <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/II_01.html" target="_blank">Feynman Lectures</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All matter is a mixture of positive protons and negative electrons which are attracting and repelling with this great force. So perfect is the balance, however, that when you stand near someone else you don’t feel any force at all. If there were even a little bit of unbalance you would know it. If you were standing at arm’s length from someone and each of you had one percent more electrons than protons, the repelling force would be incredible. How great? Enough to lift the Empire State Building? No! To lift Mount Everest? No! The repulsion would be enough to lift a “weight” equal to that of the entire earth!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the relative strengths of gravity and electromagnetism arise from our measurement systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We see that the question [posed] is not, &quot;Why is gravity so feeble?&quot; but rather, &quot;Why is the proton's mass so small?&quot; For in natural (Planck) units, the strength of gravity simply is what it is, a primary quantity, while the proton's mass is the tiny number [1/(13 quintillion)].[14]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he is making a useful philosophical point, but something seems a bit weasily me when blaming the disparity on measurement. From a practical standpoint gravitational forces <em>are</em> much smaller than electric ones. Reframing it such that proton masses are much smaller than we expect is just shuffling the problem around to the other term in 'G m_p^2', but it's the product of the two that matters when we think of &quot;strength of an interaction&quot;, and that product is small compared to 'k e^2'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What?</p>
<p>The fundamental strengths of gravity and the electromagnetic force and their strengths relative to another may be <strong>expressed</strong> using mankind's chosen units, but are in no way influenced or set by the choice of those units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No they don't. They arise from the coupling constants which are dimensionless. The coupling constant of gravity is 10^-39 that of the Strong force. That is why gravity is weak. Note that these coupling constants are unitless. They do not depend on measurement system at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can get far away from celestial bodies to perform the experiment, you could just put two precise spheres in orbit about each other and watch them. It's possible the simplicity would help with the precision, but it's also possible that, realistically, you need to shield them from sunlight and the solar wind enough that your shielding starts messing with the experiment and you'd be better off with something more like a traditional Cavendish experiment.</p></div>		</li>
