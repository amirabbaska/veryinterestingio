			<div class="markdown"><p>All skin does this, but the top of the head does it more.  Fun fact: the reason you get acne around puberty is because we used to have way more hair on our bodies but the sebum oil glands never quite got the memo that the hair is far less prominent.  The glands are producing excess oil which can clog pores and traps dirt/dead skin/dust (blackheads) or harmful bacteria (white heads)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would a bald person need to shave their head? </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the clarification. I knew some people shaved their heads if they started to go bald, but I always thought most bald people had lost all of their hair entirely and wouldn't need to shave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there are degrees of baldness. It's not like your entire population of hair folicles ran away one single night. So, most likely, there are still some patches of hair, usually on the sides, back and that one little awkward spot on the top of the head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone is bald my nature - some are bald by choice.</p>
<p>I have long pretty hair, but if it ever starts to get patchy or fall out, I'm going to start shaving up there. Total baldness is I think much more attractive than male pattern baldness.</p></div>		</li>
