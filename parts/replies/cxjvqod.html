			<div class="markdown"><p>Canadian here, that's factually incorrect when speaking about Just for Laughs gags. The reason they are allowed to do it is simply because they inform the police beforehand and I'm sure there are permits obtained beforehand. It has nothing to do with &quot;not telling people you are a police officer&quot;. Why ? Section 130(1) of the Canadian Criminal Code: Everyone commits an offence who
(a) falsely represents himself to be a peace
officer or a public officer; or (b) not being a peace officer or public officer, uses a badge or article of uniform or
equipment in a manner that is likely to cause
persons to believe that he is a peace officer
or a public officer, as the case may be.</p>
<p>In other words, you can be charged with Personating a peace officer in Canadian Criminal law simply wearing a fake uniform and acting as if you were an officer without ever stating so. On JFLG its pretty apparent they are not acting as a peace officer normally would and as I said they inform the real police beforehand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew two people who ran a gun store: one was a daytime police detective and the other was a firearms instructor for the city police. They could legally sell you anything you wanted on a uniform except the badge. So, clothing, stripes, pepper spray, belt, gun, tazer, boots, etc. were all fair game.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Strangely, it missed the trash cans, tore through a cinder-block wall, bounced its merry way down a hillside, barreled 700 yards through a suburban California neighborhood, smashed through the front door of a house, bounced up the stairs of the house and, without knocking, penetrated a bedroom door where a man, woman, and child were sleeping.</p>
<p>They were only woken after the cannonball had passed through. There was a little rubble and dust.</p>
<p>Was it done? Of course not. The cannonball then bounced its way out through the wall of the house, crossed a road, smashed a few tiles that were carelessly lying around on the roof of another house and finally took a seat inside the Gill family's Toyota Sienna, which they had thoughtlessly parked in the driveway of their home.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Alameda County Sheriff's Department--which is responsible for the bomb range--gave the Chronicle three apposite words for the incident: &quot;Crazy, crazy, crazy.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not super surprising. Cannonballs werent used the way some people imagine, which is by being angled upwards to come landing and cratering into battle lines like an explosion.</p>
<p>Cannonballs were actually blasted at a horizontal angle, bouncing along through line after line of troops, annihilating anything in their path. Usually, the cannonball would amputate mens legs and continue onward, but if it was an early enough bounce it could blast through your torso</p>
<p>Its part of why theres this stereotype of colonial era officers with wigs walking on a peg leg. A cannonball probably tore it clean off at hundreds of miles perhour and then tore off the legs of everyone behind him too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did that on a bomb range so they didn't have to. Making stuff explode is the point of a bomb range.</p>
<p>The cannonball escaping from the bomb range was, of course, unplanned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the reason is they consult with &quot;explosive experts&quot;. I haven't seen a lot of episodes, but all the ones I've seen with explosives they go to the range and subcontract the dynamite to people licensed to handle (and acquire ) it. Sure, I've seen them put mentos in a soda bottle, but I haven't seen anything where just the mythbusters make their own dangerous shit. Am I wrong about this ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do make their own bombs, comically with &quot;Blur&quot; and &quot;Blur&quot; (they do not tell you what they use) but this is also done under the careful watch of experts, usually FBI bomb squad agents. This is also likely a legal reason as much as a safety one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was that time when they hooked up an unsecured pneumatic harpoon cannon to a 500 psi air source in the shop. I was yelling at the tv before it went wrong. They are lucky nobody was seriously injured. I believe it was the batmobile episode and they were trying to use a cable to slingshot a car around a corner.</p></div>		</li>
