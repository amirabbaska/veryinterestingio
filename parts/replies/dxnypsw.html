			<div class="markdown"><p>There is the heating effect, <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/ResourcesforYouRadiationEmittingProducts/ucm252762.htm" target="_blank">but there is more:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two areas of the body, the eyes and the testes, are particularly vulnerable to RF heating because there is relatively little blood flow in them to carry away excess heat. Additionally, the lens of the eye is particularly sensitive to intense heat, and exposure to high levels of microwaves can cause cataracts. But these types of injuries – burns and cataracts – can only be caused by exposure to large amounts of microwave radiation.</p>

<p>So keep your guys and your eyes away..</p></div>		</li>
