			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum field theories are now thought of as low-energy effective theories, where you don’t necessarily trust their predictions above some cutoff momentum scale. In principle there could be some very high energy scale where QED breaks down, but it words extraordinarily well for at everyday energies, and even in high energy physics experiments. It’s been verified to get high precision in things like the Lamb shift, the electron magnetic moment, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that you asked about string theory, it's worth adding to the other answers that QFT has major problems with quantum gravity. You can write down some local effective theory for quantum gravity at low energy, and show that it gives classical GR and interesting corrections like Hawking radiation and Hawking entropy. </p>
<p>But there are some major problems with trying to describe high energy quantum gravity with QFT. One of the most transparent problems is that we know one thing that happens at extreme energies in quantum gravity: if you throw enough stuff together, you get a black hole - the more stuff, the larger the black hole. But if you have a large enough black hole, we can apply some of Hawking's arguments and say that the entropy of the final state is proportional to the <em>area</em> of the black hole. There's no way to get this kind of behavior using a local* QFT, so somewhere at high energies, a local QFT description needs to break. Something which is not a local QFT but reduces to one at low energies, like string theory (which contains quantum gravity and a QFT-like low-energy behavior), would be needed to fully describe quantum gravity.</p>
<p>* The word &quot;local&quot; here is really important. It turns out that some explicit string theories appear to be equivalent to QFTs which live in a lower-dimensional spacetime than the string theory! Many people believe that this is a totally generic feature of quantum gravity which the Hawking entropy formula is already screaming at us: any theory of quantum gravity is equivalent to some quantum theory without gravity which lives in a lower dimension. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_principle" target="_blank">holographic principle</a>.</p></div>		</li>
