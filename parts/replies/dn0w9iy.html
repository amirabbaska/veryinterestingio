			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had similar experiences. I (semi-recently) broke my leg and it didn't hurt that bad; I was honestly more annoyed that I wouldn't be mobile for a few months or be able to live at home. The painkillers did absolutely nothing for me, either. I tried a couple different kinds with no success. And that was fine, really, since I wasn't in pain - but I thought being high for a bit seemed like a fun way to pass some time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I was all excited about the hydrocodone they prescribed me for the gall bladder surgery. Didn't do jack squat when I took a pill. About the most I could say was it made me sleepy, but that could have been the anesthesia wearing off as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had very similar situations. Wisdom teeth being one, took the meds that night before the freezing wore off just in case, woke up with no pain and was back to eating and drinking normally that breakfast.</p>
<p>I've also had issues with recurrent rupturing ovarian cysts, that felt like a dull ache to me, whereas many other friends who have had a single cyst rupture and were laid up in the hospital on morphine for nearly a week.</p>
<p>Somewhat amusing (and frustrating) one was when I went into labour with my daughter, the L&amp;D triage unit sent me home even though I was having contractions every couple of minutes, since I wasn't wailing in pain and the triage portion didn't have the straps to properly read contractions. When I was induced 48 hours later in the actual L&amp;D department the nurse who was hooking me up was shocked that I wasn't reacting at all to the massive contractions she was picking up on the reader. It literally only felt like someone tightening a corset on me, zero pain at all. Unfortunately I was having strong contractions for so long that by the time the induction was finally moving every other aspect along halfway, my daughter's heart rate was going crazy and jumping from 60-170 bpm and back, so had an emergency cesarean... which apparently I also experienced much less pain than normal (I was up walking around pretty much as soon as I had feeling in my legs again)... and stopped taking the pain meds as soon as my daughter and I were discharged.</p>
<p>Oh, and my daughter was a biter when she was first starting to nurse, lots of people cringe horribly when I mention that... I only ever noticed the pressure, not the pain.</p></div>		</li>
