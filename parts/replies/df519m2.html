			<div class="markdown"><p>Western PA checking in, my well is 265 feet deep and was originally drilled in 1968 and I have not had any issues with water supply.  Mine is on the deeper side for my area, my parents live 4 miles away and theirs is only 180' deep. </p>
<p>Before I bought my house as part of the inspection , I had a local well drilling company come and perform a flow and recover test and that's how they found out the grandfather of the current company owner drilled the well originally. They drained about 1800 gallons out of the well throughout the day and it was still capable of flowing 6 GPM at the end of the day so I should never have issues with water supply. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even the slightest. All that rain that hits  the surface would need to travel Downward 350ft to even contribute to a wells water level. If last years down pour stays consistent for the next 4 years,  Then we'll see a significant change in water level.. Allegedly </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact to depths of wells as well: the deeper the well the less taxes you pay. Because it cost more to pump water further. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't that be the other way round? The deeper the well the more taxes you pay; as the well is large and goes down further...where as the shallower well would be cheaper as its smaller and closer to the surface?</p></div>		</li>
