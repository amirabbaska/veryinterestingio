			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, what an interesting question.  So it's not like a wire carrying a single signal, but could it be thought of as multiplexed fiber, one wire carrying multiple signals of varying frequencies or wavelengths to keep them differentiated?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A real neurologist would be better able to explain this, but it is more like having multiple wires that occasionally transform into fiberoptic cables, and having another computer ever couple feet that reprocesses the data before transmitting it to other wires. This is why your reaction time is slow compared to a computers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a good analogy I think. In fact assuming we're talking about a single neuron rather than a nerve (a bundle of neurons) it's kind of wrong.</p>
<p>The transmission mechanism itself is binary. On or off, it either fires an action potential in response to input or it doesn't. There's no extra encoding there.</p>
<p>The extra information is really in terms of the connections made previously. An action potential will induce neurotransmitter release at what can be a variety of contact points with other neurons. Generally, the substance released is the same each time, it's what's on the other side that matters - different subtypes of receptors can be either inhibtory or excitatory (usually not though, that's usually a general property of a neurotransmitter type rather than receptor subtypes), slow or fast, or have different long term modulatory properties with respect to the behaviour of the neuron receiving the signal. </p>
<p>Information is usually encoded in firing frequency because of the binary nature of the signal. Firing frequency can also have modulatory effects on both the pre and post synaptic neurons - it can alter release and response over the short or long term.</p>
<p>There really isn't that much information or distinction processing that goes on in a neuron beyond a summation of inputs and a 'decision' (basically just a threshold of activation) as to whether to fire an action potential. The complexity comes in with the number and extent of different connections each one makes, the existence of a lot of different receptors and the alteration of their expression depending mainly on firing frequency.</p>
<p>If you're including the whole synapse and downstream neurons in the assessment then I guess you can make an argument about multiplexing but I think if you do that you've gone beyond modeling just transmission or the 'wire'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also suggest that there's a type of compression of sorts. It's basically using a lookup table in the brain that your brain builds as it learns, so you don't have to send a lot of data to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply untrue, wires transmit various forms of data simultaneously all the time by utilizing different frequencies. A common example of whic is the capability for a phone line to be used for both internet and telephone communications simultaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By different types of signals I didn't mean two different electric signals. I absolutely agree that wires can transmit data in parallel, but what they do not do is transmit information chemically while simultaneously transmitting data electrically. This is what a nerve cell does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we're looking for a maximum bandwidth we don't need to consider anything about neurotransmitters. Maximum rate of action potential firing is dependent on the refractory period of voltage gated sodium channels in the axon, not on the type of signal received.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This simply isn't true. When you send an action potential down an axon, it has a singular purpose, to move on to the target cell. Plain and simple. We are talking about normal neuron-to-neuron connection here. Not talking about the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft towards a receiving cell, as that is extraneous to what line of thinking OP appears to have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP wanted to know about the quantity of data being sent, a <em>huge</em> portion of that data is transmitted chemically. You and I must have taken different interpretations of OP's question, because I considered it a matter of information transferred rather than solely of as you call it &quot;neuron-to-neuron connection&quot;. My point is that neurons and wires don't work by the same mechanism, so measuring them by a method used to determine information flow through a wire is extremely limited in usefulness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you wrote simply isn't true. Neurons can be inhibitory, meaning their &quot;purpose&quot; is not to send an action potential to the next neuron. </p>
<p>Any level of abstraction of the nervous system is going to exclude some information, but I don't know that synaptic communication is extraneous to this question. When you have multiple neurons synapsing onto a single neuron - and that's it - you necessarily lose some of the info from each of those nerves as it is converted into a single signal. I think the purpose of the comment you are replying to is to point out that, similarly, there can be multiple neurotransmitter interactions at a single synapse that work to affect whether an action potential forms. Neurotransmitters also act retroactively to attenuate or amplify signals. While many of these changes are more long term, some are not. And while it may not be practical in calculations, it definitely is not extraneous to the scope of this question to consider the effects of neurotransmitters on transmission of information. </p></div>		</li>
