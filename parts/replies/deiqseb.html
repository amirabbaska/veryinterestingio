			<div class="markdown"><p>I myself have suffered from sleep disorders, pretty generic ones mostly, and it seems that I've essentially destroyed whatever circadian rhythm i might have had. I find myself having to do &quot;hard resets&quot; every week or so, in which I stay awake for 2 whole days and the one night between them. Usually, this is done by simple choice of just not attempting to fall asleep (attempting to fall asleep typically results in finally drifting off in the wee hours of the morning, around 5am, which is horrible for getting any sleep on school days). After staying awake for an extended period of time, falling asleep is much easier the next night, and my sleep schedule will remain &quot;normal&quot; for a few days, until I once again have difficulty falling asleep anytime before 12 midnight.<br />
I've heard similar stories from many of my friends who suffer from sleep disorders, so it would seem that while morning people can become night people, or vice versa, it's also possible to completely wreck your sleep schedule so that you're just a tired person.</p></div>		</li>
