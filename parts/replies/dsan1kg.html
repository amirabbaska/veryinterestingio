			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget (3) <strong>the massive marine regression</strong> that was also happening. It was certainly the dominant reason for the extinction of species dependent on the existence of large swaths of shallow sea habitat, and such a big change in hydrology would have also influenced climate change.</p>
<p>And yes, your guess is correct---it's very complicated with a lot of ambiguity. The public, many reporters, and (grumble) Neil DeGrasse Tyson are convinced it's the impact and only the impact. But within the field of paleontology, we're actually split on the matter and mostly recognize that it's not one thing and only one thing. Especially since a lot of the groups you'd expect to be severely impacted by an impact (e.g., amphibians), sailed through just fine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's just it. He's a phenomenal science communicator and is the sole or the loudest voice for a lot of the general public on all matters science, not just astronomy, because he's very opinionated and likes to make statements about other fields that aren't always true. He's extremely charismatic, which means people trust him. So when he stands up in front of a crowd and says things along the lines of &quot;Those paleontologists just won't listen to us astronomers! Some day they'll learn...&quot; after stating the impact was the sole cause of the K-Pg extinction---and this after interrupting my advisor (a paleontologist) in an earlier one-on-one conversation, who was explaining the evidence <em>against</em> the impact-only hypothesis to very patronizingly say &quot;That's because you're not looking up.&quot;---guess who that crowd is gonna believe? It's bad enough that we have to fight misinformation spread by anti-science folks, the subgroup of reporters who think they're able to paraphrase better than they actually can, and the people with out of date information (like the highest rated answer to this question, incidentally). Having to fight a well-respected science communicator is just that much harder.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Wait no, I take it back. I was just reading about this a couple months ago. There's a correlation between earthquake intensity and radius from which volcanic eruptions can be triggered. The Chicxulub impact was (IIRC) a magnitude 12 seismic event, which would make its radius of effect global. So it's certainly possible that the impact spurred volcanic activity, but we haven't yet confirmed this.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I suppose it is very hard to find direct evidence, but consensus seems to be that the Chicxulub impact did cause global Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, so is it not at least very likely to have had an effect on the Decan Traps?  </p></div>		</li>
