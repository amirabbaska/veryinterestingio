			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. I can't think of a new discovery in experimental particle physics that was predicted by theorists any later than the 1970s. The last 40 years of particle physics have been extraordinarily unproductive from that perspective.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't that a dangerous line of thinking?  Most of the time scientists create hypothesis and theories to be proven wrong, not right.  Isn't that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theorists want their hypotheses to be falsifiable, not actually falsified. What would be dangerous is purely deductive reasoning, drawing conclusions from your models and declaring that the conclusions, too, must be true.</p>
<p>Experimental physicists, on the other hand, love telling theorists that they are wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a hypothesis, you really have to test every part of it before it can be actually accepted.  But if our hypotheses keep getting proven right, then it shows we are really on the right track and not taking shots in the dark</p></div>		</li>
