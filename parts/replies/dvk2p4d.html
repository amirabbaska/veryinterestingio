			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. When you're watching a movie on your TV, some sounds will appear closer than others, even though all sound is coming from the same speakers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that would be possible. With proper frequency attenuation and getting the timing right, you should be able to mimic a distant sound. It is kind of similar when you watch movies or listen to music where a new sound is behind a wall or barrier, and even though the source itself is the same, you can still tell (due to how it is muffled) that it sounds like something behind a wall. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you would have to be in an anechoic environment. If not, our brain will here the reflections of the sound and localize it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sort of like how distant objects look bluer.</p>

<p>If light of higher frequency gets scattered more than that of lower frequency, shouldn't distant objects look redder?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, just learned this: the blue of distant objects is because the air between you and it is scattering the blue part of sunlight,  more like a blue overlay than a bias of the original color.  So not that great an analogy for sound.</p></div>		</li>
