			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, subliminal is used in a context like &quot;subliminal messaging&quot;, in which advertisements or other emotionally/mentally manipulative messages are embedded in movies at high-flickering rates that you can't see with the naked eye, but your subconscious all of a sudden feels like you really want to drink a Pepsi, or eat McDonald's, or watch their shitty sequels so corporations can make a cash grab out of you.  But that seems a little too far in tinfoil hat territory.</p>
<p>The word you're looking for is &quot;unintentional&quot;.  As in, you didn't intend to use the Russian letter c in place of the English s even though they sound alike.  Don't feel bad.  For the longest time up through high school, I was pronouncing &quot;necessary&quot; as &quot;neck-essary&quot;...didn't intend to do that, but how was I supposed to know how to pronounce it when I didn't have that many friends with which to socialize in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
