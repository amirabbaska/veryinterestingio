			<div class="markdown"><p>To add..your kidney is made up of smooth muscle..one of its capabilities is to stretch and turn off the signal that you need to pee. That's how sometimes you feel like you need to go and you forget about it until later...I think it's called a myogenic response..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yeah. Haven't gotten to the kidney/bladder chapter yet lol. But the above was mentioned in the muscle chapter. Same mechanism works for the stomach. Thanksgiving dinner you eat a shit tonZ you get full..but still continue to eat as the signal from you being full adapts and turns off so your able to graze. Also the triptophan thing is a myth according to my teacher.you get tired on thanksgiving because your trying to digest pounds of food. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting question. We know the body anticipates the onset of exercise without needing to start exercising. But I'm unsure at what stage you could measure increasing catecholamines, I would guess that the shift towards sympathetic activity occurs quite early and is enough to suppress a &quot;just too full&quot; bladder</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but you can think of your sympathetic nervous system and parasympathetic nervous system as &quot;linked&quot;: when one is at 80% activity, the other will be at 20%, etc. </p>
<p>Now, each of these systems controls various parts of the body, and function differently, but you can think of them generally as &quot;makes you excited&quot; (sympathetic) and &quot;makes you relaxed&quot; (parasympathetic). </p>
<p>When you exercise, you active your sympathetic system. But remember, the two systems are linked. When you're running away from a hungry predator, your sympathetic system will draw energy from the parasympathetic system. More energy for your muscles, but less energy for your bladder (which is controlled primarily by the parasympathetic system). Because of this decrease, the bladder's urge is lessened, and you can easily ignore the urge to urinate. </p>
<p>I hope this clarified some things!</p></div>		</li>
