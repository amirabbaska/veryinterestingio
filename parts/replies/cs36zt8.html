			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree with you and to add to your point I've seen this painting in person at the Seattle Art Museum and looking at it it is incredibly detailed and looks realistic <a href="http://www1.seattleartmuseum.org/eMuseum/code/emuseum.asp?style=browse&currentrecord=1&page=search&profile=objects&searchdesc=61.146&quicksearch=61.146&newvalues=1&newstyle=single&newcurrentrecord=1" target="_blank">http://www1.seattleartmuseum.org/eMuseum/code/emuseum.asp?style=browse&currentrecord=1&page=search&profile=objects&searchdesc=61.146&quicksearch=61.146&newvalues=1&newstyle=single&newcurrentrecord=1</a> but to our modern eye it seems too soft focus to be a photograph. But that doesn't mean it's not realistic! Just that the artist was capturing what he could actually see and wasn't influenced by photos to depict reality has having super crisp edges or a certain depth of field etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That list of provenance is excellent; I wish more websites (coughs long and hard at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum) did that. Though it probably brings up...awkward questions with many works. </p>
<p>Say that's a nice Sumerian pillar...when'd you pick it up? Iraq, 2004? Oh. Further depressing news <a href="http://www.ineas.org/in/pj/200602stolen.htm" target="_blank">here</a>, in the postscript. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of Vermeer's paintings, which I believe came before the camera, have depth of field in them.  That's something that not even the human eye sees.  You don't see an in-focus foreground and a blurry background when your eyes dart back and forth between them, yet somehow Vermeer was able to paint blurry backgrounds.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that depth of field and photo blur is especially key, it isn't something you'd notice before the advent of photos because when you flick your eyes to another part of the scene, they focus and the area that was previously blurred is now detailed and sharp. Photos make you acutely aware of this, but an old master may go his whole life and not notice the presence of DOF in a close up scene. Thus his detailed rendering of that looks realistic, but sharpness all the way through it ruins the effect of seeing the world through a lens/eyeball.</p></div>		</li>
