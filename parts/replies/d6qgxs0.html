			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a really easy theory to test. Get 3 of the same drinks from a plastic, glass and aluminium container, pour them into 3 different cups of the same material and see whether the person drinking it can pick up the difference in taste. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think it's a matter of material migration from the container to the food. All containers are tested and certified as to their variability to contain various types of food without contaminating them, either on a level physical level (pieces of plastic) or chemical level (plastic tenant toxins).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What you think does not matter, facts are that it does contaminate the food. It's just that a small contamination does not harm us, thus there are legal limits. And if they're certified, then they're within that legal limit, it does not mean that there is no contamination.</p>

<p>Acetaldehyde is also created by thermal degradation or ultraviolet photo-degradation of some thermoplastic polymers during or after manufacture. One common example occurs when a bottle of water is left in a hot car for a few hours on a hot, sunny day, and one notices its strange sweet taste in the water from the breakdown of the polyethylene terephthalate (PETE) container. The water industry generally recognizes 20â€“40 ppb as the taste/odor threshold for acetaldehyde. The level at which an average consumer could detect acetaldehyde is still considerably lower than any toxicity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetaldehyde#Plastics" target="_blank">Source</a></p>

<p>Also every container contaminates food, it's physically impossible not to, since the liquid inside touches the container.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would put my money on that the human tongue and nose catch onto small differences in the containers' smell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is smell? There was something in the air, from that container, that you smelled, so what stops it from entering your drink, if it even enters the air?</p></div>		</li>
