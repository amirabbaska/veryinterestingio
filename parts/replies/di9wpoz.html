			<div class="markdown"><p>Fairly obvious, really. AfterShave997 basically said the same thing a different way (as I'm about to, come to that).</p>
<p>By definition, n^a = n^a-1 x n;</p>
<p>i.e. n^a-1 = n^a / n</p>
<p>By definition, 0^1 = 0</p>
<p>So <strong>0^0</strong> = 0^1-1 = 0^1 / 0 <strong>= 0/0</strong></p>
<p>And, basically, if you choose your numerator and denominator functions carefully, you can make 0/0 take any value you choose as both tend to zero. Or if you don't, you probably can't.</p>
<p>(One April 1^st quite a few years back I did exactly this when I presented my physics teacher with a &quot;proof&quot; that two obviously non-equivalent quantities were the same (can't remember what, but they were meaningful to us both at the time). Took her all day to find the hidden divide by zero.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that I would classify this as obvious.  </p>
<p>For me, yeah...but I have a degree in the stuff.  I don't know if that goes for people who only have the minimum math they needed to escape high school.</p>
<p>Now 1^∞ is a bit less obvious...</p>
<p>Edit: to be fair, I should point out that what I mean by 1^∞ is if we take the lim n-&gt;∞: f(n)^n where f(n) approaches 1.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This argument contains a mistake. You say:</p>
<ul>
<li>n^a = n &middot; n^(a-1)</li>
<li>Therefore, n^a ÷ n = n^(a-1)</li>
</ul>
<p>But this is only true for n ≠ 0. When n = 0, the second expression is nonsense.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>This is not quite true. You cannot make 0/0 take any value under any circumstances. You <em>can</em> make lim<em><em>x&rarr;0</em></em> f(x)/g(x) take any value when choosing f and g such that lim<em><em>x&rarr;0</em></em> f(x) = lim<em><em>x&rarr;0</em></em> g(x) = 0. In conversation, you might informally say that you are making 0/0 take a value, but that isn't literally correct.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So 0^0 = 0^1-1 = 0^1 / 0 = 0/0</p>

<p>This reasoning doesn't quite work. If it did, 0^1 = 0^2-1 = 0^2 / 0 = 0/0 would also be undefined. The real problem is that a^b-c = a^b / a^c is only valid when a is nonzero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. It is true that the function f(x,y) = x^y has an essential discontinuity at the point (0,0), but it is nevertheless defined there, and f(0,0) = 1. Not every function is continuous.</p>
<p>Indeed, 0^0 is the number of functions from the empty set to itself, which is 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right that 0^0 is often <strong>assigned</strong> the value 1 to make the binomial theorem play nicely at those values.  Even though this is ELI5, I think clearly stating that many mathematicians simply set the value to 1 for convenience is alright, but I would always stress the arbitrariness.  Otherwise, you run the risk of confusing the hell out of students once they actually start doing more interesting math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's <em>not</em> arbitrary, and it's hardly just because of the binomial theorem. 0^0 = 1 follows immediately from the definition of exponentiation on both ordinal and cardinal numbers. This isn't that surprising, since 0^0 is an empty product, which means it should be 1 for the same reason 0! = 1.</p>
<p>You can define exponentiation in an analytic way as well, by starting with the real numbers and defining x^y as a generic version of the exponential function e^(y), and from this standpoint defining 0^0 = 1 is for the most part arbitrary and unnecessary. But in the discrete realm of the natural numbers, 0^0 = 1. No other choice makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>y^x is <strong>defined</strong> to be the number of functions from X to Y, where X is a finite set of cardinality x and Y is a finite set of cardinality y. There is exactly one function from the empty set to itself, so 0^0 = 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common misconception. In fact, 0^0 = 1. No difficulty or contradiction arises from this.</p>
<p>The root of this misconception is that (as /u/yjfs remarks) x^y is not continuous. As a result, the function has multiple limits approaching 0^0 from different directions. Not all of these limits equal the value at 0^(0). But that doesn't mean that the value doesn't exist.</p>
<p>There is no rule stating that a function's values should equal its limit points. However, most functions that you'd encounter in elementary calculus do, and so often the whole thing is handwaved. 0^0 is an “indeterminate form”, meaning that certain techniques involving limits can't be handwaved when 0^0 is involved. But this is not a fact about 0^(0), but rather a fact about those techniques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a misconception.  The reason that some books give 0^0 = 1 is to make the binomial theorem a bit nicer.  As I'm sure you know, by assigning 0^0 to 1, you avoid having to make special cases, so the argument usually goes something like: 0^n is really important and other forms like n^0 are not important at all, so we'll just define it to be 1.</p>
<p>Other books insist that simply choosing a value like this is bad mathematics and leads to problems.  This is my stance as well.  You have tried to tie it down to a technique, but I disagree.  The fact that the value of 0^0 is dependent on the function tells us something is fundamentally undefinable in the general about this form.  </p>
<p>I have no problem assigning 0^0=1 in the context of the binomial function.  This is perfectly ok.  I get extremely nervous though when a claim is made that 0^0 <strong>is</strong> equal to 1.  At the very least, you are going to throw every calculus student into a tailspin when you suddenly yank it away again.  At least make it clear that you are simply assigning a value for convenience so that the observant student remains wary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the binomial theorem. 0^0 is correct and appropriate for pretty much all of discrete mathematics, and for algebra, and for set theory, &amp;c &amp;c.</p>

<p>What problems? Also, what books?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This is an artifact of the handwaving that occurs in introductory calculus courses. Students assume that if a function f has a limit at  x, and it has a value at x, then that value should equal that limit. This is, of course, totally wrong, and students must be disabused of this notion as soon as possible. The concept of indeterminate forms is a way of handwaving away this critical point, and it's a workable concept in its own way, but it tends to become reified in students' minds and many of them (it seems) walk away with the idea that the expression 0^0 is inherently indeterminate, rather than the lim<em><em>t&rarr;x</em></em> f(t)^g(t) when lim<em><em>t&rarr;x</em></em> f(t) = lim<em><em>t&rarr;x</em></em> g(t) = 0.</p></div>		</li>
