			<div class="markdown"><p>Cepheid variable stars to not &quot; oscillate between 2 states of nuclear fusion as the balance between gravitational and fusion pressure forces are unstable.&quot;  Cepheids oscillate because of what is called the &quot;valve mechanism.&quot;  In a partial ionization zone (where an element is partially ionized, relatively close to the star's surface), the opacity of the stellar material increases when the material is compressed.  This &quot;dams up&quot; the outflow of radiation, which pushes the stars surface layers outward.  Then the less dense stellar material becomes less opaque, and the radiation is released.  The surface layers fall back down, more light is trapped, and the oscillation cycle repeats itself.  In other parts of the star, outside the partial ionization zone, the oscillations are damped instead of driven.  In Cepheid variable stars, the driving is stronger than the damping.    </p></div>		</li>

<p>where an element is partially ionized...</p>

<p>What is that? My understanding is that ionization occurs once an element is charged by the addition or subtraction on an electron? How can that occur partially?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>The rate of nuclear fusion changes due to the changing  pressure exerted on the mass of the star. This is due to the balance between the gravitational force ( causes the star to contract) and nuclear pressure (causes the star to expand) changing.</del></p>

<p>Turns out my notes from high school were wrong, and i never questioned it. I now took my time to actually research them and while it took me a while to actually find out what the reasoning is, I now know I was wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that is not correct.  Nuclear fusion is not involved in the pulsation mechanism for Cepheid variables and other pulsating variables.  This has been understood for a long time (mid 20th century), and was the topic of my Ph.D. thesis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do all stars or certain types of stars exhibit a variation of this behavior? Our own star goes through cycles of solar activity (IIRC in periods of approxamately 11 years)</p>
<p>To be clear, I'm not asking if stars start and stop fusion, but if all or most stars go through cycles of solar activity relative to their size and if there are any stars which have stable fusion reaction, and how common stable fusion reactions are.</p></div>		</li>
