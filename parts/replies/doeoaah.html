			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true. Also, every time you drink or eat something, the residue stays in your mouth for thirty minutes. Drinking a carbonated and/or sugary beverage all in one go is much better, for your teeth, than constantly sipping on aforesaid drink for several hours. Every time you take a sip the residue clock resets so you wind up exposing your teeth to acid for the amount of time you were sipping on the drink, plus thirty minutes.
Diet carbonated drinks are acidic because of what u/MonsterMathh stated in his comment, but sugary carbonated drinks are even worse. The bacteria in your mouth that cause caries (cavities) eats the sugar in the residue and excretes acid as a waste product, thereby compounding the damage.

<p>And low ph in your mouth is always bad. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Above is carbon dioxide into bicarbonate into carbonic acid.  Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) is what's actually present in bottled sodas, and turns into carbon dioxide when room is present for the gas to expand.</p>
<p>Also note, this is the same system that balances pH in your blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically I don't see a problem with this, however  carbonic acid and baking soda could potentially react, and I'm not entirely sure how that would work out bc im not a chemist. </p></div>		</li>
