			<div class="markdown"><p>That was beautifully written. Your mom should be very proud of you.</p>
<p>I grew up in a small town, and the librarians not only helped me find books that matched my skill level and interests over the years; they showed me that there was a whole big world to explore. I got the hell out of my small town, but I don't know if I would have even considered it an option if they hadn't been there to guide me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I lived in my local library when I was a kid because I lived in books. My parents were psychos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like every time I visit my mother at work --- I can spot a kid that seems out of place. A kid that is there because he needs to not be at home at the moment.</p>
<p>I wish I could go up to the kid and tell them that it isn't their fault, that they will grow up and be happy, and that they aren't their parents. That they have their whole life ahead of them and that even though they have to live through this now --- they are going to come out as an adult stronger than an ox, stronger than I will ever be. I want to tell them that they will, someday, be happy.</p>
<p>Wow sorry for that rant, whew</p>
<p>I just read your short comment and it fucking pisses me off. I see this shit everyday. Kids neglected for whatever reason. Goddamn fucking piece of shit parents</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for writing this! As a child, I was a huge reader and even though my family was solidly middle class, my mom realized when I started devouring 2 or 3 books a week that we couldn't afford to buy them all - so we started going to the local library. It was one of my favorite places to go as a kid and I always looked forward to our weekly book-swap. I'll never forget being so proud when I got my won library card at age 6 or 7 - the first card I ever got with my name on it. </p>
<p>When I got really interested in ESP and supernatural in middle school - straight to the library, when I wanted to read every moody teen coming of age book at 14 - I still got them there. </p>
<p>Your post just reminded me of all of this - libraries are truly something special.</p></div>		</li>
