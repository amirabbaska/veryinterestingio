<p>The spirit of our rule on guessing isn't violated here in my opinion.  I would ask that you be mindful of this and other rules in the future; as i expect you would naturally.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm relatively new to Reddit, really only started using it this year, and I keep seeing people complain about how all mods are evil and ruin the spirit of the site. </p>
<p>But then I keep seeing things like this and it makes me believe it's just people complaining about how it isn't run the way they want it to be. </p>
<p>I guess what I'm saying is you seem like a cool ass mod and keep up the good work. </p>
