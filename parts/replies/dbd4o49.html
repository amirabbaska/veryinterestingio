			<div class="markdown"><p>Email like Microsoft Exchange is a beast to manage.  Most companies will have several people whose sole job is to know how MS Exchange works and can use its utilities in a situation like this.</p>
<p>Their actual job title probably wont' be email engineer, it will be Analyst or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was an attempt to explain the job easily, but it'd be someone whose job it is to look after the health of the email server. Infrastructure engineer, sysadmin, senior exchange administrator... Whatever, theres 100 titles it could be lol </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They could find where the user was phished, if it was through email (like Podetra emails). </p>
<p>If the firewall showed the source IP address belonging to a public VPN service, they could get the courts to force the VPN company to hand over those logs, but there are plenty of services based outside the USA that will not hand over logs, because they don't keep them. &quot;Private internet access&quot; is well known for being good guys in that way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I looked into PIA after UK snoopers charter went into law. Guessing ISPs aren't yet logging all that stuff, so havent pulled the trigger on it yet. They seem the best option though.</p>
<p>They are based in the US, but a recent FBI request for logs from them resulted in pretty good evidence for users that logs aren't kept.</p></div>		</li>
