			<div class="markdown"><p>So what George Carlin said still holds true. &quot;The planet is fine. The PEOPLE are fucked!&quot;</p>
<p>If I had to guess, there will probably still be some places that aren't unbearable even when the shit does hit the fan, but the crappy places will get worse and the average places will get crappy. So I'm sure some people in some places would survive, but the places that already suck are most likely gonna be FUBAR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget the huge refugee crisis that will erupt when people in the crappy places try to go to the still-ok places. Bangladesh is on track to be in this state in 10 years, and that is one of the most densely populated places on earth. When your country can no longer produce crops or supply enough drinking water then there will be mass exodus.</p>
<p>The European refugee crisis has arguably triggered Brexit and killed the EU with other nations arguing over free movement. That's a few million people - a drop in the ocean compared to what's coming.</p>
<p>There will be people alive on this planet for a long time, but life as we know it may not survive another 50 years unless we find technological solutions. Small self-sufficient communities in remote areas will be fine - but imagine living without modern hospitals, factories and global trade and transport.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also keep in mind the indirect effects. Worsened droughts can cause more severe instability which can trigger greater migration triggering even more instability worldwide. It's happened to a lesser extent historically, and as an example it's sometimes theorized that the Syrian civil war was partially caused by climate change in that it worsened the drought that led to the spike in food prices that led to the initial protests.</p>
<p>Human life will very likely survive. Not even global nuclear war would kill all life on earth or even just all humans. But that doesn't mean that a lot of people couldn't still die and civilizations can't collapse.</p>
<p>Saving the planet means saving the planet that we know of for ourselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's one of my pet peeves about debating climate change.  People claim &quot;this is all natural; there have been worse temperature swings in history, even ice ages!&quot;, and I'm thinking &quot;notice that there aren't any human civilizations that predate the last ice age&quot;. </p>
<p>The new tactic is to claim that the increased heat and carbon dioxide will be good for plants.  Sure.  That's why the lush rain forests of Venus are so famous. </p></div>		</li>
