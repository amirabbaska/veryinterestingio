<p>The potential energy belongs to the earth/object system (or to the gravitational field if you prefer), not to the object. So the height of the object affects the mass of the earth/object system, not the mass of the object.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in theory potential energy is energy and therefore the object a few meters higher would weigh differently. But we are talking really small numbers. Also there might be other powers in play. But everything else equal yes the one object higher would have a greater mass. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's the earth/object <em>system</em> whose mass is greater if the object is higher, not the object itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ya what u/Aggro4Dayz says, except he / you are talking about chemical potential energy, while I was talking elastic potential.</p>
<p>You question is a little silly because it's the equivalent of saying an identical car without gas has less mass then a car with gas. And that is obviously true. </p>
<p>I've had a few too many so if I'm being rude I apologize in advance :)</p>
<p>What's really interesting is two identical cars, one at the bottom of the hill and one on the top of the hill. The one on the top will have a greater mass, due to the potential energy from being on top of the hill. The big caveat is assuming everything else is equal. (Think air pressure and whatnot)</p>
<p>The difference in mass is equal to M = E/C2 and it's going to be a really small number. Like you are going to be able to have the same chance or better to tell if a 1TB hard drive is heavier if it was full of 1's vs 0's type of mass difference.  </p></div>		</li>
