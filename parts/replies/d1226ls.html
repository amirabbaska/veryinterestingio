			<div class="markdown"><p>What is disheartening is that is still just a snail's crawl through the cosmos. Real cosmic exploration will require some form of teleportation. I think the size of the universe is a direct hint that teleportation or &quot;worm hole&quot; travel is not only possible, but absolutely essential.</p>
<p>^Otherwise, ^it's ^an ^awful ^waste ^of ^space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The universe cares not one whit whether it is wasted or explored, awe-inspiring or terrifying.  It cares not whether you live or die, are happy or sad.  If humanity wiped itself out tomorrow, and not one sentient species ever appeared anywhere in the observable universe again...  Not one tear would be shed.</p></div>		</li>
