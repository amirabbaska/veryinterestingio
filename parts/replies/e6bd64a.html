			<div class="markdown"><p>Im assuming youre talking about plastic waste being so prevalent? </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Here's the thing. plastic itself isnt the problem with the environment. its the peoples way of processing it and handling it that needs fixing. If we here (im from Michigan in the US, so ill work with that) were to implement better standards for recycling, as well as simplify the whole process, we would see an improvement. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Best way to &quot;close the loop&quot; is to simplify packaging so its easier to process and regrind without much interaction and seperation. The cost comes from all the handling companies have to do in order to properly recycle the incoming material. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mixed recycling is a huge pet peeve of mine because I just don't see how it's so hard not separating at the start. I'm in Chicago and the fact that I throw glass paper and (some?) plastics in the same bin its crazy. People end up just thinking everything can be recycled at that point. I'm guessing most of it is likely just thrown away if someone throws trash in because of that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no better process to recycle plastic bottles. The bottle has a cap, labeling and liquid inside. Needs to be washed, shredded, melted into beads, then sent to a bottling plant to make more bottles.</p>
<p>Besides collecting, returning and baling bottles for transport, the cost of all that and transport to different facilities is expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tough to do. We're a bulk packaging supplier and really the only way to get people on board would be to charge a deposit fee like we do with beverage containers. The challenge for us is our woven polypropylene bags need to be clean, stacked, compressed, and then bailed. To make it profitable for recyclers, we're  talking at least a 20 foot ocean can of clean, bailed and compressed  bags.  Without a monetary  incentive, it's  impossible to get a company using our bags to do all those extra steps AFTER they have done all the regular work. Some of my clients charge five bucks to get the bag back and reuse it if that's  possible.  Most end up in a landfill though. And listen to Buddy with the top answer above, spot on analysis </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't use plastics! They're only used because they are cheap and one-way (producer to consumer). </p>
<p>I don't know why garbage like that is still legal. Companies don't foot the bill for garbage collection or any bad side-effects, that falls on municipal governments and the natural world. </p>
<p>A closed-loop system is only going to happen through policy, design, and passing some restrictive laws. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the problem right here . The entirety of the cost of collecting, sorting, processing, and shipping plastics falls to local governments and thus, us, the taxpayers. Producers and brand owners have ZERO responsibility for their product once it gets past what we call the point of profit - when it gets sold to a distributor or directly to a retail store (unless in a jurisdiction with a producer responsibility law (e.g. container deposit) in place. This is in addition to the social cost of litter, plastic pollution, and marine debris. </p>
<p>And just because a plastic is chemically recyclable doesn't mean it's functionally recyclable. In most places, at least in the US, recyclability is dependent on resale markets. A good example is polystyrene. Is it technically recyclable? Yes, which is why big producers like Dart set up voluntary drop-off locations (that, honestly, no one uses) to collect foam that they can then reuse in their products. But polystyrene is <em>rarely</em> accepted in curbside recycling because it has practically zero resale value because it is made up of mostly air. A pallet of recycled PS won't fetch you a fraction of what the same volume of clean PET will. So it goes in the landfill, mostly. </p>
<p>A third factor is that producers put out products - especially packaging - that our infrastructure is not equipped to deal with at the end of the product's life. A good example of this is baby food. When I was a kid, my folks bought baby food for me that came in glass jars with a metal lid, both valuable, recyclable materials that can be easily separated and sorted. Now, the baby food aisle is filled with flex-packaging pouches made from plastics fused to metal. Technically, these materials are recyclable, but our collection and sorting infrastructure is not nimble enough to deal with the ever-changing products that brand marketing departments come up with. </p>
<p>The passage of extended producer responsibility (EPR) laws give producers and brandowners a financial stake in the process, which helps both fund end-of-life management systems and can drive product design changes. This idea isn't new - bottle deposits are a perfect example and have been around for over 40 years. Manufacturers and trade groups drop millions to fight these efforts, though, and usually win. So us taxpayers are the ones left to pay for the cleanup of their global mess. </p>
<p>TL;DR: End-of-pipe solutions are not the answer and will not get us out of our problem. Producers must be made responsible for products at the end of their useful lives through laws and regulations. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're cheap, weigh less (reducing transportation costs), less prone to breaking (reducing spillage), more easily former into useful shapes than metal or glass, and I believe are less energy-intensive per container than metal or glass.</p>
<p>I'm seeing more wax-coated, paper-based containers, but the science still has a bit to go before catching up to plastic's versatility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just immediately reminded me of the timber industry. And wow how the Americans make it so difficult. The states and Canada are the only place where the customer pays for sawdust. So when you buy a &quot;two by four&quot; plank you only actually get 19x38 mm instead of 2 inches by four inches. In the rest of the world, if you buy a 38x228 plank, it will be 38x228. And your length is usually longer than indicated because the customer benefits from the overcut. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of this is incorrect. LDPE (&amp; LLDPE) can be recycled. In fact, PP, LDPE &amp; HDPE can be co-mingled as they share similar melt points. It is essentially to have a fairly accurate idea of the ratio in order to get an end plastic with the desired properties. Even a degree of thermoset plastics (thought they aren't that common in domestic waste streams) can be harmless as fillers (think aggregate in cement)</p>
<p>The most difficult plastics tend to be the clear ones such as PET and PVC as they have way different melt points. PET will still be solid when most other plastics are melting while PVC will burn at that temperatures releasing acidic by-products. PVC is also the most vulnerable to UV becomes brittle and yellow as mentioned.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, LLDPE and LDPE can be recycled together. as they are basically the same thing, with different molecular weights. Thanks for the correction. </p>
<p>I should've clarified that most consumer grade materials can be &quot;co-mingled&quot; as you say. You just cant equate them in properties to their &quot;virgin counterparts&quot;</p>
<p>But yes! PET and PVC are very different. (and honestly i hated working in the plant where we made PVC tubing, the smell was awful)</p>
<p>Glad to meet someone else in the industry! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the molecular weight that differentiates LL&amp;LDPE, it's the degree of branching of the polymer chain. You can have equal molecular weights but different densities depending on the branch length/Mw. </p></div>		</li>
