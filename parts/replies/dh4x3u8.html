<p>I would just like add that games, dialogue heavy RPGs, share this exact trait with reading. Games in my childhood like Fallout 2 and Morrowind in particular, vastly improved my english language capabilities (english is my 2nd language). Games like these (RPGs) also has an edge over reading in that you can personally manipulate events and be rewarded or suffer the consequences of your actions. RPG videogames are also good at presenting and let you learn from moral and philosophical dilemmas. One such game that stuck with me was planescape torment.  </p>
<p>As a child I'd hear &quot;why waste your time with video games?&quot; when I was at the time (without knowing what it was) faced with deep and existential questions that I felt were extremely interesting and valuable lessons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this. In my opinion comprehension is the key to learning and reading boosts comprehension </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And just because you can't recall every subtle nuance of the book doesn't mean your brain still hasn't been altered at a subconscious level.</p></div>		</li>
