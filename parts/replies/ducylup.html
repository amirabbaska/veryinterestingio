			<div class="markdown"><p>1 calorie is the amount of energy required to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree celsius. You do this by burning the fat to heat water, and seeing how much the water temperature changes. We have already studied this carefully so we know how much energy (calories) is in protein, fat, and carbs now.</p>
<p>To complicate things, 1 big C Calorie (as is used in food labels) is actually 1000 small c calories aka 1 kilocalorie. It would just be annoying to read everything in the thousands I guess was their reasoning. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's easily estimated by measuring the carbohydrate, protein, and fat contents</p>

<p>How do you determine that makeup?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different ways (I remember reading a WHO report once about it, but I can't find it), but one way is:</p>
<p>To find our how much fat is in food, you weigh the food, bathe it in ether (which will dissolve the fat and wash it away), and weigh it again. The difference in weight is the weight of the fat.</p>
<p>Then you can use sulphuric acid to measure how much nitrogen is in the food. All proteins include nitrogen, so there's a direct correlation between the amount of and the amount of protein.</p>
<p>Then you can subject the food to a bunch of different solutions to figure out how much carbohydrate is in it, since carbs are water soluble, but dietary fiber isn't, which you can remove by sulfuric acid. Since you know how much of the food is fats and proteins, you can find the carbohydrates here (even if some proteins are also washed away by the water).</p>
<p>For vitamins and minerals there's some different methods for different vitamins and minerals. Minerals can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_absorption_spectroscopy" target="_blank">AAS</a> which measures elements by shooting light into it and see how it absorbs it. </p>
<p>Vitamins are hard. For example, for a B vitamin you do it by growing bacteria that eats the vitamin on plates and then measure them compared to known quantities of vitamin on control plates while Vitamin C can be found by titration.</p>
<p>If you simply want to know how much minerals are in the food (and not how much of a specific mineral are in the food), then you can simply burn it at a high temperature. Since minerals aren't organic like the rest of the nutrients everything else will burn away, and then the difference you have (you now know the fat, protein, carbs and minerals) is the vitamins (but you won't know WHAT vitamins)</p></div>		</li>
