			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrite" target="_blank">Chondrites</a> can have water:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many chondritic asteroids also contained significant amounts of water, possibly due to the accretion of ice along with rocky material. As a result, many chondrites contain hydrous minerals, such as clays, that formed when the water interacted with the rock on the asteroid in a process known as aqueous alteration. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is a subtle distinction. The hydrous minerals likely would've only formed after a collision with something from beyond the snow line which brought some water with it. I don't think they would've formed naturally inside the snow line without external water sources.</p>
<p>So the general principle holds that icy stuff from far out in the disk gets tossed inward and collides with something, thus hydrating the inner solar system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I couldn't imagine water being dense enough within  the snow line to be involved in mineral formation. While I'm not a scientist, one cannot deny that some comets must have hit the protoEarth, bringing their water here. I just stumbled on a r/space post that highlighted the evidence that the majority of our planets water is very unlikely to have been seeded by comets, due to an incompatible hydrogen:deuterium ratio. Our water is <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/2ow4ce/rosetta_results_comets_did_not_bring_water_to/" target="_blank">too light!</a></p>
<p>Another thing I find fascinating about water is its stability. We've often heard how hydrolysis of water is an energy intensive operation, and nigh uneconomical as a method of producing hydrogen fuel barring significant leaps in technology. So from this...is damn near every water molecule ~4.6 billion years old? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and a process called outgassing is believed to be another significant source of earth's water. </p>

<p>These are just cursory sources, but basically the idea is that gases from volcanic activity contain a certain amount of gases that are or can form water vapor than can then condense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This is the right answer. Volcanic out gassing. </p>
<p>The type of comets that contain water (name is escaping me right now) are only 5-20% water. They didn't fill this oceans. They did supply some water, but not all. </p></div>		</li>
