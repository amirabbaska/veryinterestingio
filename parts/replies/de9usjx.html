			<div class="markdown"><p>I question the accuracy of those nutrition facts, it makes very little sense that collard greens would have 2x the fibre of kale by weight.</p>
<p>and checking raw USDA data, seems I was right:</p>
<p>Raw Kale: 49 kcal per 100g, 0.93g fat, 8.75g Carb, 3.6g fiber</p>

<p>Raw Collards: 32 kcal per 100g, 0.61g fat, 5.42g carb, 4.0g fiber</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>-Collards have more protein, are more filling, and have fewer calories per serving.</p>
<p>-Collards are sitting at 21% vitamin C and 48% vitamin A, compared to 134% C and 206% A for Kale.</p>
<p>-Kale scores better on their nutrient balance and protein quality scores, while collards have a lower glycemic load</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you go by equal weight, then collards has 40% fewer calories. It has 43% fewer calories from carbs, 41% fewer calories from fats but only 26% fewer calories from protein. The collards has 80% more fiber. Most nutrients fall very close to the 40% split.</p>
<p>I'm guessing most of the difference in what you see is from fiber and probably some additional water weight. I don't know if I'd really call that significant, though. Not at least to prefer one over the other.</p></div>		</li>
