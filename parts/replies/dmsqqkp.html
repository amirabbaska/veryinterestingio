			<div class="markdown"><p>This is super interesting (very well written, by the way). It got me thinking, too. I do a lot of handwriting. I just find it more enjoyable when writing a story or journal. But I have created my own little hieroglyphs, haha. My digraphs (like th and sh) are just one symbol, and even further, when I write the word 'the' it is just an odd looking scribble with no discernible letters. I mean, I know what it is, but most people reading my writing have no idea! And I consider myself a fairly decent typist, not like 100 wpm or anything but good enough, but I always stumble on easy words. It usually makes me laugh because I can bang out longer words no prob, but I'll mess up on 'there' or 'she'll' and I'm just like wtf? Haha, but I wonder if that's what's happening. My brain is trying to load my 'th' file and my fingers send my brain a '404 your dipshit writing style not found' </p>
<p>I'm not sure how this really relates to OP's question. I just find it super interesting, but something else to think about is how we go from letter to letter. I mean, If we are handwriting the word handwriting, when you are making the 'h' you are already planning on the 'a' if not the 'n' already. Not just what comes next, but how to shape it to lead up to the next letter after. I don't know about others, but an 'a' leading into an 'n' is different from an 'a' leading into a 'd' or something. I suppose there is probably a little bit of that involved in typing, but not near as much (I don't know if this is a term, but) thought-training (not like training like learning but as in training your thoughts together). I'm not sure if that's what you were actually getting at, GoalDirectedBehaviour, and I just restated it way less intelligently, but thought it was neat to think about. </p>
<p>Now that I'm thinking about it, one of the most common phrases I end up writing at work is 'your request has been processed' and 9/10 times it ends up 'your request hsa been processed'. I type that close to 20 times a day and it is never right. However, when I write it out by hand the 'a' is almost nonexistent. There is the h and the right leg of the hump just kind of leads into the 's'. (Sorry, on mobile otherwise I'd put some pics on here) it's almost like the 'a' is an after thought when typing because I normally wouldn't be really writing it out. </p>
<p>I'd be very interested to do some tests with this and see if the majority of my errors typing align with the mash'em up style of writing I have. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent discussion. I rarely hand-write anything, and when I do I often skip letters or transpose them, but I don't when typing. </p></div>		</li>
