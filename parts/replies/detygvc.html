			<div class="markdown"><p>The proper term (in the pool industry) for a 'Hot tub' is Spa. You see them referred to as a 'Pool &amp; Spa Combo', or a 'Pool Parts' or 'Spa Parts' catalog.</p>
<p>Jacuzzi is a name brand. Nobody in the industry would refer to a spa as such. Customers on the other hand don't follow the rules :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting, thanks! I'm glad I've been right this whole time haha. People will usually use &quot;Spa&quot; or &quot;Spa pool&quot; here in NZ. People would understand if you said &quot;Hot tub&quot;, but &quot;Jacuzzi&quot; would definitely draw some funny looks </p></div>		</li>
