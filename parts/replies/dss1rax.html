<p>If matter was on a trajectory to pass between the two singularities would the two sources of gravity not act against each other?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well according to our numerical models. As two black holes approach each other, a ‘duckbill’ shape protrudes from each of the two event horizons towards the other one. This protrusion extends longer and narrower until it meets the protrusion from the other black hole. At this point in time the event horizon has a very narrow X-shape at the meeting point. The protrusions are drawn out into a thin thread. The meeting point expands to a roughly cylindrical connection called a bridge. This happens in a fraction of a second and will very quickly move into the ring down phase. Gravity never &quot;cancels&quot; out during this phase. I'm sure you've seen how you can visualize gravity as a sheet pulled tight with a weighted ball pushing down. Well imagine if you had two extremely heavy balls and slowly moved them towards each other. At no point would the curvature of the sheet just get canceled out. Same thing with black holes. You would just get pulled to each side by the tidal forces. </p></div>		</li>
