			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part of this isn’t actually true plants do use all of the light spectrum (yes including green light). The reason people think it only uses red and blue light is since the main photo receptors absorb red and blue light but plants also have other antenna pigments that can absorb light other than red and blue light and transfer it into usable energy. You also have things like far red light controlling hormonal responses in the plant. Recently we’ve been finding that green light actually penetrates deeper into plant tissues and is very useful in indoor plant growth this is why LED companies, such as fluence bioengineering, are moving away from all red and blue lighting. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>is because (most) plants are green, and therefore reflect more green light than light of other colors.</p></div>		</li>
