			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between children and no children probably can't be reduced to the biological factors mentioned, but you can easily pinpoint the social factors.  Dr. Thomas Joiner's Interpersonal Theory of suicide looks at the interplay between three aspects that can result in suicidal behavior: Thwarted Belongingness, Perceived Burdensomeness, and acquired capability to cause lethal self harm.  By social design, having children gives you a sense of belongingness - you are now a &quot;parent&quot; with all of the roles and responsibilities that come along with it, and your focus is moved away from yourself to taking care of a child, so you aren't focused on yourself being a burden on others.  There are exceptions galore to this, but this would be the basic concept.</p></div>		</li>
