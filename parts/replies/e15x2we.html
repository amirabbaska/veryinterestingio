			<div class="markdown"><p>Mind if I ask a mostly unrelated question?  That feeling that a lot of people experience late in the evening or especially when they're trying to go to sleep, when (as I've had it explained to me) they're tired enough to have fewer inhibitions and thus be more inclined to do things they might normally put off, but not quite tired enough to fall asleep yet, so they lie in bed with an unusually high level of motivation. Do you/we know what's going on with that in a chemical sense?  Is it really just a matter of &quot;peak tiredness&quot; or are there two (or more) separate reactions happening with the loss of inhibition/sudden motivation, and tiredness itself?</p>
<p>I get that sensation very strongly and very frequently, and it's not <em>always</em> associated with drowsiness or slowed reflexes, which makes me interested to know the underlying mechanics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK there are no hard and fast answers to this one: I'll provide three hypotheses that approach this from different points of view.</p>
<p>From a neurobiological perspective, there are no real studies on motivation over the circadian rhythm, but I can make some educated guesses based on what we DO know:</p>
<p>Motivation is almost entirely regulated by the dopamine system in the striatum. The striatum also receives a lot of dopamine inputs from the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN is the brains &quot;clock&quot; center - it's where most clock gene activity occurs. Clock genes interact strongly with dopamine. </p>
<p>In the dorsal striatum, in a typical circadian rhythm, extracellular dopamine peaks at night. Increased dopamine levels in the dorsal striatum typically correspond to increased motivation, so having more dopamine floating around means a higher motivational drive. </p>
<p>Thus, the later on in the evening you go, or as you describe it,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>especially when they're trying to go to sleep</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the closer you get to that dopamine peak, and the higher your baseline motivation is.</p>

<p>An alternative answer might be more systems based - think about the million and one things going through your mind while you're waking up, getting ready for work, going to work, at work, commuting back home, going out for dinner with friends, etc etc. Every individual task you are focusing on is demanding resources from your executive functioning centers. As you get closer to bedtime, there are less and less things demanding things from the executive functioning centers of your brain. Since humans are so terrible at multitasking, this is the same as saying that there are less things preventing you from assigning motivation to a particular task. </p>
<p>Finally, a psychological approach: As you get closer to bedtime, an internalized deadline that you have set for yourself also approaches, and you are more likely to try and make strides towards completing that task. As you lay in bed, you are highly conscious of this deadline, because you are reflecting on your day. You feel bad about not accomplishing what you had hoped to do for the day, and you are saying &quot;I should really do that right now&quot; knowing full well that you aren't going to actually do that, but just putting thoughts in those directions feels like making a substantial effort towards completing the task, as you aren't simply forgetting about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All three of those ideas seem reasonable.  I imagined it would likely be an eclectic cause rather than a single simple answer.  Also, I notice that all three of those explanations are also topics that come up very frequently when discussing ADHD, and many people with ADHD report that this sort of feeling as particularly strong and prevalent.</p>
<p>Even if you don't have a definitive answer, I really appreciate taking the time to throw some ideas at me, and especially the sources!  I'll read more about this for sure, it could very likely lead to finding some good habits to try to reinforce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experiences, the last one you said is what I often find myself doing.</p>
<p>I have realized that it feels good to think about projects and plan stuff out mentally.</p>
<p>Planning how I will put my car audio system together, each aspect of it, requires me to think through how to connect things, hide wires, what I will need and how much space etc etc</p>
<p>So all those things give me a dopamine boost from thinking about it, thus reinforcing what you said </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's more of a psychological reaction than chemical. I've noticed my motivation peeks when there is no actual reasonable chance of me being able to start the task due to outside forces. I think it is linked to a sense of wasted time essentially, and getting to blame the lack of 'doing' on an outside force rather than personal avoidance. For instance, when I am stuck at work doing something I like even less, I am excited about the prospect of being free to accomplish all my personal to-dos once I am out of work... But once I am out of work I have more satisfying alternatives and that motivation disappears. Similarly when we are going to bed, we have a reduced number of distractions and are about to spend many hours hibernating overnight...So we naturally start to think of all the things we could be accomplishing with that time instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antagonist meaning that caffeine binds to the adenosine receptor and blocks adenosine from binding. Importantly, caffeine binding to the receptor produces no effect. Conversely, adenosine binding to the same receptor would cause an effect (adenosine is an agonist).<br />
Upregulate simply meaning the cell increases the number of adenosine receptors on its cellular membrane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your statement regarding caffeine's activity at the A2a receptor is not entirely accurate. Many drugs that are commonly referred to as &quot;antagonists&quot; are in fact inverse agonists, not neutral antagonists as implied above. Caffeine is an inverse agonist of the A2a receptor, causing an opposite intracellular response than that of an agonist (i.e., adenosine). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify a bit, when the cell upregulates the number of adenosine receptors it expresses, it's placing more and more of them on its membrane, essentially sensitizing itself to adenosine. The more receptors, the more likely adenosine will bind to any given one of them and create an effect, even with relatively low levels of adenosine.</p>
<p>For a regular coffee drinker, the cell is essentially trying to regain the sensitivity to adenosine that caffeine is inhibiting. So when they wake up in the morning there is likely no caffeine in their system, but their neurons are already hypersensitive to adenosine because of the upregulated receptors. As a result, the normal levels of adenosine usually present in the morning have a greater effect because of the hypersensitivity to caffeine, and drinking coffee will restore activity to more of a &quot;baseline&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of receptors as door locks. Think of the chemicals floating around the receptors as keys.</p>
<p>You have three types of keys.</p>
<p>1) a keys that doesn't fit into the lock at all.</p>
<p>2) a key that fits into the lock but does not unlock the door. You can't turn it.</p>
<p>3) a key that fits into the lock and unlocks it.</p>
<p>An antagonist is key #2. It fits in the lock, but it doesn't turn it. The chemical can bind to the receptor but it doesn't activate the receptor. The receptor sends no signals.</p>
<p>If you have an antagonist bound to the receptor then it blocks the chemcials that would activate the receptor from binding to it.</p>
<p>It would be like putting the wrong key in someones front door. Breaking it off inside the lock, then asking the owner to use their key to unlock the door.</p>
<p>They can't do shit because there's already a key inside the lock. And it's the wrong key.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What causes the headache often experienced with caffeine withdrawal? A further question, since it feels related: I believe caffeine has been shown to increase the analgesic effects of some drugs or even to be analgesic itself. Is this somehow related to the mechanism underlying withdrawal symptoms?</p></div>		</li>
