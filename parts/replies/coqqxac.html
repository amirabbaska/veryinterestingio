			<div class="markdown"><p>I like all the points you made except letting your car idle for a few minutes after start. Your begins to prime itself as soon as the key is switched to the on position. The most wear from starts happen because the engine is not initially running at its suitable operating temperature. You should start driving the car about  10 seconds after you start it so the engine will get to its optimal temperature faster. Of course before you reach this point you dont want to rev the car too high either. When I first start driving I keep it below 3000 rpm until it is at the optimal temperature. If you sit idle for however long and wait for it to warm up you are just burning excess fuel because the car has to work harder to warm up idle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A while back, there was a thread about every-day things to make your car last longer, and the top comment was a transmission specialist who suggested the very same thing as did I. I typically end up waiting only about 1-2 minutes after it turns over, which ends up being about the amount of time I need to get situated (seatbelt, loading music &amp; phone, checking DIC/tire pressure status, climate control etc). I reckon, like virtually anything, it could be argued either way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Along with you, I had to get the shifter cable replaced during a cold winter.  It already has a donor engine, too, so I am not sure what happened to the last 3.5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be the original owner never replaced the water pump and it broke the timing belt. That's the only critical component I've found on these engines. Replacing them every 7 years or 70,000 miles is the general rule of thumb. For anyone else reading, the same goes for the Chrysler 2.7L and 3.2L (of the same era.. not the new Pentastar).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that makes sense - I got my car at 110K.  I was worried about the timing belt after reading some forums and got it replaced at 120,000 just out of safety (thermostat and water pump at the same time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whats with the water pump? I'm guessing you mean replace timing belt every 7 years, but did you mean water pump as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good advice, but not filling up when they're loading the tanks is myth. </p>
<p>There are probably three filters before it leaves the pump, and you're car has another two. </p>
<p>Also, they draw gas from the bottom anyway. It's not like a drinking straw that only does 75% down.</p></div>		</li>
