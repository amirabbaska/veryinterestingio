<p>Molecules that bind more readily to olfactory receptors benefit from the higher air flow rate of one nostril, so as not to overload the receptors. Molecules that bind less readily to receptors benefit from the lower flow rate of the other nostril, since it takes slightly more time for them to trigger reception. </p></div>		</li>
