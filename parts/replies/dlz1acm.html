			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want the even more condensed version connecting talc to the lawsuit, here's the even more basic version:</p>
<p>Talc use gets into ovaries ➡️causes inflammation in cells ➡️ inflammation leads to abnormal growth, aka tumors. Hence, lawsuit. </p>
<p>J&amp;J lost a few of these in Missouri already, this was the first in California. This verdict was bigger than all <del>three</del>edit: four previous losses combined, and there's a LOT more plaintiffs with pending cases that were watching this one (the &quot;bellwether&quot; case). Things are about to get even more expensive for the company. </p>
<p>Source: I watched a few days of this trial live. I work for a newspaper. For what it's worth, I'm surprised they lost. The defense attorney was very, very good.      </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a tort lawsuit happens, as soon as the first one is won, the chances of subsequent lawsuits winning goes up higher. The attorney, whether in court or settling, can usually say, look, this was won before and since it was through a jury (which these have), they decided it and so you gotta find this with the same verdict. It then just spirals. If it does cause legitimate proven problems, they need to pat. What these plaintiffs don't realize is that companies are greedy and instead of taking the hit, other customers will because they can hike up the price on their products to make up the difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The jury is only out because scientists need explicit correlation. If you look at why asbestos causes cancer and what silicosis involves talc also being a health risk is not a giant leap. J&amp;J Is negligent in this case because their profits are more important than the silly warning label they KNEW should be on the product. Seems like common sense; don't inhale a lot of dust over a long period of time and/or while your lungs are developing, don't put talc in your vagina. The latter was a major marketing tool for talc to keep you 'fresh'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>[Edit: I'm making this more ELI5 friendly]</p>
<p>As a lawyer, let me tack on a little bit: </p>
<p>The expert reports that the Plaintiffs used in this case were just <del>wildly specious</del> not really well founded in science but sounded good to the jury.  The Defendant's experts should have carried the day, but I think sympathies and emotion destroyed the facts.  </p>
<p>I dug, far too deep, into various Plaintiffs' claims and, as mostly a Plaintiff-side litigator, I was very disturbed that all of the claims rested on a rather <del>tenuous</del> thin correlation that was reported on back in the 1970's.  </p>
<p>Nothing else was new testing, it was all resting upon that.  </p>
<p>I'm hoping J&amp;J is successful in its appeals because the verdict is bad law.  The expert reports for various Plaintiffs should have been thrown out.  Hopefully on appeal J&amp;J can either get a new trial or get the verdict set aside.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that this is far from over.  J&amp;J has indicated it will appeal this to the fullest extent possible and the science is on their side.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asbestos was last commercially produced in the 1970s and mesothelioma takes a long time to surface. Any claim related to asbestos would necessarily have to tie back to the 70s.</p>
<p>Also, since all the asbestos manufacturers are bankrupt, most claims nowadays are necessarily pretty tenuous. If people want any chance of recovery (read: any chance of being able to pay for their likely insane medical bills) they now have to sue, for example, the employer who put them in a position to be exposed to asbestos, etc. </p>
<p>You are likely aware of this already but I wanted to add a tiny bit more context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the plaintiff first had to convince the judge to allow the evidence, over the objection of the defendant. Basically, they had to convince the judge that it was decent enough evidence. Then the jury weighed he evidence and found the plaintiff's scientists more compelling. We weren't in that court room, so we don't know what happened. Maybe J&amp;J's expert witness was a bumbling stuttering idiot savant? We don't know why the jurors decided the way they did.</p>
<p>Regardless, J&amp;J has the right to appeal.</p>
<p>Right to jury trial is literally the least of the problems facing the legal system. In fact, the jury trial is, on par, pretty fucking great and much better than the alternative, especially in criminal cases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately not many people in law or politics seem to see the folly in non-experts making the decision, without consulting experts, that expert advice isn't really necessary.

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you may have looked over a paper or two debating whether or not there is a statistical correlation between the use of baby powder and cancer, you fail to explain the basics of what is happening.</p>
<p>Both talc and asbestos are chemically inert for all practical purposes here, they do not have dangerous chemical reactions.  What they do have are dangerous physical forms, this is particularly the case with asbestos which forms in very sharp hairlike needles and tends to break into a fine dust that can be easily inhaled.  Talc in baby powder form is also a fine powder that can be easily inhaled  and contains sharp particles but talc crystals form in a sheetlike pattern.  These are both chemically inert silicates that the body can not metabolize and almost any silicate can cause  silicosis (and associated cancers) when enough is inhaled.  </p>
<p>There is a long history of underestimating the dangers of silicates and it is likely that there have not been enough studies into talc's effect on mucus membranes and the skin.  Also industry has a long history of trying to hide information on inhalation hazards associated with silicates.</p>
<p>With that being said talc might be a fairly safe form because of the sheetlike crystals and might not be damaging enough to cause a large number of problems,it seems to be more of an issue with people who work with larger quantities of it on a daily basis.  <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150928082149.htm" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150928082149.htm</a></p>
<p>It seems to me that it would be fairly simple to replace this substance for most uses because of these potential hazards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fairly certain I addressed that in the best ELI5 lingo I can use (although my 5-year old vocab does include the word &quot;nebulous&quot;):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Even if the talc powder used is pure talc and doesn't have any asbestos, it could be an irritant to the special skin inside your body (epithelium). That's because under a microscope, talc is made of very sharp crystals of rock. The jury is still out if this causes cancer or not. That said, it's probably best to avoid it and not put it inside your body.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is the correct answer.</p>
<p>glass is also chemically inert, but it will still ruin your day if you have to walk barefoot across a floor covered in broken glass. silicates are basically microscopic broken glass. your cells don't deal well with this and it results in cancer. &quot;chemicals&quot; don't have to be involved for something to be a carcinogen. we're finding out more evidence all the time that this is the case.</p>
<p>people are also pretty sure that carbon nanotubes will also have this effect.</p></div>		</li>
