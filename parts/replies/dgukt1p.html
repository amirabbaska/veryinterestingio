			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrogen peroxide is indeed amazing for canker sores.  However, I personally do NOT recommend 'taking a swig out of the bottle'.</p>
<p>Seriously, H2O2 might well be the most revolting substance on the planet - I suggest focused applications with a Q-tip.</p>
<p>On another note, I find it interesting that someone else said there wasn't a definitive link between canker sores and bacteria, given that hydrogen peroxide (a highly potent anti-bacterial/anti-viral agent) is so effective against them.  Also because eating a lot of sugar at once almost guarantees I get a canker sore or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like swishing the hydrogen peroxide because if I get one, then I'm gonna get a few. Swishing ensures that I get all the potential ones before they start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get canker sores with the slight amount of mouth trauma (bit my cheek, sharp piece of food hits my mouth, certain toothpastes trigger them)... I've only used salt directly on the sore, which stings for a moment but numbs it for an hour or two. I'm looking forward to giving this a try</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a chronic canker sore sufferer (I have 5 right now) switching toothpastes did absolutely nothing for me :(. I used Biotene for years and still got several at a time.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm a chronic sufferer, too. I've tried switching toothpaste, hydrogen peroxide, baking soda paste, regular use of mouthwash, brushing multiple times a day, infrequent brushing, and birth control. Nothing really worked. </p>
<p>Recently I went in for a braces consult and the doctor suggested probiotics &amp; a b-complex vitamin daily when she saw how many canker sores I had. I started doing so and after my canker sores healed, I haven't yet gotten another and it's been about a month which is a super long stretch for me so maybe it is working. Might be worth trying. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suffered for years with canker sores. Turns out it was my anxiety condition causing them. After a month of escitalopram and stress relieving exercises I have maybe one or two a year.  Could be worth discussing with your doctor if you have high stress levels or other symptoms of anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like other people who have commented, I used to constantly have multiple canker sores at the same time, it was really rough.
After getting blood tests done by a new family doctor it was found I had a really low level of B12.
Once I started taking a supplement I haven't had any since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  I went from 4-5 canker sores/year to maybe 1/year by switching to SLS-free toothpaste.  You don't have to buy crazy boutique stuff for this if you don't want to.  There are sensitive-teeth formulas that have no SLS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2007-2009 I got canker sores constantly.  It was brutal.  I read on some website about the SLS free toothpaste and switched right away.  I would try anything at that point.  It helped a lot!  The site said that SLS strips some protective coating off the interior of your mouth.  All I know is that it really worked.  </p></div>		</li>
