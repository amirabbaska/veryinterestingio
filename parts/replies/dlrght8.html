<p>You're right that going through a door says &quot;go to room 3&quot; or whatever.</p>
<p>BUT there are two values set when you do that. There's one number for which room to load and one number for which cutscene to play in that room. Normally this second number is 0, which means don't play a cutscene. Cutscenes are actually stored in the same list as levels, so level 3's first cutscene is the same as level 4 (meaning there is no level 4...or at least level 4 is actually a cutscene on level 3). Thus the game adds these numbers together to get the right cutscene to play.</p>
<p>The teleport glitch is due to you setting the level number incorrectly while still setting the cutscene number. Basically you play cutscene 2 of level 50 instead of cutscene 2 of level 10. Except level 52 isn't a cutscene, but an actual level. So it loads that level. Yay!</p></div>		</li>
