<p>producing 1kg would be more expensive compared to producing 10,000 tons. I don't know enough about economics to explain this further.</p>

<p>The term you're looking for is economies of scale, but it's not quite what you've described. It's where making more of something leads to reductions in cost per [some amount].</p>
<p>Because of this effect, if you're making 100kg of baking soda, and the raw materials are $2 per kg produced and it costs $20 to run whatever you need to run to produce <em>any</em> amount up to the limits of your plant/machinery... then you have a product that costs $2.20 per kilo.</p>
<p>If your upper limit is 500kg, then it will cost you $2.04 per kilo to make that much baking soda.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Baking soda is made from a reaction of easily obtainable items, so costs to produce are low. If I recall correctly, its carbon dioxide, salt and ammonia.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its ore (trona) is also common enough that in some places (e.g. the states) it is the primary source of baking soda, which is very easy to recover from the ore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny enough, if you buy it at the pool stores, as alkalinity increaser, it ain't cheap. </p>
<p>So for anyone with a pool still doing that, just get big boxes of baking soda at your local supermarket or Wal-Mart. Way cheaper and it's the same stuff. </p>
<p>You can use regular bleach instead of liquid shock, but I've actually found my local odd lots type store carries pool shock at a very reasonable price and bleach is more expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both are used for raising pH and sodium carbonate is also to make chlorine less caustic. </p>
<p>Edit: You're probably getting it mixed up with Sodium bisulfate, which would be used for lowering pH. Maybe HCl too. </p>
<p>Pharmacy is my thing, not pools.</p></div>		</li>
