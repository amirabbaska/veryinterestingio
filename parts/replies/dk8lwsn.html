			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Rail Wheels&quot; go back before trains and it's hard to pin who the full credit goes to because the modern ones kinda evolved over time.</p>
<p>But in 1789, William Jessup designed the first flanged wheels for wagons. Which would be incorporated into trains about 15 years later after the invention of the steam engine.</p>
<p>Though those wheels were much less conical than what you see in the gif.</p></div>		</li>
