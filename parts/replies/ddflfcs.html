			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived near the National Zoo in Washington, and every once and a deer will jump into the cheetah enclosure. If the cheetahs are in with that deer, their hunting instincts go into overdrive, and they will chase it as they would any prey. If they manage to kill the deer, the handlers will prevent the cheetahs from eating the deer, not because visitors would get upset, but because of the parasites the deer would have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true.  </p>
<p>One thing a lot of people don't realize is it is normal for animals to have a significant, often debilitating parasite load.  The fact that humans are able to largely avoid this gives them a tremendous survival advantage.</p>
<p>It is also part of the reason invasive species prosper so easily.  If they arrive without their normal parasites, that gives them a leg up on the locals.</p></div>		</li>
