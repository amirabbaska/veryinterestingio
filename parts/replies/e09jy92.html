			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, unless it's not just a reaction that can be sped up when put under a pressure that shouldn't happen. Simply because increased pressure would increase the vapour pressure, effectively bottlenecking the boil off.
But if it is a reaction, then it's because the reactants are forced to be closer to each other, increasing the rate of reaction not decreasing the boiling point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another misconception may come from the fact that when you compress something, it releases energy as heat. Like when you compress gas, it feels hot. Conversely when it expands, like out of an aerosol can, it feels cold because the expansion takes energy from the surroundings.</p>
<p>But actively compressing something and having it release heat is different from just keeping something pressurised.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. For anyone interested, look up the phase diagram for water. You can see that as pressure increases, the boiling point increases and the freezing point decreases. With high pressure at 33 F, nothing will happen with the water. </p></div>		</li>
