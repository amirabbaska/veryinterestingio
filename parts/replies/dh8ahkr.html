			<div class="markdown"><p>There must be hundreds of thousands of these little quirks in the English language alone, and each one carries a small piece of history, of why the people came to use this phrase or that, or why and how they pronounced a new word as foreign concepts entered their language and thinking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a fantastic advantage in learning European languages but so much of our vocabulary and grammar rules are lifted directly from French, Dutch, and German. Likewise Spanish, Italian, German dialects and even many Slavic and Nordic languages have similarities with English. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, no English speaking nation significantly invests in modern foreign languages. </p></div>		</li>

<p>smoothed down to easy pronunciations</p>

<p>To expand on this a bit: This is called assimilation, where one sound becomes more like another sound. Your mouth has less repositioning to do when going from &quot;o&quot; to &quot;n&quot; rather than from &quot;oo&quot; to &quot;n&quot;. Try rapidly alternating saying &quot;doont&quot; and &quot;don't&quot;; you'll probably find that &quot;don't&quot; is easier.</p></div>		</li>
