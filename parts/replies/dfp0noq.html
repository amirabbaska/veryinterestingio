			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question for you, you sound like the person to answer it:D</p>
<p>I have lowgrade visual static ever since dropping acid a few months back. It's kind of like when you close your eyes and don't see fully black, you see colors and whatnot, but I have it when my eyes are open. I have always had it since I was a kid but the acid made it more prominent or called my attention to it more so. Would seeing an eye doctor help with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would definitely see an optometrist with that concern in case its progressive and only coincidentally related to when you dropped acid. They will be able to determine if this is being caused by damage or swelling of the optic nerve and its extensions into the brain. If your doctor has further suspicions they may refer you to a neuro-ophthalmic specialist who can take images to rule out any problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhh. What if you have fairly prominent visual static and never really bothered about it? I see an optometrist every three years or so but never brought it up.</p>
<p>The night sky looks like tv static in color. I can't see stars. I thought this was normal until a year or so ago, husband just gave me a wtf look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Visual Snow perhaps?  If you've had it all your life, google it, there are some good examples.</p>
<p>If so, it's neurologists or neuro-ophthalmologists that you want to see, but only a few deal with it.  It's pretty rare, but there's a wealth of information once you know the specific name of the condition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>visual static another term for visual snow, which I said I had. Thanks for the advice and I'll look into those specialists after I see an optometrist (never had my eyes checked so might as well)  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're confusing accommodation and vergence. Accommodation is what we use to focus on near targets, but if we're looking at a distance (or in a pitch black room) there is no stimulus for the eyes to accommodate. </p>
<p>You're thinking of tonic and proximal vergence, which is the amount our eyes have to turn in (or out) in order to align both eyes on a target. Without any stimulus for accommodation OR vergence, the eyes naturally move to their tonic phoric posture, which is just a fancy way of saying the direction the eyes turn when all of the ocular muscles are relaxed. </p>
<p>So the answer is it's different for everyone, but a simple answer is the eyes aren't focused on anything, but just relaxed and pointing in whatever direction they feel like while waiting for something to look at.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the clarification. I recall learning that there is tonic and proximal vergence AND tonic and proximal accommodation. The two are related since converging will also cause accommodation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree that the two are related in that one can help to drive the other, in the absence of a stimulus I don't think accommodation plays much, if any, of a role in the resting position of the eyes.</p></div>		</li>
