<p>First, there's nothing in physics that says you can't have a perpetual motion machine. You just can't extract any energy from it and have it move forever, because whatever you're using to create energy will add resistance to the system.</p>

<p>Except that a perpetual motion machine is a device which produces work indefinitely without energy input, not just something that moves forever.  It's a confusing name, but for it to be a true perpetual motion machine you have to be extracting energy from it, which is impossible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are lots of things in engineering that say you cannot have a perpetual motion machine. The assumptions needed to make a physically stable perpetual motion device dont translate to the real world (perfectly insulated frictionless systems). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He is getting at the idea that perpetual motion is not impossible in theory. Discussing the engineering limitations is misleading. If people think that the human's ability to make such a machine that generates infinite energy is why they are failing, then people will keep trying. But in truth, an object resists changing it's speed, even to slow it down. But in the 'real world' that is hard to see intuitively since we always see objects slowing down due to friction etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is though. Entropy-free systems don't exist.</p>

<p>A perpetual motion device would still be a perfect battery. You could theoretically retrieve stored energy with 100% efficiency, and the limitations to its existance are practical  (and massively so).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your first paragraph is still off a bit. Nothing in nature, not even a deep space drumstick, not even the planets themselves can achieve perpetual motion. For one, it's impossible to create a perfect vacuum - there will always be some small resistance to motion.   Gravity waves also sap kinetic energy, albeit extremely slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal environment with ideal objects, it's theoretically possible. On the other hand, perpetual motion machine is impossible even in ideal (theoretical) conditions. That's the big difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as someone mentioned below, it's also assumed that perpetual motion machine assumes energy creation. My point was that on paper you can have a pendulum that oscillates forever by setting mu = 0, but no equation will allow you to generate energy for free.</p></div>		</li>
