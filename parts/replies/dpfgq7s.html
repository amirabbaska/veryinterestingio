			<div class="markdown"><p>Pardon me if this is explained in your sources, since I didn't even study biology in college they're a bit over my head - but why speculate? Couldn't this be tested quite easily by just comparing the mitochondrial DNA of a child born through surrogacy with the DNA of the genetic mother and surrogate mother? Forensic Files always made it sound pretty simple (though I assume expensive, nonetheless).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chimerism has been successfully tested for a few times, though fetomaternal chimerism is a little harder to test for because the amount of genetic material that passes through is far less than in other types of chimerism.</p>
<p>I wrote a paper about this and its relation to personal identity and some other things.  Granzen's paper <a href="http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1485&amp;context=student_scholarship" target="_blank"><em>The Human Chimeria: Legal Problems Arising From Individuals with Multiple Types of DNA</em></a> does a good job ELI5 the few most noted types of chimerism and how they differ, as well as a few case studies that revolve around tetragametic chimerism.</p>
<p>The short answer, FMC (fetomaternal microchimerism) possibly occurs in every pregnancy.  So the surrogate very likely shares a small amount of DNA with the fetus and, in fact, the surrogate likely also has DNA within them from the fetus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the references provided they found the regular cell DNA of the surrogate in the child.</p>
<p>All mitochondrial DNA a person receives is from the egg.  It is the power plant of a cell so to speak with its own DNA.   It is a very useful tool for determining maternal ancestors.  </p>
<p>Using this to confirm the surrogate’s DNA in the baby is a slight side step from using the surrogates actual DNA. </p>
<p>Finding regular cell DNA of the surrogate in the baby is full and complete proof to the original question.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It has been speculated that mitochondrial dna may pass from mother to fetus in utero, even if they were not a genetic contributor to the embryo.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be helpful to provide a source for this because every science textbook I've ever read explained the mitochondria and its DNA as originating from the ovum (egg). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mitochondria definitely come in with the egg, the question is whether a few more wander in later on.  I've never actually heard that before, but weirder things have happened</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely NOT arguing, but just asking for more clarification of sorts. </p>
<p>How much of this actually affects the baby/genetics in the long run? Obviously, if the surrogate doesn't pass on some immunity, or something like that it could affect the baby, but how much of this lingers past, say, the first year or so?</p>
<p>The only reason I ask is because I know there are a lot of people who will dismiss surrogacy (which is usually only used if the mother cannot carry the baby herself-a potentially life threatening, and in my opinion, responsible move to make) as the same as adoption. This logic is flawed, yes, but how could one argue that none of the (perfectly factual) 'passing on' of the surrogates mitchondrial DNA or immunity to baby doesn't really 'matter' in the long run. I'm oversimplifying, I know, but I think you catch my drift.</p>
<p>edit: I mean in cases of using the fathers and mothers sperm and egg, but just 'baking' it in a different oven. Obviously if you use the surrogates dna then it's a whole different scenario.</p></div>		</li>
