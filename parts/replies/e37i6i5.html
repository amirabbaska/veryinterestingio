			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of major benefits of cancer research that extend beyond treating cancer itself.</p>
<p>1) Dual-use drugs and therapies: since cancer is a highly complex disease that requires a lot of innovation, some of the techniques used to deal with cancer can be applied to other types of diseases. Immune system related diseases and therapies are among the most prominent examples. <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/96/8/577/2521219" target="_blank">Here is a bit of an old article</a> detailing some of these dual-use drugs.</p>
<p>2) Learning how the body and how cells are wired: one of the most critical components to developing effective cancer treatments, especially in the recent era of &quot;personalized medicine,&quot; is to have a highly detailed schematic of how cells in our bodies work. The more we learn about how cancer hijacks cellular signaling networks, the more we form a basic understanding of how a disease that involves the dysregulation of those networks can be treated. In the process, we also can uncover multiple drug candidates that can be used for each part of the cellular signaling machinery. One example is the use of drugs that regulate the cells' antioxidant environment that may be candidates for cancer, diabetes, and inflammation, as they all have oxidative stress in common.</p></div>		</li>
