			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an American (California) living in Asia, and surprisingly I found people in the United States, California at least, exercise <em>more</em> than they do here in Asia.</p>
<p>The big difference I see is with diet and portion size. In the US entrees are huge compared to here in Asia, and the American diet consists of much more processed carbohydrates than the average Asian diet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smaller refrigerators, open air markets, lots of walking, decreased vehicle ownership - these can describe <em>many</em> parts of Europe.</p>
<p>In the US this kind of lifestyle is very limited. Which is what I see as the difference that leads to obesity vs Europe.</p>
<p>Exactly where I lived in Europe is irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very relevant because Europe has obesityâ€‹ rates like we (USA) do. 50% of men and women in the WHO region of Europe are over weight. But there is big differences between the various countries. Walking isn't going to solve the obesity problem at all so that is irrelevant. Open air markets? My cities has all these things. Doesn't mean anything for my country as a whole</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the UK. Not many open air markets at all, most people eat like shit. But then again, we are right below them in obesity.</p></div>		</li>
