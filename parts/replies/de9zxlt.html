			<div class="markdown"><p>And if it provided a strong return on investment, then it would be a simple matter to pay back the loans.  The truth is, a lot of people don't get a strong return on investment on the loans.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bubble is with the debtor, not the lender. Pretty much the only way an average college student is going to get their loans discharged is through death. Unlike, say, mortgages which can be discharged entirely through bankruptcy, student loans will follow you up to your grave. For lenders, student loans are an incredibly sure return. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is a particularly good answer.  Student loans are a very risky investment generally (no collateral, limited credit history, high variance).  In context, they are even worse.  The federal government is getting their ass handed to them on direct student loans.  People just aren't paying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can almost never discharge the debt, it's a less risky investment. The Federal government can and will garnish your wages until you die if you're an able-bodied person with student loans. The expected loss then is much, much less than someone who can just declare bankruptcy and walk away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also are never required to repay the debt.  Just pay income-contingent repayment for 20 years.  They can be gone without ever touching a dollar of principal.</p>
<p>Even before that, they were very risky.  If they weren't, the government wouldn't have had to step in and first guarantee them and then directly loan them.</p></div>		</li>
