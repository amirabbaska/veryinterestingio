			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eyes can only see 3 colors, Red Green and Blue though they do get affected by other colors, so the color yellow will activate the green and red receptors in your eye. Thus can be &quot;faked&quot; by mixing other colors so a mix of green and red light you will also see as yellow. </p></div>		</li>
