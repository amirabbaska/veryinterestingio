			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this - from a cost point of view you want to trim your design down to what is strictly necessary!</p>
<p>Aside from the perspective of money, the instrumentation load out will vary drastically between missions because they are looking to make different observations. Even things like cameras tend to be substantially different across the space probes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just atteneded a seminar yesterday about how these are all good reasons for using additive manufacturing to build parts for use in space. Development time is cut down by a factor of two to three, it's more economical for all of the parts that are only ever used once, plus it allows for testing to be faster and cheaper than design analysis.</p>
<p>Edit: A few people seem to disagree with the feasibility of what I've mentioned. I'm just sharing what was said by a guy who works for NASA on this very topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's only 10% of explicit cost.  If you have the option to spend $10 on engineering to save $20 on launch (without adding additional risk), you do it.  End result is that while launch costs are only around 10% of the mission cost, that is, in large part, because the rest of the mission is scaled to most effectively make use of that launch budget.</p>
<p>If we were to see those costs drop drastically, I would also expect to see the mission costs drop as well, because it stops being viable to spend so much on engineering around it.  Additionally, lowered launch cost means a relatively lower consequence of failure, increasing failure tolerance and further lowering engineering costs.  Get it low enough ($100/kg -- and yes, I know that number is unrealistically low) and &quot;grad student project&quot; becomes something that can be sent off.  Amusingly enough, I would expect a project like that to still have a total cost around 10x the launch cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh no, your Elon Musk is leaking.</p>
<p>It's not the pricepoint to LEO that prevents them from using the same design over and over which is what the question was.</p>
<p>If you are building a probe for say a gaseous, low atmosphere, low sunlight planet like Jupiter or Saturn, the design and mission requirements of that probe are almost totally different than that of a probe intended to explore Mercury, Mars and Venus. That's the main reason they are always different. The mission requires them to be. I wouldn't send the same probe designed for a cold icy planet to a hot gaseous one. Also, the instrumentation and monitoring equipment is almost always purpose built and designed. Again, you're going to be looking for stuff one one planet that you might not be looking for on another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then why not send a dozen identical probes to the same place?  You only have to pay for the additional launches and hardware construction, but not the engineering, and you can be less cautious in operations since you have more rovers or satellites, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are missing the fact that there are teams of mission specialists working on each project. A space probe is not a drone. You need to choreograph what you want to do and how to do it many days in advance. You have to plan to use the least resources (for instance, you want to maximize the maneuver propellant). You have to plan the craft's orientation. You have to plan out the use of ground stations for transmitting commands and receiving data, none of which can be done with a simple radio setup.</p>
<p>The mission teams are fairly sizeable. Adding more probes would add to the complexity of the mission with less to gain than, say, taking the extra money in the budget and spending it on a different mission entirely. You might learn a bit more about, say, Mars, but not have the people or money for a Cassini.</p>
<p>This doesn't even take into account that what you learn on one mission tells you what to look for on the next mission.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The only reasons for that would be redundancy, in case one of the probes failed or for wide area coverage.</p>
<p>I see what you're trying to do, but even here, price point to LEO isn't even the main factor in why you don't send multiple identical probes. The main reason they don't is because they all do the same exact thing. There's no reason other than Redundancy and Coverage that would send multiple identical probes. Talk about a straw man argument if I've ever heard of one. And you best believe that if the mission called for multiple probes with wider coverage or redundancy, they would send them. I don't think people have quite understood that for the entirety of NASA's history, they really don't care about Costs. It's Mission above Cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but it's the pricepoint that makes it not worthwhile to send three.  Also, if weight was of minimal object, you could design a series of more general-purpose probes, and just not use parts of the functionality that aren't needed for that particular mission.</p></div>		</li>
