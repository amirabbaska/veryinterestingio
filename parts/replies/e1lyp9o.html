			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough there are two steps to the metabolism of ethanol, step one makes an intermediate that is responsible for most of the unpleasant things like flushing and headaches, and the second step turns that intermediate into something benign. </p>
<p>The expression and activity of those two enzymes determines how fast you make the intermediate and how quickly you get rid of it. It’s determined a lot by genetics, and that’s why some people tend to drink less than others.</p>
<p>Edit: removed a generalization regarding these genes’ distribution in Asians.</p></div>		</li>
