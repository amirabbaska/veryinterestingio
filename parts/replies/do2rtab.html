<p>That's retarded, and seems entirely unenforceable. But then again I live in Louisiana on a lake, so maybe I just don't understand how bad other states have water problems </p></div>		</li>

<p>And this is the issue here. People who bring this up as &quot;drastic government overreach&quot; don't seem to look at the reason why these things are in place. If you are in the middle of a drought you have to make sure everyone can get access to water.</p>
<p>What most people's minds run to in this case is a small plastic barrel connected to their gutters and can't fathom the harm being done with it. Which to an extent is true depending on how bad the drought is. But on the far other end you have people like <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/crime/rainwater.asp" target="_blank">Gary Harrington in Oregon, who collected so much water that he built 3 small lakes completed with stocked fish and boat docks on his property by damming off natural water flow</a>. You can see how this would have an effect on the surrounding areas' water tables.</p>
<p>Are there times when local governments go overboard? Sure. Does that mean that big government wants to come melt down your rain barrel right in front of you? Not too likely. They're probably more concerned with making sure some jaggoff isn't making it harder for all the people in the county to have adequate access to a water supply, just so he can have a 3rd private fishing lake.</p></div>		</li>
