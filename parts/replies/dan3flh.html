			<div class="markdown"><p>This. And all 3 components are the U.S. economy, and all parties are interested in keeping the game going, so they work together to make sure the Free Parking and passing Go come out to an amount that all players can keep on playing.</p>
<p>Basically, we owe that money to ourselves, and as long as we produce and collect the right amount of money, we can keep playing.</p>

One caution. The entire system/capitalism is based on growth. The second the system stops growing, the entire system will collapse. We got a hint of this with the housing crisis in 2008. The system stopped growing and shocked the rest of the markets. The system is ultimately based on finite resources, which will eventually run out or not be able to sustain the growth. Growth can't continue indefinitely. /rant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an apt analogy since the designer of Monopoly intends for sinks to be greater than the inputs so it becomes a race to be last to go bankrupt. </p>
<p>Then, most people who play invent crazy rules to get more money (free parking), but then the game never ends. I recall having to use 1's as 1000, and creating the option of double hotels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i like to use the simcity analogy. they start you off with like 20k or something silly. you can maybe build a power plant and some small areas to develop. lets say you earn 10% of your value back in taxes monthly, even ignoring the power plant cost, 2k. now you could continue the game like this an there is nothing wrong with it. or what you could do is borrow 100k and make 5% payments on the debt. 5k. but youll make 10k on the new developments you can afford. so now you are earning 12k a month, and paying 5k, net profit 7k. so the first year (assuming no further reinvestments) you can earn 24k without debt or 84k with debt. debt can be good, if you use the money for returns.</p></div>		</li>
