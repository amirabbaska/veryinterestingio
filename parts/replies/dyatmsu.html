<p>Why not let it get burned up in the atmosphere and have less clutter up there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a geostationary orbit it would need more fuel to bring it back down to an altitude where it would start to drop into the atmosphere and burn up. Fuel = money when the satellites life is determined by when it runs out of fuel so someone like direct tv or whatever would want to keep their satellite operational as long as possible to keep making money off the service it provides. I agree at some point it might be an issue but the dice junk/trash issues guy hear about at at much lower or it’s than these graveyard orbit. There is a LOT of space up there and it’s not really a problem to have them all drifting around endlessly in the graveyard. </p></div>		</li>
