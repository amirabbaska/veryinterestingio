			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story. I'm allergic to avocado and bananas. When I was 23 I got a new allergist through the health clinic at school. I told her that I had hay fever and asthma, and that avocados made me vomit and bananas made my mouth itch. She told me that I should avoid latex because avocado and banana trees are in the same family as latex trees. I recalled that while working at a daycare center recently my hands had gotten really itchy after wearing gloves while changing diapers. She then asked me about my experience with condoms. I was really caught off guard. Condoms hadn't been a problem... I mean, I KNEW that condoms were latex, but for some reason I never connected the way I felt after sex as attributed to a latex allergy. I thought that all girls felt <em>irritated</em> down there after sex and that it was just because I'd had fun and was feeling the aftermath of that; not that my VJay felt so sensitive and irritated because I might be having a mild allergic reaction to latex! </p>
<p>THe irritation wasn't so severe as to warrant any really big reaction, and I hadn't connected it because I was on the Nuva Ring and in a dedicated relationship at the time so condoms weren't as big of a thing, but after my first was born and we started using condoms again...BOY HOWDY did I feel it then!!! </p>
<p>Word from the wise, ladies: being sore from fun sex is more of an internal, achy feeling, not so much a burny, itchy, inflamed feeling....<em>sigh</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>Recently become allergic to avocado (haven't had any banana recently though - I will be so sad if I've developed a banana allergy too).  I'm going on a trip to visit my dad today and he lives near a pine forest. </p>
<p>Might as well test the pine sap theory whilst I'm there</p></div>		</li>

They used this plant so often it went extinct. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ruta was mentioned by Pliny and Hypocrates as an abortifacent. Modern studies show it is indeed very potent for that purpose, but also quite dangerous and with a low therapeutic index. Cachexia is a side-effect, causing death in a significant amount of test animals, according to some studies.</p>
<p>source: I was forced to make an extensive article about this plant for Med Shool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There <em>are</em> options for a non-latex 'safe' condom, one of which is <a href="http://www.skyn.com/en/Condoms.aspx" target="_blank">SKYN</a></p>
<p>I highly recommend them over lambskin for the stated reason.</p></div>		</li>
