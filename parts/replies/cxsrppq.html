In fact, if you were to take a photo from space, you <a href="http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae323.cfm" target="_blank">wouldn't see any stars because the sun is far too bright</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also you can triangulate a fix on known stars and the moon.  If it is just a shot of the moon you'd need another point of known reference in 3d Space.</p>
<p>Short answer yes you can!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This would be something! You're probably looking for the word 'dual' by the way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To follow up on your comment, if you can get a fairly precise latitude then you may be able to identify some features in the photo like distant mountain ranges and the relative elevation of the observer. That only works assuming your method gives a pretty good idea of the angle the camera was at when the picture was taken relative to the earth surface. Once you have two earth surface features along that latitude you can do a topographic cross-section through that latitude using digital elevation model data and narrow down the location a bit more by excluding any place where those two elevations aren't more or less in the right place along that latitude. This can be done with statistics if you have the DEM data.</p>
<p>This is a pretty neat question! I never really thought about it but with a single photograph showing the moon you could, potentially narrow search down to a few hundred specific locations around the world just by using math. That's a small enough list to check by a human!</p></div>		</li>
