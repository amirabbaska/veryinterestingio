			<div class="markdown"><p>Do this for (5 min):</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Concentrate on feeling the tip of your nose</li>
<li>Step 2: Inhale and count one</li>
<li>Step 3: Exhale and count two</li>
<li>Step 4: Repeat until ten and start over</li>
<li>Condition: When (not if) you lose your concentration, return to breath and start over</li>
</ul>
<p>Do this every day for twenty minutes. <strong>This is just like exercising a muscle.</strong></p>
<p>After a few weeks or months of daily concentration exercise, it will have profound life-altering effects on all aspects of your life. It rarely takes more than a few months for people, who consistently do concentration meditation to see great benefit. So don't take my word for it - see for yourself.</p>
<p>You can say this first big step because it means having a clear mind. You could say this is a tamed monkey.</p>
<p>But of course, it doesn't end there. Your monkey will still act up sometimes.</p>
<p>If a tamed monkey is an enlightenment, then that process is simple too.</p>
<p>Once you have good concentration described above, you can start to concentrate on three things </p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>impermanence</strong> of everything</li>
<li><strong>Suffering</strong></li>
<li>Your concept of having or owning a <strong>self</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And once you make good progress with that, you can concentrate on these things happening very rapidly (faster than ten times per second).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Material forms</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The sensation of either good or bad</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Labeling things (eg. green tree frog)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Conditioned things (eg. avoid that poisonous frog)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li><strong>Consciousness</strong></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The enlightenment formula at the end of the path is:</p>
<p>Concentrate on consciousness</p>
<p>WHILE</p>
<p>Having correct understanding of suffering, impermanence, and self</p>
<p>At this point there is no monkey left to tame and you can know the reason for all of your emotions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand. Many people will say they feel both at the same time. With more concentration, you will see the separation. It is inevitable to find, and I urge you to keep trying to find a separation.</p>
<p>Let me give you a tip. Try to focus intensely on the tip of time - the now of the feeling. Intensely focus on the feeling NOW. If you are delayed, the sensations will merge.</p></div>		</li>
