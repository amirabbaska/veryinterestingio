			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Actually, LED lights are some of the most efficient grow lights because they use less electricity (due to not using green light), produce less heat (a factor you want to consider if you're growing anything in an enclosed space), and provide only the spectrum you need. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.gelighting.com/LightingWeb/apac/news-and-media/press-room/press-releases/2014/Japan%20Case.jsp" target="_blank">Here's a link to provide an example of a real-world application of LEDs to grow plants</a></p>
<p>Another cool fact is that most plants have sleeping cycles - basically they need an uninterrupted period of little to no light where they are allowed to &quot;rest&quot;. Some plants can go without it, but for a plant to maintain its natural cycle of life, it's better to have this rest. Any light during this time will disturb the plant and stress it out; it won't die, but it will not grow as fruitfully if continuously disturbed like this. However, if you shine a green-spectrum only light on them during sleep time, it will not disturb them much. This practice is often employed by pot growers to check on their plants during sleepy time without disturbing them :D </p>

<p>It's pretty easy to deduce that the green light is what's being <em>reflected</em> after seeing this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's even easier to deduce this by observing the fact that plants ARE green under regular sunlight.</p></div>		</li>
