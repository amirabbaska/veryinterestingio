<p>Edit:. My most upvoted comment is now about pepper seeds.  Nice. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Birds lack the protein (ion channel TRPV1) involved in the sensation of hot peppers (capsaicin), so they simply do not perceive 'hot' like most mammels do, so they have no reason not to eat the spicy food. Plants prefer their seeds to be eaten by birds, because they fly far and spread their seeds in their droppings over a large area. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, though I've heard it has more to do with how we handle the pooping. Birds apparently don't have control over when they let it out, so they are more likely to spread the seeds wider.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be!</p>
<p>I was thinking of herbs like oregano and thyme but peppers probably use the same strategy against some other animal.</p>
<p>As a side note, the pepper we eat are berries, which are used to reproduce so it can be good for them to get eaten so they can spread easily, but spices like oregano are leaves that don't gain anything from being eaten, so there might be some difference there.</p>
<p>Edit: I read pepper as in black pepper, not as in chili peppers, just for the record.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Works on grazing animals too... for example the 'humble birch' is in fact mildly toxic to animals and insects that eat it, such as rabbits and hares, that if they eat only birch leaves and shoots they will die... the trick is, that as long as they eat other plants on the side toxins in Birch bark and leaves won't kill them because lapines are adapted to eat it to an extent -especially at winter when there's nothing else fresh available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever heard of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synsepalum_dulcificum" target="_blank">miracle berries</a>?  After consuming them our tongues lose the ability to taste some types of sour/bitter flavors.  Straight up lemons and limes are some of the most delicious citrus you can imagine when you aren't overpowered by the sourness.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Vinegar also becomes almost a sweet drink after a treatment with miracle fruits.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>from the wikipedia article it seems that the miracle berry binds to the taste buds and induces the sensation of sweetness when in a low-ph (acidic) enviroment.<br />
makes me a bit sad that you don't actually get to know the taste of a lemon without the sourness, but rather an over-the-top sweetness due to how the berry works.<br />
still very cool though and i'll definitely try it out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool, but I disagree with the ending conclusion.</p>
<p>I have no issues with genetically modified food through breeding. I have issues with genetically modified food where the plant dna is combined with virus or bacteria dna and then patented and used to manipulate and abuse agricultural industries.</p>
<p>If the genetic modification is simply crossbreeding or editing the existing dna wirh nothing added in, that's fine. The other method is just risking something bad down the line that will catch up to us, like Colony Collapse Disorder. There is a lot of interesting studies being done on accumulated dna damage through generations of exposure to low levels of harmful aubstances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard this was a wide spread problem, but supposing it's true. Most citrus is propogated through grafting. They take a citrus variety that creates an exceptionally well developed root system but produces shitty fruit and graft in a branch from a delicious citrus tree. What may sometimes happen is the section of the tree used for the root system will get a branch of its own to grow and produce fruit. I suspect your lemon tree was grafted to a bitter orange</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right.  Im not saying its a problem, just saying that's why it's so common. At least in Phoenix it is.  I see em all over. Half lemon half bitter orange. Someone obviously must've grafted one onto the other at some point.</p></div>		</li>
