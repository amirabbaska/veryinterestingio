			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your answer the best. The only thing that I would add is that  composites like kevlar, fiberglass, carbon fiber, and all the other variants have properties that allow you to do really interesting things like; form them into very precise shapes with the proper tools and equipment, you can add filler materials like plywood or foam to increase the strength of your design without adding much weight, and you can adjust the composition to bring out the qualities that you desire.</p>
<p>Fiberglass or composite boats are a great example of this. Once you create the molds you can easily make thousands of very precise copies of the original design very cheaply. They used to use plywood as a filler material for fiberglass boat bulkheads because it is rigid, bulky, and, relatively light. Now they mostly use foam because it is even lighter and while it is not as rigid, it doesn't rot if it is exposed to water (this is a big problem with older fiberglass and ferrocement boats... a tiny puncture can let water into the filler material and wood filler will absorb water, becoming much heavier and will eventually rot to leave a void.) You can make incredibly strong bulkheads and structural components by sandwiching foam with many sheets of composite material. You can even add metal mesh, plates, and wire to armor areas that might experience trauma and to create hardpoints to mount equipment to your design like chain plates or motor mounts in a sailboat/motorboat. You can even add lead pellets or sand to the mix to balance your design or control its behaviour as forces are applied in different ways... extremely important for a sailboat or an airplane.</p>
<p>So, these materials can have fantastic strength and weight properties on their own, but when you add the ability to create intricate designs in ways that are easily replecateable and modifiable then you are able to build some really amazing things with these materials... you are almost building your design molecule by molecule through layering, shaping, and adding other materials and design elements. It's a whole different world when you compare it to building something out of wood or metal where the macro characteristics of your materials (their shape mostly) broadly affect your design and construction methods. It's truly a whole different way of building something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy has the right of it. As an Army airframe tech, we use a lot of advanced composites (Kevlar and Carbon Fiber mainly) and the ply orientation, resin qualities and your base fiber material are all factored into the shear/tensile/compressive strength calculations when applying them on an aircraft, while still keeping weight to a minimum. And just a note - working with Kevlar/Aramid sucks. The low surface adhesion of the fibers makes it so though the resulting composite is extremely strong for tensile and shear strength, any impact creates microcracks in the resin, and delamination begins almost immediately. Kevlar doesn't want to stick to anything, including itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not lying about the fray factor. Ridiculous. Carbon I've found the resin saturation ratio and a proper vacuum is key to a solid bond</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kevlar is anti-abrasive, so in addition to what you stated, it's also a bitch to cut since it resists being cut by a diamond tipped abrasive saw.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This matrix can be a lot of things, such as thermosets (can be separated from the fiber with heat) such as epoxy (most commonly used), phenolic, bmi, etc and thermoplastics (can't be separated from the fiber with heat)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isnt it the contrary? Thermoplastics melt under heat and that property makes them recyclable. Thermosets are more resistant to heat than thermoplastics (will burn under a flame instead of melting)</p>
<p>I am a student in aircraft maintenance and I currently have a class on composite materials.</p>
