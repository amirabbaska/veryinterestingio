			<div class="markdown"><p>What came first?  The chicken or the egg?  As glaciers advanced and receded wouldn't they repeatedly wear down newer rocks on the north side until all that's left is the older, non sedimentary stuff.  That detritus would be left at the end of the glacier and become part of the sediment in new rock formation.  And wouldn't the rising of the mountain systems in the Northeast, concurrent with the disappearing inland sea create more sedimentary rock than before?  Also I seem to recall that the basis for the great lakes was a tectonic fault.  It didn't create the lakes right away, but was a precursor to how they formed.  Would that have any effect on the different types of rock on either side of the divide?</p>
<p>These are all questions that I thought of based on the map and the theory given.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good questions! The glaciers came first and have been eroding in the north and moving that sediment south in the form of the recent sediment covering much of the upper Midwest. Some of the rock has also been transported down rivers as sand and as dissolved ions. When the next glaciation occurs the current large/Great Lakes may also be obliterated...except for Superior, itâ€™s so deep that the bottom is below sea level! What will probably happen is that the next rounds of glaciers will continue to erode out the Mid Continent Rift that the Lake Superior basin is just a small part of, leaving a handlebar mustache looking lake running from Kansas up thru Minnesota and down into Michigan.</p>

<p>And for those not paying attention that rift formed about 1 billion years ago.  Since then there has been the formation and breakup of 5 supercontinents.</p>
