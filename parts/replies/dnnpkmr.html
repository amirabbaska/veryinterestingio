			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome explanation.</p>
<p>I think the Star Wars films portray this in a really obvious way. Shortly after the characters commit some horrible deed that puts them squarely in &quot;evil&quot; territory, something happens to horribly disfigure them. After Palpatine murdered Mace Window he becomes withered and creepy. After Anakin strangles Padme he gets his face burned off. </p>
<p>I actually dislike when movies play on the whole ugly = bad trope. It feels weird, like they are banking on the fact that people tend to dislike unattractive people to drive the audience's hate for their villain. I love when they reverse it and make ugly/disfigured characters pure hearted and vice versa. </p>
<p>Which is why I think it would be really refreshing if now that Kylo Ren has killed his father he doesn't show up suddenly grotesque in the next movie, but I kind of suspect he might.</p>
<p>Edit: I just remembered it already happened, Rey literally disfigured him by slicing up his face after he murdered Hans. Dammit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. It was also a form of punishment throughout history and mythology. </p>
<p>Blinding was a common form of punishment in the Middle Ages. Depending on the crime, it may have been just one eye. </p>
<p>So being blind in one eye was associated with thievery, murder etc.. </p>
<p>Hence &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that 'an eye for an eye' is from the code of Hammurabi. The bronze age predates the middle ages by 2000 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forms of it have been around for thousands of years. Not necessarily the term itself. The Babylonians had a method where the punishment was no worse than the crime. </p>
<p>But my point about the Middle Ages was in regards to the eye patch question. Many superstitions from that time are still prevalent today. Like knocking on wood to prevent ill fortune. </p></div>		</li>
