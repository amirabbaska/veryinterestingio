			<div class="markdown"><p>There are ways that a massive core of a gas giant might get exposed though. For example a close orbit around its star might lead to the atmosphere being siphoned away from the gas giant, leaving only the rocky core behind. I believe we have observed such with binary stars where one is feeding on the other.</p>
<p>I also wonder what happens if a gas giant is hit directly by a massive coronal mass ejection, or even nova.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Siphoning off gas to fall into the star seems less likely than gas being blown off and away like a comet's tail, in my opinion. That said, we don't really know. There are quite a few &quot;hot jupiters&quot; with such mass and Orbital parameters- maybe someday we will find out!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This didn't answer his question though. He wants to know if a planet can be as big as Jupiter or the Sun. Your answer seems to just say it would have a relatively larger atmosphere anyway. Are you just saying yeah there could be one but it wouldn't look like Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would end up being a gas giant, with a rocky core of relatively insignificant mass (10 Earths or so) inside. Calling that a solid planet would be silly.</p></div>		</li>
