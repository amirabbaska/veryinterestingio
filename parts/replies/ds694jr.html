<p>Face masks very likely do help prevent transmission from you to others <em>when worn correctly</em>, but most people don't wear them correctly. The most recent study I know of (not saying there haven't been others, I don't follow this too closely) concluded</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At week 3 and onward, significantly reduced ILI rates were observed in the face mask and hand hygiene group  ... <strong>Statistically significant findings were not observed for the face mask only group when compared to the control group</strong></p>

<p>It's not going to hurt, and it might help, but regularly washing your hands is simpler and much more effective than wearing a mask.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that the people that you see wearing the masks are sick. They are putting on a mask so as to not infect others.</p>
<p>I've also heard that the masks are worn in polluted areas to help mitigate the smog. </p>
<p>I am not confident in the validity of either of those statements and I've no first hand experience to back up what I've said. Has anyone experienced this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, as I say it's not a &quot;single fixed value&quot;. R0 changes constantly.  When you see a number like &quot;6&quot; you can more or less interpret it to mean that &quot;In an outbreak, each newly infected person will infect 6 more people&quot;. But &quot;an outbreak&quot; isn't a permanent state. Once your population is immune, or when the humidity drops, or once blood-exposure rules are put in place, the R0 (hopefully) drops to less than one. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050042" target="_blank">this paper</a>, for example, the authors looked at R0 for malaria in many different conditions, and found numbers between 1 and 3000 (!). Obviously you can't have a disease with an R0 of 3000 for very long before everyone is dead, immune, or already infected. </p>
<p>On an multi-year time scale, many diseases (influenza, for example) probably have an &quot;R0&quot; (in quotes because &quot;R0&quot; is not actually used under those conditions -- but talking conceptually here) that's pretty close to 1 -- but that's not useful for describing outbreaks. You generally are using R0 under conditions where there's an outbreak of some kind, so it's still useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well put. </p>
<p>A simple way to model how these dynamics change is the SIR model. Susceptible-infected-recovered. R0 is highly dependent on the percentage of susceptible individuals in a population, so as an outbreak progresses, the potential to infect other people shrinks.</p>
<p>So another way to think of R0 is as the number of <em>potential</em> new infections from each infected person; at the tail end of an outbreak, many of those exposures would be to &quot;recovered&quot; people who are no longer susceptible, slowing the spread of whatever disease. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the RO is for when the contagion is &quot;brand new&quot;. Eventually you just run out of people (because humans interact with a finite and insular amount of people) that haven't been exposed and are either already sick or immune. It's kinda complicated math wise, but there's a lot of work done on it if you are interested. If each human infected 6 random humans all around the earth, you're right, it would pretty much get everyone. But since we tend to stay in a certain geographical area and interact with only certain people, it fizzles out. Like how a whole family and their kids class get sick but their neighbors are fine if they don't have kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I've now clarified that R0 really isn't used to describe long-term, equilibrium-type situations, but the concept is still useful to think about.</p>

<p>A classic example of this is measles, pre-vaccination.  Measles has a truly spectacular ability to transmit -- it may be the most contagious disease we know of; its R0 is around 15 -- which means that it burns through susceptible victims at a great rate, leaving a firebreak of immune people behind it.  See the epidemic charts I made from historical data <a href="http://www.iayork.com/MysteryRays/2010/03/16/measles-week-part-ii-emerging-disease/" target="_blank">here</a>.  You have huge peaks and valleys of disease, as enough susceptible children emerged and then got all infected at once.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to plug the 2011 movie <em><a href="http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1598778/" target="_blank">Contagion</a></em>. It's my favorite infectious disease movie. Had science advisors they seemed to listen to, they explain R0 well, and it's filled with a great cast. The movie follows investigating and responding to a deadly disease outbreak from a much more realistic perspective than most. It's also the only disease movie I've seen that gives a spotlight to highlight how dangerous people cashing in with pseudoscience/alternative medicine can be. </p></div>		</li>
