			<div class="markdown"><p>It appears that article you quoted, pulled those data from the abstract of [this session at the 2017 GSA Annual Meeting] (<a href="https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/webprogram/Paper300667.html" target="_blank">https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/webprogram/Paper300667.html</a>).  Maybe they just tried to sensationalize what they read in the abstract, bending some of key concepts to make it sound like the world is ending.  He's got some good points and solid reasoning behind them, but I can't say for sure because I haven't studied any of that type of thing in a decade or more.</p>
<p>It's probably easier to read directly from his abstract than trying to decipher what written in that article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On five occasions in the past century a 25-30% increase in annual numbers of Mw≥7 earthquakes has coincided with a slowing in the mean rotation velocity of the Earth, with a corresponding decrease at times when the length-of-day (LoD) is short. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having said that, he did write this for a conference.  Nobody attends sessions at a conference that don't sound Earth-shattering-ly amazing (pun not intended), so even he threw in some crazy emphasis in his abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The correlation between Earth's angular deceleration (d[LoD]/dt) and global seismic productivity is yet more striking, and can be shown to precede seismicity by 5-6 years, permitting societies at risk from earthquakes an unexpected glimpse of future seismic hazard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The paper he's referencing, and many other things he's published, <a href="http://paleoseismicity.org/has-roger-bilham-been-deported-from-india-because-of-his-seismic-hazard-warnings/" target="_blank">have gotten him into some hot water over the years</a>.  I can't seem to find any peer reviews for any of his work, but he's a professor at the University of Colorado and he's referenced plenty of times as an earthquake specialist.</p>
<p>There are also some related/similar articles (I mean that by the media is blowing them out of proportion in whichever direction, instead of hearing of reading the science and understanding his words), like <a href="http://www.academia.edu/23927109/Corruption_kills" target="_blank">this one crediting him with calling out the corruption that's killing poor countries worldwide, including the Haitian people that didn't listen to his earthquake predictions</a>.  </p>
<p>This also <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/interview/scientists-downplay-earthquake-risks/article4670854.ece" target="_blank">isn't the first time that someone has sensationalized his work</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Woah, imagine the havoc an earthquake prediction 5-6 years in the future would have on an economy. That's material for a good book.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just want to point out correlation is not causation here- just because an increase in earthquakes happened to occur at the same time as a change in the Earth' s rotation, there could be (and likely are) a number of other factors at play here. However, thing such as the closeness of the moon can influence magnetic orientation, so heck who knows. Would be interested if anyone can find more articles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tidal forces do slow down the Earth's rotation a very small, mostly consistent amount.</p>
<p>But earthquakes and weather patterns (or something else) can cause the rotation to vary a bit. Computer time uses <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second" target="_blank">leap seconds</a> (not leap days) to correct for this variability.</p>
<p>Edit: Leap seconds also correct for the slow consistent amount of slow down. Any change to the rotation of the earth that causes the start of a day to be off by a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Changes in axial tilt take place over a few thousand years (24 thousand or so for a full cycle of the most rapid of those changes, 42 thousand or so for a full cycle of the next most rapid) and <em>might</em> have an effect on earthquakes.  </p>
<p>Haven't looked into that link so I can t say one way or another.</p>
<p>I'd suspect that the article may have meant axial tilt rather than the billion+ year rotational slowdown in rotation.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>No, them actually mean rotation speed. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/10/sloshing-earth-s-core-may-spike-major-earthquakes" target="_blank">Here is a better article on the subject</a></p>
