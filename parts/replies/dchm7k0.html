			<div class="markdown"><p>Very curious if anyone could provide any answer to this. I had a very small brown birthmark on the shin of one leg and the back calf of the other. Throughout high school, they got a bit bigger. By the time I was in college, both of my legs from the knee down looked basically covered with freckles, and are completely brown in some spots. I don't think it's expanded much since then, but considering both were relatively small when I was a kid, and definitely weren't as &quot;freckly&quot; or spotty.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter was born with Sturge-Weber Syndrome. She has a large port wine stain on her ride cheek and neck and she has seizures. This is a great explanation of the origin of my daughter's birthmark:
&quot;Though SWS is present at birth, it isn’t an inherited condition. Instead, it’s the result of a random mutation in the GNAQ gene.</p>
<p>The blood vessel formations associated with SWS start when a baby is in the womb. Around the sixth week of development, a network of nerves develops around the area that will become a baby’s head. Normally, this network goes away in the ninth week of development. In babies with SWS, however, this network of nerves doesn’t go away. This reduces the amount of oxygen and blood flowing to the brain, which can affect brain tissue development.&quot; from Healthline Website (<a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/sturge-weber-syndrome#Overview1" target="_blank">http://www.healthline.com/health/sturge-weber-syndrome#Overview1</a>)</p>
<p>May I ask what kind of problems your birthmark is causing? You can message me privately if you don't want to discuss it here but I would like to know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem,  I have had to wear braces in preparation for a jaw realignment surgery and then a surgery on the upper side of my face to help fix the way I look and eye problems I have had that has caused significant pain but luckily no permanent damage to the eye.  I have also had about 12 sessions of laser surgery as I was growing up. I can not recommend laser surgery enough as it has faded the birthmark drastically, the only side affected being some puffiness and swelling for a few days. The birthmark also duplicated on the inside of my mouth,  but luckily did not reach my brain.  Feel free to ask me anything </p>
<p>Sorry about your daughter and hope she out grows the symptoms </p></div>		</li>
