			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's correct, but I'd imagine the Earth would have to be pretty much tidally locked to get to the point that losses due to gravitational waves dominate the interaction.</p>
<p>In practical terms the system may never get to that point, because the Moon may escape Earth before the tidal forces stop being the dominant interaction. I think that would make for a really awesome physics problem, wish I knew enough math to work that out lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're generally right, but the moon can't escape Earth in this way. The Sun <em>will</em> expand to reach Earth's orbit before Earth can tidally lock, however. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will be in tidal equilibrium, but the orbit will still emit gravitational waves and, in isolation of other more dominant effects, decay. The effect will still be small (and the sun will expand to the Earth's orbit long before the Earth/moon system reaches this point anyway). GW radiation happens for all accelerating masses, even a dribbled basketball or jazz hands. It's a negligible effect for systems like Earth/moon, but it's technically there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the Gravitational Waves causing the orbital configurations to lose energy - or is it the energy lost by a specific orbital configuration can be emitted in gravitational waves? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth/Moon tidal interaction is energy neutral (Earth rotational energy + Moon kinetic energy + Moon gravitational potential energy = constant), it's just that Earth rotational energy is being converted to Moon kinetic/grav potential energy (which define orbital height). Gravitational waves cause the entire system to slowly lose energy over time, it's just that the Moon's orbital energy increases are larger than the decrease due to gravitational waves.</p>
<p>edit: hope that makes sense, my physics lingo isn't exactly up to snuff.</p></div>		</li>
