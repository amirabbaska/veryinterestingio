			<p>Once Earth's rotation has slowed down enough, doesn't this effect go away and the moon's orbit would start decaying?</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes that's correct, but I'd imagine the Earth would have to be pretty much tidally locked to get to the point that losses due to gravitational waves dominate the interaction.<br><br>In practical terms the system may never get to that point, because the Moon may escape Earth before the tidal forces stop being the dominant interaction. I think that would make for a really awesome physics problem, wish I knew enough math to work that out lol. </p>		</li>

			<p>You're generally right, but the moon can't escape Earth in this way. The Sun <em>will</em> expand to reach Earth's orbit before Earth can tidally lock, however. </p>		</li>

			<p>Here's my attempt at a really basic calc using highly simplified conservation of energy...<br><br>Earth's rotational kinetic energy: 2.138x10^29 J (Google)<br><br>If Earth's rotation were to be slowed to the point it was tidally locked with Moon, it would have to slow it's rotational velocity by approximately a factor of 30 (moon orbit ~ 1 month). Rotational energy proportional to angular velocity squared, therefore rotational energy would be 1/900 of current. Assume all rotational energy transferred to Moon kinetic energy for simplicity.<br><br>Moon mass: 7.35x10^22 kg<br>Moon velocity: 1022 m/s<br>Moon kinetic energy = 1/2mv^2 = 3.84x10^28 J<br><br>If all of Earth's angular kinetic energy was converted to Moon kinetic energy...<br><br>What is Moon's resulting velocity?<br><br>E2 - E1 = 2.138x10^29 J<br><br>1/2mv2^2 - 1/2mv1^2 = 2.138x10^29 J<br><br>v2 = SQRT(2.138x10^29 J + 3.84x10^28 J)<em>2/7.35x10^22 kg) = 2619 m/s<br><br>Escape velocity of Earth at Moon's orbit<br>ve = SQRT(2</em>G*Me/r) = 1481 m/s &lt; 2619 m/s<br><br>Therefore, it would seem that it might be possible for the Moon to escape the Earth's influence if 100% of Earth rotational kinetic energy was converted to Moon's kinetic energy. Now I'm not saying that it would, because clearly there's some oversimplifications in the above calc (not 100% conversion due to energy loss in deformation of Earth, calc assumes all energy transferred to moon at once instead of gradually over time). Just saying it might be possible.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>That's the right approach, but there are other important things that also need to be taken into account, like angular momentum conservation (which is just as fundamental as energy conservation here). When you take that into account, you will find that the Moon can't escape Earth's orbit. <br><br>So let's do a similar calculation with conservation of angular momentum:<br><br> - Earth's total rotational angular momentum is L_Earth 7.1e33 kg m^2 / s <br><br> - Moon's current orbital angular momentum is L_orbit 2.9e34 kg m^2 / s<br><br> - Total Earth + Moon L_t = 3.6e34 kg m^2 / s<br><br>The effective gravitational potential for any orbit is U_eff = L^2 / 2mr^2 -  GMm/r. Escape happens at U_eff =0 or higher, giving the condition <br><br>    L^2 = GMm/r * 2mr^2<br>    L^2 = 2GMm^2 r<br>    L = 4e34 kg m^2 / s<br><br>So the critical value of angular momentum needed for the Moon to come unbound is higher than the angular momentum available in the Earth+Moon system.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks! When I started to do my calc I was thinking I should use conservation of angular momentum, but I couldn't figure out how to make that work. So, where'd you learn that?</p>		</li>

			<p>That particular form usually comes up in the first classical mechanics course in undergrad, same course as Lagrangian mechanics. I think this is actually a fairly common homework problem, asking for the equilibrium orbital solution. My PhD was on binary evolution (among other things), though, specifically in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs - hence the user name). </p>		</li>

			<p>No, the earth will slow down until it is tidally locked to the moon at which point the system will be in equilibrium.</p>		</li>

			<p>The moon is, the same side of it always faces the earth.  But not the other way around, the earth rotates faster than the moon orbits, so the side of earth facing the moon always changes.  Given enough time, the earth would be locked with the moon as well, so it always had the same side facing the moon.</p>		</li>

			<p>The moon is already tidally locked with earth, OP is referring to a mutual tidal locking between Earth and the Moon, where the length of a day has increased and the length of a lunar month has shortened until the two are the same.<br><br>In other words where they are both tidally locked to each other and thus each keeps the same face towards the other.<br><br> However, Earth is not expected to become tidally locked to the Moon before the Sun becomes a red giant and engulfs Earth and the Moon.</p>		</li>

			<p>It will be in tidal equilibrium, but the orbit will still emit gravitational waves and, in isolation of other more dominant effects, decay. The effect will still be small (and the sun will expand to the Earth's orbit long before the Earth/moon system reaches this point anyway). GW radiation happens for all accelerating masses, even a dribbled basketball or jazz hands. It's a negligible effect for systems like Earth/moon, but it's technically there. </p>		</li>

			<p>Are the Gravitational Waves causing the orbital configurations to lose energy - or is it the energy lost by a specific orbital configuration can be emitted in gravitational waves? </p>		</li>

			<p>The Earth/Moon tidal interaction is energy neutral (Earth rotational energy + Moon kinetic energy + Moon gravitational potential energy = constant), it's just that Earth rotational energy is being converted to Moon kinetic/grav potential energy (which define orbital height). Gravitational waves cause the entire system to slowly lose energy over time, it's just that the Moon's orbital energy increases are larger than the decrease due to gravitational waves.<br><br>edit: hope that makes sense, my physics lingo isn't exactly up to snuff.</p>		</li>
