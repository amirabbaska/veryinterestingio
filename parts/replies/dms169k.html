			<div class="markdown"><p>The industrial revolution was driven by the heat engine. To build a heat engine you need to understand how to get work out of heating and cooling a gas and you need the skilled workers who can put it all together.</p>
<p>2000 years ago, gunpowder wasn't known so understanding that you could propel an object by lighting a fire wasn't part of the common body of knowledge.  Even after gunpowder had been invented, it took awhile to realize you could move objects like bullets with it. Being able to conceive and build a rifle  took skills.</p>
<p>Once we had gunpowder and figured out we could shoot things with it, it took awhile to understand that instead of shooting bullets we could shoot pistons in an enclosed space by heating and cooling a gas. Same basic principal but entirely different application. The engineering skill to build the piston, cylinder and seals were higher than what you needed to build a rifle. It took time to develop those skills.</p>
<p>Moreover, once you've understood the basic physics and have enough skilled workers to start building a heat engine, you need capital and time to carry you while you make the inevitable mistakes.  Accumulating those resources took time.</p>
<p>You also needed a market for a heat engine. We use engines because they save labor. If you live in a period where people are expendable, labor is cheap. When the plague hit Europe, 3 out of 10 workers died which made labor expensive enough to justify looking for alternatives. </p>
<p>Bottom line is it took time for all the pieces to fall into place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good comment. I suspect, though, that this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You also needed a market for a heat engine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is the strongest part of your argument. In other words, economic factors. After all, a primitive sort of steam engine, the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeolipile" target="_blank">Aeolipile</a>, did exist at least <strong>two thousand</strong> years ago... basically, double the notional period given by OP!</p>
<p>Of course, the ancient world had no pressing need for such a device. I've seen this example used fairly often in popular science books, to illustrate just what we're discussing.</p>
<p>Had the pieces fallen differently, civilisation might have utilised steam engines before muskets appeared.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I use your gunpowder example, how much stuff is currently in our lives that is used somewhat commonly that would just require a small tweak that could change the world.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not entirely. It actually started with water power. It expanded to cover a lot more space with the heat engine and became a lot more efficient with the pairing of the electrical engine with the electrical grid instead of complex drive systems or large numbers.</p>
<p>The heat engine was definitely the start of a massive ramp up but most people peg the start of the whole industrial revolution to the idea of water powered machinery and its side effect of pulling previously unheard of numbers of people into major population centers to start passing ideas around for how to improve the machinery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>we don't know. short and simple. Plausible explanations of why Song China, for instance, did not accelerate, despite having a very advance knowledge base and meritocratic social structure, range from religion (very weak argument, and used to explain lack of capital formation) over to more circumstantial reasoning like the fact that coal deposits lay much deeper under the earth than in Europe, which </p>
<ul>
<li>arguably - made it difficult/impossible to access. Another argument stresses that Europe's warring tribes necessitated innovations in warfare, finance and finally governance, something the hegemonic, benign Chinese state circumvented, dulling their &quot;peaceful&quot; populus into a state of inactivity - while European tribes were literally innovating to survive.  But then again was the Western model the only plausible way toward accelerated growth? We don't know. We can't really &quot;test&quot; hypothesis in history like that. What we do know is that from a &quot;theory of civilisation&quot; standpoint, the Western civilisation, i.e. Renaissance onwards, is relatively young and positively dwarfed by the Minoan culture, which lasted for more than 2,500 years. We also know that some civilisations literally grow themselves into extinction by devouring natural resources unchecked (so who knows how long our hyper tech civilisation will actually last?). Lastly, some believe that human progress is cyclical. For instance philosophy (using the term to encompass all of Western thought) peaked in Ancient Greece and has just been &quot;rediscovered&quot;... scientific knowledge is obviously different, but equally a lot of mathematics was developed in Ancient Greece and simply &quot;built upon&quot;. Personally, If I was to list one single factor to explain Western success it would be this [one] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k1xY7v8dDQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4k1xY7v8dDQ</a>).</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as China, the one that James Burke used -- in addition to the smothering bureaucratic peace idea -- was that it boiled down to how China and the West saw the world.  It was either in his excellent series Connections (the first) or the also excellent The Day the Universe Changed.</p>
<p>It went something like this:</p>
<p>In the West, we developed the idea that God was rational and therefore His universe was rational.  And we figured that what you observe can translate to the rest of the universe.  If you built a model and it acted a certain way, then when you scaled it up it would still behave that way.  In other words, an observed experiment can lead to general knowledge about how everything behaves.</p>
<p>China, however, had a number of differing philosophical/religious concepts, including the one of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_\(Chinese_religion\)" target="_blank">shen</a>.  Under this line of understanding, every object in the universe had this immutable spirit that governed how it worked.  That means that if you make a model of the universe, it <em>won't</em> be translatable to the rest of the world because it's impossible to create a model and fill it with shen.  Experimentation, then, doesn't teach you anything.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Improvements to Earth's climate due to a long-term climate cycle, as we got farther and farther from the last ice age.</li>
<li>The long and painfully slow process of civilizations learning technology, most notably the progress from wooden tools to bronze tools to iron tools. This could have happened at any particular date, but it could not happen quickly -- too much to learn.</li>
<li>The invention, improvement, and spread of basic printing technology, leading to much greater sharing of knowledge and increase in learning. (The Internet of its day, though far slower.)</li>

The elimination of a huge amount of the populous allowed for loosening of cultural and economic norms and lead to opportunity for rapid change of the &quot;enlightenment&quot; era which directly lead to the scientific advancement that allowed industrialization.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor was how wood was used.  In a place like Britain they have tons of coal and dwindling forests.  Where as in China they had a ton of lumber so they never had to make the switch to coal (eventually falling way behind the west).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to cultural and demographic values, which are commonly overlooked by highly impactful. Innovation wasn't really encouraged in China, there was no incentive as patents were nonexistent. You create a steam engine in China? Cool, the elites steal your idea and you get zero credit, and are left being a poor man. In addition to the fact that inventors were far from promised ownership rights, there was really no incentive to invent in the first place, or even innovate. Efficiency would decrease the value of Slavery exploited by labor surpluses. Elites didn't like this.</p>
<p>Europe however encouraged innovation, or at least they allowed it. It's also a misconception that Europe was ahead. It wasn't until 1500 A.D did Europe finally take the lead as the worlds leader in technology. From the entire course of history up until that point, Europe was either behind, or barely even with the Middle East and Asia. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a combination of a lot of things, but the fall of the Roman Empire set the West behind by hundreds of years due to the political instability left in its wake.    All sorts of knowledge and technology were lost for a millennia when Rome fell apart.  For example, the Romans made giant, reinforced concrete buildings just like we do today, but the technology for concrete was lost for about 900 years and wasn't in widespread use until another 300 years after that.  Roman concrete was just as strong as our modern stuff (although they used brick structures as reinforcement whereas modern rebar is stronger).  During the Middle Ages, The Islamic and Chinese civilizations were far ahead of the West, but then the mongols obliterated the and set those civilizations back behind Europe.  Luckily for Europe, the Mongols decided to withdraw from their European campaign before making it to the intellectual centers of Europe (France, German states, Italian states).
Europe had been learning a lot of science from the Islamic world before the Mongols destroyed the Islamic world and Europe soon erupted into the Renaissance.  It wasn't until the Renaissance that science/technology really kicked off again.  </p></div>		</li>
