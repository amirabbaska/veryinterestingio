<p>When it rains, small depressions in the rock fill up with water and I often find what looks like tiny shrimp swimming around in the water.</p>

<p>Any chance they're <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triops" target="_blank">triops?</a></p>
<p>I used to go caving in central New Mexico, and there were cattle watering holes near Carrizozo that we'd check out when we were there. One was always swarming with triops; none of the others had them. I asked the rancher once, and he just shrugged. That one watering hole had them, but not the others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, not sure, i guess I haven't look at them close enough to say. They just look like shrimp to me, except really tiny, like rice grain size or smaller.</p>
<p>Are the cattle watering holes filled with water from a spring or well? The thing that makes we wonder about these is they are just in little puddles on a giant impermeable monolith of a rock which is only wet very infrequently, and there is nothing up there like cattle, even the pronghorn don't climb up. I guess birds must be taking them up there somehow, there are reservoirs 20 miles away or so. They survive some pretty dry and hot conditions for the majority of the year I guess. The little fish...I don't know how they survive that though since I know you can dry and ship &quot;sea monkeys&quot; but fish...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly some kind of fairy shrimp. We have them here in Ohio too. There are woodland vernal pools that completely dry in the summer, but refill with snow melt and spring rains for a couple months each year. During this time they fill up with fairy shrimp from eggs that laid dormant in the dry and then frozen soil for most of the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure the fish fry weren't tadpoles? Quite a few species of frogs and toads throughout Wyoming, actually, even at higher elevations. And especially on the prairie, much much more likely you were seeing tadpoles in ephemeral pools than fish fry. (I studied amphibians in Wyoming for a time)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That could be very likely actually, I'm not sure I know enough to tell the difference when they are that small, I just know they never seem to grow much before the water is gone. But I still am left with the question - how did they get there? The water is usually dry within a couple weeks so it doesn't seem like enough time for them to grow up and reproduce. It could be 5 miles or more to the next little temporary pond in some cases and maybe 20 to 30 miles from the nearest year round river or body of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's amphibians (and I'm convinced here that that's what you saw), they usually aestivate in rodent burrows until it rains again. Spadefoot toads actually dig their own burrows and can stay in there for over a year. Incredible creatures!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talking about the summit of Mt. Everest:</p>
<p>“When the climbers in 1953 planted their flags on the highest mountain,
they set them in snow over the skeletons of creatures that had lived
in the warm clear ocean that India, moving north, blanked out. Possibly
as much as twenty thousand feet below the seafloor, the skeletal remains
had turned into rock. This one fact is a treatise in itself on the
movements of the surface of the earth. If by some fiat I had to restrict
all this writing to one sentence, this is the one I would choose: The
summit of Mt. Everest is marine limestone.”

			<div class="markdown"><p>McPhee is talking about fossils though, these are living creatures today. Also, he's talking about sedimentary formations that were at one time ocean bottoms or land where things lived, this is granite that was formed miles underground from magma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really like John McPhee's stuff. I read <em>Coming Into The Country</em> when I went to Alaska, and then I started working my way through his other place-based books as I traveled. He gives you such an interesting perspective on place.</p></div>		</li>
