			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that science is always changing, based on new studies and perceptions of how things work. </p>
<p>In 2015, a new study was conducted by Rafael Wlodarski, an experimental psychologist at the University of Oxford. The study's results suggest that humans, may, in fact, &quot;be both monogamous and polygamous&quot; in nature, as opposed to just polygamous (i.e. having multiple partners). </p>
<p>The scientists involved speculate that, while polygamy and multiple partners may have worked as the best mating strategy for our ancestors, in more modern history, monogamy has become the better &quot;winning strategy&quot;. This is for several reasons, but they speculate this is down to how much humanity has changed over thousands of years.</p>
<p>This would also explain the discrepancies in modern dating, namely, with some people preferring casual dating and multiple partners, and others choosing to only have one mate, as opposed to many. Likewise, the scientists involved speculated that, much like with many things, human sexuality is &quot;a Bell curve&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Human beings have much more varied mating strategies than other animals. Some people mate for life, while others seem to have an endless parade of interchangeable partners. In between is a whole range of unique love arrangements, from men with many wives to women who marry two brothers. Humans are also, by and large, less promiscuous than their primate cousins. Only about 30 percent of primates and 3 percent of all mammals are monogamous, Wlodarski told Live Science.</p>
<p>But most scientists tended to think of human sexual diversity as a bell curve: while there were a few extremes on either end, the vast majority fit in the middle.</p>
<p>To see whether that was true, Wlodarski and his colleagues analyzed data on the sexual attitudes of 600 British and American men and women. Some of the questions looked at how willing people were to engage in casual sex or short-term affairs. </p>
<p>&quot;When we looked at the data, it has this very weird shape,&quot; Wlodarski told Live Science. &quot; Rather than it being a whole gamut of mating strategies, there seems to be two potential phenotypes within males and within females.&quot;</p>
<p>Both men and women tended to split into two groups: one made up of people who valued faithfulness, and another with people seeking flings. Slightly more than half of the men could be classified as having the promiscuous orientation, compared with just under half of the women. </p>
<p>In a similar study, the team looked at data on the finger lengths of 1,313 British men and women. Because the ratio between the second and the fourth finger is a proxy for how much testosterone both boys and girls are exposed to in the womb, the team predicted that those with a much longer ring finger (and therefore greater prenatal testosterone exposure) would be more interested in casual sex. Sure enough, this finger ratio did in fact track with a person's proclivity toward casual sex.</p>
<p>However, the variation between people was huge, so it would be impossible, based on these survey results, to predict who is likely to stray, Wlodarski said.</p>
<p>But the findings do suggest that these two mating strategies have persisted because they both have their benefits, depending on the time and place.</p>
<p>&quot;In humans monogamy is relatively new on the scene â€” we're talking hundreds of thousands of years,&quot; Wlodarski said. &quot;It's a winning strategy because it's so novel and it seems to work in the culture that we've created.&quot;</p>
<p>For instance, if most men are sleeping around, it may provide a strategic advantage to be more faithful and help raise kids with just one woman, Wlodarski said. </p>
<p>In any case, it's likely that hundreds of variables, from upbringing to culture to birth control, may shape people's mating strategies in a given society. The current study looked at just two fairly similar Western populations, so it would be interesting to see whether and how these mating types show up in different cultures, Wlodarski said. <a href="http://www.livescience.com/49690-humans-naturally-monogamous-promiscuous.html" target="_blank">(Source)</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For humans it makes sense to be both.  Men have an advantage for being monogamous because they can be around their offspring and partner and prevent both from coming to harm or having offspring with other men.  The other option for men is the shotgun strategy.  Have sex with as many women as possible and hope some get pregnant and the monogamous men don't notice the difference.  For women, it depends on the type of man wether the best strategy is monoandry or polyandry  If you have a man who is a good specimen, you don't want some inferior genes polluting that, so you want to be monogamous towards him, and you want to prevent him from being polygamous because then he's not protecting your offspring.  If the partner male has inferior qualities, but is otherwise a good protector/provider its to the woman's advantage to seek out a good male that will provide superior offspring even if that means &quot;cheating&quot;.  Both of these strategies are in conflict with each other, which is why humans are polygamous and monogamous at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That assumes that tribal males knew who the father of a child was. It takes weeks for a woman to really show pregnancy and miscarriages happen often so tracing from Male A to Baby A is haphazard without some knowledge of heredity. The theory in Sex at Dawn is that the knowledge of heredity came when we domesticated/bred animals.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that in a small tribe the <a href="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTYcyd20bAUR4TYLyLNx0LRmZjkLJ5ft8K5RaTmVBFuKG4z09F88g" target="_blank">typical male would probably look a lot like everyone else.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>This has been cited as evidence that humans evolved to have multiple sexual partners at the same time. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>One other supporting fact that I've noticed mentioned several times recently is the mammal/primate relative testicle size spectrum. The smallest testicles are the least promiscuous while the largest testicles are the most promiscuous.</p>
<p>Human testicle size relative to the body place us more towards the promiscuous side of the spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere that the point of women moaning during sex was to attract other males in the area.</p>
<p>From a certain point of view, it means we evolved to have gangbangs.</p>
<p>I took it with a chunk (not a grain) of salt, though.</p></div>		</li>

The better it feels the more I moan, the harder it gets the louder I'll get. I definitely wouldn't want someone bursting in the door and putting a stop to what's being done to me because they want to take over! I'd rage and turn into something equivalent to a tiger backed into a corner.....</p></div>		</li>
