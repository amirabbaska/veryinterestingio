			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. This discussion is giving me a new perspective on how our modern understanding of the universe evolved.  The idea of an Aether is fascinating.  </p>
<p>I'd recommend following your link to the Conjectures and proposals sub heading to get an idea of how Einstein viewed the aether.  You get a sense for how so many of our current conjectures are still rooted in the threads of some of these abandoned ideas.  We still have a lot to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please for the love of space, go rent Galileo's Daughter. You will love it. The whole story is more intense but the general idea is that they believed in aether, but even more so they believed in the Aristotelean concentric shells which were physical solid invisible spheres which controlled rotation. It's a great story too much to say here but it is one of my favorite stories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not technically... yes a vacuum is never a &quot;true&quot; vacuum because of quantum fluctuations but the aether was a fluid, specifically, that permeated through all of space. Experiments that proved that there was no aether were based on observing different phenomena depending on the relative velocity an object had with the aether. When there were no effects that suggested a &quot;relative velocity&quot; with the aether were found, the aether theory was disproven.</p>
<p>So in this regard, no the quantum fluctuations in a vacuum are not an aether  as it was believed to behave. The aether would be the &quot;material&quot; composing space and space only. Quantum fluctuations are typical particles and photons, as they are excitations of the quantum fields that stretch out through spacetime. But I should mention, quantum fields stretching throughout spacetime are distinctly different from a material filling all of space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the time period.</p>
<p>Aristotelian-influenced thought posited that the planets were contained in celestial spheres, fixed within them. The spheres were crystalline &quot;quintessence,&quot; a primordial fifth element on par with earth, fire, air, or water, from which the universe was made.</p>
<p>Later, the observations of Tycho Brahe led to Copernicus' positing a heliocentric model of the solar system, and Galileo's subsequent direct observations of celestial bodies reified this model as fundamental reality—physical objects impelled by an unknown force through seeming empty space. This was powerfully challenging to authorities at the time, both religious and scientific, as it required &quot;occult&quot; (hidden) forces to move the heavens. It was believed (again, inspired by Aristotelian notions) that nothing could move unless impelled—pushed—by some force mechanically.</p>
<p>Descartes posited that space contained a kind of fluid, with the planets <a href="http://descartes.cyberbrahma.com/vortex.html" target="_blank">trapped in fluid vortices which pushed them</a>. He had no evidence of this, but the idea became influential for a time.</p>
<p>Newton made a new leap. In telling the story of the apple falling (which did not fall on his head, and may not have happened at all), he describes that he observed nothing mediate the force which pulled the apple from the tree to the Earth—and then he merely extrapolated this invisible force out to the heavens. That the force was invisible to him, able to act over distances with nothing between to mechanically transmit it, troubled him, but he proceeded to describe the force mathematically without an explanation. (Famously, he said, &quot;I feign no hypotheses,&quot; about the nature of gravity.)</p>
<p>The power of his mathematics—a full derivation of Kepler's laws and a nearly complete explanation of the motions of the planets which served for hundreds of years—allowed scientists to become comfortable with the idea of empty space.</p>
<p>For more information about what ancient astronomers in the Western tradition thought was between the stars, one source is Ptolemy's <em>Almagest</em>.</p>
<p>For a more complete accounting for the evolution of the ideas between Aristotelian thought and modern science, try <em>The Invention of Science</em> by David Wootten.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've learned so many cool facts and had so many eye-opening paradigm shifts about our current understanding of the universe through this post - not to mention how that understanding was affected by our past misconceptions. Thank you for adding this bit of context (and recommendations) to that history.  Really appreciated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad I could help.</p>
<p>I want to emphasize I've concentrated on Aristotelian astronomy and subsequent developments which formed in reaction to it, all of which are primarily Western modes of thought, because they inform modern scientific thought.</p>
<p>Ancient astronomers spanned the globe and held all sorts of various beliefs.</p></div>		</li>
