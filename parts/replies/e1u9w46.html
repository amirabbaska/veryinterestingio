			<div class="markdown"><p>To continue this stimulants like cocaine and amphetamines increase release, and/or block the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine both peripherally and centrally.  Peripheral effects are things like heart rate, respiration rate, sweaty palms, dry mouth, tremors. </p>
<p>There are a few drugs that have a lot of trouble crossing the blood brain barrier and therefore only effect peripheral nervous systems.   However, most receptors and neurotransmitters that govern communication in the brain have roles peripherally as well.  If you were to inject something into the  brain you might get direct effects on the central nervous system without much on the peripheral, but that’s going to be dose and drug dependent and is obviously not a common practice... but theoretically if a drug can’t cross a membrane barrier one way, it will also have difficulty going the other way.  That said various pumps and other 1 way mechanisms might make something permeable to get out of the brain side and into the peripheral nervous system, even if the depot is in the CNS.  </p>
<p>I suggest looking up Ziconotide.  It is a pain medication that is delivered directly to the  nerves in the spine, and since it is an impermeable protein, has minimal perfusion to other locations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The not being able to cross the BBB is not true. The blood brain barrier is both a passive barrier that prevents large molecules from freely traveling through the brain, but there's also active ion pumps like the ABC transporter that actively remove substances from inside the blood brain barrier.
If that were the case the end molecules of metabolism would start piling up within the barrier.</p>
<p>A good example for this is the anti diarrhoeal Loperamide. It's a mu agonist, and would have Fentanyl like effects if it were able to pass the blood brain barrier. And it's often touted that the BBB prevents it from reaching the brain.
But the thing is, it gets through the barrier easily. It just get shuttled back out again nearly instantly.</p>
<p>But take a small dose of Cimetidine (which as a side effect blocks that transporter) and suddenly Loperamide act like a strong central Opioid!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cimetidine is a weak CYP inhibitor. I do not see it increasing BBB absorption. The cytochrome P450 is a vast enzymatic system that is more complex than say: just inhibiting CYP3A4 and calling it a day. Grapefruit juice is actually a stronger inhibitor than Cimetidine which is an old histamine antagonist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this information, about sixteen years too late to be REALLY funny. Or tragic. Probably funny, considering we wouldn't have followed through. </p>
<p>Close to twenty years ago, I joined a drug users' IRC chat room. Before we had a few severe issues, some of our members would haze newcomers. Mostly seeing if they knew enough to do their own research before acting on rumors, etc. One case I remember was a kid who was astounded to find out that his medicine-cabinet cough syrup was a strong psychoactive, so of COURSE he came to us to see what else he could find in his own home. We convinced him that a strong dose of anti-diarrheal medication, like Loperamide, would do the trick. We came clean before any harm could be done. </p>
<p>I did, however, bilk him out of twenty bucks by selling him three pills of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin" target="_blank">N-acetyl-5-methoxy tryptamine</a>. I didn't lie to him, I just told him the honest effects, and let his imagination do the rest. Making dang sure it wouldn't do any harm if things went pear-shaped.   </p>
<p>Do your own research, kids. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that Piperine is quite effective at helping to trap Loperamide inside the BBB</p>
<p>I also read that high doses of Loperamide can be toxic to the heart</p>
<p>Doesnt sound like a &quot;high&quot; worth chasing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can excessive, frequent use of large amounts of cocaine and amphetamines induce hypoprolactinemia (through increased amounts of dopamine)?</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091305796004339?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that cocaine changes prolactin levels in different ways during acute and chronic administration. It appears that chronic cocaine abuse may impair the sensitive regulatory feedback relationship between hypothalamic dopamine and prolactin to culminate in disregulation and abnormally high levels of prolactin or hyperprolactinemia. Thus, an acute cocaine-induced suppression of prolactin levels appears to be inconsistent with the hyperprolactinemia sometimes seen clinically. It is generally believed that cocaine’s blockade of dopamine reuptake may eventually result in downregulation of dopamine receptors and decreased dopaminergic tone, a phenomenon often described as dopamine depletion.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your post is reasonably tangential and yet I can respond tangentially. I have plenty of patients who give themselves pretty convincing hyperprolactinaemias through the episodic use of other stimulants (mostly methamphetamine).
My current theory is that being on the drug bumps it a bit, but the withdrawals after a run of a few days seems to bump levels up even more.
Obviously not many data points but you've probably seen that the literature is a bit gappy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. I’d agree most are not 100% selective but what about a dissociative like ketamine. I’m also thinking azaperone? I’m only familiar with them in terms of their use in veterinary anesthesia but I believe they are only centrally acting. </p></div>		</li>
