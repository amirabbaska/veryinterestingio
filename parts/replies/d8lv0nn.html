			<div class="markdown"><p>On an unrelated note, I think McMaster's website is a masterpiece of web design. Easy visual interface that makes it easy to navigate hundreds of thousands of products, CAD files available for lots of products, good filtering functions, and I can put together a shopping cart of hundreds of items and forward it to the logistics department. Orders show up the next day, even up here in Calgary, so while some products may be a little pricier, it's still more cost-efficient than leaving work for an hour or so to drive to a hardware store and losing that time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a licensed mechanical engineer in my state.  While many other answers seem to focus on reasons that make a sense for carefully engineered end products.  Your answer, imo, is closest to the truth for most appliances and machines that are designed.  Fasteners are often an afterthought and there are many times more than one right or wrong answer to why one is used over another.<br />
I always find myself checking and rechecking shear and tensile strength of my fasteners to make sure they are &quot;enough&quot; in my designs.  This helps to avoid failure of the design.  My obligation as an engineer is to protect health and safety and sometimes making things inconvenient for those attempting to tamper is desirable.  So when it comes to fasteners it is often desirable to use whatever will get the job done.  Any additional thought into it would require more money from the client that is often not available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On an unrelated note, what do you mean by licensed? I'm a mechanical engineer in the UK and there's no trade body/union that you have to be a member of (unlike CORGI for gas engineers) but it is best that you join IMechE or similar to get Incorporated/Chartered status for the sake of your career.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe in Canada you need a licence to practice as an engineer, and in some states the title means more then just a title (you need to actually study to be an engineer). As an engineer you are faced with &quot;ethical&quot; issue that might not be in the interest of the employer but are in the interest of the social good, i.e. if your car fails on the highway because of an engineering flaw (the employer can account for the private costs of this venture, which the public cost can be much greater.) (or for instance in software your security get hacked, a bug is found in a banks systems costing them billions of dollars.. undermining the solvency of the bank.. this could cause contagion across the financial system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Why Mr Boeing Engineer... why would you do this to me?&quot; </p>
<p>Then they throw in a mixed bag of torx bits, phillips, and common... Now I need 3 different drivers for one stinking part. </p>
