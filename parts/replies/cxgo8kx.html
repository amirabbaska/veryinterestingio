<p>The problem is sort of that the temperature scale has an absolute bottom but is close to being open ended at the top. (There might or might not be a theoretical 'absolute hot', but it would be far past any sort of context where talking about temperature makes sense. For practical purposes the scale might as well be open ended.)</p>
<p>In such a scale any sort of value always appears to be close to the bottom because there is always more room above than below.</p>

<p>This is definitely the right answer.  I'm glad someone said this, I just wish it wasn't so far down the thread.</p></div>		</li>
