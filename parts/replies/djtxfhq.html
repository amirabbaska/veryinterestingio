			<div class="markdown"><p>So, first you say that 4chan is &quot;liberal&quot; in the sense that is values freedom of expression above all else. Then you define it as having a &quot;a large socially right wing faction&quot; and as being &quot;far right&quot; on social issues. </p>
<p>So, if you define 4chan's primary values as individual liberties + socially &quot;far right&quot; conservatism, why would you say it's inappropriate to label them as alt right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aaaand after rereading what I said, I think I found what I phrased poorly, my bad. Liberalism (in the sense of the classical term) is not always synonymous with alt-right, I didn't mean that 4chan isn't alt-right. That being said, I would say that 4chan has a larger focus on being libertarian (again in the classical sense) than being alt-right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fair. I can see how there's a big intersection between alt right and liberalism when it comes to social issues and liberties. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say it's in appropriate to label them as alt-right, and I'm if that's what I said, that was never my intention. I was more so trying to clarify there position politically. People generally lump the political spectrum into 1 dimension, left and right being the axis. However politics is more like a cube with 3 dimensions, social position (E.g. stance on gay marriage &amp; religious tolerance), the Ã§ontrol axis (E.g. Anarchy and Democracy vs Totalitarianism and autocracy) and the economic axis (E.g. Tax cuts for businesses or lower classes). 4chan is typically socially conservative, however that does not necessarily reflect there stance on any of the other axis.</p>
<p>The only other thing that I tried to do that I can think of (currently at the library doing this on my phone, so can't get what I said before with relative ease) is the clarification of the term Liberalism, which some people had been tossing around. However Liberalism at its roots (known as classic liberalism, or the first form of it) is essentially freedom, ranging from Freedom to vote to total Anarchy, hence my disagreeal with some people simply saying that 4chan is against liberalism without defining the form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comes from the political spectrum moving slowly to the left. What is known as classic liberalism is now the moderate to mid right and neo progressive liberalism is the new left side of the spectrum. Years ago this current neo liberalism only existed in fringe group. Now it is becoming more and more main stream due to cultural shifts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The people who adhere to liberalism, which was and is first and foremost an economic philosophy, are called liberalists. Liberals are not the same thing. Bernie Sanders is a liberal, but not a liberalist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The very root of the word is the Latin word of 'Liber' or free, and was originally used in relation to freedom. That being said I have a poor head for economic philosophy, and I have not the faintest clue what it is in economic terms. However there are many different uses of the word Liberal, and I have no doubt that liberalism is also economic philosophy.</p></div>		</li>
