			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why certain foods like onion and garlic make your breath smell for a long time. Certain spices can make your sweat (or body in general) smell too. The chemicals are different but the principal is the same-- they don't &quot;stay&quot; in your mouth (necessarily) but get back there after digestion. </p></div>		</li>

<p>You're saying that <em>blood</em> can smell of alcohol, onion or garlic? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nurse here.  People often tell me they get a funny taste in their mouth immediately after I inject a medication or just plain saline into their IV.  I've heard this is due to the same method (the med going into their bloodstream, being evaporated in their lungs where it can then be tasted when it reaches their nose/mouth).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Heroin was always this weird chemical taste in the back of my throat. Meth was a icy chill that produced massive coughs. Cocaine was similar except it was a more sweet aftertaste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever I've had an IV of morphine, within about 2 seconds of being injected I smell Windex. It's so strange. I've been in the hospital a bunch due to frequent kidney stones, gall stones (no more of those, I kicked that organ to the curb a few months ago!), ruptured disc in my back, etc so I've had a lot of different meds via IV, and it's just morphine that smells like windex</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can also happen simply due to the IV fluid reaching your tongue iirc, as the effect is sometimes quite immediate (i.e. before you even get to take a breath).
Drig users, for example, often report feeling the very distinct taste of amphetamine a second or so after injection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a DUI attorney, the science indicates the smell is not so much the ethanol as it is the odor associated with other parts of the beverage. For example, if you drink 5 beers, you're going to smell like the malt. If you drink bourbon, you're going to smell like the barrel. We use this as a way to counter an arresting officer's account of a &quot;strong odor of alcohol&quot; because regardless of the facts they always report this. Ethanol itself doesn't have a strong odor; therefore, if someone drank 36 ounces of beer they'd smell far worse than someone that drank 12 ounces of vodka even though the person that smells less would in fact be far more intoxicated. Anyway this is how we articulate to a jury odor is not indicative of intoxication. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, don't talk anymore than you absolutely have to. And by that I mean just enough to be polite. The cop will try to start a conversation or give you orders ina manner that leads you to believe you have to comply. Refusing the field sobriety is NOT failure to obey a police order. There are exceptions that are too complicated to properly articulate on Reddit. In general, do NOT do the field sobriety and do NOT do the breathalyzer. You're already fucked, and the cop is just trying to make their case. Do NOT be foolish enough to think you can win their game. I've know exactly two people that got away after field sobriety. One was a lawyer and knew how the test was graded. They don't tell you how you're graded. They just give you some vague commands and expect you to figure it out. Also, you're already in jail by the time you do the breathalyzer. You're not going home so don't try to prove your innocence. You're going to lose your license temporarily but you can get a route restricted license usually very fast. So don't let that persuade you. Moral of the story. Be polite and respectful, but keep your mouth shut (no pleading, crying, asking to go home) and don't make their case with tests. Do this and your case will almost always plea down to something menial because they have no evidence to use at trial.
EDIT: In keeping the tradition of assuming we're best country and only country that matters because all other counties aren't as good, I neglected to give a disclaimer that this applies in the United States of Murica only. </p></div>		</li>
