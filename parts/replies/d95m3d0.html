<p>A VPN is a special kind of proxy that allows many people to appear to have the same IP address which makes it very difficult for anyone (except the VPN's owner) to figure out who connects to where.</p>

<p>Nope, That just describes NAT ;-) But kinda what you said too... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically you are correct :)</p>
<p>However, for the users here that are potentially confused:</p>
<p>NAT and VPNs are two similar (on the surface) solutions to different problems. NAT came about because we figured out that we would run out of IP addresses very quickly if every single machine connected to the internet had a unique IP address, which is why your unique identifier is on a different not-IP layer (lower, at the NIC itself). NAT uses some trickery to allow multiple devices to share the same internet connection - your computer sees its NAT address, whereas the internet sees your public IP address, and then magic happens, and packets go back to the right computer.</p>
<p>VPNs are around to allow people to get access into a network from the internet. For example, say I want access to a couple company servers from my house. Either we can expose the servers to the internet (very not secure and troublesome), or we can have some secure way of getting myself into the internal network. A side effect of the VPN solution is that all my traffic (potentially, or just <em>some</em>)  is shown as going to one source, the network I'm VPNd into. This can be advantageous if the VPN connection uses a strong encryption method, and the VPN host does not keep logs (Private Internet Access has proven in a US court of law that they do not) - instead of an ISP/snoopers seeing all my individual connections, they just see one singular connection into the VPN.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You could also say that
VPN is a Tunnel from one network (your home) to another (your work).
NAT provides an interface to mask a private IP from the public IP</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but the NAT run by a VPN is what's most likely to obfuscate the identity of the user, assuming the person trying to identify you has the cooperation of ISPs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PPTP has been known to be insecure for nearly a decade (if not longer), it is a very old protocol. </p>
<p>The only reason it is still in used is because of how simple it is and most OS's have a nice integration with it. </p>
<p>OpenVPN is public private key cryptography based, and is considered very secure. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are using a VPN that's even remotely designed for identity concealment, then the traffic you send to that VPN is encrypted. That <em>encrypted</em> traffic does go through your ISP, but because it's encrypted even if they intercept all of it they don't know what it is.</p></div>		</li>
