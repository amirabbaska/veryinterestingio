			<div class="markdown"><p>I found the strong force part hilarious.  For the strong force being known supposedly so well, it is terrible for dealing with nuclear systems.  Predictions for cross sections and excited states for nuclei are all over the place.  Multinucleon interactions are barely understood since they are multibody interactions. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But that's totally possible.  There's an entire field called computational chemistry that's more or less dedicated to that exact proposition.  It's complicated, sure, but you can model a molecule and predict many things about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I realize that a <em>full</em> explanation of the forces can be achieved by nothing less than the full mathematical theory. But I can do a decent job of explaining gravity to someone by saying something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things attract each other in proportion to their mass, and the effect drops off with an inverse square law. In other words, &quot;F = G <em> m1 </em> m2 / d^2&quot;. This approximation is accurate until you get forces or speeds that are not negligible compared to the speed of light; in that regime, a more accurate description is that 4-dimensional space-time is curved by the presence of energy (counting rest mass as energy using &quot;E = m * c^2&quot;).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And frankly, I wouldn't be doing TOO badly if I left off the second half of that and just gave Newton's equation -- it would still give the reader a rough idea of what gravity is.</p>
<p>I cannot recall seeing such an explanation for the strong or weak force. Nor do I understand them well enough to construct such an explanation myself. Even if not telling the FULL story (as newton's law of gravity is imperfect) it would still give some useful insight. Have you seen such a &quot;layman's summary&quot; anywhere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of the problem here is that gravity and electromagnetism have classical limits where they work as forces between objects that have  a relevant &quot;charge&quot; (gravitational charge being mass). There simply is no classical force analog for the strong and weak interactions (except perhaps for short-distance strong interactions, but that does not help describe anything larger than a proton).</p>
<p>The electromagnetic interaction does not <em>just</em> result in a force between charged objects. It is also responsible for particle-antiparticle annihilation and pair production, the radiation of accelerating charges, etc. Causing a force that goes like an inverse square law at large distances is just one of the things that it does. I think that if there will be a layman explanation of the strong and weak interaction that is on par with gravity and electromagnetism, you would have to throw out the types of explanations of the latter in terms of forces with an inverse square laws and instead re-explain them as fundamental interactions between quantum fields. That's the only way you're going to get any consistency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going off of that, I don't understand why we still teach classical physics at the intro level. Surely it would make more sense to incorporate the fundamentals of modern physics into the curriculum where possible? I feel like many people don't understand what physics is actually capable of explaining because on a technical level, all they know about it is Newton's laws, free-body diagrams and archaic methods of experiment. My specialty is math, and to me it's like the difference between learning geometry from Euclid and learning geometry from a modern algebraic standpoint. </p>
<p>EDIT: I also think that the modern algebraic perspective would work wonders in math education if it was introduced earlier on and treated properly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is that there is nothing by which you would need to reference the strong or weak forces in layman's terms.  As far as a layman is concerned, saying &quot;the strong force holds the nuclei together&quot; and &quot;the weak force mediates radioactive decay&quot; <em>is</em> the layman's description.  You can't really go into the descriptions much further without getting into some mathematical and quantum theory territory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with a very basic understanding of advanced/modern physics (I'm a geologist, only took, like, 3 courses of physics during graduation), how is the strong force different from gravity?</p>
<p>Edit: I meant different in terms of how it works, holding the nuclear particles together, similar (to me) as to how larger particles are hold together in space, forming planets and such. I know that the strong force is orders of magnitude stronger than gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being able to break things down into a fundamental layman approach helps even those who work in the field develop their knowledge.  For instance, my calculus teacher hammered into us the first week of Calc 1, &quot;position, velocity, acceleration are the basis of derivatives&quot;. From there it was a small leap to understand that velocity was merely the slope of the curve from point a to point b. The given 'explanation' if you can call it is close, it just needs a little more to give it that basis through which students can truly grasp it and use it. Gravity and magnetism have it already due to their equations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, yes, you can (and did) do a pretty good job of giving a simple explanation of <strong>how</strong> gravity works. However (and please correct me if I'm wrong), we still really don't understand <strong>what</strong> gravity actually is. </p>
<p>When you simplify it, Einstein's general theory of relativity posits that gravity is simply the geometric phenomenon that results when you place a massive object in 4d (or more if you're into <em>strings</em>) space-time. We understand <strong>how</strong> it works, because we can feel and measure the warping effects. But we really don't understand <strong>why</strong> massive objects have this effect on our space-time geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Science is the part where we answer &quot;how&quot;. There's no real &quot;why&quot; in physics. We tend to use both terms interchangeably but &quot;how&quot; is really what is always meant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind of answer could you ever hope for in regards to such a &quot;why&quot; question, though?</p>
<p>In the end I think &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; questions are pretty much the same here: &quot;why do apples fall to earth?&quot; &quot;because there is a force that attracts all objects together.&quot; If you replace <em>&quot;because there is&quot;</em> with <em>&quot;by the&quot;</em> you have a perfectly good answer to the &quot;how&quot; question. In both cases you can keep asking &quot;why&quot; or &quot;how&quot; until you get bored or the answerer runs out of knowledge. This will always happen at some point.</p></div>		</li>
