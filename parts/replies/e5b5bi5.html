			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why you need a scrupulously clean bowl to make stiff egg whites. Residual oils on the bowl or beaters will ruin the result. Plastic items are more likely to cling to oil, so use metal or glass bowls, and give everything a hot soapy wash before you start. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Per Alton Brown in &quot;Gear For Your Kitchen&quot;, &quot;Egg whites actually pick up copper ions from the bowl, which means that those ions could very well block bonding sites on the egg proteins. That would prevent other proteins from joining on, thus preventing over-coagulation.&quot; He also advocates a scrub with white vinegar and salt before and after each use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually not exactly the same. In cream the emulsion (foam) is created by the fat droplets in the cream. That's why it's impossible to whisk low-fat cream (or milk for that sake).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know that what we get from beating egg-white and whipping heavy cream have completely different texture and tastes but in the eyes of the children they look exactly the same lol.</p></div>		</li>
