			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had this happen quite a few times, once I dreamt  that my husband said &quot;there are hundreds of spiders under the blanket!&quot; Then pulled it up to show me, put it back and rolled over and went back to sleep. At this point I woke up and started trying to get the spiders off and away from me, waking my husband to help as I freaked out, I only realised I had dreamed part of it 5/10 minutes later after arguing with him about wether or not he had done/said it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had similar dreams in times of high stress.  I panic when I can't remember where I put my class ring, but havent had a dream about it that I can recall.  I have, however, dreamt that I went to class and took an exam, only to wake up and realize that I still need to head to class and take that exam.</p>
<p>Since college, I've had two dreams of going into work and performing my normal duties, then when dream lunchtime rolls around I wake up and its 5am, time to start the day again...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i have heard about this, and apparently it happens when you are so engrossed in your normal duties IRL that you have nothing to dream about. - maybe you were doing a load of study before your exam?</p>
<p>you should think of it as a boon though because when you dream of doing something <a href="http://journals.humankinetics.com/tsp-back-issues/tspvolume24issue2june/practicingamotortaskinaluciddreamenhancessubsequentperformanceapilotstudy" target="_blank">it can actually be like practice and you can actually improve your skills</a> - so it would be for your exam the next day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh it definitely helped with work. I'm not sure if it made an impact on testing, but I usually retain critical thinking in my dreams and end up explaining techniques from my old job to imaginary people in my dreams. It helped when going into work the next day and I had already run through scenarios in my sleep.</p></div>		</li>
