<p>Edit: This is just 10,000 calories and not 10,000 calories of sugar. Sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>putting it in perspective, 10,000 calories would be any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>7.5 large big mac combos with coke</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5 double-steak burritos with a side of chips&amp;guac from chipotle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>9 pints of ben &amp; jerry's americone dream</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>41.6 chocolate brownie cliff bars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 to 3 jars of peanut butter, depending on brand and type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3.3 large pan pizzas with pepperoni from pizza hut</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>72.6 lbs of watermelon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>47.6 hershey bars</p>
</li>
<li>95 bananas (for scale)</li>
</ul>
<p>some of them would be physically impossible to eat due to volume.  others would be painful.  others are totally doable.</p>
<p>i think i'm just agreeing with your point that it really depends on the source of those calories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could probably have done the big macs at some point in my life.</p>
<p>I could probably do the 5 burritos now, though I'd be feeling pretty bad after #3.</p>
<p>2-3 jars of peanut butter is probably the easiest.</p>
<p>I am under 200 pounds, and rarely eat super large quantities of food, so I'm sure some other people could handle it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if you want to look at healthier foods and blow your mind a little bit, to hit 10k calories consuming just chicken (148 cal per cup), broccoli (31 cal per cup) and wild rice (166 cal per cup) you would need to eat (roughly) <em>29 cups of EACH food</em>. That's:</p>
<p><strong>9.6lbs</strong> of chicken.</p>
<p><strong>5.8lbs</strong> of broccoli.</p>
<p><strong>10.5lbs</strong> of rice.</p>
<p>A total of: <strong>25.9lbs of food</strong>. That's like 24 chicken breasts, 11.6 small heads of broccoli and well, 10.5 pounds of rice. This is another thing that irks me about weight loss and weight conversations; if you're complaining that someone can eat so much without gaining weight make sure you look at WHAT they're eating as well. You can literally have 3.3 pizzas from pizza hut, or about 26 pounds of food and still hit the same caloric intake.</p></div>		</li>

<p>eating 10000 calories from sugar might be more completely absorbed than 10000 calories from something harder to break down like fiber.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should think so, since fiber is, by definition, food that you can't break down and digest.</p>
<p>A better example might be protein, fat, or complex carbohydrates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some fiber your body can break down. Or rather the bacteria in your digestive system can break it down first and your body can finish off the rest of the process. But it is much less than normal carbohydrates.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is definitely NOT the definition of fiber.  First off, 'food' requires the subject in question to be nutritious, so if you can't break it down, it is not food, by definition.</p>
<p>Secondly, as /u/bloodyusernames below me has said, some types of fiber your body CAN break down.  Fiber is a carbohydrate, and certain types can yield up to 2kcals/gram.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>In 2002, the
Institute of Medicine (IOM) stated that total fiber is the
sum of dietary fiber plus functional fiber (2). Dietary
fiber consists of nondigestible carbohydrates and lignin
that are intrinsic and intact in plants, whereas functional
fiber consists of isolated, nondigestible carbohydrates that
have beneficial physiologic effects in humans. Similar
fiber definitions have been described by governments and
organizations worldwide.  </p>
<p>A globally accepted fiber definition was proposed
by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (part of the
Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health
Organization) in mid-2009. This definition has not yet
been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), however. Despite nuanced differences, all definitions
agree that fiber is mostly carbohydrate that is not
completely digested or absorbed in the small intestine but
that may be fermented in the large intestine.  </p>
