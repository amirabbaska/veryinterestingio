			<div class="markdown"><p>The guy in that video is tapping with his whole hand though and only using the relatively slow movement of his fingers to change which keys the movement of his hand causes him to hit. When I only move my index finger and keep the rest of my hand still, the fastest I can tap is 8 times per second. If I move my whole hand, keeping my index finger locked, I can get 12-13 taps in a second. This is what everyone does when they play fast paced button mashing video games. You play with your whole hand, not just your fingers.</p>
<p>On the other hand (<em>teehee</em>), /u/markpsp is mentioning an experiment performed in the lab in a lot of intro human physiology class. By using a switching power supply with variable frequency (not a car battery) and electrodes placed on the underside of your forearm you can induce rapid flexion of just your fingers independent of your wrist. My memory of this experiment, though, was that at a relatively low frequency my fingers began to tetanize. Rapid repeated stimulation of a muscle causes what's called summation, where instead of just repeating the same contraction at higher frequency, each additional signal increases the tension of the contraction and decreases the level of relaxation inbetween. At a high enough frequency you get tetanus of the muscle where it's rigid and doesn't relax at all.</p>
<p>It seems like the muscles that control our fingers have a relatively low threshold for summation and tetanization. That might be a constraint their physical structure, being really long and narrow muscles, or it might be an evolutionary adaptation since gripping strength in our fingers has always been much more important to survival than rapid tapping.</p>
<p>Since this tapping relies on the full relaxation of flexion (as well as extension), you have to avoid any summation at all or you wouldn't be able to keep tapping for very long. So it might be the summation threshold of your finger flexors that's the limiting factor. Of course, there must be something in your brain that's preventing you from going faster because it knows you want to keep tapping rather than enter a summation type contraction cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually make a good point that he is using his whole hand to achieve that sort of speed. However he is making those small adjustments at a rather high speed. They are certainly smaller movements than op was referring to, but they are legitimate finger movements at rather high speeds.</p>
<p>As for the other comment, I was not aware of that specific experiment, but I'm aware that you can control muscle contractions via alternating current.</p>
<p>The point about summation actually makes complete sense to me. I also play rhythm games such as the one i linked, and have experienced that kind of effect while attempting to push myself to higher speeds.</p></div>		</li>
