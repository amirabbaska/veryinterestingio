			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, its all these barriers together:</p>
<ol>
<li>low concentration of pathogen</li>
<li>construction of digestive systems (chemical decontamination, HCl is quite strong acid + white cells and other stuff in saliva + mucus everywhere that provides nice barrier between what we digest and skin of the digestive system itself)</li>
<li>bacterias living in our guts -- the caecum, &quot;blind intestine&quot; is important section that (if I remember correctly) even feed our natural inner bacterias and protect them with immune system and is important especially in areas where diarhea is often (where a lot of microflora gets flushed out, so it is source of recolonization) -- or this is function of appendix, can't remember now. Bacterias don't only produce wide array products (vitamins), but they probably has some function in regulation, as user above me wrote. And the simplest function: They already occupies this ecological niche, so any other bacteria must be MUCH stronger and better adapted to push them out of it. Thats why wide-range antibiotics are so bad, they remove this protective layer and enable colonization even from small amount of patogens.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we have immune system, but even there it is a bit more complex, because we have:</p>
<ol>
<li>Nonspecific immunity -- passive immunity of body, not learned, we are born with it. Humans and bees have horrible one, even a lot of apes have much stronger nonspecific immunity. Last time I heard about HIV in monkeys was in this, monkeys don't suffer from HIV-like disease because their non-specific immunity can deal with it. And thus they harbour large amount of those viruses.</li>
<li>specific -- learned -- immunity -- Enough was said in previous posts, contact with pathogen help prepare white cells to recognize this pathogen and prepare response against it in further contacts.</li>
