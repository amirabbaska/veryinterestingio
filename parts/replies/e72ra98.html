In a vacuum we would boil to death long before we froze because normal body functions in a vacuum would produce heat faster than we would lose it. Eventually, you would freeze, but you would be cooked by your own body looooooong before that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All true except that the real reason space is &quot;freezing&quot; is the lack of atmospheric pressure. The lack of pressure exerted by our atmosphere causes molecules to spread out. Take for example the boiling of water. At sealevel water boils at 100 degrees Celsius. Boiling water at the top of Mount Everest will be much easier at maybe 90 degrees Celsius.  In space water evaporates much easier. If we were to float naked in space, assuming all the water in our body would not immediately start boiling, our sweat would evaporate instantly giving us a cold feeling. In a humid environment with lots of watervapour our sweat would evaporate much much slower due to the saturation of the air around us.</p></div>		</li>
