			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll piggyback off of this as it may be for more than an eli5. </p>
<p>Imagine <em>linear</em> (straight) forces. If you want to move something, you push it in the direction you want it to go, exerting a <em>force</em>. If you want to lift something, you use a force to push it up. If you want to slide something, you exert a force pushing it sideways. </p>
<p>Now imagine what forces you feel when you want to <em>stop</em> something rather than making it go. You use a force to stop it. If something is pushed at you, you use a force <em>against its motion</em> to stop it. If you toss something in the air, to catch it, you apply a force upwards to stop it from going down. </p>
<p>This is Newton's third law: an object at rest/in motion tends to stay at rest/in motion unless <em>acted upon by an outside force</em>. </p>
<p>Now imagine spinning. To spin a top clockwise, you need to exert force clockwise, and to get it to stop, you exert force counterclockwise. When you exert force on an angle, or <em>perpendicular</em> to where you want it to go, it's called a <em>torque</em>. Spinning things and torque are very similar to moving things and force, but they have slightly different rules... especially when they're mixed. </p>
<p>When something is moving in a line, it has <em>momentum</em>, a property of how big it is and how fast it's going, that's related to how much force it will take to stop it. A object that is big or moving fast will take more force to stop, and so it has a higher momentum. A spinning thing has <em>angular momentum</em> which is in the same way related to how big it is and how fast it is spinning. </p>
<p>Momentum and angular momentum both need <em>direction</em> to be specified. With momentum, its direction is the direction in which it's moving. With angular momentum, it's more complicated, but you'll see why in a second. Make a thumb's up with your right hand. notice how your thumb points up and your fingers <em>curl</em> counterclockwise. This is the direction of angular momentum. If something is spinning, turn your fingers to match the way it's spinning and your thumb points the direction of angular momentum!</p>
<p>Now, imagine a gyroscope is spinning like in the picture. It's spinning <em>outwards</em> in the second and third pictures and <em>mostly upward</em> in the first. When a force is applied to an angular momentum, it creates a force on the object, but since it's not regular momentum, the rules are different. The force it makes is <em>perpendicular</em>, or at a right angle to both the direction of the force and the direction of the angular momentum. In the second and third picture, gravity pulls down, and the angular momentum goes outward, so the net force (the one you see) goes perpendicular to both of those, or in the direction of the circle. In the first picture, the same thing happens, but only because the gyroscope is tilted slightly. Since it's tilted, the effect is lees (and thus the <em>precession speed</em>) and so it revolves slower, but still feels the force in the circle direction. </p>
<p>A little more advanced, it can be said that the gyroscope is &quot;falling sideways&quot; now. It's losing energy (spinning power) as time goes on because it <em>is</em> being acted upon by gravity. This is the same phenomenon that causes weightlessness in the ISS; they are falling, but falling sideways (in lamen's terms) so they don't fall down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What property of the universe determines that it's not the left hand rule?</p>
<p>Edit: Most of the replies have been along the lines of &quot;it's a convention&quot;. That's not what I was asking. I should have known to phrase my question better prevent this from happening. I was asking why there appears to be an asymmetry in the direction the gyroscope moves once gravity has acted upon it, and why it is in the particular direction it's in. Yes, I am familiar with the maths, cross product etc. </p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJWIl4MYMbw" target="_blank">This video</a> explains everything perfectly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone keeps saying its a naming convention so let me ask a more concrete version of your question.  Why does the gyroscope precess one way, and not the other?  The other direction would be equally orthogonal.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_20.html" target="_blank">A Feynman lecture that helps.</a> Scroll to the bottom.  The explanation starts with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some people like to say that when one exerts a torque on a gyroscope, it turns and it precesses, and that the torque produces the precession. It is very strange that when one suddenly lets go of a gyroscope, it does not fall under the action of gravity, but moves sidewise instead! Why is it that the downward force of the gravity, which we know and feel, makes it go sidewise? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God is right handed.</p>
<p>Seriously, though, I think it's just the chosen method of orientation. If we all use the same rule set, then we all talk about the same thing. Someone could use the left hand rule, but they would be negative compared to everyone else. As long as that aspect is kept straight between the two groups, everything still works out.</p>
<p>Let's take an electrical example. For most engineers, electricity flows from positive voltage to negative voltage. However, for the Navy (at least, 20 years ago when a buddy was in the Navy), they use &quot;electron current&quot; for the direction of flowing electrons; electron current flows from negative voltage to positive voltage. The two concepts are equal and opposite, but as long as everyone understands which concept is used, everything still works out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a very annoying question for you:</p>
<p><em>Why</em> is there a third direction, the perpendicular one, just like with Lorentz forces, and <em>why</em> is it in that direction only? What causes the universe to give such asymmetry to these forces? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no asymmetry. In fact <em>all</em> forces arise out of symmetry.</p>
<p>Angular momentum isn't a force. You can think of it as bookkeeping for symmetry, if you want.  When you have a rotating ring, the ring is symmetrical about the axis of rotation.  </p>
<p>Hopefully it is obvious that when you have a rotating ring or disc, the system's axis of symmetry is perpendicular to the plane of that disc.  </p>
<p>When we say &quot;angular momentum X in the direction of the axis of rotation&quot;, we mean that the system is rotating about that axis, and the direction (up or down) corresponds to whether the rotation is clockwise or anticlockwise.  Which of the two it is (right hand or left hand!) is an arbitrary choice, but so long as you adopt the same convention every time then you are fine.</p>
<p>&quot;Conservation of angular momentum&quot; means that if a system is symmetric about an axis, and there are no external forces being applied, the system remains symmetric about that axis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the reason it's always in the same direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is only one possible axis in space so that a rotating disc is symmetric about that axis. If you're not convinced of that then experiment with a coin and a straw, e.g. put the coin on the table, look down the straw, and move around until the coin looks like a perfect circle (not an oval). You'll find there is only one position that this works for the straw: perpendicular to the table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And I'll piggyback your explanation an example a 5 year old might observe. A top doesn't fall over when it is spinning but it does if it's not spinning. If it is on a plate you can lift the plate like normal and you can slide the plate to move the top side to side like normal. But the spinning top resists tipping over, changing its angle relative to the earth. </p>
<p>A light top resists minor imbalances but falls over if you hit it lightly. A heavy top at the same speed has even more momentum and is more likely to keep spinning after you touch it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party but if you are interested in gyroscopes I highly recommend looking at the demonstrations done by Eric Laithwaite in the 70's.  He is most famous for pioneering mag-lev technology but far more <strong>infamous</strong> for his fascination with gyroscopes which began late in his (previously esteemed) life.  It literally cost him everything professionally and academically. </p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Laithwaite" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Laithwaite</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1974, Laithwaite was invited by the Royal Institution to give a talk on a subject of his own choosing. He decided to lecture about gyroscopes, a subject in which he had only recently become interested. </p>
<p>His interest had been aroused by an amateur inventor named Alex Jones, who contacted Laithwaite about a reactionless propulsion drive he (Jones) had invented. After seeing a demonstration of Jones's small prototype (a small wagon with a swinging pendulum which advanced intermittently along a table top), Laithwaite became convinced that &quot;he had seen something impossible&quot;.</p>
<p>In his lecture before the Royal Institution he claimed that gyroscopes weigh less when spinning and, to demonstrate this, he showed that he could lift a spinning gyroscope mounted on the end of a rod easily with one hand but could not do so when the gyroscope was not spinning. At this time, Laithwaite suggested that Newton's laws of motion could not account for the behaviour of gyroscopes and that they could be used as a means of reactionless propulsion. </p>
<p>The members of the Royal Institution rejected his ideas and his lecture was not published. <strong>(This was the first and only time an invited lecture to the Royal Institution has not been published.)</strong> They were subsequently published independently as Engineer Through The Looking-Glass.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was/ is a very fascinating physicist. There are a ton of short demo videos online but you can see the event referenced above here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCEJxO6V9g" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpCEJxO6V9g</a></p>
<p>He ultimately relented on gyroscopes defying newtonian physics near the end of his life but he continued his work with gyroscopes until his death.</p>
<p>Edit: replaced the youtube link with one i found to the entire 45 min in one video.  The prior one was 7 parts.</p>
<p>Edit2: If you only have 3 minutes and want to see something incredible referenced in the first video watch this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRPC7a_AcQo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRPC7a_AcQo</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One can understand gyroscopes so called antigravity effect once you understand how a skater turn faster when he take his arms toward his body! </p>
<p>It is a basic example of coriolis force at play and you don t have to knw more than v=rw. When a mass is at a certain linear speed and you modify its radius, then the mass has a tendency to go faster in linear than a mass that was initially at that radius in the angular rotation (just draw it from above). </p>
<p>If the skater accelerate, it is because its muscles retain the arms, otherwise they would wrap around him when he take them back to his body.  </p>
<p>Once you undetstand this effect, read thishttp://www.cleonis.nl/physics/phys256/gyroscope_physics.php and you will understand intuitively why 90 degrees reaction to gravity force</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh shit this is the best video I have seen. It makes perfect sense without any crazy vectors or right hand rules. All you need to do is track the direction of the spin. As he tilts it clockwise when looked at directly on (ie how the video camera sees it), the spin is going clockwise as he sees it. Since now there is angular momentum spinning clockwise as he sees it, there needs to be something that is spinning counterclockwise. Since he's the only thing attached to it, the professor-chair system goes counterclockwise. </p>
