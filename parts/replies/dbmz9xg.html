			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree 1000%. Nothing annoys me more about teaching than when you have a situation where all the regular joes - the kids who just come in and get on with it quietly - miss out on so much of the attention and one to one guidance that they're entitled to, simply because someone else is louder and more demanding. People often forget that the kid acting out isn't the only one suffering.</p>
<p>Not to mention the fact that if you don't take some sort of action to deal with the kid causing the discipline problem, a pattern of negative thought will sometimes develop in other kids, who start to think &quot;well, he/she gets away with not doing x/y/z, why should I bother?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why I question what someone above said about &quot;have they tried lavishing praise/rewarding the kid when he DOESN'T act out?&quot;  </p>
<p>When I was a kid I was the quiet, obedient kid (besides the <em>one time</em> I got ISS) and I got PISSED at how the usually &quot;bad&quot; kids would get rewards and praise for simply not being little shits for a few hours.  I'd show up every day and do what I was supposed to do while Johnny clowned around and didn't do his work.  Then one day he does one assignment without being asked and the teachers act like he cured cancer or something-- he gets ice cream and a special visit from the principal for a pat on the back and he gets student of the week and gets all this stuff simply for doing what the rest of us do day in and day out.  As a quiet, obedient kid it pissed me off.  </p>
<p>The other kids notice it.  I was volunteering in a school a few years ago that gave out wrist bands when kids got a certain amount of compliments from teachers and met certain citizenship goals.  It didn't take the &quot;regular joe&quot; kids long to realize the kids who act up regularly were earning wrist bands twice as fast as the normally &quot;good&quot; kids.  Teachers would go out of their way to reward the &quot;bad&quot; kids for any and all normalish behavior while the regular kids' good behavior was simply expected and would go unrewarded.  It undermined the whole system and left a lot of good kids jaded and unmotivated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in highschool I ended up taking 5 AP classes in one year and I decided to take the regular level history course because I was afraid to add another AP course to my work load. </p>
<p>The quality of students between AP and regular classes at my school ended up being largely different. Nearly every student in my history class was rude and disruptive. They would talk over and mock the teacher, refuse to pay attention during lectures, get into fights during exams, etc. It was impossible for the teacher to really provide an environment to learn. If he kicked students out they would end up coming right back because the school refused to suspend the number of students that really needed it. So he couldn't teach at all and I didn't learn US history at all. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When you're teaching a class of 40 kids and one child is being so undisciplined that you have to spend most of your time keeping him in line just to get through the day, you have to weigh your options. Do I keep trying to work with this child, knowing that all of these other kids will suffer? Or do I try to move this problem onto someone else knowing that the child in question will suffer and probably not improve?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely. </p>
<p>Nobody has time to fix the problem kids. Not when you have 39 other kids in the class who are behaving themselves and are owed an education in return. </p>
<p>It's nice to think the system values every child equally, but in reality it's a practice in triage. </p></div>		</li>
