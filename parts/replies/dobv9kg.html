<p>&quot;Though Joseph Priestly may have discovered rubber's erasing properties, it's the British engineer Edward Nairne who is generally credited with developing and marketing the first rubber eraser in Europe. And Nairne claimed to have come upon his invention accidentally: He inadvertently picked up a piece of rubber instead of breadcrumbs, he said, thereby realizing rubber's erasing properties&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So they were erasing pencil with breadcrumbs/bread before?</p>
<p>Secondly, why would you have a piece of rubber laying around?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably worth noting the structure of graphite as well. Graphite is an allotrope of carbon (different carbon arrangement structure) which forms a planar structure in layers with a free electron between such layers. This allows for a kind of 'shedding' when using pencils (and also its electroconductivity for those wondering). These layers are on top of the page, and like u/LordDongler said - rubber 'snaps' the little layers of carbon off the paper. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why hard erasers suck ass.</p>

<p>This, at the end of a well thought out and explained answer, cracked me the hell up. Thank you internet person!</p></div>		</li>
