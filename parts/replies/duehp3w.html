			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm. Not trying to be a dick, but I'm just very curious. Did you test the chemical composition of the sweat, and are you sure that's the reason for the change in skin conductivity?</p>
<p>My guess would be that it's either due to different music eliciting different emotions which result in different <em>amounts</em> (not compositions) of sweat, or due to vasodilation (and thus greater blood profusion) brought on by the parasympathetic effect of calming music.</p>
<p>Again, not trying to be a dick, I'm just really curious. It would be interesting to test this effect in people across different cultures (who would have different ideas of calming/aggressive music) and different temp/humidities</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All good! IIRC the GSR (Galvanic skin response) was measured on the hands.  The sweat glands in your hands serve a different role than the ones we use for cooling our bodies in areas like the armpit.  The reason we came to the conclusion that the contents of your sweat changed is people described themselves as feeling more sweaty after the aggressive piece (an excerpt from Rite of Spring) as opposed to the slower one, but the GSR was significantly higher during the slower one.  </p>
<p>There has been some other research done that shows high GSR in the hands is related to parasympathetic response (really interesting subject) which is basically a state of relaxation but in a more biological sense.</p>
<p>I think this was actually one of the reasons it was never published though, the data wasnâ€™t concrete enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How is it possible that no one has said this?</p></div>		</li>
