			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, your carriers are simply greedy - here in Finland pretty much every plan has unlimited data (that is, truly unlimited, not with a huge asterisk; consequently, average Finn uses over 7GB of data per month because why not). </p>
<p>As to why they are greedy or can get away with it, that is a complicated issue. Historical monopolies do play a part. But don't give me population density in rural areas as an excuse, it is not a valid one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But Finland is very different than a country like the US. The population in the US is huge and spread across a massive land area. So building infrastructure is much more costly than Finland. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair though 7GB really isn't much I go through 12-20 per month when I had unlimited now I keep it under 11 usually since I have a 12gb cap </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could low population density in Finland be what allows this to occur? In countries like India with millions of people crammed together there literally isn't enough spectrum to go around with current technologies (of course future technologies could mitigate this problem). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a limit on how much data can go through a switch at a time. For example, a 10 gig switch doesn't mean all ports on that switch can put 10 GB through it at the same time, it means it can support 10 gigs of network traffic (in oversimplified terms).  I could provide a lot of users very high speed connectivity, and as long as they aren't all using it at once, I'm fine.  Most users don't use it very often. The thing is, my biggest users use their service all of the time, and the top 10% create over 90% of the total network traffic. Do I charge grandma, who only uses her internet twice a week, but wants it to be fast when she does, the same amount as my torrenters who are the real  reason I can't add any more subscribers without upgrading my network?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope, most switches have much higher switching capacity than their per port speed. Even cheapy 8 port Gigabit switches usually have 8 gigabit switching capacity. That doesn't necessarily apply to mobile networks due to spectrum constraints (although again, those networks still have larger host bandwidth than client bandwidth), but still.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the UK here. Paying Â£17 a month for more minutes and texts than I could ever use and unlimited data (using the company Three). </p>
<p>I watch a lot of YouTube on my phone. Tried the slightly cheaper 500mb plan once. Ran out of data at midday on the first day. Pretty good for someone who'd only been awake for 3 hours. No idea what most people do on plans to avoid hitting the cap for a whole month. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why all communications should be a non-profit public utility, as various companies have to build their own inefficient overlapping infrastructure and pay shareholders. Communicating isn't really a luxury anymore, it is a necessity, and therefore qualifies as a utility, imo.</p></div>		</li>
