<p>I believe that individuals who exhibit traits of psychopathy develop strategies in response to a harsh childhood environment to protect themselves from experiencing the emotional pain induced by empathy.</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>It is protective to deidentify with the other in pain. However, when one learns that they can circumnavigate the rules of society in a way that others can't, who can blame them, they might think.</p>

<p>I don't quite understand this part. Do you mean that a psychopath has the ability to empathize but can chose to dissociate themselves from it? So when they see a child being hazed by their peers, they may keep walking because they chose to block out that particular emotion or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is what he is saying.  I believe some brain imaging studies of phenomena exist. Also, if i recall it may be worthwhile to look into comparative brain imaing studies of buddbist monks and psychopaths, and those with pyschopathic traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like he's saying it's the other way around.  Psychopaths start with the ability to empathize, learn to turn it off due to painful experiences, and can later choose to turn it on.  Dissociating from empathetic feelings is the default, experiencing them is the choice.</p>
<p>So maybe they keep walking because they didn't feel any of the child's pain, but if they stopped to put themselves in the child's shoes, would realize that they should help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's ironic to think that empathy is common sense, almost foolish even. Feelings are an extra dimension to knowledge; ignorance, even willful, to empathy is a nullification of this dimension. In most respects, this level of desensitization is done in micro levels in almost everyone. It just shows more predominantly in some, and whether by psychology or physiologically, is really the question when discussing this behavior. It's important to distinguish those that wilfully neglect empathy, and those that feel no choice, as this is a particularly unique topic with this dynamic. </p>

<p>Are you meaning that psychopaths can choose when they want to feel empathy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not feel but react as though they feel. Some of them can learn to mimic human emotions that they don't feel, sadness, empathy, sympathy etc. (Again, that depends on whether you believe nature vs nurture, OP seems to lean towards nurture...I'm more believing of a combination of the two.)</p>
<p>It's a reading and recognition of other people's emotions then a choice to react, people tend to react instinctively, psychopaths don't....they &quot;react&quot; in a way that would benefit them, when it comes to reacting in a beneficial way, it's often a very measured, calculated response...</p>
<p>Not OP, not a PhD....couple of years behind on a similar(ish) track.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not what is meant by having an empathy switch, mimicking these emotions is something else altogether and is something at which those with aspd are adept.
Rather, the empathy switch means that psychopaths do not categorically lack empathy as was once believed. It means that by default they do not empathize but when instructed to empathize, they can display levels of empathy almost indiscernible from those of nt's.
It is also important to note that there are two types of empathy, cognitive and affective. Cognitive empathy is the cerebral ability to put oneself in another's shoes and affective ability is the negative emotional response that accompanies that awareness. The latter is what psychopaths typically lack. </p></div>		</li>
