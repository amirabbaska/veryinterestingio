<p>Cooler air inside the tower would slow down airflow. As for the wider radius at the outlet, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Kind of part of same thing, the airflow is accelerated and needs to slow down eventually. Flanging out the top keeps the pressure same but the airflow will be allowed to slow down. And i'm quite sure the reason we really need to slow it down controllably is the massive turbulence that would be created if fast moving, hot air was mixed with ambient. Widening the top allows it to mix gradually, in layers rather than as a direct turbulent stream.</p>
<p>And i would assume that it would aid collecting the condensation when it cools down at the top.. </p></div>		</li>
