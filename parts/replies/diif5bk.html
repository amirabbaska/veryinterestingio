			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah so I just downloaded the app, and it gives me the in-store and Walmart.com price a whole lot faster than I could have ever found one of those price-check stations and gotten it to actually scan.<br />
I mean, you shouldn't <em>have</em> to download an app to find out how much something is, but if you frequently shop at Walmart it's worth the space it uses. Plus there's Walmart Pay which sends you an eReceipt which saves paper and is really convenient since you don't have to keep up with receipts if you need to return/exchange something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you use Savings Catcher (and you should because you have nothing to lose by doing so), the Walmart Pay system is actually extremely convenient.  Submit your e-receipt with one tap, and your e-gift card is now reloaded automatically if they find a better price elsewhere.  Then, next time you check out with Walmart Pay, your e-gift card is used first by default.</p></div>		</li>
