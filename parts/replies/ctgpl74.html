			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually why salt and vinegar chips, for example, are &quot;artificially flavored&quot;. They are sprinkled with sodium acetate, which conveys the flavors of salt and vinegar while not technically being either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they use sodium acetate because using actual salt and vinegar wouldn't somehow &quot;work&quot; or is it more a budgetary decision? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. People can also buy KCl 'salt substitute' in grocery stores. It still tastes sort of salty. But definitely different. The K instead of Na makes a difference, for the reasons you said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly I like the taste of KCl more than regular salt.  Tastes kinda metallic and a little bit more bitter than regular salt.  But then again I'm weird and I like diet soda better than regular soda too.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work with dancers (ballet) for the summer and filled my winters with work as a commercial electrician.</p>
<p>Summers it was diet soda, and winter with sugar. Clearly I have some peer pressure issues. (Married a dancer, moved to hardware engineering - been diet for the last 25 years)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our brains are better at tasting sodium over potassium because we're more liable to lose our sodium. Our bodies like to have a major extracellular positive ion (Na^+ ) and a major intracellular positive ion (K^+ ) for things like altering membrane potential, paired transport through proteins, and controlling cell volume. Since K^+ stays mostly inside our cells, Na^+ is flushed from the bodily fluids faster, and low sodium (hyponatremia) is the most commonly encountered electrolyte imbalance. So, we have to be able to detect the taste of Na^+ to replace what's lost.</p>
<p>This spatial difference in distribution is clinically important. Inject a patient with NaCl, and you haven't changed much. But a syringe of KCl into the bloodstream is the killing stroke of the lethal injection procedure. It disrupts the heart's ability to conduct electricity by stopping it from exchanging intracellular K^+ effectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's not really true. Our bodies (mammal bodies in general) can't really tell them apart or which one we need. Animals deprived of potassium obsessively lick salt to no avail, eg. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2410095/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2410095/</a></p></div>		</li>
