			<p>This is actually why salt and vinegar chips, for example, are &quot;artificially flavored&quot;. They are sprinkled with sodium acetate, which conveys the flavors of salt and vinegar while not technically being either.</p>		</li>

			<p>Do they use sodium acetate because using actual salt and vinegar wouldn't somehow &quot;work&quot; or is it more a budgetary decision? </p>		</li>

			<p>vinegar is a 5% solution of acetic acid. Pure acetic acid is a liquid, so seasoning chips with it wouldn't work as it would make the chip soggy and disintegrate over time. By removing a hydrogen (the acid part of acetic acid) and replacing it with sodium, you turn it into a solid salt. Salts can be sprinkled on solids. Sodium is usually chosen as the replacement because it's cheap and easy to acquire, and sodium salts are soluble in water (which allows the flavoring to dissolve on your tongue). You could use other metal ions instead of sodium that are also soluble (such as lithium or potassium) but they ALSO taste 'salty' to our tongues (KCl is &quot;salt substitute&quot;). Other metal ions would not necessarily be soluble in water, or taste good. <br><br>So if you're wanting salt and vinegar flavored chips, and you need the vinegar to be solid, it's probably best to kill two birds with one stone. </p>		</li>

			<p>Vinegar tastes sour because of the protons, not the acetate ion. How does sodium acetate, being a weakly basic salt, produce a vinegar taste exactly?</p>		</li>

			<p>Acetic acid has a distinct aroma, which is what we associate with vinegar. If you sniff a bottle of vinegar, you can tell what it is before you put any in your mouth and notice that it's sour.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, if you know it's the hydrogen ion that tastes sour, it's not a huge leap to imagine that <em>any</em> Br√∏nsted-Lowry acid will give a sour taste. Sodium acetate is not going to be the only flavoring agent, and any pH-reducing agent will have this effect. The acetate ion, I presume, stimulates some range of bitter receptors characteristic to vinegar. The combined stimulation from multiple receptor types gives the peception of characteristic tastes.</p>		</li>

			<p>See my response above. Sour taste is actually specifically the detection of protons, and many of the other components of vinegar's flavor are probably largely olfactory.<br><br>[I mixed up which kind of acid that is. Not much of a chemist. My bad!]</p>		</li>

			<p>Once the salt reaches your mouth, it is dissolved by the water in your saliva. Contact with water causes some of the acetate ions to become protonated again (this is called equilibrium), giving that distinctive vinegar tast/aroma.</p>		</li>

			<p>Correct, but acetate is actually a base. His assertion was that  vinegar was sour due to acidic protons in solution. <br><br>The acetate ions abstracting protons from water as you correctly said would produce more hydroxide ions. </p>		</li>

			<p>I would think the reprotonation of acetate would have little effect on the sourness of it. The sourness of most acids comes from the hydronium ion, in my understanding. Acetate would never increase hydronium concentration in a solution.</p>		</li>

			<p>Our brains are better at tasting sodium over potassium because we're more liable to lose our sodium. Our bodies like to have a major extracellular positive ion (Na^+ ) and a major intracellular positive ion (K^+ ) for things like altering membrane potential, paired transport through proteins, and controlling cell volume. Since K^+ stays mostly inside our cells, Na^+ is flushed from the bodily fluids faster, and low sodium (hyponatremia) is the most commonly encountered electrolyte imbalance. So, we have to be able to detect the taste of Na^+ to replace what's lost.<br><br>This spatial difference in distribution is clinically important. Inject a patient with NaCl, and you haven't changed much. But a syringe of KCl into the bloodstream is the killing stroke of the lethal injection procedure. It disrupts the heart's ability to conduct electricity by stopping it from exchanging intracellular K^+ effectively.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, that's not really true. Our bodies (mammal bodies in general) can't really tell them apart or which one we need. Animals deprived of potassium obsessively lick salt to no avail, eg. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2410095/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2410095/</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Well, I said that rats can discriminate them. But not that that necessarily reflects a specific taste sensation four potassium cations. <br><br>Generally I suspect that the ability to discriminate sodium from potassium probably reflects the existence of multiple forms of sodium detection, which KCl activates with a different pattern of efficacy. In particular, there are amiloride sensitive and amiloride insensitive sodium detection mechanisms, and the pattern of activity produced by potassium may be different than the pattern produced by sodium, meaning that the subject can learn to discriminate the two despite not having a specific potassium sense.<br><br><a href="http://m.jn.physiology.org/content/50/4/879.short" target="_blank">Source</a> describing the responsiveness of sodium-best (meaning responsive primarily to sodium) neurons in the NTS, the primary brainstem sensory nucleus for taste, to a variety of other salts, including NaCl.</p>		</li>
