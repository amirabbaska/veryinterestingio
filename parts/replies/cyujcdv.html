			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case it is also not correct, at least not for the question asked.  They are moving away from each other at .88c but that has nothing to do with how fast light gets from one to the other.  Once a light beam is emitted it's going to go at the speed of light regardless of the speed of the source. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but I think the main confusion lies in that people think the 2 ships are moving away from each other at 1c (0.5c + 0.5c), so they believe the light emitted from one ship will never reach the other ship, since they are moving away from each other at the same speed that the light travels.</p>
<p>Once people are shown the calculations, and understand that the two ships aren't actually moving away from each other at a speed of 1c, but rather 0.88c,  it becomes clear that the light emitted from one ship will reach the other</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But didn't OP assume that velocities add in the classical way? I.e. they would (wrongly) think that in either ship's reference frame, the other one would be moving at c and thus even if they accepted that light always travels at c, they could still wonder if a beam of light from either ship would reach the other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Travels at <em>c</em> relative to each observer. So once that photon is emitted,  it doesn't matter how fast anyone is moving, they'll all see it moving at <em>c</em>.</p></div>		</li>
