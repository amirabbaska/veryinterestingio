			<div class="markdown"><p>My husband was a voracious reader as a kid and well into his adulthood. My father-in-law tells a story about how he came home from work and found his “”lazy” kid on the sofa reading a freaking book” when he should have been “doing something.” The father in law was ranting to one of his co-workers the next day about his shiftless kid, wasting time reading. The co-worker stopped him and said are you serious? Your kid is READING and you’re bent about it? </p>
<p>He had the self-awareness to realize he was being somewhat unreasonable—and that—gasp—a literate kid wasn’t the end of the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 21 and my parents wanted me to read less as well. Though, to be fair, I did spend more time reading than was healthy and some sleep and exercise probably would've done me some good. They never refused to buy me a book for my birthday or Christmas though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>She also criticized my reading because I'm wasting time and not socializing with my family.</p>
<p>She did not see the irony. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My folks encouraged my reading, even if it was daffy duck or asterisk at the shop as my mom did stuff.. </p>
<p>My aunt gave me lotr at age 12, I fucking devoured that book in 4 days, parents never questioned me being up late or tired for school,  I was dropping hundreds of pages a day. </p>
<p>30 years later is still my best pass time. Reading is better then Lego, mine craft, Netflix.
And I say this as an avid user of all the above. </p>
<p>You kid reads? Encourage it even if it's the box of cereal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My granny never understood why anyone would want more than two or three books, don't they all contain the same stuff? And why would you ever want to re-read any? Well, if all you ever encountered were the cheap romance booklets from the supermarket, it kinda <em>does</em> get boring. </p>
<p>But watching TV was fine, because it was &quot;educational&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every summer I would go to my grandparents' house. I'd be dropped off in the morning and picked up at night, pretty much like daycare. I loved to read, and there wasn't a whole lot to do at their house, so I would spend hours reading whatever books I brought. This would upset both my grandparents, as they thought I should be spending more time outside.</p>
<p>After years of this, they never understood why I wouldn't want to spend anytime outside in 100° weather when I could be enjoying the air conditioning with a book.</p></div>		</li>
