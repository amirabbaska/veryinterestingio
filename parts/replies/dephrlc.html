			<div class="markdown"><p>Um, no. It used to be an International Socialist day (in case you're wondering Socialist =/= Communist) that wasn't held on a particular day, although it <em>was</em> held on March 8th as early as 1914. On March 8th 1917 it wasn't the Russian Revolution that began, it was the February Revolution, which is the first of two distinct revolutions that took place the same year. What we call the Russian Revolution was actually the October/November Revolution (depending on the calendar), that was the Communist overthrow of the provisional government. Now, it <em>is</em> true that mainly the Soviet Union and its client states celebrated the holiday for the better part of the first half of the 20th century, but the UN started recognizing it in 1975 (which was the International Women's Year and incidentally the year I was born) and since 1977 it is an international holiday. The real reason the US hasn't been celebrating it (and some people don't even know it exists) is kind of similar to the reason soccer's not huge as in the rest of the world: a combination of &quot;we have our own thing going on&quot; and &quot;we got other things to worry about&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that the date of celebrations are due to the 1917 protests in Petrograd that started the whole Soviet thing, but did you know it was actually celebrated in America first? (Albeit a week earlier.)</p>
<p>It started as an American Socialist event in 1909, and then spread to the Second International. Russian women picked it up soon after (with the late February date).</p>
<p>It's celebrated on the 8th of March now because, well, the Petrograd marches kind of set off the whole Soviet thing and led to women's suffrage there, some 3 years before the vote was extended to American women. It's connection with socialism probably explains why it's not as well known in the West.</p></div>		</li>
