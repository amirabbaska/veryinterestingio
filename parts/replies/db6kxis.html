<p>Just to clarify, you are talking about magnitude of the momentum four vector [; p_{\mu} p^{\mu} ;] being equal to (mc)², right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the equations for relativity, mass doesn't come up as something that changes. Instead we simply see that it takes more energy to continue speeding up as you get closer to light speed, which contradicts Newtonian mechanics because Newton was frankly just wrong. Dynamic mass is only brought up by people the refuse to let go of Newtonian mechanics.</p>
<p>Here are the equations: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_relativistic_equations" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_relativistic_equations</a> </p>
<p>We know these relativistic equations work because we have tested them in particle accelerators. Mass, and therefore gravity, doesn't change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you mean is that, as you get closer to c, you need more energy to continue speeding and we see that in the equations and interpret that as mass increasing?</p>
<p>Maybe something like anti-matter in Feynman diagrams where you can interpret them as <del>matter</del> particles going against time but that's something that doesn't really happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah alright I'm a few hours late but there's a question regarding this that I've had an absolute burning curiosity in to the point where I've considered posing it as a separate question here on askscience, and it goes something like:</p>
<p>I have constantly heard that relativity clarifies that there is no such thing as absolute velocity; that we're only going as fast as can be compared to other objects. But if that were the case, then how is there a preset, determined increase in energy required to boost an object's velocity as it approaches C? If velocity is relative, but there's an absolute energy requirement gain as we approach a constant C, then why can't we define an absolute velocity based on the energy requirement gain? Either we'd need to agree that there's a concrete, absolute velocity, or that there's a facet of this that I am completely overlooking because I'm a helpless layman informed by Google and Wikipedia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newton wasn't &quot;wrong&quot;, his theory was just incomplete, as he never had any chance to observe motion close to the speed of light. Besides, I doubt any serious physicist rejects relativity and thinks Newtonian mechanics is all there is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the difference between saying E^(2)=m^(2)+p^(2) and saying m^(2)=E^(2)-p^(2). (note: we're using c=1; the expression should be m^(2)=(E/c^(2))^(2)-(p/c)^(2) but the factor of c is often dropped for convenience).</p>
<p>In these equations, E is the dynamic mass and m is the rest (or invariant) mass. The second equation is really what we get from Special relativity, and it's important to note that m (and thus m^(2)) is <em>invariant</em> - it doesn't change no matter which frame you are in. So it's the <em>invariant</em> property of the material, the rest mass, which we want to actually use.</p>
<p>The mathematical trick is literally just adding p^2 (the kinetic energy) to both sides of m^(2)=E^(2)-p^(2) and calling the result the dynamic mass.</p>
<p>The reason it came about is because historically, as the theory was being worked out in greater detail, we simply didn't know what should be important. Now that we do, we can see that the concept of dynamic mass (also called relativistic mass) is not the important one.</p>
<hr />
<p>To justify why I said &quot;E is the dynamic mass&quot;; the original definitions where that m_rel=E_tot/c^2 and m_0=E_0/c^2 (where m_0 is rest mass and E_0 is rest energy) and it was found that m_rel=γm_0 (where γ is the speed factor 1/(1-(v/c)^(2))^(1/2) that shows up everywhere in SR); E_tot, the total energy, is given by the sum of the rest-mass energy and the kinetic energy from the momentum contribution. Hence, E_tot is what I was just calling E, and is up to a factor of c^2 the dynamic mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Einsteins equation in its full form is: E^2 = m^2 <em> c^4 + p^2 </em> c^2 </p>
<p>The non-relativistic approximation is the more famous version: E = mc^2</p>
<p>If these two energies are to be equal we have:</p>
<p>E^2 = m<em><em>dynamic</em></em>^2 <em> c^4 = m</em><em>constant</em><em>^2 </em> c^4 + p^2 * c^2</p>
<p>=&gt; m<em><em>d</em></em>^2 = (m<em><em>c</em></em>^2 <em> c^4 + p^2 </em> c^2 ) / c^4</p>
<p>=&gt; m<em><em>d</em></em> = sqrt(m<em><em>c</em></em>^2 + p^2 / c^2 )</p>
<p>Now using the fact that p = mv we get:</p>
<p>=&gt; m<em><em>d</em></em> = m<em><em>c</em></em> * sqrt(1 + v^2 / c^2 )</p>
<p>The square root term is equal to one when v = 0 and slowly increases as the velocity increases. So in a non-relativistic point of view the mass seem to increase but as relativity tells us it is just the fact that our energy increases with our velocity.</p></div>		</li>
