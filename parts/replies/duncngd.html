<p>I've heard that a submarine can go some extremely far distance with a golf ball sized piece of uranium.</p>
<p>Assuming the worst case, how much damage could a golf ball sized piece of uranium/nuclear material cause to the sea around the sunken submarine?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fuel is contained inside the reactor vessel which is thick steel which itself is inside the reactor compartment. There's considerably more than a golf ball sized amount of fuel although the exact reactor specifications are classified (reactors use fuel rods, not balls, but that's not really relevant) but even if both the reactor compartment and the reactor vessel were breached exposing the fuel rods to open sea water, the environmental risk is so low it might as well be 0. The wreck is over 200mi from the nearest land at a depth of 8,400 feet. at that depth, water mixes very slowly, and there's such a tiny amount of radioactive material compared to the entirely of the world's oceans that if it did leak, it would, over time, disperse into the entire rest of the world's oceans at concentrations so low it would be undetectable. It's worth noting that the Navy periodically monitors the site of the wreck has never found any signs of radiation leakage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not exactly sure about the latest submarines but the Navy doesn't use fuel rods. The rods in this case are control rods. The uranium is stored in fuel cells and the rods control the reactivity in the core. Fuel rods are mainly used in commercial plants because they burn through fuel much faster and are easier to replace than pulling out spent uranium from within reactor core. Something else worth noting is there are multiple layers of safeguards in place to prevent a core meltdown which prevents fuel exposure to the atmosphere. Aircraft carriers have something called emergency fill which will surge the core with borated water effectively killing the ability to produce fission. I'm not sure if subs have this kind of procedure. I'm a former navy surface nuclear reactor operator but it's been quite some time since I've been in so some of this may be outdated but most of the ships are still in commission from when I was in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the most radioactive material can't penetrate more than about 20 feet of water with it's decaying particles. It really would only affect a very, very small area on the ocean floor. If the material dissolves, the volume of the ocean is so great that it simply dillute to safe levels.</p></div>		</li>
