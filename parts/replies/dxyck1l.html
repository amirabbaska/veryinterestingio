			<div class="markdown"><p>Another party of your question regards variance. They can vary a lot, considering there are some high desert regions without sand at all (a good example of this would be Joshua tree national Park in California).</p></div>		</li>

I don't <em>think</em> we have a detailed map of soil types under the glaciers, but I would be <em>delighted</em> to be proven wrong.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question. How does sand turn into sandstone. It seems like the amount of pressure and heat would have to be immense to compact sand into a stone. How much pressure and heat would be required?</p>
<p>This brings up another question. If the amount of material needed to compact this sand into stone was immense then where did all the material go that was stacked on top of this sand and why did it go away exposing the layers underneath?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two ways to cement: direct chemical bonding of grains, or cement deposition via groundwater.
So, elements of importance to answer the question are:</p>
<p>1) Material the sand is made of; quartz, which is what you expect in deserts is non reactive, while carbonates are more likely to react;</p>
<p>2) Length of time: millions of years gives a lot of time for bonding to happen;</p>
<p>3) Availability of cement: silica or carbonate in groundwater can deposit on your grains and cement them, if they are available and in conditions where they can be deposited;</p>
<p>and last, </p>
<p>4) Pressure and heat can increase the rates of reactions. </p>
<p>I have held carbonate sandstone that is 10,000 years old and is tightly cemented, and I have also held Paleozoic (300 Million year old) sand that is as loose as what you'd find on the beach today. So there isn't a simple answer to your question, but as a rough guideline, once you get quartz sand buried a mile deep, it's very likely to bond together. </p>
<p>The answer to getting enough material on top, and then eroding it, is usually going to be related to mountain building events and then erosion related to plate tectonics. Geologists spend a lot of time recreating these histories. So, when people talk about sandstone, key into names of mountain ranges or uplifts, which will define their history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response. What I still don't get is exactly HOW you get individual solid rock to bond together. For example if I took a handful of sand and put it under a hydrolic press with 100,000 lbs of pressure I don't think it would bind the molecules together under a rock. </p>
<p>So when we're talking about the sandstone formation how much pressure and heat are we actually talking here? And what is the actual process that it looks like when these molecules start to combine? Are these &quot;cements&quot; you talk about always required in compose sandstone? Is it sort of a situation where these smaller clay and silt and calcium carbonate gluing together these larger particles of sand or are the actual sand particles themselves gluing together?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the example of the Navajo Sandstone, it would have been buried a few km deep at minimum, possible up to ~10 km deep.</p>
<p>Low grade metamorphosis will begin to occur at ~200 Â°C and 300 MPa (~10 km burial depth).</p>
<p>The Navajo Sandstone is fully-lithified, but doesn't display low-grade metamorphism, so its maximal burial depth would not have exceeded 10 km.</p>
<p>/u/aelendel explained the concept of 'accommodation space' fairly well, but yeah, in their time, the sand dunes of the Navajo sandstone were buried by more sand dunes and sediments (back during the Jurassic).</p>
<p>Once the sand dunes were sufficiently buried, another event that could have pushed them to deeper depths was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laramide_orogeny" target="_blank">Laramide Orogeny</a> -- which occurred from ~ 75 to 40 millions years ago -- which is the event that built up the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>During orogenic events, the lithosphere (crust) thickens significantly... Rocks near the surface will be pushed to higher elevation, while rocks and sediments at the core of the mountain building will be pushed to deeper depths.</p>
<p>So at some point, this sandstone was buried several km deep.  It was brought to the surface through the process known as [geological exhumation](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhumation_(geology" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhumation_(geology</a>).</p>
<p>During this process, overlaying rocks and sediments are eroded away, and the previously buried geological layer is brought to the surface because of Lithospheric buoyancy -- this is the same reason why the East Coast of the US has risen 100s of meters since the last Ice Age, after ~10,000 feet of ice was removed from the surface.  The lithosphere 'rebounded' due to the unloading of overlaying material... the same thing happens when overlaying geological layers are removed.</p>
<p>So that is how a sedimentary layer comes to be buried to depth, and then proceeds to be brought back to the surface.</p></div>		</li>
