			<div class="markdown"><p>I would beef up your writing skills. I would recommend volunteering with whichever office at your university writes press releases describing research advances to the public. In my experience, their reporters were ecstatic to have someone on board that could explain the science!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like most scientists that go into alternative careers, I took a unique route to where I am now. I started my graduate work wanting to become a professor in academia. As I went through my time as a grad student, I quickly realized I loved science but didn't want to be the principal investigator (PI) of a lab.</p>
<p>When I got my Ph.D., I went to my postdoc thinking I wanted to do research in the private sector. Because I was one of the few native English speakers in my lab, I helped write most of the research papers we were publishing.</p>
<p>The more writing I did, the more I realized I wanted to spend my time writing rather than doing experiments. I started volunteering with my university's public relations department writing press releases describing research advances to the general public on the side while I still did my lab work.</p>
<p>I was still trying to figure out what I wanted to do when I talked to one of my friends from grad school who was then working in the State Department, and he recommended I take an online myIDP career assessment offered for free on the Science Careers website. I was a 94% match for science policy.</p>
<p>AAAS offers a Science and Technology Policy Fellowship that embeds people with advanced science and medical degrees in the federal government. It sounded great, so I applied. I got a position, and I've been here for a few months. I love it!</p></div>		</li>
