			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, permafrost will make pretty quick work of anything underground. Canada is constantly ripping up roads to fix all the sewage and water lines underneath. It's non-stop. By the time they fix one spot, the previous spot they already fixed needs to be re-done. Even if they are just fixing a road from permafrost damage, now they have to be careful not to rip up any buried lines.</p>
<p>I imagine it is the same for northern States.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As well, lightning degrades the cable jacket. So, after a good electrical storm, we get some fun outages to chase around.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For reference in Bellevue, WA; when replacing the power lines from above to underground for my apartment building, I needed to pay over 100k to service 4 units, just for inspection, permits, and engineers. I then paid another 150k for the equipment, and the actual work cost another 60k, which required, yet another permit because it was in a city right of way. Since I was doing all that work in this area, I had to pay the entire bill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Funny, I was coming to mention whole cities without above-ground lines, and I was gonna name Bellevue =P</p>
<p>Where about are there above-ground lines, aside from transfer stations and some of the transmission lines in between?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they're fundamentally changing my neighborhood's character. But we also have the transmission line running through. Which, incidentally, everybody's up-in-arms about what the new lines will do to South Bellevue property values, well, Bridle Trails has a big fat line running straight down the middle and you'd never know it.</p>
<p>Because Bellevue is a forest.</p>
<p>But OKAY NIMBYs =P not that I don't appreciate their concerns, since the rezoning is fundamentally changing my neighborhood's character.</p>
<p>At any rate, I'm honestly surprised, though I guess I shouldn't be. There was plenty of Bellevue here 50, 60 years ago, and before that, it would've been farmhouses, who <em>definitely</em> wouldn't have had underground lines.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia, we've been told the installation costs are about 8 times greater for equivalent network infrastructure. There are lower numbers of faults on UG but a higher expense to repair, both in terms of effort to fault-find and repair &amp; customer length of outage (can't pay charge bills when meters don't tick).</p>
<p>I don't know actual costs for anything though.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For 3 phase 12.5 kv or 25 kv, supposing nearly ideal ground conditions and easy access, I usually ballpark about $70k to $80k per mile. But that doesn't include any transformers, regulators, easements, permits, land costs, etc. If you have rocky soil, rock that needs to be blasted, need helicopters, etc the cost rises very rapidly. Also if you are running transmission voltages the cost raises precipitously.</p></div>		</li>
