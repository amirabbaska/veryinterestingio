			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps this is out of place in ask science, but this almost blew my mind. On earth, oxygen is an essential component of fire - a base component from atmosphere. On titan, if you were to rediscover fire, oxygen would be the fuel and methane your base component from atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now, I know at school I was taught oxygen is required for a flame, but is this really the case? Can two reactants make a flame without the presence of oxygen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily a flame, but you can have a &quot;burning&quot; type reaction without oxygen. Several elements can work. The general class of reactions is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox" target="_blank">redox reactions</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely possible. As /u/tansit stated as well, combustion is basically a set of redox reactions, for which you need something that really wants electrons (your oxidizing agent) and something that likes to get rid of them (your reducing agent).</p>
<p>For example, fluorine is a more potent oxidizer than even oxygen, and will set fire to almost all organic materials you have it come in contact with. There are many more crazy compounds like this, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_trifluoride" target="_blank">Chlorine Trifluoride</a>, and while they give off quite energetic flames with anything you can oxidize (including metals), the reaction products are often pretty nasty (stuff like Hydrochloric and Hydrofluoric acid ain't fun). This is also one of the reasons a lot of rockets rather resort to liquid oxygen than these more potent oxidizers, next to all the extra handling risks of course.</p>
<p>Another fun example is the formation of regular <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbPxwDiX1NU" target="_blank">ol' sodium chloride</a>. You have Chlorine &amp; Sodium, and with a little kick they will combust and form table salt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The atmosphere seems to the the lesser part of the methane reserves (and ethane, as well as propane) on Titan.  The lakes and possible sub-surface aquifers seem that they'd be a better target for combustion, but a method for volatilizing them would be needed first...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't sure what Titan was so I googled it.</p>
<p>Wikipedia says it's 50% larger than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive.</p>
<p>Would you happen to know what the difference is? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's incorrect:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Density of the Moon: 3.34 g/cm^3</p>
</li>
<li>Density of Titan: 1.88 g/cm^3</li>
</ul>
<p>Titan has a lot more ice than our Moon, which is much less dense than rock.</p>
<p>The real reason that Titan is 1.5x as large as our Moon but 1.8x more massive is because mass does not scale linearly with radius. Rather, mass scales as the radius <em>cubed</em>. </p>
<p>If you increased the size of Moon by 1.5x, it's volume would increase by a factor of 1.5^3 = 3.38x. If you added enough moon-material to keep it the exact same density, its mass would also increase by a factor of 3.38x. The fact that Titan is only 1.8x more massive (and not 3.38x) tells you it must be much less dense than the Moon.</p></div>		</li>
