			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya know, I've saw the same thing after power outages.</p>
<p>And I think it's because these machines have been on for years and years, and the surge from powering off and back on is enough to damage it. Would have happened with a normal shutdown, in a way the outage was just identifying all the stuff that was on the verge of breaking anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was all about overcoming that inertia on  older bearings. Sort of like an old 3 speed fan just hums when you try to start it in 'slow' but can spin up with full juice on 'high'.</p>
<p>Blowing the crap out of the bearings and a drop of oil rejuvinates the fan, not so much a hard drive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be related to temperature too.  If a machine has been running warm or hot for years, then a power loss lets it cool down, you could get loose connections from everything shrinking a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have forcefully set a drive or two down flat on a bench while powered off. If I needed to do it while running I'd whack the side with the handle of a rubber screwdriver, hoping for less chance to scratch the platter using a sideways motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup, the drive parked. I was blaming it on too many gluons leaking from the power supply for a while, but someone called me on that one.</p>
<p>Tech support was a blast in the early days, they would believe almost anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now the hard drive issue wasn't an electronics problem at all, rather it was mechanical. The issue was stiction in the motor that spins up the platters due to some shitty lube on the bearings that would dry up and cause the motor to stick. </p>
<p>This was common in Seagate ST series MFM hard drives back in the mid to late 80's. I worked as a tech for ComputerLand back then, we used to get these in for service all the time. The usual procedure was whack it with a rubber mallet to get the drive to spin up, then we'd back up all the data and sell the customer a new hard drive with the data restored.</p></div>		</li>
