			<div class="markdown"><p>I've mentioned this elsewhere, but it is possible to place a magnetic field generator at lagrange point 1. Because the solar wind would bend the field away from the sun and around the planet, it would not have to be near the power of one on the planet itself. It wouldn't be easy or permanent without maintenance but it would help delay the damage from solar wind to any teraformed atmosphere and probably speed the process up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be underestimating the size such a 'generator' would need to have, as well as the distance of the Lagrange points. </p>
<p>Earth's magnetic field is produced by the constant motion of iron in the <em>outer core</em>. It may not move very fast, but that's ~<strong>1E^24 kg</strong> worth of iron swirling around producing the field. Right now, an artificial generator of that strength is in about the same realm as terraforming Venus, Dyson Spheres and other concepts that require a <em>vastly</em> larger scale of engineering.</p>
<p>But even if we could build something that could produce a field equal to Earth's, it would do very little at L1. Mars' L1 with the Sun is more than a million kilometers away, and magnetic field strength is related to distance (r) as r^-3 . An Earth-strength magnetic field would have lost (very roughly) 100^3 = 1,000,000^th of its strength by the time you reach Mars. The shield idea is nice, but solar radiation does not move in a straight line around a field like that either. Building it on Mars, would remain a more sensible choice, because the strength requirements would be roughly a million times lower.</p>
<p>So in conclusion: the investment such a (horribly inefficient) generator would require, are most definitely not worth it, especially seeing how extremely slow the atmosphere-reducing effect of the solar wind is, relative to human life and development. For the a fraction of the cost a civilization could just renew the gases that are lost.</p></div>		</li>
