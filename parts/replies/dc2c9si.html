			<div class="markdown"><p>The first thing you described is natural, and is common for everyone. We normally only fully utilize one nostril at a time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because your nostrils split their workload. Throughout the day, they each take breaks in a process of alternating congestion and decongestion called the nasal cycle. At a given moment, if you're breathing through your nose, the lion’s share of the air is going in and out of one nostril, with a much smaller amount passing through the other. Every few hours, your autonomic nervous system, which takes care of your heart rate, digestion and other things you don’t consciously control, switches things up and your other nostril does all the heavy lifting for a little while. </p>

<p>The nasal drip is something that your doctor will have to figure out. Your doctor likely wanted to try antihistamines first because they are less invasive than some other things I can think of that could cause nasal drip. One thing that you could have is a deviated septum. These are quite common, and somewhat easy to fix via small surgery.</p>
<p>Vaping can irritate your sinuses. It is a mixture of flavor chemicals and humidity that you are introducing into your airways. These aren't normally dangerous, but you could be sensitive to them. </p>
<p>Regardless, it is dangerous to start playing doctor. You should discuss these issues with your doctor and take anything you hear or see on the internet regarding your health with a grain of salt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nostrils close in order to re-moisturise. If both your nostrils were clogged, then they didn't dry out, so both opened at the same time afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nostrils are open different amounts, but the speed of the air is the same in both. One nostril will have air moving at a particular speed through a large channel, while the other nostril will have air moving that same speed through a narrow channel. The only thing you can really feel inside your nose is the speed of air coming past, so your nerve cells will pick up an identical stimulus of &quot;air going past at speed X&quot; in both nostrils. You don't have a way to feel that the channel sizes or total air volumes are different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One side automatically allows less air through, but that becomes much more obvious when sick because swelling causes &quot;less air&quot; to mean &quot;no air&quot;. After getting over the disease you could've just been so used to &quot;no air&quot; that any airflow seemed great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used Rhinocort nasal spray (similar to Flonase I think) for a few years for my pollen allergies and it was great. I'd always get a new prescription in the spring whenever my allergies kicked up. But then one year I noticed I went the whole year without allergies. The next year, same thing. Ever since, like 10 yrs now, I've been allergy free. Don't know if I have the meds to thank for that but it's been great not having spring/fall allergies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm always wary of nasal sprays now because I used Afrin heavily for a while as a teenager and it permanently fucked up my sinuses. I wish I had known the dangers of long-term use beforehand, but I only knew how harmful it was after seeing a ENT years later. </p>
<p>Granted, it would help immensely with my post-nasal drip and congestion. But in the long-term, it made everything much worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it helps I can tell you that I have never smoked and I and my brother both deal with the second problem you described. Many mornings I will have to &quot;hock a loogie&quot; and swallow hard to pull it down into the back of my mouth so that I can spit it out. Brown or dark green sometimes. Usually thick almost like a half developed booger only its the size of, like, 3 nickles stacked up? Sorry for the tmi, everyone. Haha </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You desperately need a [Neti Pot.]( <a href="https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/neilmed-nasaflo-neti-pot/ID=prod3356564-product" target="_blank">https://www.walgreens.com/store/c/neilmed-nasaflo-neti-pot/ID=prod3356564-product</a>) This one is the best I've used. I'm not exaggerating, it will change your life.  When you get to flush out all the glue with nice, warm, salty water, you immediately feel better.</p>
<p>If you do it daily for a while, you also flush out any particles of dust, etc that are causing the irritation.</p>
<p>If you wake up to this every morning, I would make a huge effort to clean your bedroom - cotton bedding only, washed weekly in hot water, no carpets, no curtains.  It's part of any allergy management to reduce your exposure to irritants. You are probably allergic to dust, dust mites, mold or feathers/down from the bedding.</p></div>		</li>
