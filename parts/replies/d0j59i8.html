			<div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned how an earth day would be different. Obviously the rotation of earth about its own axis will not cause much variation in what part of the earth is receiving sunlight, so I imagine there would be something interesting going on there. Any enlightenment you can give us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the day would change throughout the year (like it does now, only far more extremely).  In the summer and winter, you'd have one pole in 24-hr, broiling sunlight, and the other in perpetual darkness, and at the (apparently icebound) equator, you'd have the sun hovering just above the equator (at least on the equinox). <em>However</em>, in the spring/autumn, you'd have the opposite: sun circling above the horizon at the poles (much like a polar summer here), and a sun that moves overhead from East to West at the equator. It would be a very screwy system, and climatically chaotic no doubt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The poles would be the same as they are now: day for half the year and night for the other half. The sun would simply work it's way up higher than it does now (in the middle of summer). For a full 90 degree tilt the Sun would be directly over head at the summer solstice. From then until autumn the Sun would slowly spiral down to the horizon and below it for the next half-year of night.</p>
<p>For a full 90 degree tilt, the equator have completely normal day-night cycles at the autumnal and spring equinoxes, with the Sun passing directly overhead on those days. Each day from the equinox to the solstice the Sun would cut across the sky a bit further towards the North or South. At the solstices you'd have a very long dusk/dawn, before the Sun would start doing everything in reverse for the trip back to the equinox. For a &lt;90 degree tilt you have something between that and what we have now. Just more extreme.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well just imagine if the arctic circle were pushed down to 90-tilt degrees in latitude.  For 57 deg that means the arctic circle would be 33 deg north, so southern Georgia, Northern Africa, Israel, southern tip of Japan would be on the Arctic circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might get buried/not answered, but out of curiosity... if the tilt changes, does a correction in the distance from sun help in any way to form a new goldilock zone for the planet? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, this is just one of the reasons that a &quot;goldilocks zone&quot; is a bit of a poor estimate of habitability. There are a lot of other unknowns - like planetary albedo (reflectiveness) and the magnitude of a greenhouse effect - that make simple knowledge of a planet's position alone a really uncertain indicator of the prospects for life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The distance from the Sun just increases or decreases the overall average temperature of the Earth.  According to the paper, a highly tilted Earth would not have a significantly different average temperature than the current Earth.  The temperature would just be distributed differently across the Earth.</p></div>		</li>
