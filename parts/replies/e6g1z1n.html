			<div class="markdown"><p>Opposite, keep both feet close together on the ground. Move in a shuffling motion and don't separate your feet.</p>
<p>For instance if you crash your car into a power pole and the wire falls down (if you absolutely have to, generally you should stay put!!) you should stand up on your door frame and jump onto the ground with both feet at the same time, being careful to not touch your car.</p></div>		</li>

But here is the part where it shows you how to survive being in the radius of a downed power line.  It should be noted, the prior to this part they suggest you call 911 and remain in the car keeping people away, but since it is on fire he needs to get out.</p>
