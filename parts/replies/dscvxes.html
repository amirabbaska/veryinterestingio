			<div class="markdown"><p>I...think that might be overactive for me. When I touch cold things, like an iced drink, for more than a minute or so, my fingertips swell up and get red, like uncomfortably so. I've never been able to figure out why, and it's sort of the opposite of Reynaud's as far as I can tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. Maybe! I don't get damage from it, but it does itch a bit. Doesn't ever happen just from cold weather, only from directly contacting ice-cold objects. And I don't think it's ever happened to my feet, but then I don't carry cold drinks with my toes, or walk on ice. Thanks for the link!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just started getting these in my toes this winter. They suck so bad, I wish I knew a way to get rid of them. It's so uncomfortable when my one toe is hotter than the rest of them, and then it feels like I'm walking on tiny pebbles. :( if anyone has any suggestions other than what's in the wiki article, please let me know, I'm desperate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused but interested and Google searches used big words I don't understand. Can you explain a little more how to apply this? My understanding from your post is that you basically let an extremity freeze, then warm it up, and it has an easier time adapting and staying warm after that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>*Also, which words did you not understand? I'd like to help you understand them. (feel free to pm)</p></div>		</li>
