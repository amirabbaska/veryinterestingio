<p>1/2 the thickness in an amorphous solid tightly interwoven and sporadic is not nearly as weak as a warped grain boundary that happens to separate the two pieces.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am willing to take this for true but then the question only adds more depth to the original question.</p>
<p>Why is it for a softer, presumably more amorphous solid, does the grain act as a lesser force concentrator/smaller defect in Griffiths equation relative to the intentional scoring than in the harder, presumably more ordered solid? Is it deformation and elasticity at the grain boundary? And if so why does increased deformability before failure favour the macroscopic score as the flaw rather than the microscopic grain boundary?</p>
<p>Edit: I am speculating that there might be an alignment of forces factor going on here. A person breaking chocolate with his hands might be more likely to align the stress with one of a bazillion major microscopic flaws than the scoring? I wonder what the results are compared to using this <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.649051!/file/FractureBehaviour.pdf" target="_blank">rig</a>? Is this kind of alignment of force a thing in materials engineering with respect to micro vs macroscopic faults? Or does there tend to be relative homogeneity of force applied through the material with relative to yield stress?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People here are talking about the organization of the material but not considering how the forces are applied in relation to the groove. For the glass cutting, I imagine they apply pressure right on or very near the spot they scratched vs. breaking a chocolate bar when the groove could be proportionally further way and much wider (less defined stress point)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>true.  for the glass, we use a straight edge even just a table and line the groove up just beside it.  clean break most times</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, everyone is ignoring the elephant in the room: the immensely complex 3-d stress state you introduce by loading an un-notched bar in what is basically a 4-point bend using 4 misaligned spherical balls (assuming you break it like a normal person and not facing upside down)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it that people can cut glass in all sorts of shapes using a slight scoring? Is it because it's creating a weakness in the final crystalline structure, rather than a cast-in weakness?</p></div>		</li>
