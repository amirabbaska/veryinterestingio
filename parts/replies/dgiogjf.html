			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah okay, yeah I mentioned Heisenberg's uncertainty principle but I didn't make the connection that it itself is a reason for incomputability. Thank you for your answer</p>
<p>Tangential and ~crazy question that you'd may not even want to respond to, but what about computational requirements for actually including Heisenberg's uncertainty in a simulation ? </p>
<p>Like Neil Tyson, Steven Hawking and Elon Musk; The simulated universe hypothesis has always fascinated me. This uncertainty principle has always been suspicious though. Does it not feel like it's exactly what you'd expect in a simulation? Along with the max resolution of space and floating pt. numbers (aka plank distances and time) and tick-rate increases (as one approaches the speed limit c.). Also the way that light waves (approximations to reduce the computation?) only become discrete particles upon closer inspection. Have you given any thought on this stuff, or do you dismiss it as funny parallels? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that planck length is not the length at which space becomes quantized - in fact, it's more likely according to current knowledge that space is continuous and not discrete/quantized. Just wanted to make that clear, as I wasn't certain if you were implying the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was implying the opposite, so I was misinformed. Thank you for the correction. When you say more likely according to current knowledge, can you explain why space is not discrete?</p>
<p>Do you mean, if i moved my hand an inch across space, each point in between could be written with infinite digits? I was under the impression the accuracy could only go to 35 digits in base 10. 1e-35 or whatever the plank distance is.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Planck distance isn't a fundamental limit like you're saying, it's not a &quot;max resolution&quot;, it's just a relationship between the speed of light the gravitational constant, and the constant we use to calculate the energy of a photon from its wavelength, and it has little actual physical significance. </p>
<p>Light waves don't only become discrete particles upon closer inspection either.  Photons propagate in a wave but interacts in a more discrete area.  It's the interaction and the persistence of the information from that interaction that makes it discrete, not &quot;inspection&quot;.</p>
<p>On a macro level, there are constant interactions by nearby particles, so the particles stay more particle-y.  </p>
<p>Light waves aren't &quot;approximations to reduce computation&quot;.  If I'm writing a program, it's orders of magnitude simpler to calculate the ray of a single particle than it is to calculate a probability map of all potential interactions in a waveform.  It's far simpler for me to simulate a photon as a particle than it would be to simulate the actual behavior of a photon. </p>
<p>The simulated universe hypothesis is still interesting, but I don't think these things point to evidence to support it.  We don't have anything in our universe, or barely even imaginable that could simulate our universe, because anything that simulated our universe would need to be bigger than our universe to do so, as it would contain our universe, plus itself at a minimum.  But for pretty much the same reason, a simulated universe could be possible because it would require things that could do things that would be impossible in our universe.   But more importantly, it is possible to imagine that within our universe could simulate a less complex universe of our own, that could not create a simulation of itself, similar to the way that we could not create a simulation of our universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that the time evolution of the probability wave function of quantum systems is perfectly linear and deterministic and hence non-chaotic.  </p>
<p>However measurement of said systems are probabilistic and non-linear, so that is where chaos come in.</p>
<p>I'd love to corrected by a physicist though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Determinism is not the opposite of chaos. Chaos just means that the output of the system depends very sensitively on the input. For a quantum system this would mean changing a small subsystem to an orthogonal state and getting a very different final state for the whole system, which you can analyze without mentioning measurement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unitary time evolution in quantum mechanics is linear and deterministic, but that doesn't mean that the &quot;motion&quot; of a quantum-mechanical particle cannot be chaotic. For example in strongly interacting many-body systems like atomic nuclei, you'll find chaos. There is a whole field of study called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chaos" target="_blank">quantum chaos</a>, which plays a role in mesoscopic quantum systems.</p></div>		</li>
