			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in nursing school the other students would not wear masks (even when in clinical) when they were sick, because they would get strange looks. At some point you have to suck it up and be socially responsible. Regarding flu transmission, there’s a pretty good YouTube video out there that Adam Savage did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, there's a difference between simply looking weird and irresponsibly risking the spread of illnesses b/c you don't think it's cool to wear protective cover. Imagine an aspiring astronaut saying they won't wear a space suit in space b/c it looks lame... Practical function over fashion IMO</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where were you in nursing school?  The number one users of medical masks I see, are nurses.  But that's in oncology.</p>
<p>Next on the list are immunocompromised children, but that's also oncology.</p>
<p>Then docs, but they're less frequently involved, but also in oncology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't wear a mask while I was driving to my doctor's office but put it on after I got out to go in. I did feel a little strange at first until I explained myself to the receptionist and she thanked me for being considerate and other patients didn't seem to mind, just a little common sense goes far. It's not something I would do all the time but will do again if I have to absolutely go somewhere sick. </p></div>		</li>
