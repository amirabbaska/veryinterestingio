			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the interesting question! Around over 99% of Antarctic terrain is covered by permanent ice and snow currently and we know ice sheets from before the Last Glacial Maximum were thicker and more widespread. Scientists have long thought, based on modelling of ice sheets across the continent, that all pre-glacial (Mesozoic) terrestrial life was wiped out during these successive events and that the animals currently found there colonized during periods of glacial retreat. However, there is some evidence, biological and geological, that challenges this theory (Convey et al 2008). It is now thought that some of the contemporary terrestrial biota was isolated millions of years before (some even pre-Gondwana break-up). This is based on fossil record of midges in the South Shetland Islands (49-68 million years ago; Allegrucci et al 2006), insects present inland before break up of Gondwana (Cromer et al 2006, Hodgson et al 2005) and copepods which are from the time of seperation of Antarctica and Australia (Bayly et al 2003), among others which date to before formation of the current ice sheet formed around 33 million years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I expect so...see earlier reply above. I don't think any of us have the expertise to know where to look. Exploring to find fossils in a polar land has been a dream of mine. I've wanted to see the fossil forests in the Canadian Arctic. </p></div>		</li>
