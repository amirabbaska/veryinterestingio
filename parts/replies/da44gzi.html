			<div class="markdown"><p>But is this strictly true. Doesn't it have more to do with fauna in your gut? I seem to recall that some animals, like dogs, are better suited to just drink or eat what ever than other animals, because they are opportunistic predators that will also eat carcasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good part of changing your gut flora is just changing your diet. Our other primate relatives do as well as any other animal with sources of water that we wouldn't drink from. And early humans would have done so as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a hand-wavey answer. Yes, animals get sick, but by and large not from drinking from mud puddles.</p>
<p>Instead, their guts are simply better prepared to handle the microbes they are likely to pick up from those sources - both by immune system defenses aimed specifically at them, and often by having shorter digestive tracts (which gives less time for intestinal poisons to build up, when something like botulin is ingested).</p></div>		</li>
