			<div class="markdown"><p>Nailed it. To add, I’ve been told that one of, if not the hardest part to perfect is the eyes. Something about the human eye is very difficult to recreate with such accuracy that the our brain recognizes it as a real human. </p>
<p>And IIRC the “uncanny valley” refers to the gap between obviously cartoonish “humans” say in a Pixar movie, and an attempt at a real-looking human. Something like The Polar Express may fall into that Valley since the people in that movie are a bit unsettling looking. At least to me. </p>
<p>[spoiler?] I would say they’re getting close when they’ve been making older actors appear young in the Marvel movies of late. But that is done using real actors and real photo doubles that appear to be a young version of that aging actor or actress. They have tracking dots on their face that they can then “paint” onto and attach to the young face they’ve animated of the famous actor. But hey. It’s still animation and it looks probably the most legit real human so far. Animation is animation I guess. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you might not feel any affinity to a toaster, but put a smiley face on it with big eyes and it looks cute, it's more human-like. Give it some more defined eyes and you like it more. But at some point it gets just creepy. And then it gets less creepy once it looks human enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably because they are translucent.  Getting 2-d biological surfaces to look natural is hard enough, when there's a 3-d biological matrix that's reflecting and refracting light internally across hundreds of miniscule sub-surfaces it's going to be a lot harder.</p>
<p>Also eyes being both the most subtle and important parts of expression reading means we've got a ton of subconscious systems going on to process them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problems probably the viewers eyes as well. Just like our brains look for shapes and everything we see, a survival skill that in the right situation warns us of predators, there's probably something hardwired to make us feel unease whenever person doesn't act right.</p>
<p>Since we're being more critical of a robot or a simulation, it's even harder to ignore. when it's Ted Bundy, everybody tried to convince themselves he was a nice guy. Nobody gives a robot the benefit of the doubt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eyes are the most difficult part because they have thousands of tiny little movements and &quot;positions&quot; based on what the rest of our body is doing. If you're happy, you're eyes look a certain way, but it changes based on level of happiness and whatnot. That's also where the phrase &quot;smile with your eyes&quot; comes from, because the eyes tell a lot more about a persons emotions than everything else combined. The eyes really are a &quot;window to our souls&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the reason why all Asians look the same to westerners and vice-versa</p>
<p>EDIT: For those of you who can't grasp the concept: It's not about being able to tell if these two guys are the same person. It's about being able to tell which is Japanese and wich is Chinese.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note, I think the Asian thing is a bit overstated, the concept can apply to many races. While true that many Asians &quot;look the same&quot; to me, if you've ever met a bunch of dirty blonde Irish dudes, they look even more &quot;the same&quot; to me. Same goes for black fellas that have similar pigmentation to each other. When you get to countries that have more of a &quot;mutt&quot; history, you get more diversity in how their people look even though they identify with the same racial/nationality group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Well not at all actually. The only thing those phenomena have in common is that they involve facial recognition.</p>
<p>Humans achieve facial recognition by identifying deviation from a mean, in different regions there are different features which contribute more proportionally to that deviation to such an extent that humans in different regions have different &quot;algorithms&quot; for looking at faces to identify them. So if say, just as an example, everyone from region A has approximately the same size nose in proportion to their face, but in region B, there is a wide variance, in region B nose size would be in the algorithm, and everyone from region A would look the same, even if they all had widely different jaw shapes, or whatever (again, this is just an example). As you'd guess east asian algorithms are different from western ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And westerners have a very good algorithm to identify western faces but a (relatively) bad algorithm for asian faces (unless they are trained). The same way humans in general have a very good algorithm for human faces but a very bad algorithm (comparatively) for dog faces.</p>
<p>Which is exactly the point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are being a bit too aggressive against their statement.  You are technically right in that they aren't the exact same effect.  But, they are right that it is a highly related phenomenon.  The uncanny valley is about our ability notice small features of human faces that we wouldn't notice in animals.  While distinguishing  between members of different races is influenced by how much our brain focuses on minute details of people's appearance.  The are pretty similar mental processes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way I’ve had it described is that at a certain point (uncanny valley) our brains stop seeing it as animation, but as a real person, and at that level we start to interpret body language, which is off and gives us that uneasy feeling. </p></div>		</li>
