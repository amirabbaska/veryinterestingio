			<div class="markdown"><p>48 hours is a conservative estimate. The water will probably be ok even longer than that. I'm not an expert on the biology of what happens after that time, but it's probably algae that starts to form. If you drank enough contaminated algae water it might cause you some digestive issues but probably nothing tooo serious. Also, you'd probably be able to smell that the water was a little off. </p>
<p>Assuming you live in a single detached house, and you're concerned about it, when you return from vacation, go to the tap in the basement if you have one and let the water run for a few minutes. That should flush out the old water from the cold water pipes. I don't drink the hot water so I wouldn't be concerned about that. </p>
<p>All this being said, I don't do any of this and I have left my house for a week at a time in the past without any problems. I wouldn't worry too much about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends. Copper pipes kill bacteria, which is why when you take a water sample for testing you are instructed to collect it after the water has ran for a few minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My uncle is a municipal engineer in northern alberta and they have to deal with that quite a bit due to the remoteness of the town and how spread out it is. They have a crew that goes around and flushes out hydrants to make sure the water keeps moving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. We do that here too if needed. Obviously this is an extra expense though and you want to avoid it if at all possible. It's also not 100% effective unless you're flushing them constantly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a major issue for some standpipes/water towers which are designed for current and future growth. If there is significant change such as population decrease or decrease in industrial customers, the standpipe may circulate water less and it can become stagnant. CL2 decays and the curve can be affected by many variables. We've had to engineer CL2 booster systems at some standpipes or methods to increase circulation. Typically WTP high lift pumps, pump water into the distribution system in a [standpipe] level or pressure mode. Changes in seasons also greatly affect the CL2 decay curve with summer being the worst culprit. Got to keep that water flowing/circulating.  </p></div>		</li>
