			<div class="markdown"><p>In all honesty, not really haha. We were 17, we lost our virginity to each other, and he had a lot of family issues, so he came off as really clingy. It ultimately drove me away. I felt bad for him, and his grandparents' situation - they were elderly and did not have the financial means to deal with the roach issue. The structure of the trailer had shifted, leaving cracks behind, and there were various holes in the floor... which made it virtually impossible to treat unless they rectified that. They also had a lot of animals, dogs and cats, inside that they had no place to relocate in order to at least fumigate the house even if they scraped enough money together just for that. Also, piles of stuff everywhere (minor hoarding) did NOT help the problem.</p>
<p>Haven't seen nor spoken to him in ~6 years or so, so I have no clue if that situation ever improved.</p></div>		</li>
