			<div class="markdown"><p>If we are being picky: his assertion was true, you can easily make polynomials of two degrees more fitting these n points ;-) just think you add two random points, take the lagrange polynomial for these n+2 points, and here is your degree n+1 polynomial fitting your n points :-D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, forever. You can't disprove that there may be a pattern because patterns can exist over extremely long intervals. </p>
<p>Side note: you have to define &quot;random&quot;. You used the phrase &quot;truly random&quot;. Random, in itself, denotes no outside influence. Outside of mathematics, there are no instances that I can think of that do not result from some outside influence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, also, human brains are notoriously bad at generating random patterns. We think in patterns. We lapse into them very quickly. Even if I know nothing about you, and have you generate 100 random numbers back to back (say, between 1 and 20), I may notice enough of a pattern to predict the next number you'll spout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are not very good at this. Let's say you're told to pick two numbers at random, between 1 and 10. If the choosing of the two numbers were truly random, then the second number picked should not be influenced by the first choice at all. But a human tends to think &quot;I've already picked 3, so I shouldn't pick 3 again,&quot; I guess because we tend to think random means &quot;all different&quot; as opposed to &quot;equal likelihood&quot;. So this means that the choice of the second number is being influenced by what was chosen for the first number, which is not random, because a random choice would basically be blind to whatever the first choice was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it's &quot;random enough&quot; if its statistics from a large number of samples is not significantly different from some desired reference distribution.  There are plenty of statistical tests that could be useful for this task, like a 2-sample KS test.</p></div>		</li>
