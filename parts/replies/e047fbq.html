<p>Anything more than a dog owner having a up to a few breeding pairs that they happen to sell I'd think, if they're specifically using the dogs as a source of income and breeding them as much as they can to maximize profit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How prevalent bad breeders are in the Amish community (e.g. a percentage vs the percentage of breeders as a whole) is unclear, but the Amish definitely play a big role in the dog breeding industry.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can’t they simply say people who intentionally (or neglectfully) breed, without registration are illegal. They should also enforce breeders to provide a “standard care package” to puppies (shots, genetic lineage papers — such as akc papers — modification — spay/neuter or registration that your dog is breedable — latent genetic illness reports, and a — care guide — on how to take care of a dog and train them properly). </p>
<p>If you make it a pain in the ass, that it’s not worth it selling them / giving them away, people will stop. </p>
<p>People do things like this because it’s worth their time. Then only good breeders who care about the breeds and puppies will be around and flourish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got to license and regulate every person breeding dogs. You've got to define intentional breeding/neglectful breeding. Are these criminal or civil charges? If criminal, realize that every rando person caught up in the process is going to have a criminal record trashing their career prospects meaning they're gonna be a drain on the social safety net, when maybe before they wouldn't be.</p>
<p>You're talking a massive regulatory scheme, with enforcement people. Where's the money going to come from? You've got current animal welfare enforcement people, but they're probably already at their limit, so going to have to hire more.</p>
<p>Even if you think it's worth the cost and should be paid for out of general taxes or licensing fees, you've got to consider this: Is local/state government going to do this in a remotely effective way? Or are we just creating another bureaucracy, with pensions and substantial costs, that's going to haphazardly enforce poorly defined, ambiguous rules/legislation and not lead to substantially improved animal welfare?</p>
<p>Even if you answer yes to the above allow me to gently concern troll you with this: Could we not take that money and spend it improving actual human lives?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if a dog breaks into my backyard and impregnated my dog I'd be charged under your system? </p>
<p>So what do I do if I can't sell them?</p>
<p>Give them away for free to unchecked people?</p>
<p>Put them into the already overcrowded animal welfare system?</p>
<p>The old fashioned brick and pond? (because that would be lesser crimes according to your system)</p>
<p>You'd be better off instituting the same system as Australia. All pets sold from stores or animal welfare (pound, RSPCA) are desexed. No exceptions.</p>
<p>Breeders or &quot;free to loving home&quot; pups and kittens are the only place breedable animals are available and vets can do the surgery for a few $100.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sweet summer child. Generally when you take an already limited, high demand &quot;product&quot;  like certain breeds are and you force them even more into the shadows by over regulating and making it unprofitable then the industry usually doesn't get &quot;better&quot; it becomes even more shady, and if eager the dogs will suffer even more. We just need to stop the abusive ones, not shit them ALL down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's horseshit, compared to having no oversight and saying &quot;well I guess this is a problem that just exists nothing we can do&quot; having some oversight would always be better. You don't have to go hardcore into the issues just makes the penalties higher to outweigh the benefits if you get caught being an asshole. </p>
<p>Without any regulation at all as it is now you simply make every breeder have the capability of being a shady one rather than have them few and far between. </p></div>		</li>

<p>the problem here is you'll have more breeding in pure-bred lines that will eventually result in genetic degradation (Made up term because I don't know the actual term) down the line causing problems for the dogs of that breed as a whole, like what happened to english bulldogs and the like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure how that follows? Why would breed distribution be affected? AFAIK, puppy mills typically go for purebreds anyway, or &quot;designer&quot; mixes which I doubt would go away, as they certainly have highly devoted breeders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A breed is simply a group of characteristics. Humans defined them. Breeding two dogs that have similar characteristics wouldn't necessarily mean there would be genetic degradation. Among an entire world of people breeding dogs, the &quot;top&quot; examples of a breed are genetically diverse. There's a TON of dogs and examples of a dogs who fit a breed standard very well. </p>
<p>Breeds are carefully monitored for &quot;gene conflicts&quot; where too similar of dogs have terrible genes throughout their lifetime, and they introduce slight diversity to counteract this. </p></div>		</li>
