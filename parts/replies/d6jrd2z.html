			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried explaining this when eating at pizza hut with friends in high school. No one else seemed to care and ate their own stupidly inefficient single pizzas</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Typically restaurants will scale their prices linearly, but the area scales exponentially (A=PI*R2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Presumably this is because the main cost to the restaurant is actually the labor in cooking and serving the pizza? The marginal cost of an additional pizza must be pretty tiny. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason restaurants scale their prices linearly is because customers wouldn't tolerate it otherwise. The average consumer does not at a 10-inch vs 14-inch pizza and go &quot;oh, the 14 is twice as large&quot;â€”they'd likely estimate it to be 40% larger.</p>
<p>If you charged double, they'd feel they were being cheated. Could you educate them? Maybe, but the more you have to explain your product (or your prices), the less you're going to sell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder why they don't label their pizza by area, as in 100 in^2 pizza and 196 in^2 pizza. The uneducated customers will think 100 in^2 &gt; 14 in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not necessarily main cost, but essentially a fixed cost independent of size, I.e making and serving a 10&quot; pizza takes essentially the same time as making a 14&quot; pizza.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I would think the cost is mostly in the labor/overhead vs the added ingredients. Glad to hear I'm not the only one out there who has trouble explaining this to friends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The area scales quadratically (or polynomially, if you want to be more general). If it scaled exponentially it would be a function like 2^n , which would make it even more cost effective to bump up your size with a linear price increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cost-effectiveness depends on coefficients and the base of the exponent. This is a bit nonsensical because we know how pizza value scales with radius, but exponentials always grow faster than polynomials <strong>as n-&gt;inf</strong>. Since in this scenario there is an upper limit to n (the size of the restaurant), the rule may not hold true.</p></div>		</li>
