			<div class="markdown"><p>Comcast isn't paying this straight out of their accounts - they have only <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CMCSA/balance-sheet?p=CMCSA" target="_blank">3 billion</a> in cash and only 16 billion in total current assets. This would be a financed deal - they'd take out a 60 billion dollar loan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And just to be clear, everyone: Comcast wouldn't go to your neighborhood bank for a 60 billion dollar loan. this would most likely be financed through a bond offering, which 'splits up' the debt into 'manageable' $1,000 increments and then investors can purchase up to the shares they wish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Valuable - thank you. My next question was just that. Does your local bank just offer up a nice rate on $60B? Obviously not.  That makes a lot of sense as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually might be financed at least in part with bank loans or senior securitized loans. It would smell like that kind of deal and I believe Comcast has done it before. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got it - thank you. Still, $60B sitting around in easily liquidated assets seems incredible to me. Even a company as large as Comcast, cash in that volume seems absurd.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Total value of all stocks on just the NYSE: over $25 trillion.  Total value of all US real estate: $30 trillion.  Total value of US Treasury bonds outstanding: over $20 trillion.</p>
<p>And that's just a few things in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where did you get the real estate number? I remember researching a project a couple years ago and discovering the value of all public infrastructure in the US was $37 trillion. It's hard to imagine all real estate would be less than that.</p>
<p>Edit: the post has been locked, so I won't be able to respond to u/PacoFuentes with a reply, so I'll do it like this. I think I see where we went wrong. When you say real estate, you are only including residential homes. But that leaves out commercial property, agricultural property, industrial property, not to mention unimproved properties. If we did include all those, I'm sure the number would be way higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it more like offering to pay $70k cash for a car instead of financing it through the dealership. You don't necessarily need to have $70k in easily liquidible assets, you just need to have outside financing that can provide you with the cash if the deal goes through.</p>
<p>Comcast likely has arranged a line of credit for this deal that will cover the majority of the cost, which they will service at their leisure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you - that makes more sense. I am a financial dolt so I really assumed that a company as big as Comcast has that kind of change rattling around in drawers in offices (kidding, somewhat).</p>
<p>Given that Apple seems to have over $200B in cash, though, it is not out of the realm of possibilities. </p>
<p>I always thought the language was strange, though. Saying you are a 'cash' buyer suggests cash and not really financing - but I get the language is nuanced when it comes to all things financial.</p></div>		</li>
