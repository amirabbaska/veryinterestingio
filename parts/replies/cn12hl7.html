			<p>Overpopulation? You do know that the majority of the land in the U.S. is rural, right? 94.6 percent of U.S. land is rural. However, most of the population lives in the remaining 5.4% of space available urban land. <a href="http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2003/07/01/census-bureau-946-percent-us-rural-open-space" target="_blank">http://news.heartland.org/newspaper-article/2003/07/01/census-bureau-946-percent-us-rural-open-space</a></p>		</li>

			<p>If you think the systems are so closed that overpopulation in one area doesn't affect housing prices all over, you're deluding yourself and trying to justify conclusions you've already reached.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think you're deluding yourself by thinking that overpopulation is occurring when the birthrate is declining.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think that's more of an economic problem than a population problem.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah you go right along thinking that. We're overpopulated. This area is being forced to 'support' so many more people than it ever has in history, and has to import retarded amounts of materials to do it. And we don't have the water to keep farming the way we do.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think we have the technology to fully support our population. It's just a matter of investing in it. I do agree with you that water is a problem, especially in California. That has a lot more to do with policy decisions than ability. Food is problem, but it's being overproduced and wasted. 30% of what is produced is never eaten: <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141013-food-waste-national-security-environment-science-ngfood/" target="_blank">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2014/10/141013-food-waste-national-security-environment-science-ngfood/</a></p>		</li>
