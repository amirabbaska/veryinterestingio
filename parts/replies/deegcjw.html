			<div class="markdown"><p>Very high energy particle collisions. So in a very powerful collider, for example. Given the way that a magnetic monopole would interact with regular matter, you'd expect charged particles to strongly scatter off of a magnetic monopole. And since there are highly energetic collisions already happening with cosmic rays in the atmosphere, it would be possible to detect the remnants of some event where a monopole is created by some collision, and then scatters off a bunch of charged particles, creating a lot of ionization in the surrounding matter.</p>
<p>That is, if monopoles exist and can be created in these collisions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One method is with a superconducting ring of current.  If a monopole goes through the center, the current in the ring will step up or down by a discrete amount; if a dipole goes through, the current will change temporarily and then revert to its original configuration.</p>
<p>There is also the <a href="http://moedal.web.cern.ch/content/magnetic-monopole-trapper-%E2%80%93-capturing-new-particles" target="_blank">MoEDAL detector</a> that can potentially trap monopoles.</p>
<p>The likeliest scenario for monopoles -- monopoles arising due to grand unification of forces -- implies such a large monopole mass that you wouldn't produce monopoles in any collider.  However, monopoles just flying through the universe would be detectable by these methods, if present.  One nice feature of the superconducting ring method is that the mass of the monopole is irrelevant to the detection mechanism; the monopole just has to pass through the ring.  (The extraordinarily high masses of grand unified monopoles means it is very hard to direct them to one place or another.)</p>
