<blockquote>
<p>[...] Two white papers Working for Patients and Caring for People were produced. These outlined the introduction of what was termed the &quot;internal market&quot;, which was to shape the structure and organisation of health services for most of the next decade. In spite of intensive opposition from the BMA, who wanted a pilot study or the reforms in one region, the internal market was introduced.</p>
<p>In 1990, the National Health Service &amp; Community Care Act (in England) defined this &quot;internal market&quot;, whereby Health Authorities ceased to run hospitals but &quot;purchased&quot; care from their own or other authorities' hospitals.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>
<p>The NHS began its steady drip of privatisation during Blair's tenure. It was New Labour who introduced the impossible to meet targets, the crippling debt, foundation status and then all the companies who were suddenly invited in to examine and fix what had gone wrong.
Certainly the 2010 conservative government took the ball and has run with it, but let's not place the blame on a bogeyman when the real authors are still in parliament.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Government controls residency training and funds it through taxes. Hospitals cannot hire more residents - Congress literally must change the law for more residents to be hired. We work long hours because there isn't money to hire more residents, and because shorter hours cause more harm to patients because most medical errors happen during handoffs. It's cheaper and better for patients if we work longer hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only a small piece of the picture. The real reason is what /u/WithoutFurtherApu said: patient transfers are dangerous. Study after study has shown that a tired doctor with the same patient (say a mother in labor) for 24 hours is safer for the patient than three different, fresh doctors each for 8 hours. Minimizing patient transfer prevents mistakes. </p>
<p>Patient transfers just create too many risk factors. Did someone forget to write down an allergy? Does the new doctor have a full list of all the drugs that have been administered, and their dosage? Was the room number written legibly so the doctor knows how to find his patient? There's too many opportunities for mistakes with handoffs, so its in the patient's best interest to limit them. </p>
<p>Part of the reason that it's safer is that doctors, while residents (aka trainees), are specifically conditioned to handle this. They will be put on 36 hour shifts even when they don't have any patients for that long to teach them to function well while sleep deprived. This is done while they still have an attending looking over their shoulder to correct mistakes. That way, once they're on their own, they are used to operating while exhausted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait what?  I need a source on that because any EMR that's MU compliant should manage every scenario you listed. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did someone forget to write down an allergy? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a non-issue in every EMR I've worked with.  Allergies are clearly displayed in the patient chart and most have pretty extensive interaction checking.  Doctors overriding that because they know better than the machine is on them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the new doctor have a full list of all the drugs that have been administered, and their dosage? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, not an issue with an EMR.  Very easy to find and again, most offer med to med interaction checking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was the room number written legibly so the doctor knows how to find his patient?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you serious?  Where are you living where so much paper is being used This is all face up in every EMR.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Handoffs should not be a problem if a good EMR is being used.  Maybe you're in a part of the world where electronic records aren't the norm, fine, but in the US, Canada, most of Europe, and plenty of other places, EMRs should eliminate every issue you brought up as long as the person is awake and reading information on the screen.</p>

<p>Yeah, I need a source on this too.  That doesn't sound very effective in the long term.  Sure, one can get used to the feeling, but preventing fatigue isn't something you can really train to fight. </p>
<p>EDIT:<br />
From reading the thread, it looks like the handoff process is more of the issue than the handoffs themselves.  In my experience working with physicians, they hate to read over charts and look too deeply beyond the first screen.  A couple EMRs I know of are working to fit as much as they can on the handoff screen, but it's still seems like a process issue more than anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's human error/negligence more than anything. Yeah, EMRs in theory should negate all of these issues, IF they are used properly. I've seen techs not do follow up EKGs when asked, nurses forget to administer medication because they're busy in 3-4 other rooms or physicians who forget to call for consults in a timely fashion. The EMR only works as much as all parties involved use it properly. There are a lot of cases where physicians don't write their notes as they go which is a whole other issue, especially if they leave out small but still important details. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good handoff is amazing. It's brings in a new set of fresh eyes from someone who is not mentally and physically fatigued. It can often add to patient care. If it's a shit handoff it's dangerous as hell. I've seen both as an emergency doc. I can tell you that you don't want me to be your doctor at the end of a long busy shift (in the ER I work 8-12 HR shifts and I'm drained by the end). I wouldn't want my family to be taken care of by a tired doc. Why would I want the same for my patients? I'm currently in residency and working 24-30 hrs every 4th day (on top of normal daylight hours all the other days) in the pediatric intensive care unit. Luckily this is only my schedule a few months a year. I would not want my kid's doc to be as tired as I am in the second half of my shift.  Until then I'll try to provide the best care I possibly can to my patients and their families. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll stop you right there. There are absolutely some small-medium sized hospitals not running a proper EMR in the US. We just brought one live a year back to our EMR. Until very recently at least one was still using a primarily paper-based system. (It was some kluge of mainly paper with some radiology and other systems they ran. Definitely not even close to having proper integration and checks a full EMR would have.)</p>
<p>As the saying goes, where there is smoke, there is fire. There is guaranteed to be at least a few other hospitals in the US running primarily paper-based systems. Unless they very recently changed. As for exact employee size of that hospital we manage, I'd say at least 1000 emps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a nurse it blows my mind that so many things are still hand written, and so many doctors refuse to make even a modicum of effort to write legibly, especially when lives are on the line.</p>
<p>When I worked night shift one of my favorite things was to wait until 3 AM to call a doctor to clarify an order. You do it enough and eventually they learn to write so that other people can read it.</p>
<p>EDIT: For all you folks saying this is petty and counterproductive, if you have a better way of getting the situation to change, I'm all for it. We nurses have our hands tied behind our backs in these situations. Administration will not listen to us. If we fuck up a treatment because we couldn't read the order, it's our fault. If we call the doctor to clarify the order, we get bitched at. Fuck it, you doctors with shitty handwriting can get woken up until you decide to take the extra three seconds to write clearly so your patients get proper care.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tell me docs that criticize this nurses atitude what is the difficulty in writing in all caps ?  Why do you think I should have to chase you because of your handwriting when you can just save my time and your sleep and just write it in a way that OTHER people can read ?
Prescriptions and ops notes are not a doctors journal they are to be read by other professionals. </p>
<p>You think its petty to call a doctor at 3am? I think its unprofessional to write in a shitty handwriting that no one can read and using abreviations that only you can understand... </p>
<p>Plus sorry to disturb your sleep at 3am you see nurses hardly sleep during the night so 3am for us is working time and probably medication time. </p>
<p>A hospital works as multidisciplinary team . I lost count the times I told surgeons I couldn't read their handwriting and sometimes they couldn't either... They just keep doing the same. I long for the day everything will be on the computer... </p></div>		</li>
