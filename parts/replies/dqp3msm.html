			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. To be honest though, if the world was completely absent of any radiation, you'd still get cancer. Whenever a cell every divides into two, DNA replication happens. Our body makes mistakes - like a <em>lot</em> of mistakes because replication happens so fast. We have mechanisms that fix this, but sometimes those fail and we're left with a cell that slightly dysfunctional but not enough to be picked up by white blood cells to be killed off, or the cell doesn't recognise its own dysfunction and won't undergo apoptosis. It's a fine balance between repair and mistakes. That slightly dysfunctional cell might not be cancerous, but a few more of these mistakes, then bam - cancer. </p>
<p>Background radiation just accelerates this process by tipping the scale in the direction of mistakes - meaning more errors. Being alive predisposes cancer, and being older, where you have cells that don't function <em>as well</em> as they used to because of senescence, that predisposes cancer too.</p>
<p>Cancer is inevitable. There's no vaccine for it because they're our own cells. The best we can do is recognise when these faults come up and try to kill off the mass before it goes neoplastic/cancerous and malignant. </p>
<p>With that said, most gene mutations are <em>okay</em>. A good number of them will just outright cause the cell to die. Others might cause a change in a gene that makes it less effective at its role, or even give it a new role by letting the protein it encodes do new things because its no longer as specific (proteins are usually very specific). It's just these very special set of genes that regulate growth, death, signalling, replication, DNA repair, and other similar functions that are key to cell life that cause cancer. Mutation to something that makes you less able to absorb energy? Meh whatever. Mutation to something that stops DNA repair? That's no good. </p>
<p>Man-made mutation to your body is no different to &quot;natural&quot; mutation. High energy photons, alpha particles (He nuclei) and beta particles (electrons) smashing into your molecules = bad. And both natural and man-made produce those 3. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whats the mechanism they found in elephants that regulates their rate of natural cancer appearances? I remember its only roughly equal to humans, but since they have vastly more cells than we do, it was still considerable.</p>
<p>Could this be replicated somehow in human cells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about radiation is that it damages the DNA randomly at every place in the body where you are affected, so it's impossible to copy and paste back the right DNA after somebody is exposed. The only thing you can do is prevent exposure.</p></div>		</li>
