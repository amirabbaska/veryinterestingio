			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect OP meant semiconductor devices like diodes, transistors and ICs. I think all modern devices are doped, but early diodes and transistors were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-contact_transistor" target="_blank">point contact</a> devices. </p>
<p>That's not saying that &quot;doping is the process in which semiconductors are produced&quot;. Many processes are used in conjunction with doping. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doping in and of itself is a process whereby a material other than the parent material is introduced to add charge carriers to the material system. N-type doping refers to the addition of materials which add electrons as charge carriers, and P-type is the addition of electron hole carriers.</p>
<p>Both intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors can be doped in order to increase the conductivity and lower the band gap (the minimum amount of energy necessary to cause the flow of charge carriers) of the material. However the difference lies in that extrinsic semiconductors require doping to exhibit semiconductive properties, intrinsic semiconductors do not. </p></div>		</li>
