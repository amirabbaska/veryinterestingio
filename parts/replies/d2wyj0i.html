			<div class="markdown"><p>This is important to remember. Most major ISPs tend to frown on users that 'run servers' - mainly for bandwidth usage reasons, but every node can be a full participant by design.</p>
<p>My ELI5 analogy is to look at bandwidth like a water pipe. When you flush the toilet, the person in the shower screams because the cold water flow just got cut in half.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what point you are trying to make. The internet is by and large a download heavy format. The vast majority of everything you do online will be in the form of downloading content, with very little uploading. This is why you dont get/need much upstream bandwidth, because for the most part uploading is really just used to confirm what you downloaded from whatever server you are being fed from. If ISP's were you offer symmetrical download/upload rates by default for every single user then they'd have to further improve upon their infrastructure to support it, something they dont care to do since running servers is not something commonplace for their users. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is what the Internet has been turned into. It didn't start that way, and for a long time that's not what it was. In the last 20 years it has been turned from a peer collaboration tool into TV - an advertising/marketing platform. That's exactly my point, people who have been online for less than 15 years or so think of the Internet exactly the way you describe. My point is that the underlying technology was not meant for that, and this split in concepts is what causes questions like the one OP poses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean &quot;it wasnt meant for that&quot;? It was meant for whatever it is people decided to use it for. It turns out entertainment was a hugely popular thing so that is how it evolved, there is nothing wrong with that. You might as well say cars were never designed to transport people, their original intention was to transport products, but as people began to use them more regularly eventually they decided to transport themselves instead. It makes no difference what the original idea of the internet was. In fact, nothing about it has changed. Every time someone watches a youtube video there is still a peer to peer series of connections established between your computer, the ISP, and the source network to exchange data. The fact that it is a funny cat video instead of some lengthy dialogue on science or whatever &quot;pure&quot; thing you are talking about is irrelevant. It still works the same way today as it did back then.</p></div>		</li>
