			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely... without the Pacific Hawaii would look like a <strong>chain</strong> of mountains... the string of mountains / islands / seamounts which make up Hawaii all sat right above the spot which Big Island currently sits... as the Pacific plate moved NW it carried along with it a string of islands to the NW which eventually collapsed into seamounts... </p>
<p>Think of it as a sewing machine, just upside down... the Pacific plate is the cloth and the volcano / hot spot is the needle... as the cloth moves the needle stays in the same place punching through the cloth multiple times in a straight line.....</p>
<p>An interesting thing about the Hawaiian chain is that it shows a discrete change in direction of motion of the Pacific plate... If you follow the chain NW from Hawaii you'll reach a sudden 120 degree shift in the line of sea mounts... this implies that the plate was moving in one direction then suddenly (in geologic time scale) shifted 60 degrees and continued moving in the new (current) direction..</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall years ago hearing a lecture by someone who theorized the types of plate movements that were possible.</p>
<p>The Earth has MULTIPLE cells that create spots for each of the large plates.</p>
<p>He and other thought the Moon at one time had Only a single cell of tectonics before the heat of formation and radioactives grew so weak it froze up, and the late heavy bombardment erased most of the evidence.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However that's kind of arbitrary, since if there were no ocean, you'd probably measure Everest from the same starting point as Mauna Kea.</p>
<p>But to answer your question, yes, Hawaii would look like a huge mountain if there were no ocean.  All islands would be mountains or other prominences of some sort without an ocean.  Without an ocean the word &quot;island&quot; would be kind of irrelevant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't measure Everest from the bottom of the ocean floor, that would make no sense at all... you would measure it from the mean elevation of the plate (or in this case, the colliding plates) at it's base.. </p>
<p>Essentially all plates are floating and they are trying to maintain an equilibrium with the buoyant forces... continental rocks (and therefore plates) are much less dense than oceanic rocks/plates so they float much higher in the mantle... the reason why the ocean is so deep around the base of the Hawaiian mountains/seamounts is due to the density of the oceanic plate.... </p>
<p>It's like floating two cubes in a pool of water.. one ice and the other wood.. even if they are the exact same size you don' expect for them to be floating at the same height in the water... </p>
<p>So Mauna Kea would be measured from the ocean floor, it's equilibrium point, whereas Everest should be measured from somewhere near or a bit below sea level (not exactly sure where the continental equilibrium point lies.. most likely under water though since shallow oceans are over continental shelves which are continental rock not oceanic)... </p>
<p>EDIT: reasons for the density differences are chemical / compositional... continental rock is dominantly granitic and metamorphic with bulk densities around 2.7 g/cm^3 whereas oceanic plates are dominantly balsaltic to gabbroic with bulk densities around 3.0 g/cm^3 ... doesn't seem like much of a difference but with continents being 90% the density of oceanic plates you get the vast elevation difference.... and yes, this is oversimplified there is more to it than just this... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there were no oceans, we would likely measure from the lowest nearby location to the highest. As that would give the most accurate depiction of the size of the mountain. I feel like just because Mauna Kea is effectively inside a huge canyon doesn't make it smaller, just not as high.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how the height of Olympus Mons is measured (base to top or lowest point to highest point)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably what you were getting at, but for clarification: high gravity means rates of erosion will also be high. Erosion is much slower on Mars due to it's lower gravity.</p>
<p>Probably the other factor is that heavy mountains will subside into the planet to a smaller degree under low gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.</p>
<p>Non-moving hotspots underlying shield volcanoes + quasi-dead hydrosphere restricting erosion.</p>
<p>You just keep piling on pancake-like layers of volcanic rocks in the exact same spot for half a billion years or more while restricting erosion to the max and you <strong>will</strong> get a huge mountain like none ever was on Earth. Some claim the last eruption on Olympus mons was a mere 25 Ma ago but I don't know when the bulk of that volcanic edifice was put in place. That is a <em>looooooong</em> stratigraphic record of volcanic activity in one given spot...</p>
<p>For comparison sake, the oldest (paleo-) shield volcanoes of the Hawaiian complex, now seamounts, are about 65 Ma (<a href="https://www.soest.hawaii.edu/GG/HCV/haw_formation.html" target="_blank">source</a>) old, as the seafloor keeps moving the islands away from the hotspot, conveyor-belt style... Each island stays actively fed by the hotspot a few million years, say about 5 tops....</p>
<p>Variations in gravity have very little to do with the altitude of Olympus mons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mars appears to have plates, but since Mars's dynamo has stopped (it is comparably less massive than Earth + did not have an iron injection from a moon/protoplanet crashing into it), the plates no longer move.  Also, the Mars plates are much larger than ours (with respect to the surface area of the planet).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Because it is relatively small.</p>
<p>Longer answer: Smaller things cool down faster than bigger things. Think of taking a cupcake and a cake out of the oven at the same time. Which will be cool enough to eat first?</p>
<p>The phenomenon of plate tectonics is caused by convection in the mantle. Convection requires 2 things: (1) something that can flow, (2) a temperature difference. When the planet cools down (1) the mantle doesn't flow as well or at all and (2) the temperature difference between the interior and the surface of the planet diminishes. Both of these things diminish convection, and therefore plate tectonics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of reasons: the lack of water in the mantle and the much thicker lithosphere. On one hand, this inhibits partial melting and crustal recycling; on the other it makes very difficult for plate spreading to start in the first place. That whole Valles Marineris - Olympus mons system was Mars trying its best, but ultimately failing to initiate plate tectonics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely correct. The above posters are correct that the non-mobile lithosphere means that the material to build the volcano is around long enough to do so. The absolute height a volcano (or any construct) can achieve is ultimately governed by gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that the tharsis bulge is just about as massive as it could be without collapsing under its own weight, so that definitely has something to do with it, but the maximum height the crust can hold isn't usually the determining factor, its rare for mountains to get up to that limit.</p></div>		</li>
