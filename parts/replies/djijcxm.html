			<div class="markdown"><p>The rotation of the earth doesn't change the gravitational acceleration itself, but rather introduces a second force that counteracts part of it. It results in an apparent outward force that varies from 0 at the poles to a maximum at the equator. This force reduces the apparent gravity at the equator by <a href="https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Srotfram1.htm" target="_blank">~0.034 m/s^2</a>. That's about 0.35%. </p></div>		</li>
