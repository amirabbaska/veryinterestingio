			<div class="markdown"><p>Just think of the things we could accomplish if the entire population was as dedicated to learning and advancement as the people that contributed to that. Imagine if equal and good education was treated as a public good, and soul crushing student loans weren't a thing.  Or if people stoppped fixating on checking off some &quot;to do&quot; list in life and set their goals higher instead of settling. Or if everyone would stop letting themselves be divided and turned against one another. </p>
<p>I wonder where the world could have been by now without all the impediments we create for ourselves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's relatively new, I think they started doing it in the early 2000s in sweden. I live in germany. It wasn't really gradual wear and tear it was a blunt force injury, I slipped while lifting something heavy and after a few days my knee got grotesquely large from the swelling. I think the defect was almost an inch in diameter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can give some details.</p>
<p>You have two options depending on size, type and affection of bone structure . OATS (bonegraft with cartilage attached) and MACT (just the cartilage, embedded in a matrix-gel). Both have shown success in patients depending on age, the size of the lesion, additional structure defects (menisci, collateral ligaments, cruciate ligaments, patella fractures).</p>
<p>Not going into details. The sooner a small cartilage lesion, without affection of the bone structure (bone effusion is a no go) and coexisting malacies within the knee, is treated the better the outcome will be. Here lies the problem. Most patients do not suffer from isolated cartilage lesions. Trauma most likely results in tears within the menisci and damage to the cruciate ligaments, causing instability within the knee, increased stress on the damaged cartilage and hence the transplant. This leads to destruction of the graft over time. So it is not a viable treatment for all patients.</p>
<p>There is no long term knowledge available regarding these options. We have been doing post op mri scans for 17 yrs now with varying results. Some do fine, others completely lose the graft. Consult an expert for treatment options. </p>
<p>Knees do suck. Few realize that joints cannot be repaired, only given more time until arthrosis makes prosthesis surgery unavoidable. I highly recommend any athlete practicing sports with high speed rotation impact on the knees (basketball, soccer, handball, tennis to name a few) to treat carefully, </p>

<p>There are other new options coming down the pipe as well. This one is using a current waste product to eliminate painful burn bandages. I don’t know enough about the science to say that it will replace skin grafts but it certainly can change the long and painful process. </p></div>		</li>
