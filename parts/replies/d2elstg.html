			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh heh. We have Scandanavian and Dutch stores that carry it here, but it's still better from online sources because of spoilage due to little customer interest. Not sure how Portland hipsters haven't caught onto this stuff yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I actually enjoy the blood/iron-like taste in my mouth and sort of bloodrush I get from consuming extremely strong liquorice. Personally, I've experienced this the most with the djungelvrål lollipops.</p></div>		</li>
