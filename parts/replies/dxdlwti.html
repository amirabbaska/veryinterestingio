			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also mentally and physically tiring being so close to people. You're on alert a little bit, you're trying to stay out of each other's personal space, etc. Flying business/first class, where the seat folds down horizontal and you can splay out with no one within a few feet of you, makes a huge difference. This is actually the point of biz class, so you can land and feel refreshed and ready to work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you were a balloon, takeoff is where you get twisted into a balloon animal. When you land, someone sticks a pin in you and all that pressure deflates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this metaphor reminds me that many people get super bloated on planes because of changes in pressure, to the point of being miserable and in actual pain. those seats have absorbed so many farts it's not even funny anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the flatulence issue: if you get gassy on flights and are worried about the smell, stick a dryer sheet in the back of your trousers between your pants and underpants. It may not rid the smell entirely but it will cut down on how pungent it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure its better to use activated charcoal underwear inserts like Flat-D or Under-Tec.  Activated charcoal will absorb and neutralize all kinds of odors.    </p>
<p>I have my doubts about dryer sheets, because they don't actually trap and absorb anything.  If you poop in a bouquet of flowers, it's still going to smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually use special fabric on plane seats so that the bacteria left from passenger farts doesn’t wear as easily as normal fabric. Normal fabric would wear and tear much more due to fecal bacteria. Just like why underwear blow out if you don’t wash them enough. </p></div>		</li>
