Some brains get mixed message could be to deep sleep, alcohol or other issues.  One that I experience is the elusive  toilet open to air where everyone can see a toilet turning into a chair. Even have gone far enough as to urinating in my dream. No urination in RL but then the subconscious  keeps sending me even more bizarre dreams.  Also women who have given natural birth may have more issues with sphincter  control, ie I pee when I sneeze so when the bladder is full it's like an emergency.  You can also learn to ignore the impulse.  I was a nurse for a long time and you can't just go sorry I have to pee I  the middle of a procedure. So ignore it. Then by the time you get to pee the bladder is so stretched  can't pee you have to relax so muscle and sphincter  do too may take a bit. I no longer nurse due to severe back injury and spinal nerve damage. Again the spinal cord may not transmit the order from  the brain. In my case. I actually had to see a gyno urology specialist. Because I wasn't urinating.  Usually 12 up to 24 hours no pee or sensation of needing to go. But if I stood up run baby run.  Not all the time.but then again if I just peed small amount I would have bladder spasms sit on the toilet for a long time or have to visit it all the time, no urine or forced urination of a few drops that at least helped with the spasms sometimes press down on my abdomen to help reduce them. Well they at first thought sphincter issue. I knew it wasn't since I had repair done when I had surgery for other issues. They filled me up, no leaking nothing even stretched my bladder. The problem I was having the further  I had to walk to bathroom more pressure I guess and my sphincter  just finally gave way especially  when walking you can't cross you legs  The way I resolved this was to go at least a few times a day on set timing with my pain meds mostly my anti-inflammatory  since I take them every 6 hrs. I also have decreased sensation legs and feet.
Also I have noticed that constipation  can have influence. Full bowel especially  chronic can leave less room for urine. As per the study I wouldn't recommend  enemas laxatives the body becomes used to. Saw this in my practice even a term for this. Fiber supplements or  food high in fiber also adequate intake of fluids is also important  helps movement. Plus natural products can help. Some people's bladders just remain smaller. Again medical help and please positive reinforcement. No negative or shaming. Sometimes drinking less liquids especially caffine type ones after a certain time would help. Also drink less water as bedtime comes closer. I don't mean to imply leave a child thirsty offer ice. Try it at home melt a cup of ice and you will see less amount than water.  That unfortunately  is not an option for me I actually  have to drink water all the time have some near me I suffer from severe dry mouth,eyes you name it could be an issue with others too.
Well I know I have bounced all over the place. But there can be many reasons for bed wetting.
Maybe time as in age may help, medication.  But it can also be tied to trauma physical  or emotional. I am talking about abuse even if some may think we'll it wasn't much. But the psyche the subconscious  mind  may differ. But there are steps that can help. Medication therapy, pelvic and sphincter  exercises also just setting up a routine of urinating being the last thing you do and the first, even getting at least once in the night. Some might say we'll that will run  sleep but it can also keep a bed dry and a very young or older ego from feeling shame or fault as many times we can tell ourselves or another person it's not your fault. The inner child or voice I  us blames ourselves especially  children. How many times have we inter ally blamed ourselves for something out of our control even though we know it's not. The psyche is fragile  especially  in children.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about the &quot;ability to wake up&quot; part, only because.. OK, I gotta get a little personal.. On an average night I'll wake up 2-3 times to pee, but when I go it's a lot.. I don't even think I pee that much or that often during the day.. But anyway</p>
<p>If I drink enough alcohol to hit that &quot;pass out drunk&quot; point, I'll either
1: not get up at all to pee and sleep straight through the night  (maybe because I'm dehydrated) or
2: I'll sleep walk and end up  peeing in a cup, a shoe once, the ashtray, etc
And I am completely oblivious to this until I wake up.. </p>
<p>You would think I'd just wet the bed, but something gets me up </p></div>		</li>
