			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's very true that space is very empty, it's also often overstated. Satellites and spacecraft are hit fairly routinely. Here's the radiator section of a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope after 15 years of use:</p>

<p>Whipple shields are used for protection. It's a neat concept. A thin outer shell uses the debris' kinetic energy against it, causing it to vaporize or shatter when it hits the outer shell, so that by the time it hits the next shell, its energy is spread over a wider area and doesn't penetrate it.</p>
<p>The ISS Whipple shields are capable of preventing penetration by a 1 cm projectile travelling at 15 km/s. Low Earth orbit velocity is about 8 km/s. Weirdly, Whipple shields actually have a local minimum protection at about 3 km/s, where they can only protect against a .7 cm projectile, since at those speeds the projectile is less likely to shatter and behaves more like a bullet.</p>
<p>In the case of Cassini, based on probabilities of impact, they determined that the thermal shielding was adequate to serve dual purpose as a Whipple shield against dust.</p></div>		</li>
