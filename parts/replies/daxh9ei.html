			<div class="markdown"><p>That would govern the volume of the column of air driven by the vocal cords, right?  Which would change the &quot;loading&quot; on the vocal cords and affect the range of frequencies they can produce sound at.  So would I be far off the mark describing it in synthesis terms that the vocal cords and SVT form the oscillator with the mouth forming the filter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but studying to be a speech-language pathologist (SLP). Yes, you basically just described what vocal physiologists call the &quot;source-filter theory&quot; and it is the reason why acoustical physics is an important part of my field. However, it's more that the vocal folds form the oscillator as they vibrate against one another, and the entire SVT/mouth is the filter. (SVT = supralaryngeal vocal tract, i.e. the area above the vocal cords/folds.) The filter's characteristics are unique to each person and are a major reason why we can tell people's voices apart even if they are producing sound at the same pitch.</p>
<p>Understanding this physiological system has also helped developers create artificial voices for people who have lost the ability to speak. They take linguistic samples from a speech &quot;donor&quot; and take recordings of vocal noises (vowel-like sounds) produced by the person who cannot speak (to get data on their biological source), and create an artificial voice that ends up as close as possible to what their real voice might have been.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the early 1990s, my father had a tracheotomy as part of treatment for throat cancer (it worked in so far as he could then breathe) which obviously left him unable to speak.  I build up a small audio oscillator attached to what was basically an earpiece with a thin bit of tubing that he could use to aim a pitch-variable &quot;buzzing&quot; sound close to a hard &quot;ah&quot; vowel sound at the back of his mouth, which improved his ability to make himself understood.  Unfortunately he died before we could refine it further; I'd planned to add a bit of filtering or shaping to tweak the vowel sounds further, and a filtered noise source to get the sibilants out.</p>
<p>Although there are commercial &quot;throat buzzer&quot; things, they sound weird and robotic.  This sounded less like an electric shaver and more like a good attempt at synthesized speech.</p></div>		</li>
