<p>That's the opposite of how evolution works. Traits generally only disappear if it's detrimental to survival. All other traits are left alone for the most part (I mean, traits can disappear due to pure chance, because mutations are in the end random so if the stars align, anything can happen)</p>
<p>Also, I think the question wasn't asking changes over time of hair color as a whole. The OP was asking why there aren't humans who have like calico or tiger stripe hair color patterns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! Wanted to make this point too, there has to be some factor causing a trait to disappear besides the fact that we don't &quot;need&quot; it anymore.  Random genetic drift causing a trait to disappear in a species is possible but over a long long period of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/r3wPpYrZCmg" target="_blank">My reaction to Sumit's first point</a></p>
<p>I think it's necessary to explain why these traits disappear in a way but also don't disappear in the way that Sumit said. And specifically in an ELI5 way.</p>
<p>First of all, a counter example. Humans don't need their appendix anymore, but we still have it. Just because a trait isn't <em>needed</em> doesn't mean it will disappear. A trait has to hurt the survival of the given organism in order for that trait to disappear. I'll explain in the next paragraph why.</p>
<p>Humans, just as any other species, have a large number of genes. These give us traits. Different genes mean different traits for humans as a whole. A trait will continue to be passed down if the organism(s) whole hold that trait can reproduce. That is the key in what is called &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. The &quot;fittest&quot; is the population of the species that doesn't die before they reproduce. If they reproduce, those genes/traits that hey carried, stay in the gene pool. (The gene pool is just a term for the collection of genes in a certain species at a given time.) If the organism dies before they reproduce, then they don't pass their genes down to their kin. This is where there is a chance that a gene might &quot;disappear&quot;. If the gene is only carried by that one organism, who dies before reproducing, then that gene is out of the gene pool. The species won't contain that gene anymore. In this -&quot;survival of the fittest&quot;- the fittest (ones who reproduce) pass their traits down, and the others (who don't get to reproduce) don't pass their traits down.</p>
<p>So where do traits come from? They come from mutations. A mutation is a random difference in the DNA sequence of a certain gene resulting from he randomosity of the universe (actually tho). It results in a different variation of a trait, or a whole new trait entirely. These each have a chance at affecting the chance that that one mutated organism gets to reproduce. There are other factors that affect the species like this, but we group them together and call it &quot;variation&quot;. For example this could be the species' population splitting in location due to natural disaster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But as far as most researchers believe, the ape line never had the trait of mottled hair.</p>
<p>Many biologists the evolution of fur occured roughly the same time as the evolution of endothermy (before, while or after is unclear, but in evolutionary speeds, they're close) and the ape line split off from this pretty fast as well. The evolution of camoflauge and sex based mottling and patterns occured later, likely after the split between apes and other mammals.</p>
<p>So there's no need of an evolutionary pressure, because the trait never existed in our line.</p>
<p>Of course, there's still why humans don't have much hair, but that's not relevant here afaic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a detriment to survival (it caused overheating - at least that's the latest theory, anyway). Which is especially bad if you support the endurance running hypothesis. It is really strange he implied that it was because we no longer needed to hide/blend in anymore though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't really buy this. If hair caused overheating, hair wouldn't have evolved to begin with (the period when hair evolved the CO2 levels were like 2-3 times higher than today, and temperatures were higher as well).</p>
<p>Are there any studies of hairless chimpanzees outperforming normal ones in any function?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Both my dad and my little brother started as blond and had their hair get darker over time. My brother's happened much faster than my dad's, if I remember correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, I was actually the other way around. I was born with dark black hair and my hair actually turned a coppery red a few years later. Granted now that I'm in my 20's it's more brown than red depending on the lighting, but yeah. I think 2 of my brothers are the same on that too where their hair actually lightened to blonde when they were toddlers, but I'm not 100% sure what they looked like as babies...</p></div>		</li>
