			<div class="markdown"><p>I came to the realization that modern art is more realistic and detailed than classic artwork I have had the pleasure to see.  My original question is simply asking why that is.  There is nothing sad about that, calm down.  Whether or not the masters wanted to create something that realistic or not is not in question.  The fact is that nothing with that level of detail and realism had been created until at least  the mid 1900s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is wrong with your question, don't feel bad. We are born blind, and as artists we learn to see and interpret the world differently. If you were to draw a person, you would draw a stick figure, a symbol of a human. If a well trained artist like an old master drew a person, it would look like a human. The saying is &quot;draw what you see, not what you know.&quot; When you actually draw what you see in front of you, you get realism. You learn the best possible way to represent three dimensional form onto a two dimensional surface. The masters without the help of a camera did this better than anyone ever has. Now introduce the camera. It does the same thing, but on its own terms. Pictures are interesting, but they only provide their side of the story. So when someone goes to draw something and uses a photo, it robs them of the opportunity to learn how to represent what they saw onto a two dimensional surface. It's skipping a step in your art education. Please read my original comment on this thread for a few more points as to why photo realism isn't that impressive.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;classic artwork&quot; is kind of a misnomer, it's not exactly an accepted term. Perhaps &quot;pre-modern&quot; might work better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THIS... It pisses me off I had to go so far down to find this comment. The masters painted (and created) for more than just the creation of an image. The amount of people that are ignorant about art in this thread makes me sad.</p>
<p>But you are wrong on one point, there are plenty of photo-realistic images from before the dawn of photography...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Hundreds upon hundreds of inane comments. The artists of the past had many different goals in mind throughout the years - making pictures look &quot;real&quot; was only one of them. And what &quot;real&quot; was, was not objective... nature was merely inspiration for the longest time. Even with the photorealistic paintings/drawings that OP posts, they look <em>flat.</em> the values have all been compressed a certain way, and in many the artists don't understand the mechanics of light and form - they are merely copying values</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't made it that far into the comments but that's sad if it's true. Picasso did beautiful realism paintings as well. His blue period pieces are some of my favorites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He didn't have good enough instruments to draw curves, and his paints were impure, and he was blind in one eye so his depth perception was way off, and the room he was standing in kept constantly having earthquakes so his brush kept shaking, and he had arthritis, so he couldn't put a lot of details in the background before he got too sore and tired.</p></div>		</li>
