			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really not- it's Hollywood logic. As others have stated, bombs are designed with different intents in mind and have different characteristics. Some use concussion (force of the shockwave) to perform damage but generally that's reserved for hard targets like buildings. </p>
<p>Suicide vests aren't just C4 on an idiots chest- it's generally a layer of shrapnel (ball bearings, nuts, bolts, etc) over a low yield explosive (sometimes made with crap like bleach or even chapati flour). The idea is to get in an open but crowded area and kill and maim as many as possible from the high velocity projectiles created by the vest detonating- with a generally horizontal pattern as the shrapnel bursts away from the vest and through others.</p>
<p>If someone grabs said piece of shit before he detonates, he absorbs the shrapnel much like jumping on a grenade. It also generally means you've floored said cunt, so shrapnel that would otherwise have a 360 degree horizontal blast arc, now goes down into the ground and up into said hero.</p>

<p>Of course the first reference to chapati I see on Reddit is somehow about building a bomb</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's absolutely not true.</p>
<p>Primary blast injuries are caused by the over-pressure wave of the explosion. Secondary blast injuries are fragmentation injuries from &quot;shrapnel.&quot; Tertiary blast injuries are blunt trauma secondary to a body being physically propelled into an object or the ground. Quaternary blast injuries are all other associated injuries (thermal, inhalation, etc.) </p>
<p>Look it up, also, read the actual EOD guys reply below.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What... </p>
<p>People don't die from the explosion. They die from the shrapnel. There's rarely enough force to kill someone more than a few meters away. When someone puts them self in front they take all the metal pieces onto themselves. It's the same with hand grenades. The grenades explosion doesn't mortally wound, the metal casing breaking apart does. It's designed that way on purpose. There are many articles, movies, a myth busters or two about this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blast does kill.  By your logic, you could stand 20 feet from a bare block of c4 (no frag) and survive.</p>
<p>The blast enters all air pockets in the body and tears you up from the inside. How do you think TBI from explosions happen?</p>
<p>Also, you have to think of a human body jumping on a suicide bomb.  It's an enhancement, just like adding nuts and bolts to HME.  Bone can get thrown just as fast as a nail or bolt. So now you have frag from the bomber, the hero and whatever enhancements the bomber put in his vest.  </p>
<p>To the EOD assistant... You know the powerful cutting and pushing effects water can have, or you should know...a human body has plenty... And doesn't redirect much.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Grenades work in the same way. Sure, the shockwaves might damage some of your internal organs but in the end, that plastic bit sticking out of your chest will kill you.</p>
<p>Shrapnels kill, shockwaves shock.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What you said makes no sense and you should not get medical information from myth busters, movies, or TV.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't think about bomb size, which was great point. My mind went straight to saline bags.</p>
<p>If you watch any breaching videos, you'll see they use something to force the blast towards the target. Usually metal, or saline bags. Don't ask me the sciencey stuff,  but basically the water forces the blast of the explosive away. And, like ^ pointed out, were mostly water.  </p>
<p>So, hero used his body to deflect the expanding gases back towards the bomber. And his body ate much of the material. And that's as smart as I get for the rest of the year . Or lifetime. Oh. Former EOD assistant.</p></div>		</li>
