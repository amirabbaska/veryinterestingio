			<div class="markdown"><p>I really dislike loud noises, I frequently finding myself turning down action scenes when they rumble my fillings only to find myself unable to hear the characters in the next scene as they whisper to avoid being discovered by the serial killer. I really hoped I wasn't alone in this but I guess I am :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate this as well.  Just as bad, scenes too dark to see what is going on.  The studios spent 10s of millions of dollars on this crap that I can't see and I can't hear.  I don't get it  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scenes being too dark to see what the hell is going on has always bothered me more than the noise differences. It always takes me right out of the movie and i find myself cursing at the studio and being too annoyed to get back into it for a bit. What is the damn point of that crap?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not alone. A couple of months ago I tried to find a solution for this problem too. There are special hardware devices for this problem (e.g.: Pötter Max 12 Pro) but I think some AV receiver can solve this too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, well, some of us live in apartments and don't want to &quot;sensory overload&quot; the neighbors while still barely being able to hear the dialogue. </p>
<p>I'm looking at you, Marvel Studios. Your movies are great but your loudness equalization sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone goes to the movies for &quot;sensory overload&quot;. </p>
<p>It comes at the expense of being able to understand wtf is happening in the damn thing. </p>
<p>Here's the thing: I wear hearing aids. They <em>help</em> but they can also be painfully triggered by sudden loud noises. I went to see &quot;Arrival&quot; on Christmas, and the first th ing that happened was I had to take the hearing aids out, because the volume in the theater was so loud.</p>
<p>Then the movie started...early on, there was a tv show in the background, but the dialogue--which was relevant to the scene!--was so low I couldn't hear it. It was then followed by noises <strong>SO LOUD</strong> that even without the hearing aids it was painful! </p>
<p>And it wasn't just me...my companions with hearing ranging from excellent to good had the exact same problem with the sound volume.</p>
<p>There was a time when directors and editors realized that people were there to actually follow the story, not get an ersatz &quot;sensory&quot; experience which doesn't do a damn thing to improve the movie.</p>
<p>Can't wait for this fad to be over. These movies are going to end up like the ones from the '70's with their crappy music and crackle-y miking--as late-night tv filler no one ever wants to watch. But at least they'll have subtitles then.</p></div>		</li>
