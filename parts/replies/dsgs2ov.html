			<div class="markdown"><p>Shockingly no! This is one of the coolest things about cuttlefish. Cuttlefish are, as far as we know, colorblind! They can only see tones of green. They can, however, see polarized light, which we’re incapable of seeing, and some scientists think that it’s possible that they communicate with each other by putting on polarized light displays that other animals (e.g. humans, fish) can’t see!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's cool, do you think we could use special cameras to recreate cuttlefish vision to view the world as they might see it?
A second question, I think I read somewhere that cuttlefish have light sensitive cells connected to their chromatophores in their skin. Is this true?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know enough about cameras to tell you whether we can visualize polarized light with a camera but considering that we can do infrared… probably? Also there are polarized sunglasses, right? So again...maybe. I don’t know how you would translate that into something we could see, that sounds like a question for an engineer but I would think… probably. That would be SUPER cool.</p>
<p>I think it was hypothesized that cuttlefish have light sensitive cells on their skin in general because scientists couldn’t figure out how they hell these cuttlefish are SO GOOD at camouflaging when they can’t see the full color spectrum in their eyes. An experiment that was proposed was blinding the cuttlefish so that the scientists could see whether they’re still capable of blending in to the background. Thankfully for the cuttlefish, the scientists just couldn’t bring themselves to blind the poor little munchkins and the experiment was never done (to my knowledge, anyway. I haven’t thought about this question in a few years). </p></div>		</li>
