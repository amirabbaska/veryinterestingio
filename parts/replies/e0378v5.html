			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia" target="_blank">apophenia</a> in general is a good explanation for lots of perceived patterns in natural phenomena, and especially those that get asked about here on AskScience. Not all patterns and apparent clustering in things like earthquakes, volcanoes, etc are devoid of meaning (e.g. aftershock sequences are good examples of a true pattern in earthquakes), but almost all of the, 'Why are there so many X recently? Is the rate of X increasing?' type observations/questions aren't meaningful when you look at time series of events. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read recently that earthquakes aren't neccesarily happening more frequently, we just are able to record the seismic activity in more areas resulting in it seeming like there are more. I guess it's kinda how in medicine when something gets recognition and people are able to be diagnosed finally it seems like all of a sudden we have an influx of X disease and so Y must be related to the increase. That's information bias, correct? </p></div>		</li>

<p>both are being filmed a lot by locals (mostly safely in the case of Hawaii and really unsafely in the case of the Guatemalan eruption, you should never be as close to a pyroclastic flow as some of the people shooting video are)</p>

<p>The USGS had to tell people in Hawaii not to toast marshmallows over active vents...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/Sunlight_lovee/status/1003422584199876608" target="_blank">people standing on this bridge</a> are very lucky to be alive and very stupid to not be getting as far away from this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroclastic_flow" target="_blank">pyroclastic density current</a> as they possibly can. </p>
<p>EDIT: To add a bit, since there seems to be a lot of confusion here (and elsewhere), pyroclastic density currents (or flows) are not 'smoke' and are not just ash. They are one of the most dangerous volcanic phenomena and are a mixture of both solids and gas that, as their name implies, flow downhill due to their density. They can travel very fast (upwards of 400 miles per hour), can be very hot (~1000 degrees celsius), and can contain a significant amount of mass (e.g. considering the sedimentary <a href="http://volcanology.geol.ucsb.edu/deposits.htm" target="_blank">record of pyroclastic flow deposits</a> gives you a sense of how much material can be deposited very quickly). As a tangible example, the well known destruction of Pompeii and the entombing of the victims was a result of pyroclastic density currents, not lava or ash fall.</p></div>		</li>
