<li>
<p>Blood clots if it stops moving in your bod (doesn't normally because of blood flow) but doctors can make it not clot after being taken out of your bod with a certain chemical.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blood has proteins that encourage and discourage clotting. Too many clot proteins and you clot too much. Some things can make you prone to this, like genetics and smoking.</p>
</li>
<li>The cells that line your blood vessels release proteins that encourage clotting. Makes sense because clots are needed when blood vessels break.</li>
</ul>
<p>Body blood no clot when things above not do. Clot still become maybe if:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In hospital. You don't move much and chances are there's been some incisions or needles or just an injury which has/is resulting in the cells lining your blood vessels releasing proteins to clot blood.</p>
</li>
<li>If you have a disorder.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TL;DR TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>If not hospital and not have cut and not have disorder or smoking problem, clot machine broke.</p></div>		</li>
