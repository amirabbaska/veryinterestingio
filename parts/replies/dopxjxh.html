			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming from a mathematics background, I can say I've seen very few maths journals that use two-column formats. The presence of long expressions probably factors into this. I've certainly noticed that if I'm reading physics papers, many end up being forced into breaking the two-columns at some point to include a longer equation, which looks dreadful in my opinion</p></div>		</li>
