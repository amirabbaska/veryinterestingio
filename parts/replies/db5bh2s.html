<p>I personally would argue that a similar sort of grade inflation is the primary factor in improving high school graduation rates in the US in the last couple decades. The education curriculums have shifted to make it harder for people to fail, because failing students mean: you have to deal with parents complaining or worse; the kid has to repeat the year which can be disruptive for other students; your school and teachers look shittier since graduation rate ends up directly and indirectly affecting performance perceptions; it costs the various levels of governement that contribute funding more in the 2-5 year term (though ostensibly loses them money via tax dollars in the long run); it makes everyone warm and fuzzy inside to see rising pass/graduation rates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how much things have changed but when I was in engineering school you were pretty damn luck if you could pull a 3.0, you were a freaking anomaly if you pulled a 3.5.  There were tons of weed out classes where the prof made it pretty clear than a C was a good grade.  On the other hand my father was a prof at a small private university and everybody had a 3.0 or above, part of there pitch was to get their students in to grad school if they wished.  GPA to me is very subjective and I think is a poor way to choose employees, but I guess you have to start somewhere when you don't have any prior job experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point that should be considered and upvoted more. Additionally, one must remember that at the high school level at least (for those jobs that don't require a college degree), some schools weight GPA while others don't.</p></div>		</li>
