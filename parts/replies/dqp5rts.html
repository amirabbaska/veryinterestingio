			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably depends a lot on the region and home. The first source cited in the linked article says one-third if dust is carpet fiber: I haven’t lived anywhere with carpets in twenty years, but I still have plenty of dust. Similarly, I’m pretty confident that less dust blows in from outside to my Brooklyn apartment than a stand-alone house in Arizona.</p>
<p>Obviously strongly supports the contention that the 80% figure is wrong, but doesn’t really answer the question of what dust is in most homes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is that it varies too much depending upon conditions like ventilation, urban or rural setting and if the home has pets. However in general the major contributor is fine particles of soil.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2009, Paloma Beamer of the University of Arizona catalogued household dust for the journal Environmental Science and Technology, and found that two-thirds of it blows in from outdoors: dirt tracked in on floors, as well as particulate matter from the air. The other third is mostly carpet fiber. Not much skin.</p>

It has the names of the researchers interviewed for the original false Wall Street Journal article, and their verbatim responses clarifying their actual position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a commonly repeated myth. Most times the source of the myth is someone with a vested interest in making you concerned about the amount of skin, commonly mattress and pillow manufactures. This isn't to say that there isn't a lot of skin flakes floating around, just that as a percentage of dust it represents a relatively small amount.</p></div>		</li>
