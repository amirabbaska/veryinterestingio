			<div class="markdown"><p>It is illegal to fire someone because they are of a certain ethnicity.  In a right-to-work state, you do not need to give a reason to fire someone.  They can fire someone because they are he wrong color, they just can't SAY that's why.  Same with store owners.  They can say whatever they want, whether that be the reason or not.  But as been already pointed out, that still doesnt protect them from public opinion and critisism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's the Catch 22 then, isn't it?</p>
<p>Both of my personal experiences with this were met with a refusal of why I or we were asked to vacate the premises. Once the refusal to leave occurs, then it is a matter where a clear onus is on the party and not the business.</p>
<p>It seems like a large legal loophole that a business can deny service without having to give cause, and then the customer's refusal to comply incriminates them.</p>
<p>Perhaps the heart of the question is at what point the line gets crossed from the business or manager doing something illegal to when you are? Or just what rights exactly you have in a sticky situation like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there are some reasons that you are allowed to refuse service (e.g. customer being rude or disruptive) and there are some reasons that you are <em>not</em> allowed to refuse service (e.g. customer is black).</p>
<p>Not a lawyer, but IIRC if they refuse you service it would be on you to prove it was for an illegal reason rather than a legal once if you wanted to hold them accountable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, not all situations are covered in the law.  If a bakery won't sell you a doughnut because &quot;we don't serve blacks here&quot;, that's a crime and the sign means nothing.  If the bakery won't sell you a birthday cake because &quot;we don't like old people&quot;, that's a crime.  If they won't sell you a birthday cake because &quot;we don't like birthdays&quot;, then that's the same as them not selling mufflers, no legal problem here.  If they won't sell you a wedding cake because you want two brides on the top and &quot;we don't sell wedding cakes to people who are violating our religions prescriptions for marriage, but we'd sell you a birthday cake instead&quot; - well the SCOTUS is considering that one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a recent case in Northern Ireland where Asherâ€™s Bakery, a local Christian business, refused to serve a gay man requesting a cake with an LGBT pride or similar message on the cake. Went to court and the bakery lost, although I believe appeals are still ongoing. It was all over the news at the time and the company definitely received some backlash, however, Northern Ireland being as it is re same sex marriage, archaic Christian views, etc the support from the public was pretty evenly split for both sides. </p></div>		</li>
