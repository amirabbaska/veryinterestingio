			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note: good on you for admitting that you were 'at a loss for words', and asking for help. You're setting such a good example for your son by admitting you don't know and that you would have to look up the answer. An Australian ISP Bigpond capitalised on the opposite of this (the <a href="https://youtu.be/DvlWQyvEI38" target="_blank">'keep the rabbits out'</a> ad)-- I'm not sure how true this is for other parents in the real world, but there seemed to be a big pressure on my dad to 'always know the answer to everything' when I was younger. Even if he wasn't sure it was true, he'd try and explain it without admitting he wasn't sure. It was rough, learning in my teenage years, that my dad wasn't the paragon of knowledge that I thought he was. Keep doing what you're doing OP! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Had a history teacher who I would always ask hard questions to because I was a history nerd and a lot of times they would turn the question back on me and ask me what I thought the answer was and want evidence could I think of and then they would either agree or disagree then look it up later. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although awesome, it’s actually incorrect. It’s aeration, not The way the water reflects the light. Basically when water “Falls” or flow is rough, bubbles are created and their surface edge reflects the light more than water at a slower, calmer flow......when the water stops falling bubbles dissipate and white color fades</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not scintillation. Scintillation is when light gets <em>generated</em> inside a medium due to some outside influence.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly why a diamond is shiny where as a sheet of glass is clear</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's caused by <em>dispersion</em>, where different wavelengths of light refract differently at interfaces, in combination with the facets ground into the stone that are designed to reflect light back out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for mentioning that. I was trying to go out of my way to use the layman's term scintilation, as in the effect of scintilation visually as opposed to the physical process as I felt it would help younger people make the connection between bright flashes of light and dispersion.</p>
<p>I'm a scientist and I'm trying to learn how to better teach things to young people, it's genuinely hard to use words without going into a 5 minute explanation of what you mean by the word in my experience.</p>
<p>I probably should have written, &quot;This is the visual effect we call scintillation caused by light bouncing around inside an object&quot;.</p>
<p>Would that have been more clear or even worse?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the effect of scintillation or light bouncing around inside an object, and the effect of being redirected and focused or spread out. This is exactly why a diamond is shiny where as a sheet of glass is clear.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Isn't this just the effect of reflection and refraction? I thought scintillation was the emission of light following the absorption of ionizing radiation (e.g. a gamma particle), observable in certain materials. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In physics yes. We see the effect scintillation in the layman's sense as opposed to the process of scintilation in the physics sense.</p>
<p>It's worth mentioning the difference if it's not clear, thanks.</p></div>		</li>
