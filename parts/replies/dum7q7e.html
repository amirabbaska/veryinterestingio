<p>Yes, that's true. The issue is within that sentence - not all food can be processed the same. Rotting (raw) meat will contain nutrients, but also harmful bacteria and maybe parasitic worms making it a net negative - you'll shit yourself for a week, and if you're really unlucky, get a parasite that will remove nutrients from your diet long term. </p></div>		</li>
