<p>But to clarify, UV rays only hit your skin. X-rays will penetrate your entire body and hit sensitive organs. Still, skin cancer is no joke. </p></div>		</li>

<p>tanning is not harmless. excessive UV radiation causes sunburn along with other direct and indirect DNA damage to the skin, and the body naturally combats and seeks to repair the damage and protect the skin by creating and releasing further melanin into the skin's cells. With the production of the melanin, the skin color darkens = tanning. </p>
<p>I don't know why some people want to tan their skin...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is semi correct.<br />
People that love the beach, surfing, or are farmers, builders etc are better off being tanned as a tan is the body’s natural defence against the sun. If you are going to be in the sunlight all day every day and you can’t help it, being tanned is a massive pro, not a con. Tanning isn’t just repairing the damage, it’s the body’s way of preventing the damage and reducing sun-burn, which is much more harmful to your skin.<br />
This is why most native people are black, because people like native African’s were out in the sun all day every day and through evolution their skin colour darkened to defend against the UV from the sun. They’re skin wasn’t necessarily damaged, just altered to suit its environment through time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you clarify your response? A heat injury and a radiation injury are not mutually exclusive sets as radiation is a form of heat transfer. </p>
<p>Wikipedia lists several different types of burns, including thermal and radiation as well as cold, chemical, etc. Is UV radiation incapable of cooking flesh? </p>
<p><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cooking-with-the-sun/" target="_blank">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cooking-with-the-sun/</a></p>
<p>This article says it’s converted to infrared to heat and cook the food, but doesn’t say whether an intense enough UV source or a long enough duration would cook food without the conversion. </p>
<p>Microwaves obviously cook food as well, so it’s not like radiation and cooking are exclusive either.</p>

<p>Full circle to another askreddit thread about this subject where people seem to think that UV radiation can be used to cook. SO, can you please source your comment or delete it for being misleading and perhaps also incorrect? :) </p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought it was clear from my examples that I was contrasting the UV radiation burn with the other two forms of heat transfer that your first source references: conduction (I mentioned burn by flame) and convection (food cooking in an oven). I was trying to avoid confusing OP, as most people think of &quot;heat&quot; as &quot;things that are hot to the touch&quot;.</p>
<p>When you speak of cooking flesh, that sounds like you think the UV radiation is cooking or burning your skin in the same way you'd cook a chicken in the oven. That is completely wrong. You do not get a sunburn by the UV radiation being absorbed by your skin and cooking it.</p>
<p>The CBS article is also wrong, or at least overly simplistic. Solar cookers generally work because they trap heat or focus sunlight on a smaller area. Most of the sun's radiation is infrared <a href="http://solar.physics.montana.edu/ypop/Spotlight/Today/infrared.html" target="_blank">[source]</a>, so the parabolic solar cooker concentrates that infrared radiation (and other wavelengths, sure, but it is the IR that is cooking the food) from a wider area onto the focus. The heat trap style of solar cooker is opaque to infrared but the other wavelengths that pass through are absorbed by the material inside and emitted as infrared radiation, which cooks the food. <a href="http://solarcooking.wikia.com/wiki/How_solar_cookers_work" target="_blank">[source]</a>. Also, please note that this is not some magical UV to infrared converter that someone skips over or ignores visible light.</p>

<p>If the article doesn't mention an intense UV source directly cooking flesh, then why are you citing it as a source that UV radiation can cook flesh?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You're kind of skipping over some details and making unfounded conclusions because of it. Microwaves don't work because of &quot;all radiation cooks food&quot;. They work because microwave wavelength radiation interacts with the polar water molecules in food, which increases their temperature, which cooks the surrounding meat.</p>

<p>Why do you believe the uncited claims in that thread, but not my uncited claims? :-)</p>
<p>In any event, I think you are also misunderstanding what that thread also said. The top post says:    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So a toaster which cooks primarily through convection, heating the element up to the point it would primarily output UV would require much better insulation and build quality and different materials to contain the heat. It would cook much faster, the element would be much hotter so it would cook much quicker through convection, and UV will also cook it slightly, but whether it'd be hugely different other then being burnt much quicker I can't say.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, a toaster whose element is hot enough to output significant UV would still be cooking primarily through convection. It would be so hot that it wouldn't be so much a toaster as it would be a char-rer.</p>
<p>In any event, I added a source with some quotes that makes it clear that a sunburn is directly from UV radiation damaging DNA in the skin, it is not a thermal burn from solar IR, conduction, or convection.</p></div>		</li>
