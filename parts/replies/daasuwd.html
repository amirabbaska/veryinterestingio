			<div class="markdown"><p>Eeeeeek, wrong. They do heal themselves, there are micro-canals that supply minerals and strengthen them if you chip-off a piece. Yes, chipped part wont regrow, but the revealed surface will become stronger over time. Micro-canals also supply fluoride to the surface. Also every tooth grows with the rest of the body, they are nothing like nails or hair. Thanks for playing though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but in rodents it works the same way.</p>
<p>The ends of the teeth are worn away by normal wear and tear, and new material is constantly pushed onto the bottom of them by the body - just like hair and nails.</p>
<p>However even in rodents, the body has no control of the tooth beyond the very base.</p></div>		</li>
