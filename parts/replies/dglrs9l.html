			<div class="markdown"><p>You would need to drink 100L to raise your pH from 2 to 6. More than your weight in water. </p>
<p>Edit: my math was wrong. You would need to drink 1000L. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pH 2 to pH6?</p>
<p>Are you drinking water or concentrated Sodium Hydroxide?</p>
<p>Almost all cells in organs of our body go into osmotic shock (cell membrane rupture due to concentration imbalance) over pH variances of 1-2.5, even lesser than that in case of delicate cells (those in nerves). If stomach pH would increase to 6 even momentarily I am sure certain types of cells would literally implode, as the proton concentrations inside them would be 10000 times than their surroundings.</p></div>		</li>
