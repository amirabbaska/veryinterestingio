			<div class="markdown"><p>In this context, yes. Viruses have temperature they like, most of what affect us prefer our body’s temperature to grow. When we raise our temperature it makes the environment less hospitable for viral growth without harming our bodies immune responses</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. RN here. A temp of 39, sure. We don’t typically give out Tylenol till a fever is greater than that because your body needs to fight off the virus. I don’t let my patients sleep with a million blankets though. </p>
<p>But it also depends if it’s viral or bacterial. Recently looked after a patient who was radiating heat, lethargic, drowsy. Took a rectal temp of 41c. Gave him a Tylenol supp and immediately got ice packs and put them on his groin, armpits and carotids. </p>
<p>He had a uti. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it normal to feel hot then cold over and over. This was a few years ago now when I was still in high school. I had my jacket with me I would feel really cold and I would put my jacket on. Then I would be too hot and would have to take it off and repeat. Turned out I had the flu and that was the only warning I got before I started to feel like shit an hour later. </p></div>		</li>
