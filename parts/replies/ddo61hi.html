			<div class="markdown"><p>does it matter that, at large distance from the Earth, the gravitational force is all 'downward', while closer to the surface there are (canceling) 'sideways' components? i.e. is gravity much weaker near the surface than would be expected if the planet were a singularity (and you were standing 6300 km above)?</p>
<p>i've wondered this for a while, i feel like it's a dumb question somehow but this seemed like a chance to ask..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The planet's gravity can be modeled as if all the mass was concentrated in the center.</p>
<p>So, no, the gravity from the planet and a black hole with the same mass at any distance at or above the surface will be the same^1.</p>
<ol>
<li>This ignores deviations caused by the planet not being a perfect sphere, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: When you have a singularity, all the mass is at the center, while a planet has a distribution, both along the perpendicular to the radial direction (which cancels out) and on the radial direction (some of the planet is behind the center and some of it is in front). You can do some integrals for concentric shells to see that a hollow shell of some small thickness (a very thin sphere) will behave as if all the mass was concentrated in the center for any point above the shell. </p>
<p>If you integrate for a point inside, you will find out that at any point inside a hollow shell there is zero gravitational acceleration due to the mass in the shell.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, how do orbits changed if your orbital mechanics are influence by the Shell Therem?</p>
<p>Ie, I have a gun. I fire a bullet at 1km/s eastwards from the equator. The bullet is very nifty, It changes to cold (slow) dark matter instantly. So this bullet goes eastwards, and .... doesn't lithobrake against the ground. </p>
<p>If we treat the earth as a point mass, and ignoring any friction, I think we'd just have an eliptical orbit with the high points just touching the earth's surface? </p>
<p>But if we're applying the shell theorem (And no litho-friction) we'd have to treat the source of gravity as a varying mass, proportional to the distance to the center of the earth?  Full mass at earth surface, zero mass at center of the earth. </p>
<p>So how would our orbits would be different?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It doesn't matter. Treating the Earth like a perfect monopole, the only direction that matters at all is the up-down direction.</p>
<p>If the Earth were a point mass with the same total mass, the gravitational field would be identical at 6300 km to what it is now. That's a result of Newton's shell theorem.</p></div>		</li>
