			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you can't say things like that. What you can say is, before the procedure, dentist will assess the state of your teeth, and will discuss with you expectations regarding how much whiter your teeth could get, and from that information will figure out the exact protocol for the procedure - the peroxide exposure period and the degree of photoactivation to use. Careless application of any reactive substance to your tissues can and will seriously damage them, that's just common sense! Follow recommendations of your dentist, or at the very least carefully read the instructions on the OTC whitening strips.   </p></div>		</li>
