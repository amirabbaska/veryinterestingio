			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a paper about coral bleaching a few semesters ago. Microplastics play a big role in coral reef destruction because the polyps, and many other coral-dwelling creatures, confuse these tiny bits of plastic for plankton. These microplastics can't be digested, so they accumulate in the polyps stomach until the creature dies (either from an exploding stomach or starvation).</p>
<p>I'd be really interested in reading your paper when it's finished. Any chance you'd throw it on google drive and share? </p></div>		</li>

<p>If I wasn’t going crazy with final exams and trying to finalize my 20,000+ word paper, I’d love to but I’m pretty sure I included what’s generally accepted- meaning that there must be infographics out there already. The GPGP has been around for a while, but check out the Ocean Clean Up website! It was started by a Dutch kid who took an interest in finding a way to clean it- he’s now 23 and in charge of a multi-million dollar clean up organization. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where are you graduating from and what is your degree? Curious. Also can you provide hyperlinks to your references. A copy and paste of your bibliography would be awesome. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a pretty tall order to be honest.  Given the frequency of internet doxxing, it might not be such a good idea to put all that info in one place.   </p></div>		</li>
