			<div class="markdown"><p>When I visited the UK, both of the bathrooms in houses I was at, and I think at the hotel too all had light switches on the outside of the room.  </p>
<p>This is objectively terrible, I don't want somebody to be able to turn off the light, accidentally or not when I'm on the shitter or in the shower, but at least I have a reason now.  </p>
<p>I've actually lived at a house where the bathroom light wiring was bad, and this would happen to me. I'd get tingly fingers whenever I touched the light switches with wet hands (Usually to turn on the fan after I took a shower), it was never a big deal though, and it never happened at other houses I've been at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few friends in electrical engineering and they once explained to me that where I come from (The Netherlands) a light switch must be a minimum distance away from any water source (I think this is a European guideline). If a shower room is very small, this means that the light switch has to be outside the room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's generally true for sockets but not switches, at least not as a universal European rule. Plenty of European countries have the switches within the bathroom even in small bathrooms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's actually standard building code in the UK that requires pull-string light fixtures in bathrooms unless the bathroom exceeds a certain size. Very annoying, honestly. As though the rest of the world are getting electrocuted constantly operating switches in their bathrooms with wet hands...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, within 1,5m of the shower, light switches have to be high near the ceiling, therefore also needing a wire down to reach it. This is to minimize the risk of short circuit by water splashes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the rest of the world had it too. I’m that paranoid about turning off light switches with wet hands I’d use my elbow to turn the lights off on a normal switch out of the bathroom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and you cannot have any mains electric sockets, only low voltage sockets for electric razors and tooth brushes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this is true, but I swear under UK building regs, you're not allowed to have a switch inside the bathroom(normally a switch just outside the door), I know that razer-plugs(/maybe normal plugs) are a big no-no, so i'd imagine that the string switch was to work similar to that(no direct contact towards the switch)</p></div>		</li>
