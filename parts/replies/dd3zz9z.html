			<div class="markdown"><p>So, short answer is &quot;yes&quot; and long answer is &quot;yes, but what you do with that is up to you.&quot; Is that about right? If I'm understanding you right, we <em>are</em> hardwired to make that distinction, but the qualities we <em>associate</em> with that inherent classification can change based on culture or whatnot? So when seeing a person, everyone will think &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;man&quot; innately, but then what that means to us may change?</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;However, these Universities, as well as the individual researchers who have contributed to this site, make no claim for the validity of these suggested interpretations.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
