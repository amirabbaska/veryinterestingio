			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting. My step-aunt, who has mid-stage Alzheimer’s, isn't diabetic, but constantly craves sweets. She eats cookies non-stop if supplied with them. I have no idea if she did this before her diagnosis, but I suspect not, since she was always trying to control weight. </p>
<p>Could this be a symptom of her Alzheimer’s?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add to this - my grandmother has Alzheimer's and Diabetes and recently has been hiding sweets in her room. My aunt who she lives with had found little red candy wrappers scattered around the house. &quot;Jane, where did these come from?&quot; &quot;what?&quot; &quot;these candy wrappers?&quot; &quot;oh, I don't know.&quot; two minutes later, another candy wrapper shows up. &quot;Jane, where did that come from?&quot; &quot;what?&quot; &quot;the candy! do you have candy in your pocket?&quot; &quot;I don't know.&quot; </p>
<p>She frequently says things like &quot;how about some apple pie?&quot; or will wake up in the middle of the night to grab some ice cream, without anyone else knowing. It's a danger to her health as a diabetic, but also definitely affects her memory throughout the day - if she's had a high sugar day, she is more sporadic and her train of thought is harder to follow. </p>
<p>I wonder if it's a symptom of Alzheimer's, but also a precursor? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting, I've observed similar behaviour with my mother. She's not a diabetic but in the past 7-8 month (diagnosis of AD 4 months ago) she started eating a lot of sweets and cake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm an SLP and work with people with dementia every day. The sweet taste is the last taste receptor to fade. Most of my patients with mid dementia love sweet things as a result, especially chocolate milk. In order to encourage her to eat savory items, try adding ketchup (which has a lot of sugar). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Not OP) Good question...when I was in a hospital doing an externship (I'm an SLP), I remember that the blood sugar of people with brain injuries would be all over the place.  Whether that's from damaged brain tissue or something else (shock?), I don't know.  They would have disturbed cognition until their blood sugar was stabilized so we couldn't treat them, really.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Type 3 Diabetes has become pop-culture relevant, but it's not necessarily an ideal term. It's referring to the fact that you a) have increased risk of AD when you have type 2 diabetes, and b) there is evidence that insulin mis-regulation in the brain may play a role either upstream or downstream in the pathogenesis of AD. I think there is very little evidence to suggest that insulin and IGF abnormalities cause AD, but the jury is still out. There is far better genetic evidence for the protein misfolding theories (And their downstream repercussions) being the underlying mechanism. The only causative mutations we have found for AD create increased amounts of amyloid beta which deposits in AD brains.</p></div>		</li>
