			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, many places besides Israel get drinking water from desalinization. Kuwait uses it to provide virtually all their water. Around 300 million people get at least some of their drinking water from desalinisation as of 3 years ago <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desalination#cite_note-6" target="_blank">according to Wikipedia</a>, and that number is higher today. Current average costs are around 1 cent per 15 liters, and new plants can usually beat this as the price has been falling with better technology. </p>
<p>Desalinization is already cost effective for drinking water, the main issue is that people are used to getting free water and agriculture uses massive amounts of water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This.  A gallon of desalinated now costs a fraction (less than 0.1%) of what Americans are willing to pay for a gallon of bottled water.  Still too expensive for agricultural use but entirely reasonable for drinking.</p>
<p>Israel now gets most of its drinking water from desalination.  It uses reclaimed water for agriculture.  The US is miles behind:  Israel recycles 80% of its water, the US about 1%.  Israel’s largest desalination plant produces 6 times as much water as the largest US plant.  Even Saudi Arabia, Cyprus, and Spain are far ahead in the race.</p>
<p>So no, cost is not the barrier.  Will is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Israel also is mostly desert and has water shortage issues. While this is also true in some high profile cases in the US, mostly California/Arizona trying to make the desert bloom, for most of the country this is simply not the case. We have enough water from more normal means, which makes desalination not as cost-effective.</p>
<p>There also <em>are</em> multiple desalination facilities in California.</p>
<p>Finally comparing bottled water to desalinized water also isn't a fair comparison. Comparing my tap water, pumped from a stream, to bottled water and you'll get an even more ridiculous cost ratio. Bottled water is just ludicrously expensive in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beg to differ. The entire southwest is in desperate need of water. The Rocky Mountains and ground water supply large cities in the deserts (LA, Phoenix, etc) along with the mass agricultural. Colorado specifically, one of like two donor states is in a drought and on fire. Water rights is no joke, and I couldn’t imagine what it would be like if those desert cities were more self reliant...or more people cared less about there green grass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US also has an abundance of water, and can buy more from an even bigger reservoir (AKA Canada). Israel's got fuck-all, so yes, research into desalination is more important for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big droughts occur often in US states like California, where desalination would make a lot of sense (instead of pumping Yosemite dry).  They’ve turned to Israel time and again and the solution is obvious.  But the political will (for any infrastructure investment) is lacking.  So it’s drought panic again and again, every 3-5 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this was a good overview and conclusion.</p>
<p>As someone who sails desalination on boats can generate hundreds of gallons a day just on solar. </p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things that's expensive but to the average American it's not that bad, so like you said it's approaching a cost effective solution. Especially when utilizing solar. </p></div>		</li>
