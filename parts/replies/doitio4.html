<p>In April 2015 the Wall Street Journal reported that &quot;biologists working for the state estimated that <strong>3,500 birds died at Ivanpah in the span of a year</strong>, many of them burned alive while flying through a part of the solar installment where air temperatures can reach 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit [540 Â°C]&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat peripheral, but: </p>
<p>1) The 3500 birds per year estimate was, in the fine tradition of risk assessment, really high. (I think they saw 3 birds in one day, tripled it in case that was a good day, and multiplied by 365 days in a year. Something like that.) </p>
<p>2) The problem was software. On a really bright clear day not all the mirrors are pointing at the central receiver. (To avoid burning a hole in it, basically; you engineer in a few extra mirrors so you can get full power when it's not noon, or not a super clear day.) You want those mirrors pointed somewhere far enough away that they don't spill sunlight onto the receiver, but close enough that you can move them back on-target fast if needed. </p>
<p>My understanding is that Ivanpah's software initially focused all the mirrors not in use at a single point near the receiver, and any bird that came anywhere near that point got flash-roasted. Once they rewrote the software so every beam went off-target somewhere different, the problem was fixed. </p></div>		</li>
