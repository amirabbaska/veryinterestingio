<p>Not responses aimed at literal five year olds (which can be patronizing).&quot;</p>
<p>Honest question, because this was not assuming medical professional knowledge by a long shot. What exactly about my post was inaccessible to a lay person? I explained in context what the purpose of each neuron type and receptor were. I pointed out what was in the brain and what wasn't. Do you think serotonin or neurotransmitters needed more explanation?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's your vocabulary choices. Words and phrases like &quot;area postrema&quot;, chemoreceptors, gastric motility, afferent neurons, and others are not generally layman's terms.  Hell, I had to look up what the area postrema was. You explained the concept properly, but with words that assume a certain base knowledge of chemoreceptors, neurons, and the GI system, that most people don't have. </p>
<p>Edit: I'd also like to add that most people don't know what the GI system becoming more contractile means, or what a chemoreceptive trigger zone is. </p>
<p>Edit #2: just wanted to say that I'm not trying to be snarky, but I bet you spend a lot of time around more educated people and aren't used to having to explain things at a more basic level. </p></div>		</li>
