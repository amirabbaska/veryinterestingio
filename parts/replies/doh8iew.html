			<div class="markdown"><p>a bit of a side question, but i anecdotally heard that we also accrue toxins or some other type of chemical in our brain that requires regular rest in order for our brain to flush it out.  Is there any truth to this?  </p></div>		</li>

<p>There have been MRI studies that show increased flow of CSF through the brain during certain sleep stages. It's been shown that this removes plaque and other &quot;toxins&quot; (cell byproducts) from the brain in a sort of cleaning process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may very well be true. But the question remains: <em>Why</em> do we need to sleep in order to flush those toxins?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about other animals?</p>
<p>For example, horses typically get less than 30 minutes of REM sleep per day, and less than 3 hours total sleep ... and yet, they've been shown to outperform humans in long-term memory tests.</p>
<p>On the opposite side, you have lions sleeping an average of 20 hours per day ... do they really need that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also don't need to eat as often as grazing animals so more time for sleeping. It's also hot where lions are from so I'm assuming they'd spend the heat of the day in the shade and do other things in the evening and mornings </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sure, but I'm talking from a neurological standpoint. </p>
<p>And even for the lions, the wilderness is not a perfectly safe place. They'd be better off resting and alert than they would be sleeping, at any time of day. So there must be a benefit to sleep other than just energy conservation, even when it's 20 hours of sleep. ... Which seems odd when you compare it to a horse's 3 hours of sleep, which they seem to do fine on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't modafinil technically reduce the amount of downtime needed? From what I've read, it's able to put you on a 48 hour cycle (40 awake, 8 asleep) with no real known side effects. While the amount of per session sleep is the same, the ratio of wakeful hours to sleeping is much higher meaning your required downtime is effectively less. Or am I understanding this wrong/ totally mistaken?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, you are.</p>
<p>One of the major problem with the -fils is that their actual mechanisms of action are still mysterious.  It took something like 15 years after modafinil was originally released to obtain enough evidence to conclude that it's a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (and that is still controversial in some quarters.) It also can play mean with the CYP3A pathway, which any number of other drugs use for metabolism, and that's been studied far less.</p>
<p>I'm unaware of any research that suggests the -fils actually change your sleep architecture rather than your alertness, nor do they change your circadian rhythm.</p></div>		</li>
