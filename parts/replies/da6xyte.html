			<div class="markdown"><p>Finger prints are formed due to hormonal fluctuations, heat in various parts of the womb, and friction from touching the amniotic sac. Only the type of fingerprint is influenced by genes. But since none of the conditions I stated above will be replicated exactly for any fetus, that's why no one in the world has the same fingerprints </p></div>		</li>

I was malnourished and needed to stay at the hospital for two weeks after our birth while she was able to go home; yes, the conditions in the womb can vary SIGNIFICANTLY </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although interactions in the early stages of development are considered to be a part of the story, it has much more to do with the different rates of growth between the dermis and the epidermis. The interaction that causes the pattern is between the two layers, not so much with the environment of the womb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am still a little confused.  The womb thing made me wonder why my finger print, or any of the patterns on my skin grow back the exact same way after an injury.  I'm still perplexed though because if they grow back the same way each time all my life, then it surely is genetics at work?   Yet identical twins have different patterns.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skin patterns don't grow back the same. Ever have a burn or deep cut?</p>
<p>Example: after getting a mole removed, you wouldn't grow another mole. A deep cut on a fingertip will leave a scar, ruining your fingerprint. </p></div>		</li>
