<p>The real question is why doesn't the police contract stipulate that an officer who is sued and loses get immediately fired?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's typically language in the contract between the officer's union and the municipality that determines disciplinary procedures.   </p>
<p>Unless there was overriding legislation at the state or federal level to stipulate such an action it's going to come down to the negotiators for the municipality and the union.  It's obviously not in the union's interest (ignoring PR issues) to have ultra strict disciplinary rules, and to an extent it's not always in the municipality's either.  You don't want police so afraid to do their jobs that they don't actually do them.   </p>
<p>Changing that situation if the public believes officer's are given too much leniency requires political pressure on elected officials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not just insure the officers? Require they have it and deduct the premium from their paycheck. Plaintiffs sue the insurance company, officers pay a fine to the insurance company and the rate goes up. Maybe they'll stop shooting people when it directly impacts their pay. Seems like the perfect capitalist racket for this kind of situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a possible solution, but I think it's overly cumbersome. Officers who never do anything wrong end up having to pay premiums, which hurt them, and there's bound to be a net loss in efficiency by adding in insurance regulations, sales people, etc.</p>
<p>Insurance makes sense when you have to spread risk out or don't have the money to pay potentially large expenses at once. In this case, cities generally have the money to pay judgments so there's no cash flow issue. I'd also argue it's weird to think about spreading around risk since an officer has to violate your well-established rights to be liable. That's not a risk we acknowledge happens sometimes - we think of it more as a reckless or conscious decision.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I could make this argument about good drivers.  Or good doctors, or any other profession that requires insurance.</p>

<p>Cities might have the money on hand, but it could instead be spent on things like education or infrastructure, instead of paying our for bad cops.</p></div>		</li>
