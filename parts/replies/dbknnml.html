			<div class="markdown"><p>In base 3 it's not so bad to determine if a number is even.  You can use the analogous trick as you would use in base 10 to see if something is divisible by 9:  add up all the digits and see if it is divisible by 2.</p>
<p>If your base-3 number is abcde this means e+3*d+3^2 c+3^3 b+3^4 a.  Since 3^anything is odd, the only terms in that sum that are even are those where the digits were even (0 or 2).  If the digit is 1 (the only other choice in base 3) it contributes an odd amount to the sum.  If there are an even number of odd contributions, you again get an even number.</p>
<p>This justifies /u/DupliciD's observation, since in odd bases just substitute 3 for your odd number, and powers of odd numbers are always odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment got me thinking about rules like this that would apply to other bases in a simple fashion. </p>
<p>In odd bases, if the numbers add up to an even number then it is even.</p>
<p>E.g. In base 3, 8 is 22, 6 is 20, 12 is 40</p>
<p>E.g. In base 7, 10 is 13, 54 is 75, 100 is 202</p>
<p>I'm not 100% confident on this but on the numbers I tested it seems to check out. It makes sense for a seemingly apparent reason that I can't put into words well. Fun problem to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct. If I wasn't on my phone I'd write out the formal proof, but the jist of it is that in an odd number base each digit is the base (an odd number) times the value of the digit. If you multiply two odd numbers together you always get an odd number, and if you add two odd numbers together you always get an even number. With those facts you can show that if the sum of the digits is even then the number is even when converted to base 10. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;40&quot; in base 3. &quot;12&quot; in base 10 would be 110 in base 3. Similarly, there 54 would actually be 105 in base 7.</p>
<p>For any number base, you never use the digit that represents your base, or any digits higher than that. For example, in base 16 we use A through F to represent 10 through 15, but we don't have &quot;A&quot; in base 10.</p></div>		</li>
