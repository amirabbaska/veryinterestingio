			<div class="markdown"><p>A particle can only anniilate with its own antiparticle. Some mesons are made of a particle/antiparticle pair and some aren’t. The ones which are <em>do</em> decay by “annihilation”. The ones which are not of the same type can’t do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does color charge have any bearing on this? e.g. if I have a red up and a blue anti-up, will they annihilate?  Or would it have to be a red up and an anti-red anti-up?</p></div>		</li>
