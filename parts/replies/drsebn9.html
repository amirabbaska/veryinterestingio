			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Alaska and I tell people this all the time. Crabs are scavengers, like most bottom dwelling creatures. A dead body would quickly be eaten before it froze, if it even got cold enough to do so. Crab are like the seagulls of the ocean floor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was reading Mary Roach's <em>Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers</em> a couple months ago and remembered a part about crabs eating people.</p>
<p>&quot;Then one day I had a conversation with Phillip Backman, during which he mentioned that one of the cleanest, quickest, and most ecologically pure things to do with a body would be to put it in a big tide-pool full of Dungeness crabs, which apparently enjoy eating people as much as people enjoy eating crabs. &quot;It'll do the thing in a couple of days,&quot; he said.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like the cockroaches of the ocean, but it doesn't bother me. The kinds of pathogens that infect crabs are rarely going to be compatible with human biology, so there is little to worry about in terms of making you sick. The exception to that being a possible concentration of potentially toxic substances such as heavy metals, but if they are coming from a relatively sparsely populated area, away from heavy industry, that's a non issue as well. </p>
<p>The issue with terrestrial arthropods is that they often feed on or come into contact with the sorts of things that would make us sick, crawling around on our refuse or feeding on dead mammals etc.  Ocean arthropods, even a bottom feeder, not so much.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions that may occur in warmer climates, like a build up of cyanobacteria, but even then I'm not sure if crabs with a high enough toxin concentration to be harmful to humans would also be alive enough to get caught in a trap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In college we were regaled with the story of the Sinking of Alvin, a submarine at the Wood's Hole Oceanographic Institution. Three crew members were on board when the submersible flooded in the Atlantic. Although they escaped their lunchbox remained in the sub as it sank to the ocean floor. Months later researchers recovered Alvin from depth. Their bologna sandwich was almost perfectly preserved after months underwater due to the temperature and pressure preventing bacterial growth.  <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/what-sunken-sandwiches-tell-us-about-the-future-of-food-storage-102837326/" target="_blank">Here's an article on it</a>
Of course without the shelter of a metal tank dead fish are important energy sources in the deep sea and ocean benthos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of density though. Water is most dense at 4°C so just because of the nature of density, water at the bottom of the ocean is always 4°C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is only true for fresh water. Salt water continues to get denser right up to the freezing point, around -1.7C for 35 psu water.</p>
<p>Source: oceanographer who works in water up to almost 11 km deep, and has spent a winter in Antarctica, and taken lots of classes on this stuff, and has books with plots of density as a function of temperature and salinity.</p>
<p>Edit: Here are some plots I made of water density as a function of temperature and salinity. Red dashed line is freezing temp at that salinity.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That's a not right. <em>if</em> there is water that holds 4° C in a given body of water, it will be at the bottom. The whole column of water can of course be both warmer or colder than 4° C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature and pressure aren’t related like that. While water is densest at 4 C at atmospheric pressure, the water at the bottom of the ocean is even denser than that due to the much larger pressure, even though it’s in the 0-3 C range.</p></div>		</li>
