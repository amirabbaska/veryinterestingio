			<div class="markdown"><p>You could make a serious drama about the glory part. In 1914, they initially went to war with the glory aspect front and center... which was SHATTERED on day one. The world had never seen such awful firepower until then. The Russo-Japanese war was a prelude, but nothing like this. I bet there could be some screenplay about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, the very concept of a &quot;glorious war&quot; is a myth, the product of effective propaganda.  In the face of front-line photography of its horrors, and soldiers who either died in massive numbers in attacks (e.g. the Somme) or who outright mutinied against their commanders (e.g. French army in 1917), and no clear moral imperative, it's no surprise that this ages-old propaganda machine faltered completely during WWI in the US, UK and France.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, I should probably have mentioned more clearly that I considered the idea of &quot;glory&quot; in a strictly narrative sense as we understand it from stories that conveniently leave out the horror and brutality of actual war. The truth is that both wars were horrific for the people involved, but with WW1 there wasn't even that convenient &quot;good vs evil&quot; narrative that could be spun to garner support, just rich people sending poor people to fight for their petty squabbles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The advent of the machine gun came along either right before or during WW1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Machine guns date back to at least as early as the civil war (eg. Gatling gun).  The development of the submachine gun dates to WW1.  The Tommy Gun (made famous by prohibition era gangsters) was originally intended as a &quot;trench broom&quot;.  You got up to the trench, and swept it to and fro, killing everyone in the trench.  It was not a weapon of gallantry, but of merciless slaughter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Machineguns firing black powder were pretty underwhelming outside of niche roles like close in defense for gunboats or whatever.  The invention of a practical smokeless powder in the 1880s transformed the machinegun from a gimmick into a serious military weapon.</p>
<p>The real technological killer on the WWI battlefield was artillery anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm bad with dates for stuff, so thanks for that; I knew that machine guns played a pretty big part in just how brutal the war was, and one of the main reasons for trench warfare's emergence. I just couldn't remember when the damn things were invented.</p></div>		</li>
