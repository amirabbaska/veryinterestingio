			<div class="markdown"><p>A great answer.  However, to expand on what /u/rantonels has written, nucleation can occur even if there are no (heterogeneous) nucleation sites, and no imposed shock to trigger the boiling.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Such unaided nucleation is called <em>homogeneous</em> nucleation, and is a result of random fluctuations in the arrangement of water molecules.  Nanoscale bubbles form spontaneously, but will collapse if the surface-to-volume ratio (which is inversely proportional to bubble diameter) is sufficiently large that the surface tension outweighs the forces caused by the vapor pressure.  The critical bubble size (i.e., the break-even point, at which the bubble is sufficiently large to not collapse) decreases with increasing temperature.  Thus, <a href="http://www.nist.gov/data/PDFfiles/jpcrd276.pdf" target="_blank">above 300^o C</a>, homogeneous nucleation of vapor bubbles will cause boiling to start spontaneously.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>To answer OP's question: these homogeneously nucleating bubbles would form randomly, anywhere within the volume of the water.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>In practice, if the water is heated within a container, the surface of the container (even if perfectly smooth) will provide a substrate for heterogeneous bubble nucleation (assuming the surface is not perfectly hydrophilic -- i.e., it has a non-zero contact angle), which occurs at lower superheating than does homogeneous nucleation.  Therefore, the bubbles will appear first on the interior surfaces of the container.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. Even if completely quiescent and pure, you cannot indefinitely heat a liquid. Practical factors also including natural convection not mentioned above will also reduce the superheat before boiling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microwave whatever (nonmetallic thing) you want. Just make sure you see it boiling. If you microwave it for the usual duration and it doesn't boil, poke it with a stick or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Provided you microwave it until homogeneous nucleation occurs, it's more or less safe, but you'd have to be very careful of steam burns when you opened it.  If you didn't wait long enough, you'd very likely cause the situation /u/rantonels presented (while you were holding the container).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hadn't thought about the effect of cosmic radiation on nucleation -- interesting!  Could be mitigated by shielding, as you suggest.  Another strategy might be to make the water volume sufficiently small that the probability of collision with a cosmic ray would be minimal on the time scale of the heating process.  I wasn't able to find any data on the magnitude of the cosmic ray flux in a cursory Google search, but from my recollection of the rate of appearance of tracks in cloud chambers, I would estimate the flux to be on the order of 10 s^-1 m^-2 .  So maybe a water volume smaller than a mL would circumvent this issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A similar thing can be done with water, but freezing it instead.</p>
<p>It also works with Mountain Dew (I think because of pressure). You forget it in the freezer for just a bit to long, but remember in time to be excited that it is not frozen yet, only to have it freeze all the way through before your tear strikin eyes as you open it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretend you took two bottles of mountain dew, and put them both in the freezer for just a bit too long, but remember in time to be excited that it's not frozen yet.</p>
<p>If you take one of them out really carefully, so that it doesn't freeze, then shake the other so that it freezes, and put both of them next to eachother at room temperature, would the unfrozen bottle warm up to a point where it would no longer be capable of freezing faster than the frozen bottle would thaw? It seems like it would, but that seems weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the non frozen bottle would be colder so absorb heat at a higher rate. Also it would have convection helping it as well.
by freezing the other bottle the change of state actually heats it up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume yes because the unfrozen bottle would begin to heat immediately but the frozen bottle would have to thaw the ice before it could begin to heat, which requires significantly more energy.</p></div>		</li>
