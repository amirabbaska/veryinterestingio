			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question - how are the study conclusions written?  They sometimes seem very reflective of the study contents, and sometimes not at all. </p>
<p>For instance, this conclusion:</p>
<p>&quot;Maternal pertussis vaccination is effective in preventing pertussis infection in infants aged &lt;8 weeks and may be considered in other countries experiencing high levels of pertussis notifications.&quot;</p>
<p>This was from a study performed on a sample size of ~100.  Considering the tiny sample and vastly different demographics between Wales and other geographies, the conclusions seems quite broad.  I do deployments of data science projects to business, and we would reprimand a data scientist for making conclusions like this as they are not supported by the work.</p>
<p>I've seen this elsewhere as well when reading medical studies - not all the time, but sometimes.  How does conclusion writing in medical studies work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There really isn't a standard for what goes into the abstract. Most people aren't going to read the whole study that you publish, just the abstract. Naturally the authors are going to their best to grab the attention  of the reader for more more publication/citations etc. Just like reading a book summary, a lot of context and buildup (the intro/methods) is naturally going to be left out because you only have 2-3 sentences to work with. I do agree with you that these conclusions don't seem generalizable based on the methods. But really to get the &quot;big picture&quot; idea, you have to read the paper. </p>
<p>For this particular study, the authors said in the discussion: &quot;The findings of this study should be generalizable to other high-income countries, where there have been increases in notified pertussis cases despite established vaccination programs.&quot; I'm reading this as the results are only contextual in similar countries to those in the UK. They make the generalization that the vaccine should be useful in those with higher prevalence of pertussis, but really should have elaborated more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Another question for you, or maybe more like a discussion topic I'd love your opinion on.</p>
<p>Sorry, this will require a bit of anecdote first:</p>
<p>We had a baby last year, and I was dreading the day I was going to have to go look through vaccine research, because I knew it was going to be a whole thing.  Long story short, it's easy to dismiss most antivax claims out of hand - conspiracy theory, hearsay, ad hominem, etc.  And indeed we concluded we should vaccinate our child.</p>
<p>However, one interesting thing I found when reading primary sources (medical studies) like those on AAP's &quot;Examine the Evidence&quot; website, was that public health policy is a fascinating and difficult topic.</p>
<p>This appears to be because you are working with people who are otherwise healthy at the time - it would be inhumane to do large-scale experimentation on healthy individuals, whereas the calculus seems different when studying the effect of an intervention on someone who is already sick.  Is that true?  Is the approach different for well-interventions vs. sick-interventions?  This is the one thing that gave me slight pause as I was researching the topic - it's easy to approach an intervention from the perspective of &quot;prove to me it's dangerous&quot; if you are treating an illness, whereas the calculus changes a bit to &quot;prove to me it's safe&quot; when treating someone who is currently healthy.  You're one step removed from illness in the case of vaccines, which means statistics and average outcomes, rather than individual outcomes, come into play.</p>
<p>This seems to lead to a strange paradox - the burden of proof for &quot;prove to me it's safe&quot; is very high, but it is difficult to do large-sample studies of interventions on people who are not sick.  Or, alternatively, it is inhumane to provide placebo of a life-saving intervention (like Polio vaccine 50 years ago) in order to create a control group.  Either way, it appears much health policy must be derived from many, smaller samples, lab work, biological understanding/mechanisms, and extrapolation from similar observation studies.</p>
<p>Is this true?</p>
<p>(Side note: this is why I became interested in study conclusions.  I also wonder if conclusions related to public-health recommendations must be fairly forceful because the general population is not really going to be able to digest a nuanced or couched conclusion, so the researcher must represent a conclusion that is in line with their general goals.  Is this true as well?)</p>
<p>Thanks!  It is very rare I get to ask these questions, as I don't meet many epidemiologists in my daily life!</p></div>		</li>
