			<div class="markdown"><p>I have taken 30 minute power naps for years. I used to have sleeping bags in my car so I could nap during lunch in my car. Now I work from home so I can do naps on my couch.</p>
<p>After a week or less, you can train your body to just... fall asleep. It takes me a couple minutes to fall asleep max. </p>
<p>You have to do a bit of planning. I make sure I have things that normally keep me up taken care of. So a fan is turned on, I have a face mask on, and my blanket is the right weight always before I lay down. Then, when I settle to sleep, nothing irritates me.</p>
<p>The power naps are awesome and highly recommended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recommend the Power Nap app that uses your phone's ability to detect movement. You can set it for a nap up to 20 minutes, up to 45 minutes, or up to 2 hours. It detects when you fall asleep and does an excellent job knowing when to wake you up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lay in bed or on your sofa after lunch, relax, close your eyes. If you don't fall asleep at least you are resting. 90% chances of falling sleep (I completely made that percentage up but somehow it works).
My father mastered it with the TV on and holding the remote control. </p>
<p>Spanish schedules are crazy, so no wonder people can easily fall asleep for a little time during lunchtime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually interesting in that I've often laid down for naps of this nature and it didn't feel like I feel asleep even though I actually had.  But even when I didn't fall asleep, it was still reasonably rejuvenating to, well, turn off for 20 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a foreign topic to me and I find it fascinating. People keep talking about a bower nap, whenever I try to take one in the middle of the day, for about an hour, it just completely screws me up, I find it so incredibly hard to wake up. However I can't say that I have tried the shorter versions. Although I suppose that it is a practice which one would need top get used to.</p></div>		</li>

But set the alarm clock because some years ago, after a night of wild party I got home at noon, went for a siesta and woke up the next day at 9am. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - super refreshing. I take one every day, set the alarm for 20 minutes, sleep VERY sound for 15 minutes and I'm good to go for the rest of the day! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The theory is that is you're napping for say an hour, you're entering deeper phases of sleep and probably also being woken up while in those deeper phases, which will generally leave you groggy.  Napping for 20 minutes, meanwhile, is long enough to be refreshing but not long enough to drop into deeper sleep, so getting back up is far less jarring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Severe, long-term, sleep deprivation along with long hours of physical work. That's how I manage it. Takes me 2 hours to fall asleep at home, 15-20 minutes to fall asleep on my break at work</p></div>		</li>
