<p>The difference is still noticeable though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a high quality version of this video, years ago. It's definitely going one at a time. That's why the 60,000 round per minute sounds like a higher tone. The 1,000,000 round or minute is actually 5 shots per barrel but it's so fast it just sounds like one shot.</p>
<p>The system is pretty amazing. Basically, several rounds can be loaded into the barrel at the same time. There are no shells, just a &quot;pack&quot; (for lack of a better word) of propellant attached to the back end of the bullet. An electric charge sets it off. It can fire as fast as the electric pulses will allow it to.</p>
<p>They have developed a pistol that can fire 3 or more shots before you feel a recoil so your 3 shots are dead on. It also has multiple barrels for different ammo types (lethal vs less than lethal). They've also developed this system into a grenade launcher. It can be for area denial in place of mines or it can be fitted to a UAV for very precise bombing with little collateral damage. It can even be fitted to a fire truck or helicopter when armed with canisters of some sort of fire suppressor. Like if a high floor of a high rise was on fire and hoses wouldn't reach it for a while.</p>
<p>Really cool shit, but I haven't checked on it for a while.</p></div>		</li>
