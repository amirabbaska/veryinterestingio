			<div class="markdown"><p>I think your google-foo has betrayed you here. </p>
<p>Either I am reading this wrong or you are cobbling together some information that is not related about something you don't really know the answer to.</p>
<p>Annealed glass is not &quot;bonded&quot;. Annealed glass is the process of bringing glass down from a very hot temperature though a stain point to a cool temperature without cracking. You would never use annealed glass on a car because annealed glass breaks into shards. Long pieces of glass that do a shit ton of cutting. Tempered glass on the other hand as I will explain is strained and when fractured breaks into a bazillion little pieces. This is both stronger and safer for most applications.</p>
<p>Tempered glass is forcing the glass though that strain point at high speed creating a &quot;strain&quot; on the glass either on the outside or on one side. This makes it more impact resistant if done correctly. The &quot;dots&quot; that I think you have confused here from some other bit of google work is when you look at &quot;tempered&quot; glass like automotive glass with either a polariscope or a set of polarized glasses. What you see is the stress in the glass as black and the non-stress as clear. If the glass was tempered with a matrix of air jets all the same distance apart you would end up with what looks like dots or a checkerboard pattern. </p>
<p>Tempered = Stressed glass cooled very quickly to induce strain so it shatters.</p>
<p>Annealed = Stress relieved glass so that it does not have stress in it. Think art work. </p>
<p>For fun: Borosilicate/Pyrex = Thermal Shock resistant - Does not crack or shatter under extreme fluctuations in temp. </p>
<p>So in short something about your information has gotten a bit sideways. The black strip around the glass on the outside of windshield and side doors is to i believe cover up where the window is sealed to the car itself. That way you don't see the uglyness though the glass from the outside. Glass is also pretty notorious for not allowing normal adhesives to stick to it. I believe they bake this coating on to give the sealant a place of purchase as well has hide the seal. It has nothing to do with annealing and you would not want annealed glass anywhere on a car that is for sure and for certain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are wrong in the fact of windshields not containing Annealed Glass, which 98% of them do.</p>
<p>Most conventional windshields are made from Laminated Glass (Safety Glass) which is two pieces of Annealed Glass bonded together with Acetate or Polyvinyl. Windshields will be Laminated, Side and Rears will be Tempered. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_glass" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_glass</a></p>
<p>That black strip you are talking about is called a molding fastener (striping) around the window, yes it holds the window in place. </p>
<p>You are right that adhesive doesn't like adhering to glass. Frits are those tiny little dots and plastic coating they put around the edge of your window and under you rear view mount so adhesive sticks to the windshield for installation and mounting purposes. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stand corrected as well. Thanks for the clarification on the windshield. You are technically correct which is the best kind of correct. The idea that annealed glass is in that windshield really freaks me out but seeing how they have the lamination....man the idea still just gives me the heebee jeebees.</p>
<p>Got schooled, live and learn. Thanks have a good one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Front windshields are made from annealed glass, it does break into big pieces but you only see cracks because the windshield is made from two pieces of glass that are laminated together with a plastic sheet, this keeps the pieces from falling out. If your windshield was tempered and a rock hit it it would shatter into millions of tiny fragments that all stuck to the lamination and you would be blinded making the car undrivable, it would also break a lot more. Tempered glass is strong to impacts of a large surface area but are weak to impacts with a very small point, like a rock's sharp edge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some cars also have small defroster wires under the resting spot of the wipers. I think they are common on Subaru, and maybe some German cars too.</p>
<p>Another wires maybe a radio antenna embedded into the windshield. But those are usually hidden with the rear window defroster wires.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roger that. I was incorrect as well it seems. The windshield is a beast all of it's own.</p></div>		</li>
