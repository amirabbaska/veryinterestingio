For example (until I call your attention to it) you're not aware of the sensation of your clothes against your skin for more than a moment after you put them on. Your brain doesn't have resources to consciously process the tremendous volume if sensory info coming in so things like &quot;thigh feels denim, thigh feels denim, thigh feels denim...&quot; get flagged as low priority and filtered out pretty fast.</p></div>		</li>
