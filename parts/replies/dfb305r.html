<p>I've done the same thing since I was a child.  I really try not to anymore, but I have no idea if I do it while I'm sleeping. Could explain why I had such terrible sleep for all of my life.  I could sleep for 8 1/2 hours and still feel like I hadn't slept at all when I woke up. </p>
<p>I take over the counter sleep aids now, and seem to be getting better sleep. Sometimes I still have bad nights though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely do the same thing throughout the day, but have only been diagnosed with the traditional sleep apnea. I didn't even know it had a name! Thank you for enlightening me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it's a more specific facet of the apnea disorder so it has a more specific name, but most doctors don't even know the difference or the alternative name. One of those things that doesn't really do much harm if overlooked. Did you have a sleep study done to get diagnosed?</p></div>		</li>
