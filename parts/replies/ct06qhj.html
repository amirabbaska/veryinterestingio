			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I didn't even mention the cost. But it would be ridiculous since you'd be sending a team of people out to collect the blood from one cadaver. Tissue is worth it because it can be processed and can be stored long term- muscoloskeletal tissue can be kept in freezers for 5 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for someone in the organ industry: is it true that donated organs are sold for profit? </p>
<p>I'm an organ donor and I'm now wishing I wasn't because of this. I don't mind covering costs, but I don't like the idea of something I'm giving away in good will funding some CEO's yacht, or that extra cost putting the organ out of someone's ability to pay. Doubly so for tissue used in non-restorative cosmetic procedures (face lifts, etc.).</p>
<p>My wife won't donate blood locally because of this, as the only place who does donations is a for-profit corporation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work more in the tissue arena, so I'll explain organ the best way I can. No. Organs are not sold for profit. It's illegal. It's also illegal to pay anyone to donate theirs or their loved ones organs. Actually, once a person is declared an organ donor (remember they're still breathing on a ventilator) my type of company would cover the rest of their medical costs until the organ recovery occurs. What patients are paying for are the transplant surgery, not the organ itself. And then there is a lot with Medicare and Medicaid. I know it's vague, but that's the best I can explain it.</p>
<p><em>Sigh</em> Tissue donation and &quot;for profits&quot; and &quot;not for profits.&quot; So, what Tissue Banks do is collect tissues from donors. Processors then turn that tissue into a medical treatment and distribute it to surgeons. It's seen as a medical treatment, like a drug, and that's why we're regulated by the CDC. That being said, for profit and non for profit are largely tax statuses. What For Profit companies do with their money is research- human tissue isn't the only thing they supply and they make other medical products and treatments. Most Non Profit processors have for profit subsidiaries to help fund their other research.  So, when you hear &quot;For Profit&quot; it just means that that company is publicly traded. </p>
<p>That's as much as I can get into that without totally messing something up. I'm sure there are people out there who can lay it out much better than I can. </p>
<p>It's always good to be an organ donor. You can save a life, or seven, and that's worth everything to me, even on the days when I'm tired, feel overworked and underpaid and hate my job--everyone has those. And if you're a tissue donor, you can help up to 70 people or more over the course of several years!</p>
<p>What I'll say that will make you feel better is that you have more control than you think you do. Instead of just registering through the DMV, register online, you can make very specific requests that would have to be honored. Such as: you can specify that your tissue is only used for not for profit; you can restrict it from being used for certain procedures; you can ask that it isn't distributed internationally; you can make us play your favorite music during the recovery. It's all legally binding stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Making sure that my various body parts can be put to good use when I die is very important to me. Frankly, my surviving relatives are likely to hamper that goal. What, if anything, can I do now to pave the way for easy collection when I die? I've already signed up for donation at the DMV, is there anything else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make it clear what you would like in a living will. Also, if you think your family won't carry out your wishes, assign someone else as your Direct Power of Attorney. Also, sign up online, too. You can make specific requests. Consent laws different in each state. If you'd like to know how it work in your state, look up the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. In most places your DMV registration is legally binding for all organs, tissues, and eyes and we would just have to disclose your designation to your family, and then get the DRAI from anyone. But in some states, we need to have consent from your Next of Kin or DPOA.</p></div>		</li>
