			<div class="markdown"><p>Ethereum is like bitcoin in that it is a distributed network that builds a single version of history using a lottery called mining with a currency generated by the system itself.</p>
<p>However as well as allowing people to send and receive this currency it also allows people to send transactions that contain little computer programs. These programs are checked against the rules of the system that ethereum has and stored in its ledger. Other transactions can also contain data that calls these programs again following the rules of the system that all the software clients enforce. </p>
<p>These programs can do any computation that a normal computer could do although they are limited in how they can interact with the outside world and each other since they are not run on a single computer but on many computers with the exact same outcome and they are not allowed to modify the values of other programs, only call the other programs passing along data.</p>
<p>When you call these programs you can send currency to them and they can send the currency to any other account including to other programs or they can hang onto the currency for specific conditions. It all depends on how they are written. </p>
<p>Because these programs handle currency they are a bit like financial contracts but unlike financial contracts they carry out the contract rather than just specifying it.</p>
<p>These contracts because they can be written to do any computation can also be in and of themselves new currencies (by keeping a record of balances associate with accounts) or they can interact with other contracts to implement things like exchanges between these currencies or games, really anything.</p>
<p>Of course since this is going on across thousands of computers its a lot more expensive than running on a single computer. You are trading off the assurance that the contract will run the way you want for cost.</p>
<p>Each instruction that a program runs has an associated cost called gas. Blocks of transactions are limited in how much gas is allowed and when transactions are sent you specify how much you will pay for the gas you use and if its not enough the miners will simply ignore it. That way people cant just spam messages to the point where miners find it too difficult to keep up. At least if the gas prices are a match for the computing and storage costs. </p>
<p>Here is a list of some of the applications people are building on top of this system: <a href="http://dapps.ethercasts.com/" target="_blank">http://dapps.ethercasts.com/</a></p>
<p>Be warned though anyone can participate including scammers or people who are bad at writing programs that are secure. </p></div>		</li>
