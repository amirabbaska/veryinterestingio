			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct! Each cell line has a due date (apoptosis). For example, when a cell starts to lose membrane integrity it sends out signals to be replaced. Our immune system may help break a cell apart so it can be removed from the body via the spleen. Part of human feces is simply discarded cells. Some of the longest living cells are neurons and myocardial (heart muscle) cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this, and to add on a little bit. </p>
<p>So I've heard the 7 years thing before and I don't understand it. The average span of a cells life is actually less than a day. But we do have cells that never replicate themselves, and just keep chugging away until the body itself dies. Like you mentioned above neurons are one type of cell that's like this, other cells include your cardiac muscle in your heart...an area of your body that can't afford to be under construction very often. </p>
<p>Then there are other cells that do the complete opposite. Cells that are short lived and serve a very specialized function like cells involved in your immune system. Sometimes these cells only live for hours. </p>
<p>So there's really no switch in the human body that says every 7 years we have to replace all our cells. That would require a crazy amount of energy and communication. All cells in your body are specialized to perform specific functions, and with this their lifespans are specialized as well. </p>

<p>This is SOOO wrong. The average span of a cell’s life is completely dependent on the cell type and tissue it comes from. Small intestine epithelial cell’s live 2-4 days on average. Neutrophils live 1-5 days. Lung alveolar cell’s live 8 days. Intestinal paneth cell’s live 20 days. Bone osteoclasts live 2 weeks, while osteoblasts live 3 months. Adipocytes live 8 years. Neurons in the CNS last a lifetime. Lens cells last a lifetime. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like I stated in my comment, every cell is specialized and with that means that every cells life span is specialized. I never said that all cells live less than a day, just the average. So in short I agree with you...and never really disagreed. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Incorrect. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_neurogenesis" target="_blank">Neurogenesis (generating new neurons) continues into adulthood in at least a few areas of the brain</a>. Additionally, while skeletal muscles (which is what I assume you are talking about) lose the ability to divide in adulthood, new cells are added from special satellite and stem cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurogenesis continues, but many of the ones you are born with will remain. We really don't understand very much about neurogenesis into adulthood. It's clear that some parts of the brain have a lot of neurogenesis (SVZ and dental gurus). Other parts may be able to respond plastically in response to stress or damage, though unfortunately glial scarring is more widespread. The adult human brain is not good at responding to injury which is consistent with the idea that many of the cells are not replaced. Similarly, the ascending and descending neurons of the spinal cord are not readily replaced once damaged leading to paralysis. It is not at all clear that our sensory and motor neurons are replaced during our lifetimes, though it would be hard to rule it out entirely.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the neurogenesis of the Prefrontal Cortex and other areas of the frontal lobe? This seems to be one of the most important area’s in the brain for general intelligence. Besides that, it is located in the most vulnerable part of the skull: the front. If this part is unaffected by neurogenesis, ánd super vulnerable, that would equal quite poor design right? </p></div>		</li>
