			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. It’s true. Once blood has dried it’s not at all easy to remove from skin - at least not without soap of some sort, and elbow grease. Doubly so for thicker, more creased, dry, or textured skin like on the fingers. Obviously it’s just on the surface and doesn’t penetrate like ink can, but dried blood clings like a mofo. </p></div>		</li>
