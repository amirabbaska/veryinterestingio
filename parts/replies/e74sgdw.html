			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally got screwed over by brain this last weekend. Was at a music recital (very prominent classical musician) and had to go pee during intermission. I managed to get there first, while a line grew quickly for the small double stalled bathroom. I stood there for at least 2 minutes trying my best to piss, even went as far as flushing a couple of times and nothing. So back at the performance is a battle between trying to enjoy this beautiful music and trying not to piss myself. She finishes and I cant even stand up straight to applause, I just book it to the bathroom. Luckily I both made it there in time and back just in time for her double encore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find for me what works is I say to my self mentally that I am not leaving this bathroom until I pee. I don't care how many people there are, I don't care how long they have to wait, I don't care wait they think of me. I am not leaving this bathroom until I pee. That usually gets things going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have like a mild case of IBS (or something, never went to the doctor with it and I'm fine now). Like a fucking clock work, half way through a meal I would have to fucking run to the toilet to take a shit, but only when I was near a toilet. If no toilet was near, my stomach would get upset, and I would look for a toilet, but if I didn't find one, I would be okay without. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same sort of thing but it's always right before bed. Like as soon as I think &quot;ok time to get to bed&quot; it's like my body goes &quot;oh? Ok time to pee first then.&quot; Humans are a really weird species XD</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My gf always ALWAYS has to run out of the room and pee before sex. If she even thinks I'm thinking about fucking her she runs to the bathroom (too pee / prepare, whatever that entails, not to escape lol). Honestly it's a turn-off. Not bc I care about pee but because every time I'm feeling frisky it's like her alarm goes off and she flees the scene; somehow this is supposed to be helpful?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny how we can train (and untrain) ourselves.</p>
<p>When I've had to take a dump, it used to be that the urge subsided or even went completely away if I knew I was nowhere near a restroom.  Then, many years ago, there was an occasion where our toilet was out of commission and I had to go outside.  I took a big plastic shopping bag, put some loose toilet paper in it, and pooped into it in my back yard (it was totally surrounded by high bamboo, I had privacy.)</p>
<p>Ever since then, my urge to poop doesn't go away when there's no bathroom near.  I'll catch myself looking around for places I could hide to poop outdoors.  Even though I only broke my training to always go in a toilet once by necessity, my body thinks it's A-OK to poop outdoors now.</p></div>		</li>
