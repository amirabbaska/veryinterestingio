			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mostly right. The thing you're forgetting is <em>how</em> water moves through soil. In instances where you have a change from small to large pores (like the tunnels and chambers of a colony) the soil matric potential; ability of soil to retain water due to capillary action; prevents flooding until the pressure of water above the tunnel is greater than soil matric potential, at which point the tunnel floods rapidly. Even in heavy downpours it is hard to achieve saturated conditions throughout the soil profile, due to adequate soil drainage, and as a result, the tunnels would be dry spots as water is directed elsewhere. /u/nanogoose, you should read this part as well. For those interested in more soil facts, and discussion, /r/soil is a thing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in suburban Southern California, where Argentine ants have displaced nearly all the other species. I’m not an entomologist, so at most I can add an asterisk to what /u/Nerfherdin wrote. These damn ants will pick up and move when it rains. Or when the sprinklers go off. Or when Mrs. Simonitch waters her camellias.</p>
<p>I haven’t been watering my lawn, because of the drought, so now when we do get a shower there’s ants streaming all over the place carrying eggs and ottomans and tiny little suitcases and looking for higher ground. I have to keep a 12” chemical no-go zone around every crawlspace vent and foundation crack and even the doors and windows, or they’ll move their nest under my house and then I’ll have to crawl under there and hunt around for them and douse them with pesticide. It’s dirty, and dark, which makes it very difficult to spot them, and there’s spider webs, and there’s about 18” of clearance in the best places, with some tight squeezes that make the human birth canal look commodious. It’s either that or pay some Pest Control Specialist to soak the earth with gallons of pyrethrins. Which I’d do, only I actually like 99% of the other species of insect that live on my property.</p>
<p>I’m sure in their native clime, there’s a rainy season. Picking up stakes with the first rain, even if it poses no immediate threat to their happy home, means they’ll be better situated when it rains for forty days and forty nights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>napalm is self oxidising cover it with wet sand and a fire blanket and it'll still burn until it runs out of fuel. Sticky and flammable is fun, and very useful for Molotov cocktail style politics and other light entertainment - but it ain't napalm.</p>
<p>Key note kids, a Molotov cocktail made with booze and a rag will be highly disappointing. A good squirt of detergent shaken through and now it's more like the movies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After one of the recent downpours in Texas, I opened my mailbox to find: mail, larger ants with piles of larvae, tiny black ants dashing around at full speed, several large spiders (one squished/smeared on mail, presumably when the carrier flung it into the box from a safe distance), small spiders, and a few lizards. It had become a wild kingdom flooding displacement camp overnight. </p>
<p>Our disturbingly well-established fire ant mound in the back didn't seem bothered at all, unfortunately.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a great visual example of just how deep ant mounds actually are, you can go on YouTube or google and search for &quot;aluminum casting anthills&quot; or a similar search. People pour molten aluminum into fire ant mounds and then dig out the castings after it has solidified. </p></div>		</li>
