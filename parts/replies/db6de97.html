			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I really haven't. But, I generally have a hard time sleeping in a public place like that. I'm too uptight to relax in public...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah ok, I'm the exact opposite. I fall asleep pretty fast on public transport. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, I'm so afraid to miss my station or stop that I just can't sleep. As for the alarm either I wake up when it ring or, <del>often</del> sometimes I sleep trough it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, I will wake up before train stops (my speculation being subconscious pattern recognition but that's not my point) pretty easily, and not every day or even that often, but on occasion, I'll recognize it's time to wake up right before an alarm goes off, especially if I fall asleep knowing and thinking about how I have to wake up in x hours to do y. It's definitely not just coincidence, I usually sleep through my actual alarms, and will sleep as late as I can. If I wake up &quot;early&quot; it's almost always right at my alarm, and it's not so early</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with me. It didn't start happening until I started using alarms. It leaves me with the impression that my utter disdain for being woken up by an obnoxious blaring noise motivates some part of me to wake up so I can deactivate the damn thing before it goes off. If I do that for about a week and it's always the same time, I often don't need an alarm to wake up at that point so long as I repeat to myself to wake up at that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a parent and doctor, I'll tell you it's because of the change in acceleration. I can drive my sleeping kids on the interstate for hours but the second I decelerate the kids wake up. Likely a combination of change in white noise from road and slight backward force into the seat as you drive at speed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not every night but this happens to me all the time if I have something on the next day.  If I don't have something on during the day I will sleep in till 10 but if I have to get up at 7 I will more than likely wake up at 10 to 7 or something like that.  Its been happening to me since school and it has always pissed me off as I want that extra 10 mins.  I still set my alarm though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am like that a lot apart from 1 novelty alarm my dad bought me. <a href="http://thumbs.worthpoint.com/zoom/images1/1/0214/02/vintage-felix-cat-alarm-clock-trumpet_1_414e3eebc9deb4ff86bd91d567bb476e.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> motherfucker right here. Mine has a different clock face and they come with different tunes.</p>
<p>So the one I have is <em>REALLY FUCKING LOUD</em>. It's also very sudden. It's also high tempo. So when it goes off it's like someone is suddenly shaking you. Every morning.</p>
<p>After a week I started to wake up 5 to 10 minutes before it would go off. Just naturally my body would do that. So I then get up and switch it off before it gets a chance to have it's way with me.</p></div>		</li>
