			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Probably more diversity than mammals, but not animals in general.  (Comparing dinosaurs to insects, fish, mammals, jellyfish, etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As much as I am a big fan of dinosaurs, I would still err against saying they have more diversity than Eutherian placental mammals. There are very large niches that Dinosaurs left almost entirely unoccupied that mammals have not, the biggest example are marine environments, no dinosaur has ever evolved the extreme adaptions for aquatic life that you see in cetaceans, Hesperornithes and probably penguins came the closest but they were and are still tied to the land for reproduction, and generally don't or didn't occupy as many marine niches as the variety of aquatic mammals like Sea cows, Pinnipeds and Cetaceans have. Of course if you divide birds from dinosaurs for whatever reasons then Dinosaurs' aversion to water seems even more pronounced.</p>
<p>They also haven't gotten close to mammal's (and various types of reptiles) ability to exploit fossorial environments, I can't think of anything close to a bird or Dinosaur mole. Underground environments are a huge niche long exploited by mammals but the best I can think of for birds and dinos might be something like Oryctodromeus, Alvarezsaurs or borrowing owls.</p></div>		</li>
