			<div class="markdown"><p>-ite latin means &quot;Something associated with a group of people/place/religion/etc...&quot;.
Like -ese, but doesn't have to mean that you &quot;are&quot; from there, but that you had some kind of relationship with the place.
A lot of minerals end with -ite for the place they were first found or used.</p></div>		</li>
