			<div class="markdown"><p>Antennas are just metallic conductors of a shape and size which resonates with electromagnetic waves of a certain frequency. Detectors have other physical effects in play, such as electron-hole production in semiconductors. </p>
<p>Detecting radio waves has a lot of differences from detecting light waves because the latter has such high frequencies that electrons in metals face very high resistance. Semiconductors are more efficient than tiny antennas because they amplify a single photon into a large current.</p></div>		</li>
