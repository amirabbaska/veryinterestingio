			<div class="markdown"><p>Goddamnit man. You broke the pattern!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If they don't go back first, they go feet first. Both for several reasons.</p>
<p>1) Out of the water, the tank is heavy. Imagine doing a belly flop while wearing a backpack full of cinder blocks. You hit the water, then the pack hits you. Ouch.</p>
<p>2) Hitting the water face first means you get the mask smacked into your face. Ouch again.</p>
<p>3)Some kinds of SCUBA gear will have bits extending behind your head. Going face first means you have a good chance of smacking the back of your head on them. <del>Not fun.</del> <strong>Ouch x3</strong></p>
<p>4)When you hit the water, you are less concerned about landing on the guy that is already in the water than you are about the next guy in line landing on you. Going back first means you can see what's going on above you and move if needed. <strong>If you don't, they can land on you. Ouch x4</strong></p>
<p>5)Lastly, sometimes shit happens and you need to quickly ditch your gear. If you are face down, you have to get out from under the stuff after you undo the buckles, risking getting something getting caught in a stray loop. Face up means everything is below you, thus much less risk of getting snagged. <strong>This can lead to drowning.  Ouch x5</strong></p>

<p>Also, we can generalize the Ouch Formula by calling the paragraph number N and the number of Ouches (N-1).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgot one - out of the boat, if you have short legs or don't step far enough, that tank hits the side of the boat and one of two things happen; tank cracks you in the back of the head as you topple forward, flipping into the water unconscious, or you damage the boat and the captain abandons you during your dive for the dick move. Either one is undesirable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An easy experiment to see this in action is put on a heavy loaded backpack and some sweet sunglasses then stand on the foot of your bed and flop on in. You will most likely take it sideways or anyway not to get your back snapped in half or your sunglasses smashed into your face. </p></div>		</li>
