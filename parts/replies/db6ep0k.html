			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its because your brain is kind of &quot;on edge&quot; and knows you've set an alarm so won't fully relax and let you sleep too long? When it's literally right before I think your body detects a change from the clock about to go off, a click or something? This is because I used to have a phone that I ALWAYS picked it up just before I got a text through (pre smart phone days so I wasn't constantly holding it) and I think that was because something around it changed and I knew!!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you detected the electromagnetic waves or something. Back in the days phones emitted huge amounts of these compared to nowadays (which is also the reason you could hear interference in speakers and such shortly before a message which you rarely hear today).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happens to me quite a bit. I'm starting to think that maybe you like kinda wake up several times leading up to it, look at your clock and immediately go back to sleep, then just don't remember that you had woken up those times.</p></div>		</li>
