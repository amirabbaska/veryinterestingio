			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>NPC Behavior/Patrols:</strong> Take the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, for example.  The guards go on patrol, when they see you, they go into high alert, then regular alert, then back to normal.  This is likely what is known as a &quot;finite state machine,&quot; which is a system in which an agent knows what state it's in, what possible states to which it can transition, and the conditions under which it does so.  It's actually pretty simple.  the start state can be &quot;patrol,&quot; the transition criteria could be &quot;Snake enters line of sight...&quot; I think you get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>Content Generation:</strong> There is a genre of games known as &quot;Rogue-likes.&quot;  They are dungeon-crawling type RPGs where you won't run into the same experience twice because the dungeon is procedurally generated every time you play it.  I'm drawing a blank on well-known examples, here, but &quot;Risk of Rain&quot; and &quot;Faster Than Light&quot; come to mind.  There are a number of ways to do this.  I once wrote a content generation engine for a very simple physics puzzle-type game where I used known &quot;good&quot; puzzles as &quot;training data,&quot; came up with a generalized average of their features, introduced some Gaussian (normal distribution for variation) &quot;noise.&quot;  Then, you need a &quot;fitness function.&quot;  This is just a check that the level/puzzle you've generated is solvable.  In my game, I simulated every possible move at the start to guarantee that the level could be beaten.  If there's no solution, calculate again (this is why the Gaussian noise is important).  I got an A-.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine is doing his thesis on procedurally-generated &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; levels.  Basically, he takes every level in the original Mario (that isn't underground, under water, or in a castle), discretizes the level into &quot;cells,&quot; looks at what's in the bottom left 3 cells and using the non-corner ones, looks at the &quot;training&quot; data (the existing levels) to determine what is most likely to fill that fourth cell.  From that starting point, the process continues until an entire level is generated.  I asked about his fitness function and he said he doesn't have one.  It's still early in the project :-)</p>
<p>This process is non-deterministic in that you can run it several times and get different levels.</p>
<p>The technique used is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain" target="_blank">Markov Chaining</a>, and it has a ton of awesome practical applications.</p>
<p><strong>Skyrim's &quot;Radiant&quot; AI:</strong>  This one was touted as revolutionary, but I'm not super impressed.  If you're familiar with Skyrim, you know that you can never truly be &quot;finished&quot; with Skyrim, thanks to &quot;Radiant&quot; quests.  Even if you do every single NPC's side quests, you still get &quot;Radiant&quot; quests.  This is when you get a letter from the courier that says something along the lines of, &quot;You made quiet a stir when you used your Thu'um at (some place).  If you go to (some other place) you can find a word of power. -A Friend.&quot;  There are other examples.  The side jobs for the thieves' guild do this, and &quot;Fetch Me That Book&quot; in the College of Winterhold does this as well.  I've never done the companion's quest line, so I don't know how it is with them, but I assume they have some.</p>
<p>Honestly, the reason I'm not totally impressed with these is that they feel like quest mad-libs.  &quot;Hey, [hero name], go to [some place] and [fetch/kill/escort] my [item/person/person].&quot;  Notice you always get these instructions in a letter or scroll or something because they can't have the voice actors say every conceivable quest option.  The more impressive part is that they use (I'm assuming) a statistical model of your play style to generate the type of quests you would likely enjoy.  They (I assume) take into account things like what factions you belong to and how far you are in them, your skills, quests you've completed in the past.  Eg. you have high sneak and are very advanced in the thieves' guild line, you get a quest to steal something.</p>
<p><strong>Terrain Generation:</strong>  This isn't exactly AI, but I'll talk about it.  Take &quot;Skyrim&quot; again.  The level has a vast terrain with mountains and trees and bushes.  Most likely (a lot of what I'm saying about specific games is intuition, educated guesses, and what I would do if it were up to me), a person did not place every tree, mountain, bush, etc, by hand.  Most likely, they used fractal geometry with some randomness built-in to give realistic variation.  Certainly, some things were placed by hand, like High Hrothgar, but for general mountain ranges, the designer can say, &quot;I want a mountain range here,&quot; run their fractal simulation, take a look at the result, and tweak it as needed.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal" target="_blank">Fractals</a> are shapes that repeat infinitely, smaller and smaller.  This is a really glib explanation, but the question was about AI and fractals could be their own post.  They work well for designing stuff like mountains and rivers because mountains and coastlines tend to look very much like fractals in real life.</p>

<p><strong>First Person Shooters:</strong> I talked about &quot;solved&quot; games before.  First person shooters are considered &quot;solved.&quot;  If you're a dude approaching 30 with an 11 year old Steam account, surely you've played Counterstrike, and if you've played Counterstrike, you've likely been the victim of an aimbot.  It's really easy to compute the line between the end of your gun and an enemy's head and pull the trigger.  The processor has better reflexes than a human.</p>
<p>&quot;So, why don't I always lose when playing the campaign mode in an FPS game?&quot;</p>
<p>Because that would suck to play.  The developers introduce &quot;artificial stupidity.&quot;  They make it so the enemies sometimes miss or don't know where you are.</p>
<p><strong>RTS Games:</strong> RTS AI is actually pretty bad, as things go.  My AI teacher would say this, and he'd say that human players can easily beat even the best commercially-available RTS AI.  I always got sad when I heard this, because I really suck at RTS games and struggle to beat the &quot;Easy&quot; difficulty in 1 on 1 Warcraft 3 in Booty Bay, and even then my strategy is just to get the goldmines on the islands in the north and wait until the opponent runs out of resources while building a crapload of towers.  Still, it's an open problem.  They are not solved, nor are they on the verge of being solved.</p>
<p>Contrast that with chess.  Scientists successfully made an agent that beat the person recognized as the world's greatest player in chess.  No one has made an agent that can beat the world's best players in Starcraft.</p>
<p>Another colleague does his research on this and he enters his agents in conferences and competitions and does pretty well against other agents.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Oh, I forgot: The AI in RTS cheats like hell.  Usually, they are immune to &quot;fog of war&quot; and can see everything you're doing the whole game.  One game (I want to say Starcraft) would see you the whole game, but send a scout to give the illusion that they are doing recon legitimately.  Most RTS AI will also use a finite state machine like I mentioned before, where the states might be &quot;building,&quot; &quot;defending,&quot; &quot;attacking,&quot; &quot;raising an army,&quot; etc.  Maybe they are in the &quot;building&quot; state until they have barracks built, at which point they transition to &quot;raising an army.&quot;  Once they have 15 units or something, they can go into &quot;attacking.&quot;  </p>
<p>So, that's everything I can think of off of the top of my head, but there's way more.  If you have other questions, or if you think I missed something, or if you want a more in-depth explanation of something I said or was hand-wavy about, go ahead and reply.  I love this stuff and I could talk about it all day, and my ADHD medicine is totally kicking in.</p>
<p>Obligatory credentials:  BS in computer science, MS in computer science, working on PhD in computer science, university teaching assistant/researcher in computer science, had a game I helped make accepted to an international conference and the corresponding paper is published in the ACM proceedings.  Don't want to prove them because posting a picture of my MS diploma would be really weird, so believe me or not.  Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Thanks for the gold, stranger.  Learn computer science, it's stupid-lucrative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know I'm late here, but I would like to point out that not all FPS games are &quot;solved&quot;. Any game where the projectile moves slow enough that a player's direction influence can change so so avoid the projectile isn't solved. This is really obvious in tribes where even the best aimbots are pretty much never going to blue plate a pathfinder, because pathfinders are constantly changing  their x,y, and z velocity and position in hard to predict ways. Good players have a better shot than aimbots since they can predict several seconds out and make a prediction as to where the pathfinder is going to go based on how optimal the terrain is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, thanks for two incredible posts. I never got to take any AI courses in college and this makes me wish that I did. Can you comment a bit more on turn based strategy game AI? I'm a huge Civ fanatic, but have generally been disappointed with the AI. The combat system in Civ 5 specifically seems to have chess-level potential for complexity. How do you think they handle it? How would you approach/improve that type of AI problem? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they did a good job with AI in the L4D series. The AI you mention is called <a href="http://left4dead.wikia.com/wiki/The_Director" target="_blank">The Director</a>, and it generally does a good job of ensuring gameplay is balanced.</p>
<p>In L4D2, the director has certain rules and opportunities for altering the game. It can open or close routes through the map, which adds randomness to well designed maps. It's also pretty good at spawning mobs. One problem I've seen in other games is in how mobs magically appear out of thing air. L4D2 generally spawns them out of sight.</p>
<p>L4D4 still has the magical clown car problem, where you exit an empty room, and moment later an infected horde emerges from that very same room. Overall though, the effect works so long as you're not doing too much backtracking. Special infected are pretty good in the way most of them will use their attack and will then attempt to evade the player until their attack is ready to be used. Normal infected can take some interesting paths to the player, which adds a bit of authenticity to the experience. Another nice touch is in how the infected will sometimes be seen fighting amongst themselves. The design of the special infected also discourages players from camping or relying on bottlenecks where the infected can easily be cut down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the information!  Definitely going to check out The Imitation Game.
Also,  387,420,489 ways it can play out?  That's insane.  I &quot;solved&quot; tic tac toe in my steamed up bathroom mirror when I was like 8.  The first player goes in the middle and then ties if the next move is in a corner, and wins if it's not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>387,420,489 ways is an overestimation, but with complexity analysis, you want to guess something worse than the actual outcome.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in reality, it isn't really that high, because the first player <em>really</em> has 3 choices: a corner, the center, or an edge.  It doesn't matter on the first move whether which corner you choose or which edge you choose, just that you choose an edge or a corner.</p>
<p>But here's how I got it:</p>
<p>Assuming there are 9 spaces and you can put your x in any of them, there are 9 possible results from the first move.  In reality, the next player only has 8 choices, then you have 7, then 6, etc, and you will most likely not fill in the entire thing if you win.  When you do these computations for complexity analysis, you use the worst case, which is a branching factor of 9 and a maximum of 9 turns, so assuming 9 choices at each turn (which is unrealistic), it's 9^9.  More precisely, it's actually 9! (read: 9 factorial, but it's fun to shout &quot;NINE!&quot; in math class when it comes up), which is 362880 and orders of magnitude smaller than 9^9,</p>
<p>But in computer science we could say that n! = O(n^n )</p>
<p>Still, for such a stupid game, that's huge.</p></div>		</li>
