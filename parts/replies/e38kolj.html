<p>Bigger lions would require more food for more energy and the ecology wouldn't be able to support that after a while. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Put more simply, eventually the lions would get so big that they would starve, which means that evolution favours lions that aren't too big. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact : Tigons and Ligers lack the genetic trigger that would make them stop growing when they reach adulthood, and continue to grow until death. They most commonly die from organ failure because their hearts are not able to pump enough blood.</p>
<p>Edit : Ok, just Ligers. Sorry </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on animal and environment. You would be right for lions. There were closely related (to us) hominids in Africa that died out for the same reason fairly recently.</p>
<p>Edit: the large African hominin claim is apparently no longer considered to be correct. I &quot;learned&quot; this on an at-the-time reliable documentary from Nat. Geo. in the mid-90s, but it seems that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganthropus#Extreme_claims" target="_blank">Meganthropus</a> is now thought to have been of modest height with unusually well-developed jaws, rather than being a giant with normal jaws. The article notes that such speculation was common during the time period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s all sorts of min/max pressures going on, nobody can say the true cause and in reality it’s probably a little bit of each. Larger animals require more food to grow and maintain, they produce more heat, their bones and muscles need to be more robust, they still need to be fast and nimble enough to catch their prey, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but most lions have places on their body you can install heat sinks now, to avoid this.  For some reason liquid cooling hasn't really caught on in the lion overclocking community, but I remain hopeful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is believed to be the reason Neanderthals failed to thrive as homosapiens did. Larger body mass means more food needed. Soon as times got tough they couldn't keep up with us. That and many other factors but still a big one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great clarification. It's always frustrated me when people say things like &quot;Survival of the fittest is clearly bullshit. Look at the people that are succeeding now adays.&quot; (An actual thing someone has said to me)</p>
<p>It made me realize they don't truly understand what it means. Like you said, it's definitely not just the strongest. It's the creature best suited for their environment in full.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even that isn't quite accurate. Evolution does not give a fuck if you survive, it cares if you reproduce.</p>
<p>So its really not the strongest, or best suited to the environment, ita the best suited to procreate. Being strong or auitee to the environment are very good strategies to attain that, but not the only strategies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I liked how John Green pointed out to me that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; was not the term Darwin used. Darwin said &quot;natural selection&quot;. A later author coined &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;. Furthermore, I have heard it from the same source that an even better phrase than &quot;natural selection&quot; might be &quot;non-random elimination&quot;. Less beneficial traits for a particular organism in a particular niche stop getting passed on after a time.</p>

If it's merely &quot;good enough&quot; the trait might still exist but will be hard to see amongst the billions of individuals that have the slightly better trait.</p></div>		</li>
