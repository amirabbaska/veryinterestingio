			<div class="markdown"><p>We really don't know. All of the data we have suggests that it's flat (therefore infinite), but there's a fair amount of uncertainty in those measurements. As I recall, the current lower boundary on the size is something on the order of 180 billion light years. Tl;Dr, we need more data. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About the infiniteness of the universe, what I remember from an astrophysics class I took in college is not that there is necessarily infinite space in all directions, but that there's a perceived infinity with the universe not having an edge or a centre, but it just kind of looping around itself (in that if you just go forever in one direction you'd eventually get back to where you started, but from the othrt side).</p>
<p>How correct is this image? I distinctly remember the professor making an analogy with the surface of a hypersphere, but I never heard anything about it in these terms since, so I wonder if I understood it wrong back then, or if the professor was wrong, or if the understanding changed since then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kinda out of date. Basically, the universe can have negative curvature (&quot;spherical&quot;), no curvature (&quot;flat&quot;), or positive curvature (&quot;hyperbolic&quot;). Hyperbolic &amp; flat universes are infinite, while spherical universes are finite by unbounded - that's the &quot;looping around itself&quot; that you describe.</p>
<p>Until the late 90s, it looked like the universe had enough mass in it to make it spherical, so it looked finite. But observations of distant supernovae showed that the universe was accelerating its expansion, which you wouldn't expect from a spherical universe. Combined with other observations, it now looks like the universe is flat, which means that it's infinite in size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the explanation! It was indeed in the early 2000's that I had that class. Where might I read more about it, if it won't trouble you to ask?</p></div>		</li>
