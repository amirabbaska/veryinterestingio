<p>Being big means being strong, so animals become bigger. But being big needs a lot of food, so when food becomes rare the big animals go bye bye</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s important to note that while modern humans maybe exerting pressure against large animals, the end of the last Ice Age and subsequent drying/warming of the planet was a significant factor in the extinction of the big mammals like Mammoths. Depending on who you ask (and research is still ongoing) it was humans, climate, or a combination of both that was responsible for killing them off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I don't buy the climate argument all by itself.  Reason being, first of megafauna died off along a huge range of continental climates, from the tropics to polar regions.  Second reason being, it held on longer on islands, which would have taken humans longer to get to (for example, Wrangel island mammoths and ground sloths in the Caribbean, both of which lasted until about 4-5000 years ago)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s more likely that the megafauna were already stressed when humans came along. But I just wanted to point out that the scientific jury is still out on which theory is correct. There was a recent-ish study that showed mammoths going extinct in northeast America before any known human contact. It’s just hard to tell. </p></div>		</li>
