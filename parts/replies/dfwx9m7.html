			<div class="markdown"><p>Assad knows he's not going anywhere. He may be a black-hearted piece of shit, but the other options on the table are far worse, and unlike, say, ISIS or Al Nusra Front, Assad is able to moderate and institute reforms that could bring him back into the international community, albeit still as a pariah. After all, we already tolerate Omar Al-Bashir in Sudan, and he's wanted by the International Criminal Court for outright genocide. Assad will just become the new Al-Bashir.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would 70 people and their production facility really tip the tide of the war one way or another? What could they possibly be making that's so valuable that Assad would feel the need to make such a controversial move in order to gain control of the production himself? Isn't the war going on his favor? Why only use it a couple times in a few years in relatively small scale attacks? If he had no fear of international retaliation, why not use it more often?</p>
<p>Your explanation is <em>an</em> explanation for using gas, but not one that entirely fits this scenario. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking for a rational explanation that fits all of Assad's actions will find insanity before something that makes sense.  </p>
<p>It could be some of these 70 people were key figures in one of the movements against him.  Or he just did it to see if he could get away with it, or he needed to make an example to discourage moderates, or they said something about his mother.  Or he wasn't even involved with the decision, but the truth weakens him or is even more damning to his position.  </p>
<p>Fact is there's so much propaganda on both sides we can only look at what's happening, and speculate on the motivations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the point is, there ARE a lot of questions surrounding this attack. It <em>doesn't</em> make a ton of sense that Assad would do this, only a little bit of sense. We can spend all day trying to come up with possible reasons for why he did this, but we could do that about any of the other theories on why this happened. Right now, as long as a theory makes as much sense as the Assad regime theory does, it should hold as much weight. </p>
<p>We need to be open to all possibilities here. Skepticism is good, especially when people are pushing for war. </p></div>		</li>
