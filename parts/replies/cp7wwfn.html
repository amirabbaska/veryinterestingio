			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what makes me think &quot;what if?&quot; a lot. Because if there is an alien culture out there with super telescopes, it's totally possible that they're viewing Earth and not contacting us because we don't have life forms that they can see as worth contacting. </p>
<p>It also makes you wonder about us viewing other planets with our telescopes. What if we're just viewing barren worlds because whatever is living there is current and we're seeing old light? </p>
<p>Makes ya think, eh? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well any of the planets in our solar system are mainly only light minutes away so not much room for change there but im assuming you're talking about exoplanets. Right now we can only detect the wobble in other stars to know there are planets there, we can't actually see those planets and any light bouncing off them to know if there is something there or not. They are way to faint next to their parent star. But I imagine once we have telescopes goos enough to see the light of an exoplanet, we have to take into account how far away it is and calculate how far back were looking.</p>
<p>But what I think is the coolest things about the night sky is knowing that whenever you look up at all the stars, you're looking back in time :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I more meant in a future scenario, I should have specified, oops :P </p>
<p>But yeah, it is kind of neat to think about. Like I could go to another planet and watch my ancestors' lives. Someone in the future could be looking back on mine. It's kind of a sweet thought. </p></div>		</li>
