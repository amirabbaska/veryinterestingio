			<p>can't the rainbow effect be explained with the fact that more massive objects receve a greater gravitational pull? more energetic photons have more mass and should therefore be affected more by gravity no?</p>		</li>

			<p>It's worth noting that cosmologists often don't consider the singularity itself part of &quot;the big bang.&quot; This sort of makes sense, because we don't even know if there was a singularity at all, given how the theory breaks down. Unfortunately, science writers often like to refer to <em>only</em> the singularity as &quot;the big bang&quot; and end up saying things like &quot;the big bang may not have happened!&quot; when they mean there may not have been a singularity, which should not be surprising at all.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not entirely. The problem is that the Big Bang theory as it's colloquially referred to, is now actually dozens of individual theories which interrelate. Several of those pertain to the shape and extent of space and time. If the universe &quot;extends&quot; past the initial singularity or there wasn't one, then there are significant parts of the whole  extended family of theories which may have to be revised.<br><br>This is nothing new. We've been toying with non-singularity versions of the Big Bang for a long time, and there are a number of competing models ready to step in.<br><br>It's just that we'll have a bit of a period of adjustment where what we mean by &quot;the Big Bang,&quot; especially in terms of the shape of spacetime, will be undergoing some revision.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Rephrased, the Big Bang theory doesn't describe how the universe was created, it describes what happened right after the universe was created. </p>		</li>

			<p>Conventionally, yes, but I tried to avoid that phrasing because it assumes that the universe was created immediately prior. If instead the universe remained stable in some initial state for a (maybe even infinitely long) time, the big bang would not be &quot;what happened right after the universe was created&quot; but rather &quot;what happened that turned that initial state into something like the universe we see today.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Yup, and in my opinion that is the interesting part </p>		</li>

			<p>The way I understand it is that if time does not exist how long does it take for time to exist?   The correct answer I believe is no time at all.</p>		</li>
