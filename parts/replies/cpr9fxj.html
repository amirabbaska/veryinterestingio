			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Before that, electrons had too much energy for them to combine with protons and form atoms, they simply could not stay still long enough to be captured. Because of this the universe was actually opaque and light could not travel any distance before being absorbed by the electron plasma. The CMB is the first light to be emitted once the universe became transparent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fortunately, rainbow gravity wouldn't effect the cosmic microwave background radiation calculations. Keep in mind that rainbow gravity only affects things in a very minuscule sense. The main effect is removing the mathematical singularity at the &quot;beginning&quot;. Physics doesn't like singularities, so this might help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>isn't our estimate for the age of the universe based on the background microwave radiation </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That, and by just rewinding time. It's a bit technical since the rate of expansion of the universe  has changed in the past, but the age of the universe (that is: how much time has elapsed since the big bang) is very, very certain now. No new theory will change that though better observation will decrease the uncertainty.</p>
<p>The background radiation, a.k.a. the CMB, isn't exactly from the big bang. It was released about 300,000 years after. Before that time the universe was so hot that all matter existed in a state called plasma, like inside the sun. This means that the nuclei (i.e. the 'cores') of atoms were stripped of their electrons. Normally the electrons will be bound to the nuclei forming atoms, but temperatures where so great that they were ripped off. </p>
<p>As the universe expanded the temperature cooled. At some point it was cold enough that the electrons could combine with the nuclei forming atoms. This is called 'recombination'. The photons, a.k.a. the particles of light which were responsible for stripping the electrons off from the nuclei previously, now didn't have enough energy to do that. So they didn't interact with the atoms anymore. This is called decoupling.
It is these photons we today observe as the cosmic microwave background radiation.</p>
<p>Before this decoupling the universe was totally opaque, so we can't see further than that. But we know how much time had elapsed since the big bang until decoupling, since we know how the universe expanded during that time. This allows us to calculate how the temperature of the universe dropped, so we know for how long the temperature should have been high enough to fuse hydrogen into helium (which happened for the first 15 minutes after the big bang). Since we can directly observe how much helium there is in the universe today, we know how long this fusion took place, thus how the universe evolved until the temperature cooled enough to allow decoupling so the CMB was emitted. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>if gravity affects different wavelengths differently then couldn't this calculation be wrong?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably not. The time until the CMB is calculated using it's redshift. That means how much the wavelenghts of it's photons have been streched by the expansion of the universe since they were emitted. As this redshift is due to the expansion of space and not due to gravity it probably won't change. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>And does this affect our calculations for the amount of matter in the universe, and hence the dark matter hypothesis?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, probably not. The amount of matter in the universe is partly calculated using the CMB, but several other methods for estimating it also exist, like gravitational lensing using galaxy clusters and measuring the orbital speed of galaxies and stars. They all seem to roughly agree. Maybe the amount could be changed a little bit, but it will probably still be around 30%, with 5% ordinary matter and 25% dark matter. </p>
<p>Feel free to ask more questions, or for an elaboration if I didn't explain myself clearly enough.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that cosmologists often don't consider the singularity itself part of &quot;the big bang.&quot; This sort of makes sense, because we don't even know if there was a singularity at all, given how the theory breaks down. Unfortunately, science writers often like to refer to <em>only</em> the singularity as &quot;the big bang&quot; and end up saying things like &quot;the big bang may not have happened!&quot; when they mean there may not have been a singularity, which should not be surprising at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely. The problem is that the Big Bang theory as it's colloquially referred to, is now actually dozens of individual theories which interrelate. Several of those pertain to the shape and extent of space and time. If the universe &quot;extends&quot; past the initial singularity or there wasn't one, then there are significant parts of the whole  extended family of theories which may have to be revised.</p>
<p>This is nothing new. We've been toying with non-singularity versions of the Big Bang for a long time, and there are a number of competing models ready to step in.</p>
<p>It's just that we'll have a bit of a period of adjustment where what we mean by &quot;the Big Bang,&quot; especially in terms of the shape of spacetime, will be undergoing some revision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Conventionally, yes, but I tried to avoid that phrasing because it assumes that the universe was created immediately prior. If instead the universe remained stable in some initial state for a (maybe even infinitely long) time, the big bang would not be &quot;what happened right after the universe was created&quot; but rather &quot;what happened that turned that initial state into something like the universe we see today.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
