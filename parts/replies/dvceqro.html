			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha. I'd have a hard time being that guy, I don't want to be that gal either.</p>
<p>I remember it clearly, in a stanky outhouse on a long road with not enough rest stops. Best pee ever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I totally agree. Never has it been a painful thing for me. I dated a guy once who was a screamer which was super scary cause I never actually knew if he was in pain but he always assured me he wasnt and he did that when he was on top too so</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I have a hard time keeping quiet during sex, or even sometimes when I'm alone. Never do it intentionally, it just happens! </p>
<p>And I remember always being loud, even when fooling around with boyfriends in high school, before I ever watched porn. Definitely didn't learn it. </p>
<p>I wish someone had a legit answer for this. I'd love to know!! </p></div>		</li>
