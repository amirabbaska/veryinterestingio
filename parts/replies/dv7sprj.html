			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the biggest distinction is between whether the cops found it, or whether you surrendered it voluntarily, or whether you were <em>forced</em> to give it to them. </p>
<p>The actual premise of &quot;The Right To Remain Silent&quot; isn't that you don't have to talk if you don't want to. It's that &quot;No person may be compelled to be a witness against themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>So, if the cops <em>legally</em> search your house and find your diary, it's admissible. If you <em>voluntarily</em> tell them where to find it, or give it to them yourself, its admissible. If, however, there's is some form of coercion involved, like they threaten to rough you up or throw you in jail if you don't give it to them, that is not admissible. They also can't <em>subpeona</em> the diary from you if they don't find it, in the same way that they can't make you testify against yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This leads to an interesting situation, that I don't think has been resolved yet.  Say you have a diary stored on a computer and encrypted.  Can you be compelled to give the password? Neither the diary nor the password is testimony, but you are clearly being forced to speak against your own criminal interest.  </p>
<p>Edit: typing is hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has come up - you can be found in contempt of court for refusal to disclose a password to decrypt a file if the courts believe that file contains evidence of a crime.</p>
<p>It is an interesting 5th Amendment question, but as of now those rights do not cover things like passwords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a lawyer, just a guy with a few law courses and some personal knowledge. This question is beyond the scope of my personal knowledge. Sorry.</p>
<p>That being said, there <em>are</em> a few questions you can be compelled to answer even if they incriminate you. Name, address and date of birth, for example.</p>
<p>Say you live in a house where a dead body is found in the basement. Stating that you live there is incriminating, but it's identity information so you can't withhold it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The government cannot compel you to divulge your password. In fact, itâ€™s a legal grey area whether the government can compel third parties, like Apple, to divulge your password or decrypt your phone. The government has repeatedly brought cases against phone manufactures only to drop them once they find someone else who is willing to decrypt the phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if someone like a roommate takes your diary and gives it to the police? Curious which side of the fence that falls on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to something called <em>Third Party Doctrine</em> you have no expectation of privacy on any information you voluntarily turn over to a third party. So, they can obtain your phone records from the phone company without your consent. Or internet records from your ISP.</p>
<p>So, it depends how the diary was obtained. If they had to enter an area where <em>you did have</em> an expectation of privacy to obtain it, like your bedroom, I'm thinking no. If you left it on the coffee table in the living room, probably yes. If you gave them the diary, definitely yes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if cops are legally searching your house, but you grab the diary first and refuse to let it go? Can they (legally) force you to give it? Can't you just burn it (or anything making it unuseable) right in front of them ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in terms of burning it, that would be destruction of evidence and possibly obstruction of justice, which are other crimes in and of themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can legally take the object form you by force as part of arresting you. All objects in your possession are confiscated and can be used as evidence if the arrest was legal.</p>
<p>If you were to burn it right in front of them you will certainly get obstruction of justice charges adding for destroying evidence if they had a search warrant but if that was the only possible evidence to find you guilty of the main offense if can get your off much more easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that is the reason they typically don't let you in your home when they are searching it.</p>
<p>If they have a warrant to search your home, they have a right to seize evidence in your home.  If you try to take or destroy that evidence, you are committing an <em>additional</em> crime by not allowing them to have it.</p></div>		</li>
