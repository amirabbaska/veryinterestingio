			<div class="markdown"><p>I think /u/Atom_Blue summed it up nicely. </p>
<p>I work in the research area of nuclear energy so I can't really say. At least in the USA, the biggest hurdle to nuclear replacing fossil fuels isn't a technological one, but a political/social one. The science in favor of nuclear over fossils as an energy source is beyond overwhelming, but a lot of the public and politicians remain uneducated on the topic. We're pretty adamant where I work about changing that, but it's a long process and tough process. When people decide they want nuclear power, that's when they'll get it. </p>
<p>Renewables certainly have their place, especially in areas where nuclear doesn't make as much sense. I wouldn't build a nuclear power plant out in the desert just to supply a few houses. Solar or Wind will be just fine out there. A city though? That's where you'd want nuclear. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the op but I think I can help answer your question. Currently, we can use nuclear PWRs and renewables with some gas for massive GHG emissions cuts. Still using some fossils but it’s mostly nuclear and renewables.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>First, let’s briefly explain what an integrated energy system is. As the figure below illustrates, an integrated energy system (also known as a nuclear-renewable hybrid energy system) is a co-managed system that has three main components: a nuclear subsystem that produces heat and/or electricity; a renewable subsystem that produces electricity or heat; and an industrial subsystem that produces high-value products like gasoline, potable water, or hydrogen. Integrated systems are unique because they can alter how much energy they provide to their industrial subsystem and the electrical grid depending on the value of each commodity at a given time. The flexible production of energy and industrial goods has the potential to make integrated energy systems more responsive to changing market dynamics, and more profitable for their investors.   </p>

<p>However...</p>
<p>Future molten salt reactors, like Moltex Energy, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHsljVnY6oI" target="_blank">Elysium Industries</a>, Terrestrial Energy’s reactors will be compatible w/thermal molten storage and will be able to integrate well with intermittent renewables. No fossil fuels required. <a href="https://youtu.be/TvXcoSdXYlk" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/TvXcoSdXYlk</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow thank you for such detailed information. I guess my second question to this is how do you think we can marry environmental policy to this with such a rational fear of nuclear within environmentalist movements which ironically helps pros up fossil fuel. </p>
<p>I love the idea of a commodities market for energy on this basis because the price of fossil fuels even with subsidies can't compete in that kind of market but it still leaves room for industries that create carbon products with new tech for biofuels and plastics without having to extract any more Virgin oil. </p>
<p>I've got a controversial opinion on this but I think ground oil has a far more necessary function to the Earths natural ecosystems and mineral transport much like a cardiovascular system would work but in a global network. By that logic its necessary that we stop extraction ASAP to study the Earth as a living organism which will better define the niche into which humans can move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it kept running past the normal refueling window without a refuel actually happening. Is it a quick loss of power, or is it likely to go through some oscillation cycles or is a long steady taper off of power?</p></div>		</li>
