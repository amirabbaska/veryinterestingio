			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not, and doesn't produce accurate results (too many variables)
The way they actually and accurately measured the heights of mountains and peaks is through basic trigonometry and some ingeniously designed instruments. TLDR you make a triangle of points on land and measuring distance and precise angles between them you can accurately measure the altitude difference between the three points. You start at the ocean, which is a pretty constant baseline, and work your way inland, one triangle at a time. The margin for error was around 1 in 30,000 or so.</p>
<p>There is another post on the Great Trigonometrical Survey, which is the actual method used. Basically lots and lots of math.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An anecdote (which may or may not be true) about when they first calculated the height of Everest: they determined the height to be 29,000 feet accurate to one foot. They didn't want people to assume they rounded it off to the nearest hundred or thousand, so they arbitrarily added a few feet and published it as 29,003 feet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how it's <em>estimated</em> within 100m. Good enough for climbers trying to eyeball their altitude to determine where they are on the summit, and if they should kick on their canned air or not.   </p>
<p>For precise measurements to the less than half a meter, you need precision surveying equipment like a stick and level.  This is heavier though, so unless you're actually mapping things eyeballing is far superior. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Unfortunately, air pressure also varies quite strongly with weather, so with this method, you'd only ever get a decent estimate.</p>
<p>But it's good enough that aircraft altimeters used this method until not that long ago (obviously not making tea, but calculating altitude from air pressure)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You only use the measured barometric pressure. Larger airports have an automated broadcast that tells pilots the current winds, visibility and altimeter setting expressed inches of mercury. Example: the Miami FL airport currently has a local reading of 29.82. You turn the knob on the altimeter so the number in the Kolsman window reads 29.82. You then cross check your indicated altitude with the field's known altitude. There is often a sign near the end of runway listing that elevation. For the Miami example, your indicated altitude should read 8 feet.</p>
<p>If no accurate altimeter setting is available, you can just turn the setting knob until your indicated elevation matches your known elevation.</p>
<p>As you travel, you are expected to monitor weather broadcasts and reset your altimeter as necessary.</p>
<p>Having the right altimeter setting is kind of important. Too low and you hit the ground and die (lithobraking). Too high and you can encroach on someone else's airspace and you all die (video at 11).</p>
<p>We lost a whole team of Blue Angles some years back due to an outdated altimeter setting. </p>
<p>Seems like a large part of learning how to be a pilot is learning how to avoid dying.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pitot tubes are used to measure air speed, not altitude.</p>
<p>They are not materially affected by barometric pressure. </p>
<p>However, the air temperature has a significant effect. The more expensive air speed indicators have a temperature adjustment.</p>
