			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the rest of your skin, the skin on your lips thickens and toughens slightly in response to friction and drying. If you keep your lips coated with a thick layer of grease, they lose that adaptation and become thinner and more sensitive. This may be a desirable effect (thinner lips are also redder, softer, and smoother), but if you'd rather toughen them back up, all you have to do is stop using occlusive balms (you can still moisturize, just not with grease).</p>
<p>That said, if you're keeping your lips coated with chapstick 24/7, you're not damaging them with saliva or mechanical trauma, and they're cracking and flaking anyway, you've got something else going on. You might be significantly dehydrated, you might have a skin or dental problem, or you might be licking and biting your lips in your sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moisturizer, or pretty much anything which acts like moisturizer.  It's like moisturizing the rest of your skin, rather than keeping it protected under a layer of chapstick. Applying chapstick once or twice a day is probably still fine: it's the difference between using it as moisturizer or using it as protection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best solution is to drink more water. Track your water intake, there's a very high chance you're not getting enough. When I started tracking my water intake (I used the Water Drink Reminder app for a bit), I realized I was easily drinking 1L less than I should. I try to aim  for 2.5L a day now, based on my weight/height, and I feel better, more refreshed, skin feels better, almost never have dry lips. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also drink water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For me it happens when I have sinus congestion which causes me to breathe through my mouth when I sleep. 8 hours without chapstick and with mouth breathing will destroy my lips. A humidifier in the bedroom helps a lot in that situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my situation. I have a deviated septum which increases my congestion at night. I also use a humidifier, which helps, but my best results is applying lip balm before sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. Most balms on the market contain alcohols and other ingredients which can dry out skin and are effective at exfoliating the skin, making it flake away to reveal new skin underneath. They are actually drying to the skin, rather than moisturizing. Any product with peppermint in it, or probably any mint, will dry out your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cocoa butter. Specifically, palmer's.</p>
<p>Please everyone, ditch whatever you're using and use cocoa butter for all your dry skin problems. It comes in tubs and tubes. I use the tubs for my body, and the tubes for my lips. The tubes legitimately look like <a href="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/shopping?q=tbn:ANd9GcS4HW7pKAq4vbvouJSjyQLFMXpCZTuxdao25KQHr6ObHQRuKO8IsP-nfe-wDHM_ytgO1rqypOfx&amp;usqp=CAY" target="_blank">glue sticks</a> but I swear by them. </p>
<p>Hydration is obviously way more important than which chapstick you're using, and even with my handy dandy cocoa butter, it'll just be a temporary fix if I'm severely dehydrated. Day to day use is awesome though. I put it on a couple times a day and once before I got bed, and its completely adequate. It feels damn good, too. It doesn't give that &quot;cool&quot; feeling that I hate, smells more like chocolate than anything, and doesn't have a chemical taste. </p>
<p>Yes, people constantly assume I'm putting glue on my lips, but I defend it every time. Cocoa butter is heaven. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah anything with lots of &quot;natural&quot; oils in it are the best! I use Badger Balm  and other brands that mainly consist of cocoa butter, Olive oil, avocado oil, etc. Sometimes they will have wax in them but mainly the reason I think they work better is because the oils soak in and moisturize your skin, rather than sealing them from the outside world so that as soon as it rubs off your lips are just as bad, if not worse. I've found that when I use a good moisturizing lip balm I can go further in-between uses than I can with the &quot;sealing&quot; balms.</p>
<p>Of course I am not an expert, this is just my personal experience. I find a lot of good lip balms in health food/ whole food stores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be an Aquaphor lover (and still mostly am, but no longer as a chap stick for my lips) - I still use it for my skin when it's dry. </p>
<p>I currently am using and am LOVING (as do hundreds of other reviewers via Amazon) a product by Lansinoh called Lanolin Minis (basically, the product is packaged as mini chopstick sized tubes). This products original use is and is still for breastfeeding mothers whose nipples crack and dry out due to the constant feedings and likely the saliva - which can pretty harshly crack and dry out the skin.</p>
<p>I am not being paid by the company to say this but I am totally recommending it. I actually found this exact suggestion for this product on Reddit and for chapped lips, bought some and never looked back.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! When breastfeeding I would always use it for my nipples, and used it as lip balm. Hands down the best lip balm ever. Although it's a bit grim when you think it's made from greasy sheep. But hey, whatever works!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a point of clarification - lanolin is a natural oil in sheep's wool. When farmers shear the sheep once a year, the wool is collected and processed into products like sweaters and lanolin balms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Haven't had my coffee yet, and had to go look at these &quot;chopstick-sized tubes&quot;.  Finally figured out they were &quot;chapstick sized tubes&quot;! â˜º</p></div>		</li>
