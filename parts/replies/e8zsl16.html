			<div class="markdown"><p>More specifically, cancer cells are mutated in a way which affects their replication cycle and differentiation - they're cells which are just replicating and not serving their initial function. Mutated cells exist all over your body all the time and 99% of the time they just die and aren't viable, cancerous cells are specifically mutated in a region of DNA that is involved in replication/differentiation. As such, neurons, which don't replicate in adulthood, are unlikely to become cancerous compared to cells which do regularly replicate. So the correct answer is the one at the top - that most brain tumors are caused by non-neuron cells in the brain (gliomas, schwannomas, hemangiomas, etc.). The above answer is a nice theoretical/case study addition but it's not the eli5 answer OP was looking for.</p>
<p>The exception is childhood neuronal cancers (neurofibromas) which occur when neurons ARE still replicating. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a bit inane, even by the standard of a 5 year old </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. OP posed a question, but in it they included a bit of a fallacy.</p>
<p>They loaded their question with &quot;neurons don't divide&quot;.</p>
<p>The real question they should have been asking is something like &quot;what kick starts the division of non diving cells in the process that leads to tumourgenesis in neurons?&quot;</p>
<p>u/Superm8n was simply explaining that they are no longer normal. They no longer follow the same rules. As obvious as that sounds, if it really was so obvious, this ELI5 question would not be on the front page with thousands of upvotes.</p></div>		</li>
