			<div class="markdown"><p>JS: Hi and thank you for your question. You have hit on a very tough issue. Luckily, there are a lot of very intelligent people working on this issue in New England and along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. There is a group called the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team (ALWTRT) that is comprised of fisheries representatives, federal and state fishery managers, researchers and conservationists, all tasked with developing solutions to address the entanglement issue between specific fisheries and endangered whales. The marking requirements that you mention are part of the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan (ALWTRP) that was drafted by this team and implemented by NOAA Fisheries. I would encourage you to get in touch with your local ALWTRT representative or the NOAA Fisheries ALWTRP coordinator for more detailed information on research being conducted in gear marking. More information, including members of the Team at: [Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan] (<a href="https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/" target="_blank">https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/</a>)</p></div>		</li>
