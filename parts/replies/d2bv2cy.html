			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong. Mirror neurons are responsible for children being able to raise their hand by copying what their mother does. It is a developmental aid which allows us to learn behaviours without consciously putting effort into thinking how do I do this behaviour?
What you're talking about is likely a mix of imagination, memory and empathy. When we remember an embarrassing event it doesn't mean we are activating mirror neurons, we are just re-living that experience. </p>
<p>Summary: you're right about some kind of self-stimulated neural activity but it's likely imagination NOT mirror neurons</p></div>		</li>
