			<div class="markdown"><p>I read on Reddit awhile ago that if you wanted to remember something you should cross your fingers and leave them that way until you get to whatever you wanted to remember. It works very well. But sometimes I do forget why I had my fingers crossed in the first place...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Memory is a strange thing. I think a more traditional view is that memory is mostly mental. Studies in psychology have shown that memory takes into account many variables such as the environment you are in, emotional state, influence of medication and drugs just to name a few. </p>
<p>If you want to build strong memories it is also a great idea to integrate multi-sensory information. The use of more than one of your senses. </p>
<p><em>What about these variables?</em> If you have to study for an exam and you drink a caffeine during studying it is best if you also consume caffeine before taking the exam as well. If you can study in the room in which you are taking the exam your potential for recall is also increased. Certain emotions can also negatively or positively impact your ability to recall information. For optimal recall you should aim to recreate the conditions under which you studied. </p>
<p><em>What do I mean by integrate different sensory information?</em> It is possible to study for an exam by only reading the text with the information. If you integrate visual and auditory (sound) information such as pictures, colors, videoclips etc. you build stronger memories. Connecting previous knowledge with new concepts also helps strengthen your ability to recall. Think of how you make a mind map. Furthermore, we also have motor senses so by the act of drawing, writing out or even acting out the information we can integrate sensory information from our motor senses such as hands, arms, legs, etc. in case of your example the crossing of fingers is extra sensory information but also building association between the crossed fingers and item to recall. </p>
<p>The problem with crossing fingers and forgetting is that you are utilizing your short-term memory and it still has not been solidified in your long-term memory. Hence if your attention, emotional state or other factors occur chances are you'll still forget what you wanted to remember. There's a memory technique called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci" target="_blank">method of loci</a> which works kind of similar but instead of crossing fingers you use objects in a room you are familiar with to build memory recall associations. For example, you associate the table next to your door to the memory of having to do a task such as go grocery shopping. Solidifying the association does require repetition though if recall is suppose to happen much later. You can also apply this technique by reimagining this room and the objects with memory associations in your head, sometimes called a memory palace, but you could also use the physical presence in the room for recall. </p>
<p>The point is that our memory works based off multiple areas and activity in the brain. The more you can integrate and recreate these the better your likelihood of recall will be. Crudely put, the more roads you have to the memory the better your chances of recall become. </p>
<p>(You might have heard of different learning styles but I want to state that to my knowledge there is no concrete scientific support for different learning styles. For example some claim to be visual learners.)</p></div>		</li>
