<p>There are other constraints that make many &gt;= solar-mass black holes unlikely, but those are model-dependent. See the discussion <a href="https://resonaances.blogspot.de/2016/06/black-hole-dark-matter.html" target="_blank">here</a>, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its proposed to be a thin halo 3x the diameter of the galaxy. When two galaxies collide it appears the halo has momentum and take longer to slow down because gravity drops off by the cube. Basically, if the sun froze in its orbit of the milky way today the kuiper belt would take longer to stop than mercury. </p>
<p>Combine this with the fact very few stars collide in a galaxy merger means the halo could pass through the galaxy without interacting except via gravity and coalesce into a new halo.</p>
<p>And, if you've taken physics, you may remember shell theory with fields. You can treat an object with gravity as if the particles are distributed evenly (cloud) or on the &quot;shell&quot; (halo) and the only thing that matters is mass and distance from center when outside of the halo.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even ignoring the nonconservation of momentum you propose, this is nonsense. It would mean changing the velocity of sun by ~200 km/s, so everything suddently has 200 km/s relative velocity to the sun. At that speed, nothing is bound any more, nothing would orbit the sun at all and everything just flies apart (well, moons keep orbiting their planets).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Replace stop with suddenly slowed by then. Its an example, not something that would actually happen. &quot;Slowed by 10 km/s over the course of a year.&quot; This is 1/5 the speed of mercury and twice the speed of Neptune. This is eli5 and I didn't think units were relevant to my answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I came here to ask this exact question. I thought the whole point behind dark matter was that it pretty much didn't interact with other mass except through gravity. The primary example being the bullet cluster.   </p>
<p>The black holes dark matter should've lost momentum and many of them should've become active no? Wouldn't they have picked up a shit ton of gas passing through another galaxy like that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The bullet cluster is an example that dark matter does interact with other matter as little as stars do. Much less than inter-galactic medium. About picking up gas and becoming active: Good point. Would we maybe see those that did as stars and ignore them? Or maybe inter-galactic is not dense enough that enough of it gets captured by individual black holes plowing through at 6 million miles per hour. I seriously do not know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I want to see this answered!</p>
<p>Also, much evidence of dark matter comes from the higher than expected rate of orbital velocity in the rotation curve of a galaxy.</p>
<p>In light of dark matter being from, undetected black holes, this would mean dark matter halos are due to... more black holes than we accounted for in the center of the galaxy? Surrounding the galaxy? Are we then just horribly inaccurate in calculation of mass, or detection of a black hole?</p></div>		</li>
