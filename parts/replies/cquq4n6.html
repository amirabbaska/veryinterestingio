			<div class="markdown"><p>You write m=E/c^2, but in the calculation, only divided by c once. Your formula should have given something on the order of 10^-56 kg.</p>
<p>But more importantly, the force exerted by light cannot be computed from its mass equivalence, which after all has units of mass, not force. To compute the force exerted by light, you want to figure out the momentum transferred per second. Momentum has units of Newton-seconds, so momentum-per-second has units of Newtons, i.e. force. So the dimensional analysis checks out.</p>
<p>A photon obeys the relation p = E/c (p is momentum), so a photon of energy 4 <em> 10^-40 J has momentum 1.3 </em> 10^-48 Newton-seconds. A flux of this much momentum per second therefore produces a force of 1.3 * 10^-48 Newtons.</p>
<p>This happens to match what you got, but through sheer luck - the bad arithmetic exactly cancelled the wrong formula.</p></div>		</li>
