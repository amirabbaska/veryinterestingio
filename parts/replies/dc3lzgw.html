			<div class="markdown"><p>Only one of them needs a work visa. The others might just be working illegally. They don't need a work visa to reside in the US. They just need to claim dependence on one person who has a visa, and as far as I know you can legally claim as many dependents as you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea. I don't know if they all had legit paperwork or not. They all worked at the same family owned restaurant and lived in shared apartments, so they could go for a while without needing to show ID or pay taxes or apply for anything.</p></div>		</li>
