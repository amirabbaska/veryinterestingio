			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you made me realize that this is what makes me feel so anxious about flying. I can never tell what direction the plane is flying in and feel really uncomfortable not knowing. I have to stare out the window as much as possible to reassure myself that the plane is flying how it should be, and I find it disorienting looking back and forth from the horizon ie out the window and into the cabin. I also feel most tense in that time after take off when the plane feels like it's pointed upwards. </p>
<p>So maybe my anxiety is actually strongly linked to this spatial disorientation. I never thought about it this way before! Thanks for your comment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem ... it makes sense and it's unusual at first, even to the pilots.  I'd suggest a career other than flying though if that makes you nervous :)</p>
<p>For more information, reading about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graveyard_spiral" target="_blank">Graveyard spiral</a> can give you a good idea of how weird your body's sensations can be while flying.</p>
<p>Note:  You won't get into a Graveyard spiral on your next airline flight ... this is more for newly trained, inexperienced, instrument-rated pilots.</p>

<p>I remember that. There was light fog and it was dusk, so the sky and ocean would have blended together to obscure the horizon. You almost know exactly what was happening. He was looking out the window, trying to pick up the shoreline, which they were approaching. He wasn't watching his instruments. </p>
<p>When flying with the hood, I was always amazed how fast you lost orientation. Everything is fine one second, then the stall warning goes off. That fast. Your very first thought, &quot;No way.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same! I dislike climbing after takeoff and I really feel better being able to see the horizon out the window. </p>
<p>My body interprets minute changes in airspeed and altitude as way bigger than they actually are. I feel hypersensitive to any force, especially if I can't see out the window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely in an aircraft. Simulators are excellent at simulating flight, but they do not (and are not used to) fully replace the training received in an aircraft. Accidents in training are relatively rare; the qualifications held by instructors are rigorous in terms of ensuring safety of flight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Former Boeing employee here.  Simulators ARE certified and designed to replace actual seat time.</p>
<p>Many/most commercial pilots are type rated (qualified to fly a type of airplane) with only one actual flight after hundred of hours in a full motion simulator. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A full-montion, &quot;Level D&quot; simulator does a good job of the effects of acceleration (platform pitches up, etc) and anything in the realm of &quot;standard flight&quot;, but it does have it's limitations.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be that pilots are being driven more towards automation and less towards &quot;airmanship&quot;, although that's a huge debate in itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_447" target="_blank">Air Frace 447</a> shows exactly what can go completely wrong in a multi-crew cockpit of a long-haul airliner.</p>
<p>That sort of thing should not be happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well obviously it should.<br />
I mean when you are trained to ignore something, that's best done when that something is actually there.<br />
P.e. I could tell you 'ignore the cold' but without you having the cold around, how does your body train to ignore it?</p></div>		</li>
