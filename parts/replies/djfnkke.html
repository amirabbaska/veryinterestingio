			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, related question: </p>
<p>I donated platelets for years, maybe 30 times or more.  Eventually, it started getting uncomfortable, especially my reaction to the anti-coagulant.  Very quickly after that, I could feel my nervousness (blood pressure) creeping up as I was sitting through the screening.  I finally got declined due to high bp, donated a few more times where it was pretty bad, then got declined twice in a row &amp; said Screw it, I did my part.  </p>
<p>I assumed that either my body was getting sick and tired of me draining my platelets, or else just I was getting high blood pressure.  Of course I enjoy the 1st option better, but what are your thoughts?  Can our body essentially  get pissed of at you and pinch itself off trying to make you stop?</p>
<p>I was donating at the maximum rate, and I was physically active.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You made me go &quot;Uuuuhhhhhh, &quot; &amp; seriously fire up the auxiliary  brain  Yeah.  Kind of.  Not how I would phrase  it, but that is a short way to say &quot;I knew that a feeling would shortly be upon me where I am increasingly feeling like this is trying to kill me.&quot;</p>
<p>Or whatever.</p>
<p>I assumed it was like not wanting to do pushups, as your body wants to save energy.  But I got a nagging suspicion that the platelet thing was an anomaly worth digging into.  And yeah, my bp is a bit high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really have no idea. I imagine it's maybe phlebitis in reaction to something, which is making you super anxious. If you don't feel comfortable, don't donate. It's such an admirable thing that you've done though to go that often. Maybe give it a few years and then try again. X</p></div>		</li>
