			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that force has an acceleration component then the quick impulses of force may exert more overall. Muscles, however, are designed to work as efficiently as possible. Therefore the smaller force will actually reduce muscle fatigue over time while completing a similar task.</p>
<p>The shaking is actually a sign of more fatigue to come.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! When we fatigue, our muscle twitches take longer to complete. </p>
<p>To maximize our torque, we fire our muscle fibers in rapid succession which allows for those twitches to summate to produce high torque.</p>
<p>When we fatigue, although each muscle twitch produces less torque, we can summate the twitches at lower firing frequencies.</p></div>		</li>
