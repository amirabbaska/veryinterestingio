<p>So where did the word China come from? Nobody knows. There's a lot of guesses, but no one knows for sure why a dozen different kingdoms, states, and ethnic groups that had individual named were all called China.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have a crazy guess. Maybe its because there was a person who unified all those different kingdoms, states and ethnic groups into one empire. </p>
<p>What if the old pinyin had his name 'Chin' and so Westerners thought of him as the creator of .. well maybe call his new created superstate 'Chin-a'</p>
<p>Later pinyin might have it 'Qin' as in Qin Shi Huang' or 'Qin The Yellow Emperor'. </p>
<p>Hey, funny but if we translated the English 'China' (Qins Nation) we might even have a near soundalike in 'Chinhua'.</p>
<p>But yes.. i mean, who knows, its just some crazy thing that we'll never know because no English scholars were around to record anything but maybe..</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually zhong guo is a pretty new term referring the country. The name of the country used to just be the name of the dynasty eg, Tang Song Yuan Ming Qing. Zhong Guo 中国 used to refer to the middle of the country which is the area around Henan Province today, the more common term is 中土 or 中原. </p>
<p>Japan have a place called 中国 too, which refer to the middle of their country, but now they used 中国地方 to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>Meiguo 美国 is short for 美利坚合众国, 德国 Deguo come from is short for 德意志联邦共和国, which 德意志 is phnetic pronunciation of Deutsch. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. </p>
<p>Actually, the Central Plain <em>was</em> China for the most part and the rest simply weren't under Hua control... so Zhongguo has meant China pretty far back even if it technically referred to the land and not the state itself (cf. &quot;America&quot; versus the &quot;USA&quot;).</p>
<p>The UK isn't special at all. Latin Americans get pissy when 美利堅合眾國 gets shortened to &quot;America&quot;; the Netherlands is just &quot;Holland&quot; (<em>Helan</em>); and Chinese <em>has</em> 大不列颠及北爱尔兰联合王国 when they really want to say &quot;United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&quot;. They just couldn't give 2 shits about the feelings of little Welsh and Scottish snowflakes and find the formal name too <em>mafan</em>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Chinese distinguish very carefully between the Chinese 'race' (汉族人), culture (华夏), and nationality (中国人). They can be careful with their terms when it affects their own structural integrity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>中国 was a geological concept instead of the name of the nation. It's more like New England if USA today is called New England Republic.</p>
<p>We distinguish carefully because there isn't just Han Chinese in China. There are other ethnic minorities with different cultures. I for example am a Chinese national 中国人, ethnic Korean 朝鲜族. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nope. Qin (秦) means the region specific to the original kingdom that unified China for the first time, and currently it's in Northwest China. It is never used to denote any other part of China. the name Zhong guo wasn't used in various dynasties until at least Ming (mid 1400 and onwards?). before that, the name of each dynasty is used to indicate the country. </p>
<p>I think the term Hua Xia (华夏) was still used.  the first character means the people in China proper (Han Chinese), and the second character is the first Dynasty in China, back in the 2000 BC or so. Together, they were used to indicate the part of China that was settled by Han Chinese. This term is still used nowadays as a substitute of China, but with an emphasis on ethnicity. From that comes the term Zhong Hua (中华), which means the land that settled by the Hua (Han) people and is in the center of everything. This name is found in the last two government of China: Roc (Republic of China, aka Taiwan, as Zhong Hua Min Guo, or 中华民国), and PRC (People's republic of China, Zhong Hua Ren min gong he Guo).</p>
<p>Funny enough, ethnic Chinese are known as Han people. Han is the dynasty that existed around the same time as the Romans, and in terms of power and influence Han might be a worthy opponent of the Romans. Han was the first Empire out of many that we had that totally dominated the region if East Asia and projected into the Steppe of Central Asia. Han, Tang, Song and to a lesser degree Ming dynasty all were the supreme world powers around their time. Even in its weakest states Song dynasty was able to resist the Mongols for close to 100 years. </p>
<p>Knowing this, it's not hard to imagine that a big slogan that the current Chinese government have been using for the last 20 years or more is 中华复兴, which, can be translated directly into &quot;Make China great again&quot; but in a way more elegant way.  </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Portuguese 'China' is thought to derive from Persian Chīn (چین), and perhaps ultimately from Sanskrit Cīna (चीन).[31] Cīna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mahābhārata (5th century bc) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century bc).[32] The traditional theory, proposed in the 17th century by Martino Martini[33] and supported by many later scholars, is that the word &quot;China&quot; and its earlier related forms are ultimately derived from the state of Qin </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the etymology of the 'Western' name 'China' and its widely accepted by linguists all over the world. This is also where 'Sino/Sina/Sin/Thina etc. comes from. </p>
<p>It was never used by Chinese people(Han and others) for anything except Qin as you said but for India, Persia and later Europe it indeed was used a general name for China. A run down of Chinese history is not gonna fucking invalidate that, its frankly irrelevant. </p>
<p>Words don't have to be logical, sometimes they just happen. </p>
<p>There is also a decent possibility that 'China' might have come through/from some of the Central European languages instead of India but the point still stands as it most likely originated as a reference to Qin. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_China#Names_in_non-Chinese_records" target="_blank">Names of China#Names in non-Chinese records: Wikipedia has a good article on it with plenty of good sources.</a></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR Where the word 'China' comes from is in no way a mystery and even though not all linguists agree, most do agree that it has its origin as a reference to 'Qin' from India.</strong></p></div>		</li>
