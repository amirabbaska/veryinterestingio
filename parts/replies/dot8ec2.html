			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the current theory about the origin of many of the &quot;rare&quot; metals on earth's surface (or just below) like gold and platinum is that they came from meteor bombardment a significant time AFTER the earth formed.   The gold and platinum that were around when the earth coalesced is now in the core.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be partly correct but from a geological viewpoint the majority of &quot;rare&quot; elements such as gold and Rare Earth Elements (REE's) are formed around spreading ridges in the oceans where superheated (400 C) water and acid that has permeated through the crust dissolves metals in the asthenosophere.</p>
<p>These solutions of acids and dissolved metals then rise to the surface through oceanic crust and hit cold water, precipitating out these metals around black smokers. These smokers can produce about 4 kg of gold a year ie Lihar island in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>There's many other emplacement mechanisms for gold and other heavy metals and I'd happily describe some more in details if anyone's interested.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would the binary neutron star origin of the elements imply that they were delivered by meteors after Earth's formation rather than being mixed into the protoplanetary disc already?</p></div>		</li>
