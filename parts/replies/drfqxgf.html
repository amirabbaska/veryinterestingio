			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed! If anyone is interested in the science of sleep, I highly recommend the book &quot;Why We Sleep&quot; by Dr. Matthew Walker, neuroscientist. I'm in the middle of reading it and it has totally BLOWN my mind so far. The human brain is nuts! Fascinating stuff and has a 4.5 on goodreads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for claryfying. I'm no professor, just a 17 year old student and just wrote about what I knew from my head so there's bound to be some misinformation. There's alot of factors that play their part when it comes to sleep overall but melatonin is the main one</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, melatonin plays a very minor role in feelings of sleepiness (OP's original question). Melatonin can somewhat  influence the timing of sleep, but is not really responsible for feelings of sleepiness. Biggest players are buildup of sleep pressure (aka adenosine) and backing off of circadian alerting signals which permits sleep pressure to take over. Did my PhD and postdoc in this area so I know it well. </p></div>		</li>
