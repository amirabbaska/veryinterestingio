			<div class="markdown"><p>The huge mass curves space-time and things 'roll' on top of it, light included. In the absence of this huge mass, space-time is 'flat' and 'things' propagate in a straight manner : their velocities remained unchanged along their trajectory, they don't experience acceleration, and we interpret this as an absence of gravity. </p>
<p>As soon as you introduce any kind of energy (and mass is a form of energy), it curves space time, velocities are altered when 'things' enter this space and that's gravity.</p></div>		</li>
