<p>Think of it like a rowboat, where each person rows one after the other. One boat has 6 stronger guys rowing, and the other has 8 weaker guys. But their combined strength is equal.</p>
<p>So if you're pulling something heavy, fewer stronger guys is better. If you are pulling something light and want to accelerate quickly, then more rowers is better.</p>

<p>This is not accurate at all. </p>
<p>*To explain further for others <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6kp0hb/eli5_what_is_the_difference_between_a_v6_and_a_v8/djoo0qr/" target="_blank">(and watch this dude hang himself)</a>;</p>
<p>In order for a v6 to make the same power as a v8 of the same displacement, the v6 will have a larger bore and shorter stroke. Both of these things are terrible for &quot;pulling something heavy&quot; It both results in less low end torque, and higher wear, which is huge concern for high load. Less cylinders with the same displacement also means less efficient cooling, less efficient breathing and a whole host of other things. </p>
<p>**I think akoustyk has a buddy moderator or something, he whines to them, they delete anything proving he's wrong, even when it's nowhere near inflammatory. Suffice to say, guy doesn't know what he's talking about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not even the least bit correct.</p>
<p>You just described the difference between a motor that makes power at low revvs (torquey motor) vs high revvs (peaky motor).  That has no intrinsic correlation to cylinder count.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. The power is the same. The torque is going to depend on how the car is geared. </p>
<p>The big issue is that a V6 with displacement as much as a V8 will necessarily have much larger pistons than average. That causes a lot more mechanical stress as well as some other problems like not burning all your fuel up each cycle.</p>
<p>EDIT: And according to some other people also leads to lower total HP than the V6 with the same displacement.  </p></div>		</li>
