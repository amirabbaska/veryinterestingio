			<div class="markdown"><p>Solvated ions (read salt) are part of the solution. Reverse osmosis is forcing the ions to stay on one side while the water flows through to the other. If it helps to think about it that way, the solvated ions are bonded to the water. In reverse osmosis you have to break these bonds.</p>
<p>Filtration is removing particles from the solution, but these particles are not solvated and therefore not part of the solution. Entirely mechanical process if you will because you're not breaking bonds.</p>
<p>(Reverse) Osmosis is a distinctly different process and thus has it's own name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not an expert but in treatment plants that I have worked at, reverse osmosis processing doesn't flow the same way other filters do. There is a percentage of reject water that carries the contaminates away. The membranes do not &quot;catch&quot; anything like a filter does. Instead, you end up with some water that is purer than the original, and some that is dirtier than the original. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of your traditional Brita Filter as a window screen. It will stop animals, leaves and bugs from coming into your house and let through a lot of air, including smoke, bacteria, scents etc...</p>
<p>The Reverse Osmosis water system would be like living in a surgical O.R. They have air handlers with HEPA filters and UV light filters and nothing dangerous or dirty is getting past that. But that &quot;extra clean&quot; air requires a lot more energy and technology to operate instead of just the window screen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except in your brita filter every drop of water passes through the filter.  In an RO some passes through and some becomes a separate more concentrated stream. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true, my analogy was just geared to the purity differences I guess. </p></div>		</li>
