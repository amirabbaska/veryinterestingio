			<div class="markdown"><p>I once spent an evening failing at water skiing, essentially being drug face first behind a boat for a couple hours--only being <em>partially</em> hyperbolic here--and afterward I had the most debilitating headache. It was terrible. I took the max ibuprofen and laid in the dark for hours until I eventually fell asleep. I'm assuming this is what it was from. Can it be extreme enough to actually harm you besides ruining an evening? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably had water stuck in your sinuses.  It happens a lot in water sports, and can sometimes come unclogged at the weirdest times, gushing water over everything.  The amount of it (probably from being dragged face first) was what gave you the headache, but it's basically harmless.</p>
<p>In diving sports, on the other hand, the difference in pressure can become dangerous, causing your eardrums to burst.  You are taught ways to &quot;pop&quot; your ears, equalizing the pressure.</p></div>		</li>
