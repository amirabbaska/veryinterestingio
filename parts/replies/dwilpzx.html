			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't it just a couple years ago when it was announced a new capybara sized mammal was discovered and everyone was flipping out saying &quot;omg how have we not discovered something this big until now?&quot; and then reading the article, you realized this animal has been discovered for decades but it was named something else, and nobody realized it was actually a different species until recently.</p>
<p>Always be wary when some new 'discovery' pops up that seems too obvious to have been missed.</p>
<p>Edit: Yup, found it <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/15/world/americas/new-mammal-smithsonian/index.html" target="_blank">https://edition.cnn.com/2013/08/15/world/americas/new-mammal-smithsonian/index.html</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously, though, this is why I love reddit--all the random extra info just because it's interesting and somewhat within the spectrum of the discussion! Thanks for the link!</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I mean TBH what constitutes a separate 'species' is pretty much arbitrary and wildly inconsistent. Classic example would be Wolves, Coywolves, Coyotes, Coydogs, Dogs, and Wolfdogs. </p>
<p>All of those cross breed readily across the variety of 'species' of wolves and coyotes, TBH most dog breeds have more variation, but are all one 'species'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with this example based on the history of both interstitium and Pluto. We observed the presence of the tissue without understanding it's purpose, which is astronomically equivalent to observing gravitational effects and inferring the presence some mass somewhere. Finding out that the mass is in fact a new planet at the edges of the solar system (not Pluto) would be more similar scientifically to finding out that mass of tissue is actually a functional organ, so I'd say that the downgrade from discovery to &quot;reclassification&quot; is unnecessary, as this a textbook scientific discovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of that is the manufacturers, batteries that don't lose capacity over time would make devices like smartphone, laptops, etc last much longer. Today's device vendors want you to replace your things every year or two, max.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The comment you are replying to is incorrect. That commenter does not have an understanding of the publication. Though it's understandable, because they use terms that can be misleading if you aren't familiar with the field. They did make a new discovery, because current methods for preparing tissues for microscope slides destroys the structure they discovered, so they had to use a special technique to preserve that structure. This technique allowed them to see the structure in a more representative form for the first time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more a technical advance than a anatomy discovery. The functions were already know, they just compiled everything to support their argument to make it an organ and let the newspapers do all the work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna go ahead and pull the medical student card here. These people believe they've found new functions like &quot;shock absorption&quot; while I've been studying about lubrication on the serosal surfaces of organs, and the interstitial fluid that contains anchoring proteins, facilitates oxygen diffusion, and a whole host of other things.</p>
<p>Maybe these folks actually did identify some previously-undescribed features, but they most definitely did not identify a new organ, or lift some veil off of a big secret. We learn new things about previously-known tissues and organs all the time. That's how we get better at medicine. But everybody wants something big to put their name on, which is why half the diseases you've heard of have completely unhelpful names, from dead doctors and biologists.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This paper is just an argument of some scientists for reclassification of a tissue. They say &quot;New functions were found&quot;... This isn't even new, this was like everyone taught me how things work. How did they think the exchange of substances worked in a multi cell organisms worked? By magic?</p></div>		</li>
