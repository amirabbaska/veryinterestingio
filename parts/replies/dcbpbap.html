			<div class="markdown"><p>Many studies showing that lots of fish oil sold is actually rancid. I have excellent results putting a bit of oil (coconut, argan) directly on the lips, though it does take practice not to lick the oil off (using SMALL amounts and rubbing them gently into the lips helps a lot).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get the same results when I take fish oil in fairly high quantities, too. Also, my skin becomes suuuuuuuper supple and soft. Fair warning: Fish oil is not for someone with clotting disorder(s), or someone on blood thinners. If you're on prescription medicine, ask your doc before adding in supplements. *</p>
<p>My dose was recommended to me by my doc for specific deficiencies, YMMV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is about what I take daily (I also eat salmon twice a week, as many weeks as I can). I fricking love the stuff with garlic, butter and zucchini noodles. Lucky for me i have no clotting disorders to mess up and make worse, so it's a win for me. I've also heard of folks having trouble with their teeth discoloring at high doses of fish oil? Never happened to me in all the years I've used it.</p></div>		</li>
