			<div class="markdown"><p>I get the short-lived high tone bursts of ringing perhaps once a month. Is that not normal?</p>
<p>Also I was always taught it happened due to the &quot;hairs&quot; in the inner ear &quot;falling off&quot; due to wear, was that nonsense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this all the time - easily once or twice a month since I was a kid. Always in the left ear only, though.</p>
<p>If it’s cells or hairs dying at least my right ear is doing ok??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its the result of broken or damaged cilia in the ear getting caught on other cilia iirc.</p>
<p>As long as its not constant its not a problem.</p>
<p>I personally have tinnitus. Silence is truly deafening.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, since going to NHRA drag races with those cars screaming down the drag track at 10,000hp without ear protection since i was 8 (used ear protection for the first few years cause of dad making me, but stopped) i also have a low key tenitis ring when its quiet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this at least once a week, usually just randomly. I’ve honestly found that snapping my fingers next to my ear (giving myself something else to focus on) makes it go away within a couple of seconds (or at least lets me ignore it)</p>
<p>You are not alone lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For mine I can purely concentrate on it, and it will still fade out within 30 seconds of it happening.</p>
<p>It seems to happen randomly, maybe once a week or less. Last time it happened it was my left ear, but haven’t had any instances in my life where either ear was used a lot more than the other. It’s been happening for as long as I can remember though.</p>
<p>I tend to have my music down pretty low though, I’ve been worried about deafness my whole life. I’m glad I started doing that though because having my computer volume on 4/100 is perfectly loud enough for me now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction.
It is when there is a problem with how the jaw connects to the skull, near your temples. There is an auditory nerve nearby, and the nerve can be disrupted if the jaw does not connect right, which can cause tinnitus. It can also cause many other symptoms, like jaw clicking when chewing, jaw getting tired easily from chewing, etc.</p>
<p>Neuromuscular dentists can take a jaw scan to find the optimal jaw alignment, and then create a night splint to wear at night which can, over time, correct the misalignment. This is <strong>not</strong> the same thing as a retainer that normal dentists and orthodontists make, those do not fix TMD.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't we all have some sort of white noise when in a silent room/place?. I've been told that this is the blood running next to the ear. In this case, the chronic one is just default. We just don't experience it at all times. You can't &quot;hear nothingness&quot;</p></div>		</li>
