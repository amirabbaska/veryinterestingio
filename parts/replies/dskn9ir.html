<p>does this mean I don't really need to swipe apps off the Android Overview</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Exactly this, same deal for iOS as well.</p>
<p>Here's the problem; the operating system made swiping away apps incredibly fun and satisfying, so people do it quite mindlessly when they're just holding their phones. It took me a couple of months to get used to not swiping away apps, and I still do it every now and then, but I've got much better at managing this habit.</p>
<p>It's also become a weird cultural thing. Traditionally, seeing hundreds of web-browser tabs open horrifies people at the amount of inefficient processing and memory consumption that's going on for something no-one is using. People carried this belief over to smart-phone apps, which was kind of true in the old days of Android (but not any more). Even strangers in public seeing my phone screen comment at how many apps I have open - it's that much of a cultural aspect that strangers are willing to comment on someone's private phone-screen out in the open.</p>
<p><del>I don't think iOS does this (never noticed it do this)</del> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7pvzmu/eli5_what_does_ios_do_differently_to_android_for/dskyall/" target="_blank">iOS does this also</a>; but Android actually clears the tasks itself in the background, so the huge list of apps cleans itself up as the OS needs to (it is making these decisions based on what's best for your phone's battery and performance!).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes it's still helpful to swipe away apps. </p>
<p>On Android, a process' RAM consumption is categorized into one of 6 different labels:</p>
<p>Foreground App, Visible App, Secondary Server, hidden App, content provider, and empty app. </p>
<p>Each category is allotted a certain amount of RAM, and allowed to perform certain functions. When you swipe away an app, it doesn't fully kill the app, however, in general, it pushes it into the Empty App category, which dramatically reduces the ram it can consume, and does some other ART stuff to make it lie dormant but ready to be reawoken. If you never swipe away an app, the app will never be pushed into the empty app classification. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the app is misbehaving you might want to kill it, otherwise in terms of recovering system resources, the OS already does that all by it self.</p>
<p>You can see it in action, just load up a couple of really memory heavy games up, and then go use another app.</p>
<p>Go back to your games and it'll reload them instead of just task switching, cause there wasn't enough system resources to keep everything in memory.</p></div>		</li>

Append 2.4 and 5 to the end of the WiFi name and make sure the chromecast and your streaming device are both on the same one and it will connect instantly every time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do admit, they are still useful for these circumstances. Personally I see these situations happen less and less frequently on my devices, but I imagine there's people out there that depend on buggy apps that cause these problems.</p>
<p>The issue is that everyone is in the habit of killing every single app on their device whenever they feel like it.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see the issue and I don't have the habit of killing apps but we definitely need the ability to kill an app. I would have to restart my phone whenever an app freezes or if there is some weird layout bug, way too inconvenient, this also happens to mainstream apps on iOS and it will also happen in the future with new versions of iOS</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah idk - I have to kill frozen apps several times a day and I wouldn’t say that I’m relying on obscure apps or anything. Being able to force quit an app seems pretty critical to me even if it’s irrelevant for memory and power management. Even if I only had to do it once a month though, when you need it, it’s a hell of a lot more convenient than having to restart your entire device.</p>
<p>That said, it’s super interesting to know that doing so will harm memory management and battery life. Your explanation of how this stuff works was a really eye opening - thanks!! </p>
<p>Side question: do you foresee android apps starting to run away from IOS in terms of performance? My experience is that for a long time, apps that ran great on IOS were typically sluggish and buggy on Android. Will that change over time with ART or is that not related to the stuff you are talking about? </p></div>		</li>

<p>The Youtube app on iOS used to bugs out if while you are writing a comment, you Home button out of the app, and open a video from Safari. You can't post your comment because it's a different video now and you can't close the &quot;comment dialog box&quot; properly.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you're right, to an extent. Nothing is killed by closing it until the system needs whatever resources that app is using.</p>
<p>When an app has done something requiring killing I've found also that I have to go into settings/apps and force stop it there. Closing, swiping away, reopening usually just returns me to to frozen screen</p></div>		</li>
