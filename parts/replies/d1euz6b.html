			<div class="markdown"><p>How long does it linger in the skin? I've noticed if I make something onion or garlic heavy, like curries or stir fry, it'll be days later and I can still smell it seeping through my armpits while in the shower,  or at work. Personally I like it buuuut I'm worrying how it affects my dateability... my normal perfume is pineapple but lately I've been all garlic. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an anecdotal counter-point, a coworker of mine has an Indian brother-in-law and apparently Indians think white people have a noticeable smell due to our meat heavy diet. </p>
<p>And I have a gay friend who will rant about pizza's effect on semen to no end.</p>
<p>So perhaps all of our foods contribute and we're simply used to it.</p>
<p>Added: Oh, and one of my floormates in university grew up on a pig farm. Everything about him had a pig farm smell to it that he was blind too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hence the ayurvedic concept of 'tamas' being heavy, rotting, pungent smells seem to do with sulfur compounds. Not thiosulfates but -sulfides.</p>
<p>There is also mushrooms, fungi, and fermented products such as blue vein cheese, foie gras, etc etc.</p></div>		</li>
