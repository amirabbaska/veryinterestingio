			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on your perfect reply for OP's sake, sound works much the same way.  For sure, the analogy isn't perfect.  Sound energy does get absorbed by air and other obstacles, and light does not get absorbed by empty space.  However, much of the reason sound gets quieter as it gets further away from the source is that the sound energy is being spread out over a larger and larger sphere centered on the source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely right, but a grain of salt is that we perceive sound on a log scale, so twice as far seems more than 1/4 as loud, though it is 1/4 the energy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We perceive light in a log scale as well.  Twice as many photons does not seem twice as bright.  PLUS we have an iris to further increase dynamic range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding again to the great reply from /u/iorgfeflkd </p>
<p>Light travelling through space from the sun to a planet (say venus or mars) does not lose energy when individual photons are considered. What does happen is that the density of photons declines as they are spread over a greater area.</p>
<p>Photons due lose some energy due to relativistic effects (due to the mass of the sun) and by absorption by molecules in space but these are negligible factors on the scales we are discussing.</p>
<p>A blue photon from the sun is still blue when it hits mars. Its just less likely to hit mars because mars is so small when viewed from the sun.</p>
<p>A blue photon from a distant galaxy will have less energy in our frame of reference due to the expansion of the universe. It will be more red. Again, this is not relevant within the solar system, but handy to know anyway. That same blue photon will still have the same energy (or color) from the perspective of the galaxy it came from, even billions of years later.</p></div>		</li>
