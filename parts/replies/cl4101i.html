			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is the most important point. The size of games were small because they had to be. They had to be as efficient with their space as possible, do more with less. Art from adversity.</p>
<p>It's the same reason game quality gets better within the same generation. Xbox 360 games from 2014 look better than Xbox 360 games from 2005, despite using the same hardware and maximum game size. It's because developers learned more and better techniques for achieving more with the same resources. They learned how to be more efficient with how they created parts of their game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Art from adversity&quot; is, I think, why those games will always hold a special place in my heart.  Music especially from the NES (and some SNES) era was just so good, and I believe it's because developers were forced to produce something amazing with very little resources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in complete agreement with you Nazgren.</p>
<p>The music from the 8bit era was incredible. I know it goes without saying, but look at Megaman. Arguably the best soundtrack ever made for a video game/series.</p>
<p>And what was the size of Megaman 2 and 3? Both were less than a quarter of a megabyte big.</p>
<p>So awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason you like the music more, is because it has an easily recognized  tune along with being made to be catchy instead of setting the mood.</p>
<p>For example: The Battlefield theme is pretty good. That's because they put an easily recognizable tune in it (DA-DUN-DUN-DUN-DA-DUN-DUN).</p>
<p>It's basically why, when you listen to some OSTs, even though they were awesome in the movie, they're terrible when you listen to them by themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when I was a kid and saw some TV interview both someone to do with gaming talking about these new CD things. The interviewer asked 'does this mean we will get better games?' He replied 'oh god no but it allows us to use more things to make them and room to try new things'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Optimizing for a specific platform is also far more easier than optimizing for PC and mobile. With a console, you have hardware you know will remain consistant among all users. You can write to the metal if you'd wanted to (in the case of Ocarina of Time, a cartridge).</p>
<p>Compare that to Candy Crush, a mobile game, which devs wanted to target as many devices as possible. There is no consistant one phone or phone OS for that matter. The programmers need to go higher level than on the metal if they want to sell to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Depth vs. breadth, in a way.</p>
<p>*Edit: The farther you go away from the metal, the less optimization techniques there are for you, in a way. You can still compress audio and assets, but the shenanigans you can do if you can rely on calculations from the hardware to be done? Most excellent. Computers find it a lot easier to math the hell outta stuff.
Even in webdev, generating a circle through CSS is so much more lightweight than uploading a .png of circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a tangential note, if you want to fit more clothes into a suitcase, one solution is to tightly roll everything that you can.  By that I mean, take a shirt, or a pair of pants, fold it in half once, and then roll it up like a Fruit Roll-Up.  I've done this and I was definitely able to fit more stuff in my suitcase.</p>
<p>Apparently, rolling puts clothes in a more space-efficient shape than folding.  I'm not really sure.  I think there might be dark powers at work here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a great example of this is when you look at the original Pokemon Gold and Silver. When they first coded it, it pretty much took up the whole cartridge. Satoru Iwata compressed it, and now they had literally enough space to double the game content by adding Kanto.</p></div>		</li>
