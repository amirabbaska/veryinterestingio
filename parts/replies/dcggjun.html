<p>The engine is free to start using, but you have to pay royalties if you make over a certain amount of money. So for big companies that expect to sell a lot of copies, the price may not be worth it.</p>

<p>Big companies still can buy UE4 once and then never pay royalties. Epic doesn't solely offer the &quot;free&quot; version.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that's true. But the details of how much that costs is negotiated on a case by case basis, so I can only guess at how good those deals might be.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Being dependent on another company's technology also has some risks. What if Epic go out of business? Or they get bought out and stop selling their engine? Or they change the licensing deals? If those things happen you might find your company left without a tech base to make games with. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the real reason. If you have the manpower, its often better to have ownership of the code. Even when you have the source, the experts are not in-house and you often get issues where bugs and missing features cause the project to blow out the budget as the code is not well understood.</p>
<p>It's much more reliable to have everything in-house and have bug fixing and feature requests be as simple as a tap on the shoulder.</p>
<p>There are however times when this is not ideal, in smaller companies building your own engine can cause the project to blow out and is a common mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a game like say GTA or Call of Duty, 5% is a huge amount.</p>
<p>Companies like that wouldn't get the standard deal though, they could probably arrange something else. But still, they obviously consider the money better spent working on their own engines.</p>
<p>The thing with steam is, they might take a 30% cut of each sale, but they're acting as the retailer. So it's not as bad as it sounds considering other retailers would take a similar cut.</p>
<p>It's pretty favourable compared to consoles where the console company takes a pretty big cut in addition to the retailers cut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Retailers of physical games have to buy the games beforehand, pay for shipping, store bills, employee wages for each store, etc.</p>
<p>Steam doesn't have to buy the games, there is zero retail store cost and their customer support is well, almost non existent. And their cut is still larger than whatever Gamestop or other retailers get.</p></div>		</li>

Let's assume I'm the last ~2 years they made another billion (due to releases for next gen) </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but I doubt it costs less than 5% of the profits/cost of a game to build the engine. Makes sense for big developers that make an engine for multiple games and just have to adapt it, but for smaller ones not really.</p>
<p>Plus I doubt they'd be able to make one that looks as good or runs as well as UE. Yeah, it will run well or look good depending on how well the game is done but it's still a much better foundation than most devs can afford to make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That 5% is most likely less than it would cost to develop your own engine. And it takes all the risk out. If your game doesn't sell well, you didn't waste a lot of money building an engine too.</p></div>		</li>
