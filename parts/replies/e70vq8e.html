			<div class="markdown"><p>That can explain why a movement is shaky during a lift or while exerting a significant force, but I got the impression the OP was asking about the &quot;tremors&quot; or &quot;spasms&quot; that your muscles have <em>after</em> they are done being used. For example, you might go back to the gym for the first time in a couple years, put in a solid workout on your arms/biceps, and then your hand might be shaky for an hour or two afterwards even under little to no load.</p>
<p>From other comments in the thread this might <em>also</em> have to do with the nervous system, but more from long-term fatigue than short-term inefficiency. I don't know that much about it, though.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you had OP's intentions correct with your initial response! Both are interesting phenomena, in any case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point! It does say 'after' using them.</p>
<p>But the explanation is similar. Motor unit fatigue would then cause the inefficiency of contraction after the activity as well, now with more simple and lighter movements and loads.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They shake because your neurological system is not efficient at recruiting motor units.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you have a source for that? </p>
<p>I don't mean to sound suspicious - I'm not. I just have heard that explanation several times over the years and while it appears pretty intuitive, I can't find a source for it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a little tough to dig up references for theoretical things like this. I did a quick google but I need to look in a textbook for one specifically. </p>
