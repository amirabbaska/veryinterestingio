			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/but-not-simpler/excerpts-from-the-mad-scientiste28099s-handbook-so-youe28099re-ready-to-vaporize-a-human/" target="_blank">this source</a> it'd take about 3 GJ to completely dissociate all bonds in a human body, and about 142 MJ to vaporise all of the water in a human body. A human body has a frontal area of about 1.5 m^2 (give or take), so to completely dissociate, we are talking an irradiance of 2 GJ/m^2. Let's for example assume a one megaton bomb. About 35% of the yield is in thermal radiation, so that gives about 1500000 GJ of thermal radiation. If we assume that they are radiated uniformly in a sphere, we get 2 GJ/m^2 at a radius of 244 m. For the 142 MJ vaporisation energy, we have an irradiance of ~0.095 GJ/m^2, and a radius of 1120 m.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's being said is that for complete disassociation (so that no two atoms in your body are left connected together) is at 244m, but for all the water in your body to vaporise you need only (only!) be within 1120m of a 1Mt bomb. </p>
<p>Of course, all the water in your body being vaporised is totally a fatal event, and it's worth bearing in mind that there are other ranges that are fatal for a human - such as being covered in third degree burns, or shock, or radiation poisoning, etc etc.</p>
<p>It's also worth comparing the 1Mt figure to the size of actual devices - The minuteman 1 had a 1Mt warhead, but these have all been replaced now in the US with the largest being the minuteman III with a 300kt warhead (<a href="http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/" target="_blank">taken from here</a>) which is just under 1/3 the size calculated above, however the Trident II warhead is at 455Kt so is about half a Mt.</p>
<p>The US does have some 1.2Mt missiles, and the Russians have 800Kt missiles (and possibly up to 2.4Mt) - they also tested a 50Mt bomb, but those are old and aircraft dropped. They have designed the Tsar Bomba which is 100Mt, but those have never been tested.</p>
<p>The Chinese current missile, the Dong Feng 5, is 5Mt, the French have 300Kt warheads, India has 60Kt and Pakistan 45Kt</p>
<p>Even the Pakistani bomb would give a person 50% 3rd degree burns at roughly a 2 mile range, and without medical care that amount of burns would likely be fatal. And that's one of the smallest current warheads.</p>
<p>Depressed yet? ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you really mean by vaporize. They are saying given the assumptions presented, the human body would be completely disintegrated within 244m. To just turn the water in the human body to gas takes much less energy, and this would happen within 1120m. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you must take in account the efficiency of the heat transfer into the body.
Essentially the front of the body will absorb all the energy and become superheated, but this shields the back of the body.   The heat will be mainly distributed by diffusion, which is slow.</p>
<p>I think for a body to be vaporized,  you have to be so close to a very high yield bomb that  you are in local pocket of hot gas close to the bomb. First so that you are pulverized by the pressure first which will maybe increase your surface area and secondly the hot gasses will keep heating your tissues after the flash.</p>
<p>Remember those nuclear shadows at Hiroshima? They always tell that those people vaporised. But the bombs exploded at a height of 500 m. And were only about 5 kT. So there was not enough energy for them to be vaporised.
They were probably horribly horribly burned, those people got up and ran away. And if they were lucky they were killed by the blast wave some seconds later.  I'm pretty sure they didn't die instantly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here a sum of the Lester info:</p>
<p>It is possible to vaporize a human body, based on a study conducted by the Journal of Interdisciplinary Science Topics (JIST). Their experiment included an average adult male at 78 kg with a proper calorie intake of 2,500 cals per day can be vaporized. Bones are the hardest material in a human’s body. Bone are 20% water, 10% Type 1 collagen fibres, and 70% calcium. The skeleton creates about 15% of a human’s body weight, calcium hydroxyapatite creates about 70% of the bone mass. In the theory they made calcium account for 100% of the bone mass.. A human is 70% water, so an average 78kg male would have 56.4kg of water in their body. After vaporizing the bone mass and water constituents, the organic tissue and “dry material” would follow it. After calculations, it would take 62.9×10^3 kJ to completely dissociate the average adult male.</p>
<p>(Note I'm pretty sure I fucked up the calculation but it's still a decent idea and saves a few pages of complicated physics)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some good fiction on this subject (although fiction highly supported by research), check out Tom Clancy's &quot;The Sum of All Fears.&quot; Excerpt below from chapter 36:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sergeant Ed Yankevich should have been the first to notice what was happening. His eyes were on the van, and he was walking in that direction, scarcely forty feet away, but the human nervous system works in milliseconds and no faster.
The fizzle had just ended when the first radiation reached the police officer. These were gamma rays, which are actually photons, the same stuff that light waves are made of, but far more energetic. They were already attacking the body of the truck as well, causing the sheet steel to fluoresce like neon. Immediately behind the gammas were X-rays, also composed of photons but less energetic. The difference was lost on Yankevich, who would be the first to die.
The intense radiation was most readily absorbed by his bones, which rapidly heated to incandescence, while at the same time the neurons of his brain were simultaneously excited as
though each had become a flashbulb. In fact, Sergeant Yankevich was unable to notice a thing. He literally disintegrated, exploded from within by the tiny fraction of energy his body was able to absorb as the rest raced through him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clancy seems to think that the gammas would have time to fry you from the inside out before the thermal pulse reaches you. Probably talking milliseconds of difference here, but important to note for completeness.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The speed of EM radiation through air does not depend on its frequency*. Gamma, xrays, visible light, IR and microwaves would all arrive at the same time. </p>
<p>There's also the mechanical compression shock wave that travels very much slower. </p>
<p>*Frequencies are scattered differently by air but the speed is the same.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only if they're generated at the same time. I believe the gammas are generated earlier than the thermal pulse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything lower energy then gamma/x rays are blocked by the still intact bomb casing. The process of thermal radiation being released happens on a drastically slower time scale as the bomb casing becomes plasma, radiates heat to the van, turning it to plasma, finally radiating IR through the air- long after the initial nuclear reaction.</p>
<p>EDIT: I realized the bomb will turn to plasma from gamma rays blowing all the electrons off it's nuclei, which renders it opaque to IR radiation. Heat will transfer slowly outwards by being absorbed and remitted in the hot plasma, but basically no IR radiation form the bomb core will ever make it out. Basically how heat moves from the core of the sun up to the convection zone.</p></div>		</li>
