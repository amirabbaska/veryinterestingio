			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and didn't violate agreements not to expand NATO east... This is all Russia's fault for responding agressively and trying to maintain a buffer zone.</p>
<p>They even responded by annexing their only warmwater port after a country was destabilized by US funded groups. How could they.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's be honest: the legitimate, democratically elected government of Ukraine opted for closer ties to Russia. Then a protest of mostly liberal students and millennials from Kiev and the western part of the country unseated that government with moral and possibly actual support from &quot;the West&quot;, disenfranchising all those that voted for the government that was democratically elected but overthrown. It would be as if the Canadian government was overthrown by a Russia friendly mob while Russia sat back smugly voicing support for the mob. We'd have troops in Canada so fast your head would spin. So that's what Russia did, it sent troops to support the pro-government, pro-Russian half of the country that resided along the Ukrainian border with Russia. Was it right? Who knows. Right and wrong go out the window when elected governments are overturned by a coup and their voters disenfranchised. As far as Russia sees it, Ukraine opted for closer ties to Russia so &quot;the West&quot; sponsored a complete collapse and takeover of the country because they didn't get their way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The legitimate democratically elected president that was exiled by the Ukraine parliament (also democratically elected) for high treason, you say?</p>
<p>Interesting interpretation. And here I thought one of the primary purposes of parliament was scrutinizing the rest of the government. Interesting indeed.</p></div>		</li>
