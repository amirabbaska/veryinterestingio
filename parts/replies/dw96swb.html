<p>So... muscle is muscle?  if I were to scrape the muscle out of an ant, cook it, and eat it, my body would treat it just like any other muscle I eat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor contrary point, but an exoskeleton is proportionally much heavier than an endoskeleton. Hence the lack of giant (or even &quot;big&quot;) land arthropods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the reason why bugs aren't huge (thank god) is that there isn't enough oxygen to supply all of their tissues in our atmospheric oxygen concentration. This works the same way by comparing surface area which scales by r squared and their volume which scales by r cubed. Bugs intake air through small pores all throughout their bodies. If the bugs are too big, oxygen will run out in the pores before it reaches central tissues and they die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of multiple problems. In the past there <em>were</em> larger insects... larger, <em>flatter</em> insects in particular. Same solution to both problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, this raises a question. Would it be possible to deliberately breed novelty species of terrifyingly large insects? Raise them in high-oxygen enclosures and selectively breed them for larger body size? They do have a very rapid generation cycle, so it might be doable on relatively short timelines (decades rather than millennia.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random question, but do animals with exoskeletons, like ants, ever use hydro-static pressure in their segments to stiffen or move joints?  I can see them using it for expansion purposes, but I always wondered in any animal evolved hydraulics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spiders definitely do this, this is why they curl up when they die - the internal pressure gets released and there's nothing to hold their legs in place.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure this is also how velvet worms move.</p></div>		</li>
