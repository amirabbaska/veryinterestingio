<p>Imagine being jewish and knowing a neo nazi got your kidney- that kind of thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't even have to be that extreme.</p>
<p>One of the things they told me is that the recipient is decided upon a number of factors (none of which I get to know or weigh in on, but I knew that) and it will go where it can do the greatest good.  That might be a 15 year old kid, or it might be a 55 year old man.  Some people get disappointed because their organs went to someone older who has less life left to live and they feel the gift did less overall good.</p>
<p>There are also instances where, for whatever reason, the recipient rejects the organ and needs a new one or passes away.  As the donor, that would be heartbreaking and some people would rather not know anything than take the chance that they might learn their gift didn't really help at all.</p>
<p>FWIW, I told my coordinator that I'm open to being contacted when/if I donate, but that it is up to the recipient to initiate - I don't want to put any pressure on them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are all good points. I can imagine thered be a lot of reasons for it. Obviously we cannot pick and choose where our organs go. they're doled out based on need because not everyone is compatible. </p>
<p>I wouldn't want to know either quite honestly. One its left me- it isn't mine anymore. its not part of me. Its not my fucking problem. Someone lived- thats what matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Death would be the worst. If they never left the hospital I would feel sad for them and upset that I went through all that, gave up an organ and it was for nothing.   I mean if they had a good year I could cope better but if the body rejected immediately I would be heartbroken for them and me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm donating a kidney, so YMMV with other donations.</p>
<p>Most cities of any size will have hospitals that do organ transplants.  I looked up the one in my city and there was a form to fill out if you were interested in being a &quot;Good Samaritan&quot; donor (you were not attempting to donate to a specific individual).  </p>
<p>You fill out some basic health questions and if you qualify, you start working with a transplant coordinator to go through all the <em>additional</em> tests to figure out the protein and antibody markers that determine who you are compatible with and ensure you are both physically and mentally healthy enough to donate (this is the stage I am at).</p>
<p>Once all that is done, you wait until you are needed.  This can take a couple of weeks to a couple of months.  Once the transplant committee has selected the recipient that can use your organ the most, they work with you to schedule the surgery.  You spend about two days in the hospital for the surgery and about a week at home on bed rest.</p>
<p>After that, you get semi-regular checkups for about two years to ensure you are doing alright.</p>
<p>All of this is covered by the recipients insurance - donors don't pay for anything.</p>
<p>The risk is very low and a great many Americans can donate with virtually no impact to their lives afterwards (some studies show donors live <em>longer</em> than non-donors, but no one knows why).  If one out of every 1,000 Americans would choose to donate, we would have <em>no one</em> left on the waiting list; as it stands today, 13 people die <em>every day</em> waiting on a kidney.  Despite all this, in 2014 (the most recent year I have data for) only <em>181</em> people made the choice to be Good Samaritan donors and only 5,538 people total chose to be living donors at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reddit had a thread awhile back about whether people would/would not donate their organs on death. I was appalled at the number of people who basically said &quot;Nah. They're mine and I don't want to.&quot; </p>
<p>DUDE YOU'RE FUCKING DEAD WHO CARES?</p>
<p>So I hope you smile knowing that some random stranger on the internet is proud of your decision to donate while you're still alive and for no reason other than being a good person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My country doesn't even allow live donation to strangers. The legal process is pretty simple if it's between genetic relatives, but between friends or even spouses, you need permission from an ethics committee.</p>
<p>It's really selfless of you by the way, not many people would offer their kidney and go through surgery for a complete stranger.</p></div>		</li>
