			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. And on a related note, it seems that the type of life described in your namesake actually do exist.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we use &quot;fillers&quot; like titanium dioxide, calcium carbonate, and clay internally among the woods fibers and externally in coatings to scatter light which not only increases opacity but creates a more uniform look. If you look at microscopic images of the particles, you can see that especially TiO2 has a very spikey shape to it. This creates a lot of different surfaces facing different directions that throw light around randomly. </p>
<p>Where you can run into trouble is the formulation of other additives. We have solvents that suspend our latex or styrene butadiene, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, or starch solution external coatings or print varnishes that can all have the effect described by crnaruka. They can fill in the voids around the filler and negate the scattering. This is a very common method of forgers to fake watermarks. They will use oils to draw the watermark onto a note. A real watermark is created by a difference in fiber distribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why do wr observe Mie scattering in clouds but Rayleigh Scattering in the sky?  What does the particle size have to do with it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right. The color of the sky is dominated by small molecules and atoms, which are far smaller than the wavelength of light. In contrast droplets in clouds and fluctuations in the structure of things like paper often occur on a length scale comparable to visible light.</p></div>		</li>
