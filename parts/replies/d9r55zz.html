			<div class="markdown"><p>PhD student in Electromagnetics Engineering here. We actually just learned a bit about this in my Propagation class.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are other mechanisms in play as well, but one significant effect is that of ionizing radiation on the atmosphere. UV and X-ray radiation from the sun has enough energy to knock electrons loose from (ionize) gas particles in the ionosphere. The index of refraction is a function of the number of free electrons.</p>
<p>(If you're interested, <a href="http://imgur.com/wehgvx1" target="_blank">this</a>* (EDIT: Whoops, the index of refraction should be squared!) is what the equation looks like. This is an extremely simplified version of a formula called the Appleton-Hartree equation under a number of assumptions, but it gets across the main idea).</p>
<p>Free electrons may recombine with positive ions or attach to neutral molecules to form negative ions. Both of these effects reduce the number of free electrons, N, in the atomosphere. During the day, the rate of production of free electrons exceeds the rate of recombination/attachment, so N gradually increases. But at night, when there is no incident ionizing radiation, the electrons continually recombine/attach, steadily reducing N over the course of the night.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr:</strong> Ionizing radiation from the sun causes the index of refraction of the ionosphere to change over the course of the day, so the index of refraction is very different at dawn than at sunset.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you really think any ionospheric emissions are visible from the earth's surface? Particularly around sunrise/sunset? You can see airglow in long exposure photographs taken from the ground or from space but that's about it I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked this question to a chemistry post-doc and she told me that te composition of the atmosphere was slightly different in the morning rather than at night. The night is cool and the day is hot while certain particles react to sunlight. That affects density, clouds, and chemistry just enough for the sky to be visibly different at sunrise and sunset. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I'm on board with this.  I've noticed that, since moving to SoCal from the midwest, sunrises are significantly more orange and sunsets are a lot more blue.  The only time we get the same orange/red sunset that I was used to in the midwest is when there are fires or the santa anas are blowing all the smog out to sea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is how I always heard of it, in terms of Rayleigh scattering: as far as light is concerned, our atmosphere and vapor molecules ARE pollution in the sense that it's all getting in the way and making photons refract and diffuse across space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. I'm sure OP meant pollution in the colloquial sense. But yeah anything that gets in the way of an EM wave will cause effects like refraction, diffraction, scattering, etc. whether that thing is naturally occurring gas and water vapor or clouds of soot from a factory.</p></div>		</li>
