			<div class="markdown"><p>No problem, but I'll have to answer tomorrow if that's okay? Ironically, my sleep pattern is currently lined up correctly (it sort of slips endlessly around the clock) so I'm about to go to bed, and the answers will take a while to type out so it's best done while I'm properly awake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referred to the circadian neuroscience team a few years ago, but my case was handed over to Dr. Zanobia Zaiwalla's non-respiratory sleep disorder clinic for then-suspected, now-confirmed narcolepsy. As such, circadian rhythm (or in my case, the complete lack of it) has always fascinated me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small world, I was with Dr. Zaiwalla too for most of my appointments :-) </p>
<p>I've always been curious - does narcolepsy affect circadian rhythms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't you mean time would move more quickly (seemingly for others) relative to you if you were travelling near the speed of light?  My understanding is that if you are travelling fast enough for long enough you could arrive back where you started seemingly younger than your grandchildren. To me this implies time would appear to be progressing faster outside your local bubble for want of a better, not slower.  I realise that everything would progress as normal for those not travelling. </p></div>		</li>
