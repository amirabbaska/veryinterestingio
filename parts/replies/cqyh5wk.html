			<div class="markdown"><p>Put it into a rocket with a chamber for holding the paper airplane. Light up the rocket in the opposite direction of the ISS during the EVA so it starts to deorbit then open the chamber (remotely) and let the paper airplane float out of the mothership.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Easy.  Attach paper a paper parachute to the plane via string and wax.    The parachute will increase the drag significantly.  The ISS is in an unstable orbit and the parachute with its large surface area and low mass will deorbit very quickly....within a few weeks probably.   As it heats up the wax will melt and the airplane will be free to fly solo.</p>
<p>It's like a reverse Icarus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It only takes about 60mph of delta-v to move something from the ISS's orbit to one which would decay in days. Now, I don't think an astronaut can manage a 60mph pitch in a spacesuit, but they could probably rig up a slingshot or something to achieve it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit:  I wonder if you could fit the life-support and reentry vehicle for a field mouse into a cubesat.</p></div>		</li>
