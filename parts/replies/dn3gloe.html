			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine like this: your throat has 100 hp. The infection caused 30 damage, the use of voice during the infection caused 15, low humidity and air conditioning caused 15 more. The threshold of 50 was crossed and you lost your voice.

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandmother has lost her voice every year for months at a time in the late fall/early winter. Doctors said acid reflux but prescribed antacids didn't help. She refuses to go to the doctor again because it's only her voice. She feels fine.</p></div>		</li>
