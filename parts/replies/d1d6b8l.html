			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason we have weather and humidity. Not all (or any) of the world's water is at 100C, but still a lot evaporates. If you approach a stream, you can feel the humidity.</p>
<p>The amount of water that evaporates is related to both the water and air temperature through the vapor pressure, which increases roughly exponentially with Temp until it reaches atmospheric Pressure (not coincidentally, this happens at 100C). Above 100C, water is most stable as a steam vapor, therefore it all evaporates (before it can get to 101C).</p>
<p>Interestingly, pressure cookers work by increasing the pressure above atmospheric, which also raises the temperature of the vapor liquid equilibrium temp to above 100C, which also increases the speed at which you can cook food!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;rule of thumb&quot; for chemical reactions is that +10C in temperature doubles the rate of reaction. So increasing temperature by 20C should roughly quadruple the reaction time, or take it from 2h to 30min.</p>
<p>Warning: Do not rely on this for doing actual chemistry. It's good for getting a sense of &quot;in general, how does temperature effect reaction speed&quot; and horrible for &quot;in this particular reaction, what is the effect of temperature on reaction speed&quot;. Basically, it's almost always wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature, no not once it's boiling. You can't get enough pressure to make a difference. However, while it is heating to boiling, it will heat faster and maintain more easily since you are not losing as much heat to evaporation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hijacking the top comment to add something else:</p>
<p>In any object or fluid at a given temperature, most of the particles do NOT have the same energy as each other. In fact, most are different than the temperature would suggest. However the average energy of these particles (or sometimes root means square of the energies) is used to determine the temperature. </p>
<p>If you have a cup of water, some of the water particles at the surface will reach a high enough energy to &quot;boil&quot; and be ejected into the air as a gas. This is actually pretty much how the process of sweating works; when our bodies are hot, we sweat and our bodies heat the sweat enough so that some of the particles have enough energy to fly off. When these particles fly out into the air, they obviously take energy (heat) with them, thus leaving the overall system of our body/sweat with less energy than it had before the evaporation of the sweat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only problem I have with that is that is sort of makes it sound like your body heat boils a tiny bit of water to make it evaporate.</p>
<p>Which is not the case. The important distinction is the difference between evaporation and boiling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely the best explanation for OP's question. I was sad when I saw that the top comment depends on basically looking up some definitions and experiments in a nineteenth century chemistry textbook.</p>
<p>Whereas the statistical mechanical model can not only explain evaporation, but also any phase change phenomenon as well as entropic and volumetric changes. It also relies on a base-level of quantum mehchanics, and so it can actually predict things like vapor pressure instead of relying on them empirically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, even ice has a vapor pressure. Its extremely small though. Things in thermodynamic equilibrium are always shifting molecules between phases. A glass of water the same temperature as the environment with the air at saturation will constantly have some airborne water entering the liquid phase and some of the liquid water entering the gas phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this: temperature is a property of bulk materials, not individual molecules.  Temperature is an <em>average</em> energy of the bulk (ie a cup of water).  This means that some molecules will have enough energy to overcome that pressure difference, and some will not.  This is true at <em>any</em> temperature, not just at the boiling point.  This is why a boiling pot of water doesn't immediately evaporate into steam when reaching 100 degrees - a lot of the molecules have the energy to evaporate, but not all of them do.</p></div>		</li>
