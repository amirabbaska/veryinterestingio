			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s fucking wild. This little toddler in my old apt would speak only Spanish to her mom, then after a while she started learning English with others. She could speak full sentences with me in English then turn to her mom and start speaking Spanish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I plan to do this with my children.
The SO and I have decided one of us will speak to our children in Spanish (which we're both fluent in) and the other in English. This way, they're communicating with us on a daily basis in both languages and they learn both early on in life. Hopefully we don't run into any problems!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An American friend of mine has two boys with her Peruvian husband.  Even though they know both their parents are bilingual, she says they will speak mostly English with her and Spanish with their dad. Always though that is interesting and have wondered why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it's a fluency thing. My dad is more fluent in English so I tend to use more English with him than if I was talking to my mom. I could use either Chinese or English for both of them, but because I'm more comfortable in English I think I subconsciously weigh the ease of communication in my head when choosing what language to speak. For my mom her comfort in Chinese outweighs the benefits of my comfort in English while for my dad my comfort in English outweighs his comfort in Chinese. </p>
<p>Similar concept goes for when I'm talking with my girlfriend, her fluency from most to least is Japanese, English, Chinese, while I'm English, Chinese, Japanese, so communicating in English is easiest for both of us because it maximizes the total fluency. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep I know children whose parents are bilingual, but who only speak English (though they can mostly understand the second language).</p>
<p>In this case, it is simply because there isn't enough a necessity to learn the second language fully.</p>
<p>Edit: Nvm, I mis read your comment:</p>
<p>Your comment applies to me somewhat. I can speak English and Urdu. However, I will speak in English to people I know can speak Urdu. Usually it's an age thing. I speak in English with people my age, and Urdu with people older.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My parents are both fluent in English and Dutch (my mom is also fluent in Spanish but that's not important). My dad being originally Dutch and my mother American, my father only spoke to me in Dutch and my mother in English. When I watch home videos I understood what he said and would respond sometimes in English and sometimes in Dutch. But because my mother didn't speak to me in Dutch and I heard English from every person in my life except my dad it was too hard to learn. I would keep asking him what certain words were when he said them because I didn't understand. Eventually (when I was about 4 and my older sister 6) my father gave up and now I only know a few phrases in Dutch. My two cents is that if the want them to learn Spanish, they should speak primarily Spanish at home, both parents. The kids will learn English anyways at school and from friends.</p></div>		</li>
