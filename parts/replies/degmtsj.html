<p>EDIT: England, specifically. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The education system generally employed in the United States is called &quot;liberal arts education.&quot;  The University's goal is to create a well-rounded renaissance (wo)man through its education program.  A student must satisfy two requirements to get a bachelor's degree: general education criteria (which are the same for everyone in the school) and major criteria (which are the same for everyone with the same area of study).  </p>
<p>The UK adopted a different system in the early 20th century with the Higher School Certificate (now GCSE).  The material of study in general education courses in a liberal arts college are generally addressed in A-levels.  This has made for less courses to be taken at university in the UK compared to the US. </p>
<p>The downside to the UK system is that it expects a child (17-18 year old) to know what s/he wants to be for the rest of his/her life.  The advantage to a liberal arts college is that it gives ample freedom of exploration of topics before settling or a major of study that will inform their profession.</p>
<p>The downside to the US system is that it burdens a career-focused student with coursework that has nothing to do with their chosen career path.  Some general elective courses get dismissive names such as &quot;calculus for poets&quot; and &quot;literature for jocks.&quot;</p>
<p>This focus on being well-rounded is also why US universities invested so much interest in music and athletics, which is how you can end up with things like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_ToAF46GPQ&amp;t=24s" target="_blank">this</a> at a University.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a career focused individual I still really appreciated the US system. I graduated with a Bachelor's degree of Science in Computer science with minors in Software Engineering and another in Business Administration. I also received a concentration in Psychology. When I entered the work force I did it running and not walking and I was able to relate to every one of my coworkers as a result. Maybe it is just my personality but I enjoyed it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cambridge is actually one of most similar universities in the UK to the American system. While they diverged, and Cambridge offers 3-year BAs and for some subjects a 4th year Masters, they still offer a much broader choice within specific courses (or 'Tripos') than most UK universities. A good example is Natural Sciences, through which just about all science is taught in Cambridge. You apply and are admitted to study for that Tripos, but within it you can study Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Earth Sciences, Materials Science, Psychology, History and Philosophy of Science and many more. You can specialise through the years or maintain breadth, and you'll still be able to graduate with the same BA after three years.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm Scottish and I knew a few people who left in their 3rd year and you still come away wth a degree. The 4th is your &quot;honours&quot; year and gives you the first class, 2.1 or 2.2 score. If you get 3rd class you're as well not even putting it on your CV though...</p>
<p>I think it's just rare in Scotland to stay less than the 4 years since we start a year younger than in England.</p></div>		</li>
