<p>Awesome response man. I loved reading everything you wrote in this thread. Just wanted to point out that ADC stands for Analog-to-Digital Converter for anyone else confused like I was.</p></div>		</li>

<p>AM is an afterthought these days; so the radios in modern cars aren't anywhere near as good as they used to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely agree. I can remember when AM had more listenable stations than FM. FM might have been better, but it generally didn't have the kind of music I wanted to listen to. It was more &quot;serious&quot; music. There were lots of good AM stations.</p>

<p>FTFY. I made the same mistake on Reddit a few months ago. Apparently discreet and discrete come from the same root word, but mean different things.</p></div>		</li>
