			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: I am growing graphene on a copper crystal for my bachelor thesis, ad I have assisted in growing it on gold foils as well. Even though the two require very different processes, something very similar happens.</p>
<p>If a crystal surface is smooth on the atomic level, it will still have step edges where each layer of atoms ends. Imagine a stair case with a couple meters between each step, like on a park walkway with a small slope. The layer of graphene will always start on these step edges, because there is a significant energetic bonus for the carbon atoms if they connect to the corners. The next carbon atoms will connect to other carbon atoms, and soon, you will have a layer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, near surfaces or other imperfections, the interfacial energy can be much lower. The reason is that in those parts water molecules already aren't surrounded on all sides, so it's less of a disruption when a bubble forms. </p>

<p>Wait, that sounds plausible, but I think it's way too incomplete to the point of being wrong about what's actually going on. Like, the usual recipe for getting superheated water (don't try this at home without protection): heat a glass of water to boiling in a microwave, let it cool a bit, then heat it up again. Boom, you get scalding hot water everywhere suddenly!</p>
<p>As far as I understand, the real principal source of nucleation is air trapped in crevices and imperfections. It expands, the bubble detaches, it expands again and so on. But after doing that for a while the air is replaced by water vapor inside each crevice, so cooling it down completely collapses it, and then you can actually superheat it.</p>
<p>Now, sure, superheating it to really high temperatures would require very smooth surfaces because otherwise  water bubbles would nucleate on imperfections just as you explained, but it comes way later, the dominating reason for why you can't superheat freshly poured water or what causes trails of bubbles in carbonated drinks is trapped air in particular. As far as I understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your criticism is very valid, my initial was not complete. I didn't want it to get too long, but as a result I didn't mention an additional and very important mechanism for heterogeneous nucleation. In fact, after a bit more research it turns out that the mechanism you describe comes up very often in CO2 nucleation in carbonated beverages. For example porous cellulose fibers from the cloth used to clean champagne glasses often serve as the nucleation sites for bubble trains. I expanded my original answer to include this additional mechanism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it a happy coincidence that the bubbles don't detach until after they have reached the critical size or do they detach <em>because</em> they reached critical size? If it's just coincidence, what would happen if a non-critical bubble were to detach (in theory)? Would the water surface tension squish it? And what happens when bubbles are squished or prevented from growing. Does the gas that is or wanted to be part of the bubble just get dispersed in the solution instead? Why won't the water surface tension squish a smaller amount of gas then? Why does it have to form a bubble first? Or is it that the gas simply can't exist freely outside of a bubble but rather bonds to some molecule?</p>
<p>As you can hear I'm mighty ignorant about this. But I heard asking questions is the path to enlightenment :)</p></div>		</li>
