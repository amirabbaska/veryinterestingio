			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s not ECMO, that’s cardiopulmonary bypass. There’s a difference.</p>
<p>Source: I’m a cardiovascular perfusionist, the person who would run the heart lung machine, place patients on cardiopulmonary bypass, and places patients on ECMO.</p>
<p>Edit: What the OP refers to COULD describe either ECMO or CPB, as it’s a vague description of CPB. However in the context of a heart transplant it definitely would not be ECMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Cardiopulmonary bypass is what’s used during surgery- a short term procedure/ technique. ECMO is a more long term technique used to provide prolonged cardiopulmonary support, hence the need for anticoagulants. ECMO’s methodology is largely derived from bypass, but the two are different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With children there is more success with VAD and ecmo, but with adults you don’t need to worry about killing them because my made up number on the success of VV ecmo is probably close to 95% mortality. It’s supposed to be a bridge to healing or transplant but it ends up being a bridge to nowhere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cell Saver is huge here, as the process even with a quick surgeon can easily result in something like 100mL of blood loss.  Or liters, in the case where they struggle to get the cannulas placed and take multiple attempts.  It was weird having to transfuse before even going on pump...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You run a circular suture line (pursestring - imagine the strings on a hoodie) in the wall of the blood vessel - enough to be strong, but not deep enough to actually penetrate the wall. Then you stab in the middle and immediately put your finger on the stab wound to shut off flow. You slide appropriate tubing in as soon as you pull your finger away, and then you cinch the sutures down and clamp them in place. Blood loss is just a few CCs if you’re smooth. Plus, spillage that builds through the case can be recovered by a special suction device that processes the blood and makes it ready for transfusion back into the bloodstream. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood clots on 'foreign' materials much much faster than on blood vessels. Your own blood vessels have special coatings/molecules lining them that keep blood from clotting there normally. So that's why the same sample of blood will clot in a machine but not in the body</p></div>		</li>
