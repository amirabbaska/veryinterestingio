			<div class="markdown"><p>One observation that indicates the presence of dark matter is that hot gas/dust in elliptical galaxies should diffuse and escape the galaxy based on its thermal energy, but remains gravitationally bound. Implies that there may be additional mass that is not optically observed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Orbits mainly. Everything in the galaxy is orbitting the stuff inside it but they're orbitting way differently than they should. There's a fuckload of matter we can't see that's making orbits faster. Google &quot;orbital period vs radius galaxy dark matter&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know that there aren't just vastly more rogue planets or brown dwarves floating around in galaxies than we currently hypothesize?  We already know that they are incredibly hard to detect - Hell, they are pretty confident that there is another planet orbiting our own star that we have yet to directly observe.  I know that they are miniscule in comparison to the mass of a star, but maybe there are just that many more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats the entire point. That would be a reasonable explanation, if the numbers weren't so massively off. </p>
<p>Let's (hypothetically) put it in the scale of the solar system because it's easier to understand. </p>
<p>Pretend we have a similar problem: we know there's extra mass somewhere between earth and the sun, but we don't know what it is. We can't find it.  </p>
<p>If the amount of extra mass was as much as the mass of the moon, that'd be weird. It would be like 'Woah where's that mass that we can't see? Is there some kind of moon or asteroid nearby that we haven't detected? Is Mars or mercury bigger than we thought?'</p>
<p>But no. The extra mass missing between the earth and the sun isn't the size of the moon, it's 50 times the size of the earth. There's no imaginable way that 50 earth's could be hiding between earth and the sun. Thats not some estimation error on our part, that's something fucking weird going on that we don't understand.  We don't know what it is, so we'll call it Dark Matter. </p></div>		</li>
