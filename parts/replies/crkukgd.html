			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you hit most of the points being missed above.  Only thing I have to add (ecologist here) is that homogeneity at a high elevation is also driven by environmental gradients.  Limited growing season, extreme temperature, snowpack, wind, disturbance regimes, soil quality, etc., etc. will largely determine species and distribution.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also like to add that mathematics has some play in it as well. We see that tree growth / branches / leaves/ height all follow PHI. There is also a mathematical reason for forest expansion </p>
<p>Some cool math on [tree regeneration] (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0802" target="_blank">http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0802</a>)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This  is  interesting. Are you implying that forest growth is a certain way because of a mathematical formula? Or is it just that we have a formula that can predict forest growth depending up on various elements like light, minerals and water?</p>
<p>Also that article you linked to: I couldn't understand any of it. I'm not a mathematician. Could give an ELI5 of that?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this is getting towards the best answer for OP. He/She/Undeclared (English needs a damned inclusive third person pronoun) asks a general question about trees. </p>
<p>&quot;Trees need thermal energy, light, and water like humans need thermal energy, food, and water. Their height and width is also partially determined by density of flora nutrients. Tropical rainforests are more dense with taller trees than the taiga.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, when you view the top of a forest you are NOT viewing the average tree height, you are viewing the average maximum tree height, essentially all trees that are not at the maximum height are below the canopy and you are ignoring those trees in your quick look.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering how much of the answer had to do with wind.  Is wind significantly stronger above the trees on mountain ranges?  Then it would seem that any tree growing above the treeline would be at the fully mercy of the wind, while trees maintaining a common height would shield each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not going to say this happens everywhere, but in the Caribbean area, lots of trees of different types grow to the same height. Many trees there grow shorter there than they would in other parts of the world. </p>
<p>One hypothesis I heard is that given how hurricane prone the place is, taller trees were sort of naturally selected out by the winds and the same height serves to form a protective cover from the hurricane. </p>
<p>I have no idea if this is true or not. Also, the only trees that tend to grow above this tree coverline are palm trees, but those are built to take hurricane in stride so they have no need to play along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have only a limited knowledge of how weather/climate/the atmosphere works, but I can say that your second sentence is absolutely correct. Trees that survive above tree line are often &quot;disfigured.&quot; The technical term being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krummholz" target="_blank">krummholz</a>.</p></div>		</li>
