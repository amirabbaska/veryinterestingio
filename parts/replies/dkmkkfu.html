<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, limiting the number of people who know the really big secrets helps a lot. Compartmentalization, or the &quot;need to know policy,&quot; basically says that you limit the number of people who know something to the bare minimum who need to know it. The more people who know a secret, the harder it is to keep — every person you let &quot;in&quot; to it is another person who might later leak or spy or screw up.</p>
<p>The latter point is really important. The secrets that have really had a chance of being held for a long time tend to be pretty small groups of people. (The Indian nuclear program surprised the CIA in part because it was so small — every scientist was doing two or three jobs, essentially. This made it very hard to detect.)</p>

<p>Which is precisely why I don't buy into any of those vast conspiracies that, somehow, thousands of whackos buy into. The Earth is flat? So you convinced every scientist on the planet to just sit on that little nugget? Alternatively, you pay thousands scientists to do science when you know their entire premise is bunk? Cmon. Same for conspiracies about chemtrails, vaccines, GMOs, 9/11, and on and on and on and on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read a great essay about how we should be thankful for conspiracy theorists because they provide a barometer on human thought. The frightening prospect would really be.... what would it say about us if nobody was a conspiracy theorist? Would it mean nobody was questioning anything they were told?</p>
<p>Its fundamental to real questioning that sometimes you will get the wrong answer. If nobody seems to be wrong, does it really mean everybody is right? </p>
<p>I think, overall, I am more comforted by conspiracy theorists than the notion that we could all be the proverbial lemmings.</p>
<p>If nothing else, they expose the areas in which the public needs more education. Plus, its not like people are not being intentionally mislead at times. Monied interests fund bad studies, or bury results, it does happen.</p>
<p>I like to say 'Conspiracy theorists are people smart enough to know they ARE being lied to; but don't necessarily know enough truth to know which bits were the lies&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit, I love your blog! Your work on the history of nuclear...well, stuff really kindled my interests in history and archival. I'm actually pursuing a degree in library science with a minor in history due to your work. Keep it up, man! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a small bit to add about the screening part. I work a job where I need a security clearance. My supervisor had put in 12 faithful years of service and was ready to continue there until retirement. However, when her security clearance needed to be renewed they found that while she was married she had cosigned on her husband's truck. They had gotten a divorce but it was still in her name and he had stopped making the payments. Before she was even notified, her security clearance was pulled and she was fired. All because debt can be used against you to give up information. Getting a clearance to be in areas like that is a very lengthy process and can be lost in moments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ever want to see &quot;inside the head&quot; of the clearance denial process, the DOD has <a href="http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/industrial/" target="_blank">an amazing database of industrial clearance decisions</a> which makes for pretty fascinating reading. The <a href="http://ogc.osd.mil/doha/industrial/2001.html" target="_blank">older parts</a> are especially interesting.</p></div>		</li>
