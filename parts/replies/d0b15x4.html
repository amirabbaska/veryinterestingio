			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of a misconception to be honest. Caffeine content can differ by type and steep process, but there's not a clear cut difference between the major styles. Here's a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2621.2005.tb08304.x/abstract" target="_blank">study</a> I grabbed that most people probably can't access that found a wide variety of caffeine contents in common green and black tea varieties but no general significant difference in caffeine content between the two.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/8/702.full.pdf" target="_blank">Here's</a> a better study that everyone should be able to access that looked at white, green and black teas and found the same results, no clear trend in caffeine content by type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always told that this was just a matter of time, though.  It dissolves faster in hot water (like just about anything) but will still dissolve in cold.  So a 30 minute steep in cold water should extract a lot of caffeine, but not a lot of tea. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not. Temperature doesn't just affect reaction kinetics, but increased temperature also favors the entropic side of the equilibrium. So a higher temperature does mean that more caffeine molecules go into the liquid. You'll reach the equilibrium faster <strong>and</strong> more caffeine will have been dissolved.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for posting that!  I guess I can treat the second steep as &quot;mostly&quot; decaf tea.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, &quot;tea purists&quot; frequently steep tea multiple times. As shown in the chart, you can get more caffeine (and flavor!) out of multiple infusions if you use loose leaf tea, and so that's what you'll find &quot;tea purists&quot; use.</p>
<p>For example, if you look at the brewing guidelines on <a href="https://sevencups.com/shop/breakfast-keemun-organic-black-tea-2014/" target="_blank">this tea</a> page, it claims to be good for 5 infusions. </p>
<p>It probably doesn't make it as cheap as Lipton, but it does offset the cost by a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it matter if the leaves are strained after steeping, or if they are allowed to be &quot;waterlogged&quot; so to speak -- is there some time limit (a matter of hours?) before cold damp tea leaves start to have some negative reaction/outcome?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although that require a five minute steep. If you're impatient like me and brew it for 1 minute, I imagine the second steep will be somewhat richer in caffeine.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would tend to agree with you, being a strictly Chinese black tea drinker myself. But one of my co-worker's at this tea shop i worked at SWORE up and down that the 3rd steep of Big Red Robe (Oolong) had some mineraley/plum quality that only peaked after steeping it 3 times. I don't think this trait is exclusive to Oolongs, but because of the way that many Oolongs are prepared (rolled) i think they tend to be a prime candidate for re-steeps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oolongs in particular are commonly held to the belief that they produce varying flavours over multiple steepings... but since most oolong is rolled, I've always had a similar theory to yours that any rolled tea would produce varying flavours over multiple steepings, particularly when steeped at cooler-than-boiling temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely very much better than watering down your tea, but it does weaken a bit. It'll can hold enough flavour to be flavorful surprisingly long sometimes, though: I haven't tried it with a teabag, but some loose-leafs I've seen advertise up to twelve steeps.  </p>
<p>You'd probably usually have to add a bit onto steeping length each time to compensate, though.</p></div>		</li>
