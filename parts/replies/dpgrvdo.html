			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the question that started this thread can be restated as &quot;Does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle" target="_blank">superpostion</a> hold for gravity waves?&quot;</p>
<p>This isn't just a very good question, it is one of those questions that are fundamental to the pursuit of science in its most technical sense. Good for you /u/Szechwan, the right question is half the battle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding /u/meltingdiamond correctly, they are saying that the question /u/Szechwan is asking, whether gravitational waves can &quot;double up&quot; like waves of water, is asking whether gravitational waves exhibit the principle of superposition.  /u/meltingdiamond then suggests (rightly, in my opinion) that these sorts of questions are the essence of scientific discovery.  I.e., if you were to observe a gravitational wave, and wanted to plan further studies to gain knowledge about their behavior, a question like &quot;does this waveform exhibit superposition&quot; would be essential to guiding those studies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That just seems to be a fact about our world. It makes studying black holes much more complicated than studying charges.</p>
<p>You might be interested to know that the equations governing the strong and weak force are very similar to those for electromagnetism, expect that they have an extra term which makes them non-linear as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Namely:</p>
<p>If you have two solutions to Maxwell's equation, A and B, and some scalar x, then A+xB is also a solution. This is what it means to be linear. For Maxwell's equations, they are built out of operators that are linear: partial derivatives, integrals, divergence and curl operators. Also, these operators are added/subtracted or scaled, but never multiplied which conserves linearity.</p>
<p>This contrasts with Einstein's Field Equations. They are built from non-linear combinations of linear operators. For example, the metric does not necessarily need to be linear. The triangle inequality is insufficient to show linearity.</p>
<p>To have superposition of solutions, you need linearity. Hence Maxwell's equations have superposition ( two different electric fields sum to their superposition at each point in space ), and Einstein's don't necessarily satisfy linearity and hence don't necessarily exhibit superposition. They can, but not in general, and require the specific combinations of linear operators in the equations so that those usually non-linear combinations behave linearly and thus you get superposition. This can happen with tweaking of the different tensors in the equation, choosing a convenient metric, etc.</p>
<p>Edit 1: For example. f(x)=x and g(x)=0.5x are linear since f(a+bx)=a+bx=f(a)+xf(b) and g(a+bx)=0.5(a+bx)=0.5(a)+x(0.5)(b)=g(a)+xg(b). But h(x)=f(x)g(x)=0.5x^2 is non-linear since h(a+bx) is not h(a)+xh(b). That is to say, 0.5(a+bx)^2 is not 0.5(a)^2+x(0.5)b^2.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't exactly say their equations govern the natural phenomenon. They describe them. Einstein's equations don't tell gravity how to act, gravity acting the way it does gave rise to the equations. However I'm arguing semantics here.</p></div>		</li>
