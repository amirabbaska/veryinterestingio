Another kind, called Primary Progressive Aphasia, is the term for when the degradation begins in the language centers of the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think you miswrote that Primary progressive Aphasia is not a type of Alzheimers, it is a type of symptom of Alzheimers or Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration, or any other neurodegenerative disease not yet identified.</p>
<p>Are you entirely sure that the term only applies when the degradation Begins in the language center ? </p></div>		</li>
