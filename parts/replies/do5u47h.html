			<div class="markdown"><p>For Beef Tartare and other products which are intended to be eaten raw there is a requirement for a complete absence of salmonella. For foods being eaten raw there is a higher quantity of tests and a lower maximum acceptable value (or in the case of salmonella the complete absence is required). Can look up (EC) No 2073/2005 on microbiological criteria for foodstuffs if you want specifics on the European union at least. Pretty dry reading material though. In general they would take X number of carcasses at multiple points throughout the day and perform loads of testing on them, for meat which will be eaten raw every single carcass must pass, if a single one fails all the meat will be inspected. For less pathogenic bacteria there may be 1/5 or 2/50 positives which are allowed per batch. However the origin of the product would be noted and if issues continue investigations occur to management practices etc.</p></div>		</li>
