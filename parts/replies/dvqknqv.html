			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so true.  If Carl Icahn can get Hertz bought completely, or at least maintain his control, he’ll make a shit ton of money.  Hertz is in absolutely atrocious shape compared to EHI, and Marinello is taking them back to basics to try to compete.  Should be interesting to see the next few years unfold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's quite the opposite, when companies like Bain purchase Toys R. Us or some other organization and they fail, it gets wall to wall media coverage re: some shadowy finance company just closed your favorite store and put 30,000 minimum wage employees out of work.</p>
<p>Unless you are reading WSJ or Bloomberg, you never hear about the successes.  </p></div>		</li>
