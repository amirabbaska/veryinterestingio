I guess with the California example, I was surprised that the state could benefit so much ($1.4 million) from a company's error where the direct effect was felt by consumers as opposed to any repercussions the state government faced from the data breach. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, $1.4M is waaaay not a lot of money for Target and it's even less to the State of California.</p>
<p>Second of all, the states <em>definitely</em> have an interest here. It's their duty to safeguard the interests and well-being of their citizens, and they do so with laws like this. The fines are (ostensibly) used to benefit the public at large. Nothing the states are doing here prejudice the rights of individual citizens to proceed here.</p>
<p>Imagine some kind of scenario where my neighbor dumps toxic waste on his property and it seeps into my back yard and kills my grass. He gets fined a few hundred bucks by the city, and I sue for trespass/nuisance/negligence/whatever and recover a few grand for the value of my yard. That's analogous to what's happening here.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the amounts we're talking here are peanuts. That $1.4M breaks down to about 3-4 cents per person in California. Likewise, that class action (which I wager will settle for significantly less than $10M) will probably end up paying out under $50 per person. If there's someone out there who has a big boy claim against Target (e.g., someone whose year was ruined because their identity was stolen in the breach), I imagine they brought their own claim individually and recovered substantially more.</p></div>		</li>
