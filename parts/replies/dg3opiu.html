<p>Can you remove moles that aren't raised</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>I think that there are laser procedures that you can look into that either lighten or eradicate the color of a &quot;freckle&quot; all together. Perhaps Google laser freckle removal or call a dermatologist and see if they handle it or if you would have to go to a cosmetic doctor of some sort. I know I have seen the procedure on tv. I don't think it is particulary comfortable but, if it is something you really want, the discomfort may be worth it to you.
I hope I was of some help.</em></p>
<p>Got that from a google search.</p></div>		</li>
