			<p>&quot;Of course, the US made much from &quot;robbing&quot; from the old world, especially the UK.&quot;<br><br>I never heard this before, could you expand on this?</p>		</li>

			<p>From the early to mid 1900s a lot of manufacturing that used to be based in the UK and Western Europe moved to the USA.  This process was accelerated by the world wars, where European countries and economies were torn down.  Meanwhile the USA got a boost because its industries were supplying war material to the UK, and because they helped to rebuild Europe after the war.  They also provided loans to the UK/Europe, as well as taking in European immigrants who contributed to the countries' science and labor force (i.e. Albert Einstein and German rocket-scientists brought to US after the war).<br><br>Then from the 1970s on manufacturing in the USA began moving to other countries, where labor costs were lower- i.e. Mexico, Brazil, China, India, etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>/u/cock_pussy_up gives a good answer.  My original statement was a little bitter because post war the US leveraged the debt the UK had to take with them to pay for the war to force the UK to open up the trade to the commonwealth countries.  This made trading with the UK less attractive,  and allowed the US to step in.  They also forced the UK government to make the pound convertible,  thus weakening the UK further.  The UK remained in rationing into the 50s because of the States.  Meanwhile the US gave vast aid to the European countries.  This was partly humanitarian but also to make sure the UK couldn't take economic advantage of a weak Europe.  Instead the UK has to use cast off pre-war machinery bought off Germany while the Germans replaced it with new machines bought off the Americans.  Compare Jaguar 's post-war history with BMW for example.<br><br>To be honest,  I would have done the same if I was American,  but it still leaves a bad taste in the mouth.  There has never been a special relationship between us,  more like siblings who hate each other but play nice on a Sunday in church.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm sorry, but this is complete crap.<br><br>&gt; The UK remained in rationing into the 50s because of the States.<br><br>The UK kept rationing until 1950 because the post-war Labour government favoured central planning.  The Conservatives fought the 1950 general election over precisely the issue of rationing.<br><br><br>&gt; Meanwhile the US gave vast aid to the European countries.  This was partly humanitarian but also to make sure the UK couldn't take economic advantage of a weak Europe.

Britain's class-ridden social structure and disdain for manufacturing produced many problems in the post-War period.  They weren't the fault of the Americans.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>We waited for everything to get blown up in WW2 and then conveniently entered the war late so we could win it and sell all of Europe new houses and consumer goods, since all their factories were destroyed and so on. That's the whole reason the US had the huge boom in the late 40s and throughout the 50s.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Boomers were the driving force for 35 years of tax cutting that impoverished governments and prevented them from investing in infrastructure and education.  Millennials have college debt when the Boomers had none.  Boomers will stand in history as the greediest generation the US has ever produced. </p>		</li>

			<p>It wasn't the boomers who put Reagan into office, it was their parents, the so-called 'greatest generation' who voted for Reagan, primarily because Reagan promised to dismantle the progress made in the 60's.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, I'm in my fifties and I remember the 60's and 70's quite well.  Reagan kicked off his campaign in Meridian Mississippi where the civil rights workers were murdered and told anecdotes about 'welfare queens driving cadillacs'.  It might surprise you, but the older generation was against the civil rights movement.<br><br>Reagan tapped into the resentment and rode it to victory.  One of his first actions was busting the airline traffic controllers union, and things have been going downhill ever since.</p>		</li>

			<p>I need some fuckin tax cuts please. I pay. 40% income, 8% sales, vehicle and license registration fees plus theres other taxes on items I buy, and I don't even own property. The government takes the majority of my money and all I get are a few shitty wars and trillions in debt? Don't fucking talk about taking more taxes because it's not going to be reinvested, it's going to be embezzled.</p>		</li>

			<p>I get it.  I don't like paying taxes either.  But:<br><br>i.  You are not paying 40%.  Assuming you don't have state taxes, <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/article/2014-tax-brackets" target="_blank">you would only pay 40% on money over 406k</a>.  Everything below that amount is taxed lower.  If you have a state income tax, it is graduated in the same manner.   While your marginal (that is the next additional $1 you earn) tax rate may be 40%, your effective tax rate has to be below 40%.<br><br>ii.  A state level sales tax is hugely wasteful because a state level income or property tax is federally deductible.  There is a credible proposal in California to replace the state sales tax with a broadened income tax that would produce the same amount of money with lower overall taxes because of the federal deduction.  In short, a tax cut paid for by the feds.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>California is particularly fubar.  I used to live there.  Folks vote to tax new comers and not themselves.  A great example are property taxes.  If you've owned your home for 30 or 40 years, you are paying taxes based on the value of the home at the date of purchase.  Warren Buffet reports he pays more in Nebraska then on a home in LA.<br><br>But it is worth noting you're including Social Security and Medicare.  Both of which benefit you directly when you get old and your parents long before then.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't wanna think about wealth from inheritance.  But yeah, I'm set for early retirement if the parents pass.  Separated, played for my college, set me up with good credit, got me a job  and both own their own homes.  I'm the soul beneficiary.  I have a single uncle who's leaving everything to me as well.  I have a decent job, too.  Guess I'm very lucky now that I think about it.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I was talking about the money released through the collapse of the boomer generation.  As the boomer generation is numerically greater,  then their wealth will concentrate into a few number of people.  This will give an economic boost to the receiving generation. <br><br>Of course,  I am talking mass effects,  there are individuals who won't benefit.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Enjoy it while it lasts.  I'm honestly surprised to see any concern at all about Gen X in the media, and on the rare times I do see something, it's always by a Gen X author who feels totally forgotten about, like the rest of us.<br><br>I think most of the Millennials don't even stop to realize that having several hundred articles about how they aren't self-centered regularly circulated around all the mainstream news networks year after year doesn't exactly help prove their case.  I mean, how often do you see &quot;Gen X:  Are they still feeling alienated?&quot;</p>		</li>
