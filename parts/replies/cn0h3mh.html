			<p>&quot;Of course, the US made much from &quot;robbing&quot; from the old world, especially the UK.&quot;<br><br>I never heard this before, could you expand on this?</p>		</li>

			<p>From the early to mid 1900s a lot of manufacturing that used to be based in the UK and Western Europe moved to the USA.  This process was accelerated by the world wars, where European countries and economies were torn down.  Meanwhile the USA got a boost because its industries were supplying war material to the UK, and because they helped to rebuild Europe after the war.  They also provided loans to the UK/Europe, as well as taking in European immigrants who contributed to the countries' science and labor force (i.e. Albert Einstein and German rocket-scientists brought to US after the war).<br><br>Then from the 1970s on manufacturing in the USA began moving to other countries, where labor costs were lower- i.e. Mexico, Brazil, China, India, etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>/u/cock_pussy_up gives a good answer.  My original statement was a little bitter because post war the US leveraged the debt the UK had to take with them to pay for the war to force the UK to open up the trade to the commonwealth countries.  This made trading with the UK less attractive,  and allowed the US to step in.  They also forced the UK government to make the pound convertible,  thus weakening the UK further.  The UK remained in rationing into the 50s because of the States.  Meanwhile the US gave vast aid to the European countries.  This was partly humanitarian but also to make sure the UK couldn't take economic advantage of a weak Europe.  Instead the UK has to use cast off pre-war machinery bought off Germany while the Germans replaced it with new machines bought off the Americans.  Compare Jaguar 's post-war history with BMW for example.<br><br>To be honest,  I would have done the same if I was American,  but it still leaves a bad taste in the mouth.  There has never been a special relationship between us,  more like siblings who hate each other but play nice on a Sunday in church.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm sorry, but this is complete crap.<br><br>&gt; The UK remained in rationing into the 50s because of the States.<br><br>The UK kept rationing until 1950 because the post-war Labour government favoured central planning.  The Conservatives fought the 1950 general election over precisely the issue of rationing.<br><br><br>&gt; Meanwhile the US gave vast aid to the European countries.  This was partly humanitarian but also to make sure the UK couldn't take economic advantage of a weak Europe.

Britain's class-ridden social structure and disdain for manufacturing produced many problems in the post-War period.  They weren't the fault of the Americans.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>We waited for everything to get blown up in WW2 and then conveniently entered the war late so we could win it and sell all of Europe new houses and consumer goods, since all their factories were destroyed and so on. That's the whole reason the US had the huge boom in the late 40s and throughout the 50s.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Boomers were the driving force for 35 years of tax cutting that impoverished governments and prevented them from investing in infrastructure and education.  Millennials have college debt when the Boomers had none.  Boomers will stand in history as the greediest generation the US has ever produced. </p>		</li>

			<p>It wasn't the boomers who put Reagan into office, it was their parents, the so-called 'greatest generation' who voted for Reagan, primarily because Reagan promised to dismantle the progress made in the 60's.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, I'm in my fifties and I remember the 60's and 70's quite well.  Reagan kicked off his campaign in Meridian Mississippi where the civil rights workers were murdered and told anecdotes about 'welfare queens driving cadillacs'.  It might surprise you, but the older generation was against the civil rights movement.<br><br>Reagan tapped into the resentment and rode it to victory.  One of his first actions was busting the airline traffic controllers union, and things have been going downhill ever since.</p>		</li>
