			<div class="markdown"><p>From the early to mid 1900s a lot of manufacturing that used to be based in the UK and Western Europe moved to the USA.  This process was accelerated by the world wars, where European countries and economies were torn down.  Meanwhile the USA got a boost because its industries were supplying war material to the UK, and because they helped to rebuild Europe after the war.  They also provided loans to the UK/Europe, as well as taking in European immigrants who contributed to the countries' science and labor force (i.e. Albert Einstein and German rocket-scientists brought to US after the war).</p>
<p>Then from the 1970s on manufacturing in the USA began moving to other countries, where labor costs were lower- i.e. Mexico, Brazil, China, India, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/cock_pussy_up gives a good answer.  My original statement was a little bitter because post war the US leveraged the debt the UK had to take with them to pay for the war to force the UK to open up the trade to the commonwealth countries.  This made trading with the UK less attractive,  and allowed the US to step in.  They also forced the UK government to make the pound convertible,  thus weakening the UK further.  The UK remained in rationing into the 50s because of the States.  Meanwhile the US gave vast aid to the European countries.  This was partly humanitarian but also to make sure the UK couldn't take economic advantage of a weak Europe.  Instead the UK has to use cast off pre-war machinery bought off Germany while the Germans replaced it with new machines bought off the Americans.  Compare Jaguar 's post-war history with BMW for example.</p>
<p>To be honest,  I would have done the same if I was American,  but it still leaves a bad taste in the mouth.  There has never been a special relationship between us,  more like siblings who hate each other but play nice on a Sunday in church.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>The UK kept rationing until 1950 because the post-war Labour government favoured central planning.  The Conservatives fought the 1950 general election over precisely the issue of rationing.</p>

<p>The European country which received far more aid than any other was .. the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan#Expenditures" target="_blank">UK</a></p>

<p>Yes.  Britain's class-ridden social structure and disdain for manufacturing produced many problems in the post-War period.  They weren't the fault of the Americans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Enjoy it while it lasts.  I'm honestly surprised to see any concern at all about Gen X in the media, and on the rare times I do see something, it's always by a Gen X author who feels totally forgotten about, like the rest of us.</p>
<p>I think most of the Millennials don't even stop to realize that having several hundred articles about how they aren't self-centered regularly circulated around all the mainstream news networks year after year doesn't exactly help prove their case.  I mean, how often do you see &quot;Gen X:  Are they still feeling alienated?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
