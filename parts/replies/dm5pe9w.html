			<div class="markdown"><p>In birds and mammals, the brain fills up the braincase and can leave impressions on the walls. We can use CT scanners to create digital models of the skull of these animals and then fill in the braincase digitally to get a 3D model of the brain. As I'm sure everyone knows, birds are dinosaurs, so we can use the same process with dinosaur skulls to get virtual brains (called <em>endocasts</em>) for extinct dinosaurs. As we move back in the lineage, the brain will occupy less of the braincase and have more fluid around it, leaving fewer impressions on the walls; so it gets less accurate as you move stemward on the tree. However, we can draw inferences from living crocodiles (close relatives to dinosaurs) to assess how much fluid would be present around the brain in these more basal extinct dinosaurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this an extremely new field of paleontology then? Or were people trying to make measurements concerning soft parts before things like CT scans and laser stimulated fluorescence? In fact, has there ever been brain tissue preserved in the fossil record?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a relatively new field in paleontology, but not brand new. People have been CT scanning fossils since the 90s. Before that, people were grinding up fossils in serial sections and tracing out the braincase to reconstruct the brain. CT does basically the same thing, but without destroying the fossil.</p>
<p>There hasn't been a whole brain preserved in the fossil record, but there was one study recently that said they might have a bit of <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/dinosaur-fossil-brain-tissue-paleontology-animals-science/" target="_blank">dura</a> preserved in a braincase, but more testing needs to be done. Sometimes we get natural endocasts - sediment fills up the braincase and solidifies, so we end up with a little brain-shaped rock. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how do you relate this to the development of flight? Do birds have a dedicated flight centre that you can track the evolution of through generations? In addition how accurate do the endocasts end up being? How much can information about the organism can you extrapolate from them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the exact question behind my dissertation! The CT scans give us endocasts that are reasonably accurate to the brain shape in bird-line dinosaurs, as long as the skulls aren't squished or deformed. But to understand what areas of the brains are used in flight, I looked at modern birds. I did a series of experiments where I had starlings fly in a wind tunnel and scanned their brain usage using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography" target="_blank">Positron Emission Tomography</a>. My team and I found that birds are using a couple of different nuclei in their forebrains to make rapid-fire decisions about flight, without entailing the use of the optic lobes. You can read more about that <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2016.02.025" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>Once I figured out which areas of the brain are used in flight, I looked for enlargement of those areas in the endocasts of different birds and extinct dinosaurs. This aspect of my work is just about ready for publication, so I can't say much more about it until it comes out. Stay tuned, though!</p></div>		</li>
