			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example of very precise geodesic measurements is the OPERA experiment. It measured the neutrino speed (with the unfortunate clock issue...), to do that the position had to be known very precisely. The measurement was based on GPS as it had to be an absolute measurement. <a href="https://www.lnf.infn.it/edu/incontri/2011/relazioni/paoloni.pdf" target="_blank">This presentation</a> has results on slide 33, you can clearly see the accuracy better than 1 cm for repeated measurements. You can also see the result of an earthquake in 2009 that shifted the position of the detector by a few centimeters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concerning the incredible accuracy of GPS, here's a neat trick you can do with your phone: get an app that shows your GPS coordinates and speed. While standing somewhere with good GPS reception, hold the phone still and then move it half a metre or so, and watch it register the relative movement of your phone by a few dm in relation to satellites that are hundreds of km away <em>and</em> moving at thousands of kph...</p></div>		</li>
