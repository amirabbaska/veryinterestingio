<p>but I am still kind of surprised there aren't at least attempts. </p>

<p>There's <em>at least</em> two factors involved in that.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The only attack you can't fully prepare for or 100% stop is one where the attacker(s) involved are willing to die to accomplish what they want to do.</p>
</li>
<li>Crazy people like that tend not to have their own resources to accomplish a task due to that sort of personality trait bleeding into their personal/professional lives.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: which results in a bunch of unfunded crazy people isolated from each other. I'm not strictly saying someone willing to commit an attack is crazy, but the non-crazy ones weigh their options and would rather survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially #1. It's really hard to stop people who are willing to die, even if you do have a massive advantage in training, equipment, preparation, etc. </p>
<p>cf. Every battle in the Pacific Theater of WWII where the Japanese military did something other than futile human wave attacks against entrenched positions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very possible. Especially considering how bad the public image of the leader in question would be if there was an assassination attempt reported every other week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like the most likely answer. The security teams that manage these types of events are massive, and are probably operating 99% behind the scenes, doing reconnaissance and diversion well in advance. There have probably been a number of assassination attempts foiled that we'll never hear of because they're stopped way, way ahead of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We may never even know how many assassination attempts were &quot;foiled&quot; purely because a willing assassin may have seen the amount of security present and decided it was impossible to pull off and just left.</p></div>		</li>
