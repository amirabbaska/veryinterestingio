			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and even transferring the process to a different place can make differences, as in your cake analogy even if you wrote down all the instructions, humidity and altitude will still make a difference to the end product. A lot of these process discoveries were completely by accident and sometimes we don't even know why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've often wondered if the order and all that really does matter that much. Obviously a cake has component parts but couldn't you just throw in all the sponge bits of the cake together and shake/stir for ages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should watch The Great British/Australian/American Bake Off.  Every episode has what they call a &quot;Technical Bake&quot; where bakers are only given a list of ingredients and very vague instructions on how to bake the thing they need to bake (i.e. how long to bake, when to stop mixing).  The tiniest of screw-ups in the technical bakes can deliver a devastating blow to the final product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it does, I became a chef after my retirement and i always made  bread for hobby, but before i learned how to &quot;properly&quot; do bread, they always ended up getting stone hard 2 days after i did them, turns out i was mixing the ingredients wrong, a little tweak in the system and my bread now is good to eat for a week</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>wow, Good to know and probably explains a lot about my cooking skills.</p>
<p>I kinda figured that if the ingredients were right and completely mixed it would all be the same whichever order you did it in, as long as there wasn't a cooking stage in the middle. </p></div>		</li>
