			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean it is irrelevant to the speed of charging. The speed of battery charging is much, slower than the speed of electricity. Besides, even if the speed was 1 meter/second, that would only mean a 1 second delay in starting charging. The speed of electricity is not the amount of electricity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electron flow is already slower than that,  so I assume you mean the speed of an electron. If the electrons are moving that slow the wire is probably really close to absolute zero.  The difference between 1 m/s and .6*speed of light in a vacuum is crazy.  It would reduce the power output by the same factor making a 10 Watt standard charger a 5.56Ã—10^-8 W  (watts) charger. Granite odds of anything being that cold,  probably 0. But for me too many things depend on the speed of electricity to say it is irrelevant</p></div>		</li>
