			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar understanding based on what jayf95 provided but correct me if I am wrong but wouldn't this be a reason for concern? Wouldn't delaying or stalling the neutrophil activity hurt/ lower the immune system capability and therefore leave one more susceptible to disease/ infection, thereby worsening the patient's condition?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immune system has many vectors, neutrophils being only one. It's likely the difference overall isn't huge and the relief is worth the slight dip in response. The body overreacts a lot, because over keeps someone alive better than under</p></div>		</li>

<p>That does sound correct, but then again we also have anti-inflammatory drugs to lessen swelling around something like an injured ligament. Swelling is the body's natural response, but sometimes it might be a little too aggressive in its attempts to repair itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What the researchers I mentioned found was that certain components of chicken noodle soup inhibit the ability of a specific type of immune cell (neutrophils) to find its way to the site of infection. Neutrophils will kill infected cells, and also make the area a hostile environment (by releasing cytokines) which all ends up making you feel shitty.</p>

<p>Wait, chicken soup is actually bad?</p></div>		</li>
