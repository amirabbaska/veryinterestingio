			<div class="markdown"><p>Of all the subreddits, AskScience is by far in the best position to preserve its quality in the face of the onslaught. I hope they are able to keep their high standards and keep providing an example to the rest of reddit. Stay strong moderators!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the Mods do a great job, but what also helps is having users who <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1kfb3g/what_is_the_color_of_the_sun_white_or_yellow/cbochno" target="_blank">upvote good scientific content</a> and downvote nonsense.</p>
<p>Edit: Reddit gold for this comment? Thanks anonymous benefactor!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest though, the presumption of guilt in that case seems a little premature. What seems more likely: there was an actual conspiracy among one scientist and her advisor to fake results, or some clumsy wording when all they meant to say was &quot;do this analysis&quot; (or whatever, I'm not a chemist)?</p>
<p>People write notes to one another in manuscripts all the time, and are generally not careful about how it might sound if someone else reads it out of context. I'm sure I've written some note somewhere that would look incriminating if I forgot to remove it before submitting for publication.</p>
<p>Should it have been caught? Yes.</p>
<p>Are they definitely guilty of scientific fraud? I'm going to withhold judgement for a bit</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd love a mobile app which was just an askscience search. Not asking a question, just searching for similarly asked questions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't completely agree. One reason people would use /r/AskScience instead of going to Wikipedia is that it gives them an opportunity to personally interact with experts in the field. There are often more efficient ways to get your question answered than having a human assist you personally, but the engagement carries real value and is the reason the subreddit exists.</p>
<p>Everything in moderation, though -- it's understandable that folk will lose patience answering frequently asked questions, and for that reason places like /r/ScienceFaqs exist. I don't think berating people for not going there (or searching for an answer) first is ever appropriate, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand this very well.  But, I agree that there are some Qs that can be easily answered with a google even though we are frequently available.  Not all of us will click on a Q and answer it, mostly because it's so googleable that we're more hungry for better and tougher questions to answer.  It's more about weighing time investment because we try to give a lot of background info when we answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that /r/AskScience has the advantage of interaction (also, Wiki's articles related to math are generally unreadable for anyone below a graduate level), but there are some times when the same question, almost verbatim, has been asked so many times that <em>even reddit's search function</em> can find multiple examples in this sub. Especially with /r/AskScience returning to default status, it's very important that people at least bother to see if their question can be answered with a ten-second search.</p></div>		</li>
