			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, there's totally no need to apologise in advance, that was a super interesting and detailed explanation. As someone who finds music theory fascinating but has little to no knowledge on it this kind of what I was hoping for. </p>
<p>I know that I like this and how it's supposed to make me feel, but not why, and it's weird how you can appreciate something without understanding the reason behind it.
Though this pretty much clears it up! The chord progression makes perfect sense once it's explained, but I'd never really thought about certain instruments being more sentimental than others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You might also like<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrwyk/episodes/downloads" target="_blank"> Howard Goodall and Suzy Klein's discussion</a> about 50 pieces of classical music ranging from the Baroque period to around now. It's in bitesize chunks and they talk more about the feeling of the music and why it was written rather than the theory but it's a really great introduction to classical music, at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really misleading and a symptom of the wider trivialization of harmony that you say that C major can't use chords out of the key. That is entirely untrue. </p></div>		</li>
