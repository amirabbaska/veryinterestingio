			<div class="markdown"><p>But they don't really need to appease those viewers, as long as they're still subscribers. In an ideal world for Netflix, they have millions of subscribers who never watch anything, thus saving on bandwidth costs. I can only assume that the money they're &quot;losing&quot; is the viewers that they believe <em>didn't</em> become subscribers thanks to a new show.</p>
<p>In other words, when they launch Marco Polo, they believe that it will cause x-thousand new subscribers who want to see it. When that doesn't happen, they call it a loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, while it sounds right is not how it works at all. Netflix needs it's subscribers to watch shows, they need you to watch as much as possible in order for their analytical and data systems to do their jobs. </p>
<p>If their subscribers aren't watching then companies stop putting their shows / movies on the platform and then people stop subscribing.  There is a reason why they make it as easy as possible to watch the next episode after one is finished or click on a related series as soon as you finish one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But as soon as I put the controller on charge, it wants to know if I'm still watching and I have get out from my covers to walk across the room again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I understand this correctly, the “loss” is a loss only when compared to how many viewed they projected the show to have? Therefore they overestimated? Sounds like how corporate runs their quarterly and yearly #’s... lots has to do with projection, if you over-project, your next quarter will suffer, but not really because you performed the same... bit if you’d not have overestimated, you #’s would look better the next quarter. Kinda like that? </p>
<p>I’m not in finance, I just watch the presentations my employers board of directors make, and listen to them fault management for incorrect projections...</p></div>		</li>
