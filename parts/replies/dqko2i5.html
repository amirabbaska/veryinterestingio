<p>Exactly</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3/4 is usually a waltz 1-2-3, and would almost never have dotted quarter notes or triplets.</p>

<p>Which waltz doesn't have triplets or dotted quarters in it? I can think of one that has both: La Valse (by Ravel). </p>
<blockquote>
<p>6/8 almost always divide the measure into two parts, and tends to have a lot of dotted quarter notes and triplets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6/8 having triplets? What? You mean subdivision of the beat is &quot;triplets?&quot; In 6/8, it's (usually) divided into 2 parts with the main subdivision being 6 8th notes, 3 per beat. So I see where you get the triplets thing from, but be careful calling them triplets because they're not REALLY triplets, they're still called 8th notes, just in 6/8. </p>
<p>I would say that in classical music, with 2/2 time, you're not more or less likely to see something like quarter/half/quarter than you are any other note value. The composer could write any note value he wants, and they have. Sure, if we're not talking about classical music here, there are all kinds of music written in certain time signatures because it's tradition. </p>
<p>There's an exception for every rule.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What I was trying and failed to say is that in 3/4, the rhythm is more likely to be divided at the three beats than between them.  Quarter-quarter-quarter, eighth-eighth-quarter-quarter. quarter.-quarter. and quarter.-eighth-eighth-eighth is going to be rarer.</p>
<p>In contrast, in 6/8, the rhythm is most likely to be divided by between the 3rd and 4th beat, making constructs like quarter.-quarter. constructs common and one like quarter-quarter-quarter rare.</p>
<p>And of course, there are exceptions to just about everything, especially in music theory.</p></div>		</li>
