			<div class="markdown"><p>not quite. the pixel would have no proper color. It can only energize one atom. If it is not absorbed by the subpixel's filter element, it will strike one subpixel on the sensor. I'm fairly certain most commercially available sensors (if not all) are totally incapable of detecting a single photon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think we're looking for something like <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/080318/images/452264b.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. PMT = PhotoMultipier Tube, one of the last places where vacuum tubes truely are superior to solid state electronics. If you're not familiar they can actually detect single photons.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Here we report that humans can detect a single-photon incident on the cornea with a probability significantly above chance. This was achieved by implementing a combination of a psychophysics procedure with a quantum light source that can generate single-photon states of light. We further discover that the probability of reporting a single photon is modulated by the presence of an earlier photon, suggesting a priming process that temporarily enhances the effective gain of the visual system on the timescale of seconds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're right that film would behave the same way, the question is whether or not the effect that the single photon had on the film would be observable with anything other than perhaps an extremely powerful electron microscope at atomic level magnification. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the way film works is that a photon strikes a molecule of photosensitive material, and that molecule breaks down. When you develop the film, the bits that didn't break down get washed away, leaving you with a negative. Since there are usually many photons, a lot of these molecules will get washed away. By adding more of them, you can get a more sensitive film. The problem is that one photon can only do one molecule. So adding sensitivity doesn't actually help here, as you're still limited by your ability to pick out one molecule that was broken apart out of many trillions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it means one photon. It's one photon at a time, as if it were a single file line of photons. In generating a photo with a regular camera, you would just increase the exposure time in relation to the decrease in aperture size. Once you get to a low enough photons/second you'll be running into noise issues on a digital camera and reciprocity failure on film though. </p></div>		</li>
