			<div class="markdown"><p>Robert Zubrin in his book about Mars has an interesting solution for this. Instead of using 2 capsules, you use expended material you don't have any other use for, for example a stage from the rocket. Put that on the end of a tether. No requirement for any electrical/hydraulic/etc connection between the discarded bit, since it's just used as mass. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hm. But isn't the purpose of a rocket stage to move away from it after you lose it? So how would an old stage be available?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't know if 1g is preferable though. Maybe 1/2g is enough, or less. We have no idea what the optimal number is. We have no idea if just sleeping laying down (so you don't get sick) is enough to mitigate working in 0g otherwise.</p>
<p>The problem is how to get humans to thrive (or close enough) in space, not perfectly recreate Earth in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even sitting, or just not moving around a lot. And some people it might not bother, other people might become accustomed to it like sea sickness. Maybe sitting and sleeping in 1/4g for half a day is enough to mitigate the worst effects of micro gravity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wondered if their was an minimum size the ring would have to be to be safe. I'm thinking of the tidal forces between your feet and your head and if that would cause any weirdness in your bodies reaction. In an extreme example your head could be in zero G while your feet are in 1G....that doesn't seem healthy. </p></div>		</li>
