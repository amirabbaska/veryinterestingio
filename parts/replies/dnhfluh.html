			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, glad it made your day! It was really funny to us how viral it went... it really was one of those things that was a joke between us, I shared it on the 'net and the magic took over.  We're pretty lucky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh, it's a long story (and several articles tell it if you google) but at the end of a long day at The Magic Kingdom in Disney World, I didn't feel like going on Splash Mountain with her.  It's her favorite ride - so I told her to go enjoy it by herself.  She went off, a little mad at me, and I waited at the end of the queue with our Son and her parents.  When she got off the ride, she held up her phone, which already had the ride pic on it, and said, &quot;I did this for you!&quot; and it was the pic of her staring angrily at the camera! I died laughing; it was too perfect.  Later on, I put it on social media and on reddit here - suddenly, people were sharing it and making hilarious photoshops.  It was a joke between us, but it went crazy!</p></div>		</li>
