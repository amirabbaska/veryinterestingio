			<div class="markdown"><p>Talking of vacuum for cavitation is a bit misleading though. It's the boiling point being brought lower than ambient temperature by the low pressure. It's close to vacuum but it's still an evaporation so cavitation won't happen in the same way depending on the liquid and ambient temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why back cracks by the professionals are referred to as cavitation? Bones move fast, synovial fluid moves slower, result is...? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes actually it is, as far as I know there is a gas(not sure wich one but i think it's co2) building up by moving the joints. and when you &quot;crack them&quot; it is cavitation. However Not sure but I don't think it is due to the fast moving of bones but more because of the the pressure of 2 bones pushing the gas until it escapes the joint since you can crack your back or joints by moving them not only fast but slowly as well.</p></div>		</li>
