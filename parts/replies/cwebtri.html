			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just northern European languages, either: most, if not all (too lazy to check) Romance languages start their 'teens' at 6:</p>
<p><strong>EN:</strong> one, two, three, …, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, …, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen<br />
<strong>PT:</strong> um, dois, três, …, nove, dez, onze, doze, …, quinze, dezasseis, dezassete, dezoito, dezanove</p>
<p>Those last ones are, as you might have guessed, derived from &quot;ten and [number]&quot;. (In Brazil they're spelled a bit differently, by the way: <em>dezesseis, dezessete,</em> &amp;c.)</p>
<p>Most, if not all (again, not going to check) Slavic languages, on the other hand, do all the numbers from 11–19 uniformly:</p>
<p><strong>RU:</strong> один, два, три, …, восемь, девять, десять, одиннадцать, двенадцать, … восемнадцать, девятнадцать<br />
<strong>Translit.:</strong> <em>odin, dva, tri, …, vosjem', devjat', desjat', odinnadtsat', dvenadtsat', …, vosjemnadtsat', devjatnadtsat'</em><br />
<strong>EN:</strong> one, two, three, …, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, …, eighteen, nineteen</p>
<p>For those of you familiar with <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, the Russian-influenced slang spoken by the younger characters (cf. &quot;droog&quot; for &quot;friend&quot; from Russian друг <em>drug</em> &quot;friend&quot;), is named Nadsat after the &quot;-teen&quot; suffix in Russian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Greek also does it like English, sort of. Eleven and twelve are έντεκα  and δώδεκα respectively, which basically mean one-ten and two-ten, then the format reverses for δεκατρία, δεκατέσσερα, δεκαπέντε, etc. so that &quot;ten&quot; comes first in the word. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Norwegian, too. The numbers you listed are spelled identically to the Danish ones (you're missing an E in 'en', btw).</p>
<p>My point, though, was that the &quot;Eleven and twelve are structures which show up in other northern-European languages…&quot; bit is applicable to more than northern European languages. English, being a Germanic language, does it the same way as the other Germanic languages, but non-Germanic languages still have a similar division.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your take on the Romance languages is a little misleading. Many, but not all, of them do switch to a different system at 16 (Spanish and Portuguese) or 17 (French, Italian), but 11-15 (or 11-16) are still analogous to the Germanic teens (assuming the &quot;teens&quot; means something like &quot;word derived from single digit numeral + a form derived from ten&quot;), but I see your point.</p>
<p>What's extra weird, though, is that Latin also shifted the counting, but not until 18 (i.e., <em>septendecim</em> &quot;seven-ten&quot; but <em>duodeviginti</em>, &quot;two from twenty&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, they do switch to some kind of &quot;10-form&quot; (the <em>-ze</em> in Portuguese), but then there's an additional shift. Intuitively, I don't &quot;feel&quot; a split between 1–10 and 11–15 forms in Spanish and Portuguese, so much as I do between the 11–15 forms and the 16–19 ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever look at the higher numbers under a hundred in French?</p>
<p>Until the accountants got tired of saying the higher numbers the way they were still being taught in the 70s, French had soixante, sixty; soixante-dix, sixty-ten, or seventy; then quatre-vingt, four-twenty, meaning eighty, and quatre-vingt-dix, four-twenty-ten, for ninety. Ninety-nine is, using this method, four-twenty-ten-nine.</p>
<p>The accountants did the logical thing and took sept, seven, and made septante, seventy; likewise huitante and neuvante for eighty and ninety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really the way it works in French, but French likes to be different amongst the romance languages.</p>
<p><strong>EN:</strong> one, two, three, ..., nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen</p>
<p><strong>FR:</strong> un, deux, trois, ..., neuf, dix, onze, douze, treize, quatorze, quinze, seize, dix-sept, dix-huit, dix-neuf</p>
<p>If anything, 17, 18, and 19 are just odd ones out. Then again, this is also the language that gives you 97 as <em>quatre-vingts dix-sept</em> or &quot;four twenties seventeen&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>12 is from a primitive counting system using one hand.  Each finger has three sections.  Using your thumb, count sections.  You get 12.  Use your other hand to track those and you get 12x12, 144.  Those numbers both show up in the bible, clocks and elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each finger also has four divisions if you prefer to count joints and tips. Add in three for the thumb and two for the empty set and closed fist and you can count to 21. Or go binary and it's an easy 31!</p>
<p>There are actually lots of different finger-counting systems and although most of them have physical bases, the fact that there are so many different ones suggests that this isn't the only influence. Base-12 is popular because it is very divisible for instance, while base-10 and base-16 show up in other cultures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heh; I always assumed that base 10 comes from counting on your fingers, and base 12 (dozen) comes from counting on your fingers and your feet (too much hassle to take your shoes off), and base 20 (score) comes from counting on your fingers and toes.</p>
<p>I'd never heard that &quot;count finger joints&quot; system before, but I guess it makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A priest once told me the counting in dozens came from sheep farmers who used to count sheep on one hand using the thumb to count on the knuckles and tips on the same hand each finger being 3 (two knuckles and one tip) which left the other hand free to hold the crook, sheep or dog. Never questioned his knowledge because I don't want it to be not true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For somebody not from the area I guess the best way would be to just get in touch with any local fish processors and ask if they know of any boats looking fir a deck-hand and if they can pass on your number to a skipper... Or just turn up at the area and go to the nearest pub and start asking. Be sure to buy the skipper a pint before asking though ;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, this way you only needed to count to 12, then 12 12 (144) which wasn't 144 in your mind but 12 parcels, or bushels or whatever measurement you did. So your local wheat farmer would have no real understanding of what 1,728 was but could bring in Twelve Gross of wheat bushels from the winter harvest. This kind of numeric understanding explains why we have odd hangovers in numbers like the french 99 (Quatre-Vingts Dix-Neuf, literally 4 times 20 plus 19)</p></div>		</li>
