			<p>It's not just northern European languages, either: most, if not all (too lazy to check) Romance languages start their 'teens' at 6:<br><br><strong>EN:</strong> one, two, three, …, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, …, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen  <br><strong>PT:</strong> um, dois, três, …, nove, dez, onze, doze, …, quinze, dezasseis, dezassete, dezoito, dezanove<br><br>Those last ones are, as you might have guessed, derived from &quot;ten and [number]&quot;.

			<p>Ooop right you are. Sorry I was reading fast (and didn't look at the source) because I'm at work. Thought you said German. But yes, the invasion of what is now Great Britain by the Normans was one of many events that combined the Germanic and Romance linguistic branches. People often forget that languages do not occur in a vacuum and that cultural contact creates a lot of grey area in the field of linguistic study.

			<p>I believe that number must be based on the entire English vocabulary. A huge amount of English words are scientific or technical terms derived from Latin or Greek, often via French. They are however not in daily use by most people. If you count only words likely to be used in a normal conversation, I believe germanic roots would be in the majority. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well, I'm sure it is based on the whole vocabulary, but you'd be surprised how many words we commonly use are of Latin or French origin. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_words_of_French_origin" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:<br><br>&gt; Most of the French vocabulary now appearing in English was imported over the centuries following the Norman Conquest of 1066, when England came under the administration of Norman-speaking peoples. The majority of the population of England continued to use their Anglo-Saxon language, but it was influenced by the language of the ruling elite, resulting in doublets. Consider for example the words for the meats eaten by the Anglo-Norman nobility and the corresponding animals grown by the Anglo-Saxon peasants: beef / ox, mutton / sheep, veal / calf, pork / pig, or pairs of words pertaining to different registers of language: commence / start, continue / go on, disengage / withdraw, encounter / meet, vend / sell, purchase / buy. Words of French origin often refer to more abstract or elaborate notions than their Anglo-Saxon equivalents (e.g. liberty / freedom, justice / fairness), and are therefore of less frequent use in everyday language. This may not, however, be the case for all English words of French origin. Consider, for example: able, car, chair, city, country, fine, fruit, journey, juice, just, part, people, real, stay, table, travel, use, very, and wait.<br><br>For a fanciful look at what an English science text might look without loanwords from French, Latin, and Greek, check out Poul Anderson's <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/message/raw?msg=alt.language.artificial/ZL4e3fD7eW0/_7p8bKwLJWkJ" target="_blank">&quot;Uncleftish Beholding.&quot;</a></p>		</li>

			<p>You think that's weird? Ottoman Turkish had up to <strong>88%</strong> of its vocabulary come from Arabic and Farsi. Farsi is an Indo-European language, Arabic is an Afro-Semitic language, and Turkish is, unsurprisingly, a Turkic language. Turkish is also a very vowel-heavy language and Ottoman Turkish was written in Arabic script, which is an abjad script (which means it omits almost all vowels and leaves it up to the reader to basically infer what vowels are supposed to be there). It was functionally impossible to read and write Ottoman Turkish using only words of Turkish origin in what was widely accepted as the &quot;proper&quot; alphabet for the language.<br><br>And because that's not bad enough, Ottoman Turkish is also a nightmare to parse. There are <em>three</em> different letters (sin, se, sad) that all correspond to the letter s. There are three more (zi, ze, zel) that correspond to the letter z. The letter kef can refer to <em>four</em> different letters (or it can be used to refer to the weird pseudo-g they've got that has you elongate the previous vowel sound and omit the g sound; see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpdbR_ey7xA" target="_blank">President Erdogan's name</a>). And while the Ottoman Turkish script does add a few letters (Farsi script adds four letters over basic Arabic), that's often absolutely no help because the letter vav can correspond to four different vowels (o, oe, u, ue)... or it can correspond to the letter v because <em>of course it can</em>. And that's not all of it. <br><br>I am so happy the Turks were immediately like &quot;fuck this noise&quot; and adopted the Latin alphabet after the Ottoman Empire dissolved. It makes my job as a historian so much easier. </p>		</li>

			<p>I actually imagined an italian speaker trying to woo someone in english and being all like &quot;screws-a this-a, this ain't romantic-a&quot;.<br><br>I've seen them get called romanic, latin, neolatin, neoromanic (whatever that means), italic languages etc but yeah definitely not romantic. </p>		</li>

			<p>Greek also does it like English, sort of. Eleven and twelve are έντεκα  and δώδεκα respectively, which basically mean one-ten and two-ten, then the format reverses for δεκατρία, δεκατέσσερα, δεκαπέντε, etc. so that &quot;ten&quot; comes first in the word. </p>		</li>

			<p>Norwegian, too. The numbers you listed are spelled identically to the Danish ones (you're missing an E in 'en', btw).<br><br>My point, though, was that the &quot;Eleven and twelve are structures which show up in other northern-European languages…&quot; bit is applicable to more than northern European languages. English, being a Germanic language, does it the same way as the other Germanic languages, but non-Germanic languages still have a similar division.</p>		</li>

			<p>Your take on the Romance languages is a little misleading. Many, but not all, of them do switch to a different system at 16 (Spanish and Portuguese) or 17 (French, Italian), but 11-15 (or 11-16) are still analogous to the Germanic teens (assuming the &quot;teens&quot; means something like &quot;word derived from single digit numeral + a form derived from ten&quot;), but I see your point.<br><br>What's extra weird, though, is that Latin also shifted the counting, but not until 18 (i.e., <em>septendecim</em> &quot;seven-ten&quot; but <em>duodeviginti</em>, &quot;two from twenty&quot;).</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, they do switch to some kind of &quot;10-form&quot; (the <em>-ze</em> in Portuguese), but then there's an additional shift. Intuitively, I don't &quot;feel&quot; a split between 1–10 and 11–15 forms in Spanish and Portuguese, so much as I do between the 11–15 forms and the 16–19 ones.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, they all switch at 11, ha. I don't know Romanian all that well, but just from having a quick glance I can see that all the numerals from 11-19 follow the same pattern, which is &quot;single digit numeral + prezece&quot;. The <em>zece</em>-part is clearly the reflex of Latin <em>decem</em>, but I'm not sure what the <em>pre-</em> means. Any ideas?</p>		</li>

			<p>Ever look at the higher numbers under a hundred in French?<br><br>Until the accountants got tired of saying the higher numbers the way they were still being taught in the 70s, French had soixante, sixty; soixante-dix, sixty-ten, or seventy; then quatre-vingt, four-twenty, meaning eighty, and quatre-vingt-dix, four-twenty-ten, for ninety. Ninety-nine is, using this method, four-twenty-ten-nine.<br><br>The accountants did the logical thing and took sept, seven, and made septante, seventy; likewise huitante and neuvante for eighty and ninety.</p>		</li>

			<p>Are those actually used? I was taught soixante, soixante-dix, quatre-vignts,and quatre-vingt-dix, with a native French speaker confirming that's &quot;just how it is.&quot;<br><br>Is it a France vs Canada thing, maybe? Because I'm not very familiar with Canadian French.</p>		</li>

			<p>This was told me when I learned French at UCLA around 1970. They used &quot;Langue et Langage,&quot; which was the UN-approved method of teaching people French when the people had no common language. It was all French from day 1.</p>		</li>

			<p>It seems that soixante-dix and so on is used in France, but Switzerland and Belgium use septante, etc.<br><br><a href="http://www.academie-francaise.fr/la-langue-francaise/questions-de-langue#78_strong-em-septante-octante-nonante-em-strong" target="_blank">From the Académie française</a>:<br>&gt; Vous vous interrogez sur une des bizarreries les plus célèbres de la langue française. Pourquoi en effet dire soixante-dix, quatre-vingts, quatre-vingt-dix, alors que les formes septante, octante, nonante, en accord tout à la fois avec le latin et le système décimal, sont plus ou moins largement usitées dans divers pays francophones ?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Ce système, dit « vicésimal », était utilisé par les Celtes et par les Normands, et il est possible que l’un ou l’autre de ces peuples l’ait introduit en Gaule...Dès la fin du Moyen Âge, les formes concurrentes trente, quarante, cinquante, soixante se répandent victorieusement. Pourquoi l’usage s’arrête-t-il en si bon chemin ? Aucune explication n’est vraiment convaincante.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; C’est au XVIIe siècle, sous l’influence de Vaugelas et de Ménage, que l’Académie et les autres auteurs de dictionnaires ont adopté définitivement les formes soixante-dix, quatre-vingts, quatre-vingt-dix au lieu de septante, octante, nonante. Il est à noter pourtant que les mots septante, octante, nonante figurent dans toutes les éditions du Dictionnaire de l’Académie française... Ils sont officiels en Belgique et en Suisse (sauf, cependant, octante, qui a été supplanté par quatre-vingts et huitante – en Suisse – tant dans l’usage courant que dans l’enseignement ou les textes administratifs). Rien n’interdit de les employer, mais par rapport à l’usage courant en France, ils sont perçus comme régionaux ou vieillis.<br><br>In short, they were both common, historically, but now one form (&quot;soixante-dix&quot;) is used in France and the other in other French-speaking countries, except Canada, which <a href="http://www.trailcanada.com/travel/french_travel_phrases/numbers_days/" target="_blank">apparently also uses &quot;soixante-dix</a>&quot; (not the best source, but almost everything else was just forum posts from people in Quebec).

			<p>Why? Because the Academie Francaise is interested in maintaining the purity of the French language, meaning the state that it was in quite some time ago. <br><br>I still can't wrap my head around &quot;ordinateur&quot; for computer.<br><br>By the way, I heard septante etc from a French French teacher in 1970. He said accounting people used that though most other people did not.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not really the way it works in French, but French likes to be different amongst the romance languages.<br><br><strong>EN:</strong> one, two, three, ..., nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen<br><br><br><br><strong>FR:</strong> un, deux, trois, ..., neuf, dix, onze, douze, treize, quatorze, quinze, seize, dix-sept, dix-huit, dix-neuf<br><br>If anything, 17, 18, and 19 are just odd ones out. Then again, this is also the language that gives you 97 as <em>quatre-vingts dix-sept</em> or &quot;four twenties seventeen&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>But how does this explain latin-based languages, where the discrepancy goes all the way up to 15?<br><br>For example, Spanish:  once, doce, trece, catorce, quince, dieciseis, diecisiete, dieciocho, ...  It doesn't switch at 12.</p>		</li>
