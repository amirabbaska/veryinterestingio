<p>Basically the at-home version would be to run a toothbrush slowly along the roof of your mouth as far back as you can without stimulating the reflex. Keep it there for a while and switch to moving the toothbrush side to side, still very slowly. When you feel comfortable, move it further back. Repeat daily or twice daily until you start to feel less sensitive.</p></div>		</li>
