			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, though I'd like to make a friendly amendment. There are some states where corporations can directly donate to candidate committees for local and state races. That ban only applies to federal races and states that have chosen to adopt a similar law.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>There have been some proposals to make campaign costs be paid for by the government rather than from donations, but there's a serious problem with those proposals - they really help people who are already in office. People who are already in office have good name recognition and already have connections with the media, so they have a huge advantage over challengers. Fund-raising is one of the few ways that challengers have of getting an advantage over a veteran politician.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is questionable as fundraising is almost universally seen as an incumbent advantage. It's just very hard to defeat incumbents to begin with. If you had equal money spent on the campaign you'd probably keep the opposition from getting overwhelmed monetarily and force the incumbent and the opponent to do things to get free media, which could be good, like debates, or bad like accusing Mexico of sending rapists over the border. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that if it were government funding for campaigns, the total would be far less than it is now.  It would be very difficult to justify taxpayers spending billions of dollars promoting campaigns for candidates that a lot of people don't like.</p>
<p>(And that gets to another problem with the public funding model: you are spending taxpayers' money on promoting candidates whose political platforms they, the taxpayers, disagree with, and who they personally hate.)</p>
<p>But if it were government spending, it would be at a much lower level, at which point, yes, the incumbent's name recognition and media access would be huge advantages.  And incumbents would have powerful incentives to limit campaign spending as much as possible to enhance their inherent advantages.</p>
<p>And for better or for worse, political ads do a lot to get people thinking about the candidates and the issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, correct me if I am wrong, but corporations can advertise <em>for</em> a candidate?</p>
<p>They can't donate to his campaign, but say, nothing stopping an oil company from plastering &quot;The true cost of the Global Warming Hoax&quot; billboards everywhere no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've simplified things a bit (this is ELI5, after all), the actual law has a lot of complicated sections to it.  Corporations are allowed to advertise for or against a candidate or issue as long as they don't coordinate with the official campaign of a candidate.  So yes, they can show an ad saying &quot;vote for Senator Brown&quot;, just as long as they're not coordinating with Senator Brown or his or her campaign.</p>
<p><em>In practice</em>, the vast majority of corporations don't do this kind of thing, because political candidates sometimes lose (see: 2016), and corporations don't want to deal with the problems it could cause them if they openly back one candidate but another wins.  Corporations tend to be much more involved when it comes to specific issues (like trade policy) than specific candidates.</p>
<p>To your question, there is nothing stopping a corporation from buying billboard signs warning people that global warming is a hoax.  There's nothing to stop an individual person from doing that, and what the courts have ruled is that corporations have (more or less) the same speech rights as individuals.  In practice, media organizations had been doing that since forever, the only impact of the Supreme Court ruling was to expand that to all corporations instead of just newspapers and television stations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different routes money can take to a campaign. Idk why super PACs haven't been brought up down to this point yet. They can accept unlimited sums of money from corporations or anybody and spend unlimited amounts directly towards a campaign/candidate, and we call that &quot;hard money&quot;. Hard money goes directly to the campaign, and political action committee are just the way to do that. Soft money is paying for ads and such, stuff that doesn't constitute money going directly to a candidate. I think super PACs are the problem people are looking for here, although they have regulations and such just like anybody else.</p></div>		</li>
