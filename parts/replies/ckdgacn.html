			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Everyone got paid in cash&quot;</p>
<p>Is this something younger generations didn't know? Seriously? Wow. </p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for sharing. This is interesting to read as I still use cash for everything and I'm only 32. I didn't realize there was such a generation gap. I still considered myself young. I get paid in check/direct deposit and then I go to the bank and withdraw what I need. Even when I was unemployed I would transfer the deposit to my bank and withdraw it as cash. I use my debit card on occasion. It's just too easy to buy junk you don't need when it's all electronic. I feel a pang in my body when I'm counting out $200 in cash for groceries, or break my $20 for a $3 frappachino versus no pain when I swipe a card. I see the money come in and I see it go. That's a satisfaction I can't get from a card. Plus I'm always afraid my card won't work - that idea is mortifying to me. That's amazing that 10 years of technology creates this much of a difference in commerce. </p>
<p>Edit 2: I'm amazed at how baffled people are about paying bills in cash. Very simple and takes less than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Step one: drive to office location
Step two: go in and give worker your account #
Step three: pay cash
Step four: get receipt
Step five: get in car and drive home</p>
<p>I have the satisfaction of never &quot;forgetting&quot; about a subscription and getting charged for an extra month. I'm in contact with humans so they know me and customer service is great. I would argue spending 5 minutes a month isn't nearly as wasteful as spending two hours or more on a call center hotline to fix an issue when something goes wrong. I'm on a first name bases with my bank teller, which comes in handy if I ever get a check that typically might have a hold - they give me an advance on it because of the relationship. If I ever want to buy something online I get a prepaid card so if the site is hacked I have peace of mind. I can close my bank account whenever I want because I don't have it linked to a million random online subscriptions. (That wasn't the case for me about five years ago when I moved and tried to close an account). </p>
<p>You can completely exist on cash and it's great. Also I'm not in debt up to my eyeballs from credit card use which is really freeing. </p>
<p>It looks like now I'll have the added satisfaction of knowing I'll be irritating a few Redditor trolls who think using cash is &quot;rude&quot;, so there is that too! I know there are a lot of people out there like me, they are just too busy living their life to have a reddit account. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's super interesting to me that you use cash in part because it makes it harder to make unnecessary purchases, because I <em>don't</em> use cash for the exact same reason. </p>
<p>To me the total amount in my bank account (which I try to know at all times) is my working capital, so any time I make purchase seeing the total gives me that pang of guilt and I have to readjust how much I have in my head. Taking out money at an ATM gives me that same feeling, but once I have it out it feels like it's already been spent, and I'm way more frivolous with it. Avoiding having cash makes it way easier to save. Plus then I can use Mint to track where it all goes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if I have cash it gets spent, and often I wonder if I got mugged or something due to how quickly it goes. Seriously, if I get out $60 its gone in a day, but if I keep an empty wallet then I won't buy all the coffees or whatever else it is I'm wasting it on..</p></div>		</li>

<p>The big hit for me is once I break a larger bill... I'd find myself waiting as long as I could to break a 20 or 50, but then once I did it was gone almost immediately.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>When I look at that total (cash - student loans - debt) I know I'm in the red and I stop spending money :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting because it is basically the opposite for me. I find cash in hand is spent dough. If I am walking around with $200 I don't even consider it as part of my total funds. It is spent.</p>
<p>Way too easy for me to buy a $3 frappachino when I have cash, rather than feeling inconvenienced by having to swipe/insert my card, put in my pin, wait for the transaction to go through... all for a $3 drink? Nope. But if I have a $20? Quick and easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I think it's because at any given time I can look up my bank and credit card balances, and any purchases I make with card are reflected immediately. Cash, though... Like you said - it's already &quot;spent&quot;. It's already come out of my account, so it's not &quot;real&quot; to me any more. </p>
<p>I'd be willing to bet this tendency is also a generational thing to some extent. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And I'm not sure I see how using cash is any faster than a debit/credit card. You have to count out the right amount of cash (if you aren't giving them a single bill), they have to count out your change, and you have to put that all away (unless you just stuff it into your pocket for the moment).</p>
<p>If they don't want a receipt, customers walk out of my store much faster if they use credit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 30, and I have a completely opposite view from you. I use cards for everything. I get paid in direct deposit, I buy everything on a rewards credit card, and when I owe friends money I use an electronic transfer.</p>
<p>I'm hyper aware of my bank and card balances, and spending money that way seems &quot;real&quot;. Cash feels like monopoly money to me. I feel like I've &quot;spent&quot; the money as soon as I withdraw it from my account, since my bank balance goes down. </p>
<p>I can fritter away $200 in cash without thinking about it, but it's painful to put even a $5 coffee on my credit card.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then why do banks still have such crap opening hours? (I live in Sweden and it feels like the banks here are open five minutes per week.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason banks are open five minutes per week, is because physically attending a bank now days is not common if you don't have business errands. And those are done during the day, usually, when the businessman is working doing business. It makes no sense for banks to have long opening hours in their office branches. SEB (Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken), for example, can help you with anything you need 24/7 as long as you have your identification thingy (Kod-dosan). They can transfer money for you. Heck, they can even give you a 2 000 000 SEK loan on the phone to buy your apartment.</p>
<p>And for those who are not living in Sweden, I might as well write this for the record: We don't use cheques in Sweden. And we don't normally pay bills by physically going to the bank. It's common to simply scan a bill with the bank's app, and click on done.</p>
<p>Also, there are some people, very, very few, who want to withdraw money by talking to a clerk, and who want to pay their bill by handing them over to a clerk, and pay cash. Usually the elderly. There are banks that have specialized in these customers. The biggest one is Forex and ICA-banken (that is also a grocery store, by the way). Forex is open from morning to late evening, and even on weekends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes awhile to clear a check, because once you deposit it, the place you deposit it at has to make sure all checks are scanned and they are sent to a much larger bank, unless that check was written on that same bank.</p>
<p>Then the larger bank sends all of the checks that were sent to it to a clearinghouse, which deposits/withdrawals among the banks.</p>
<p>and then sometimes checks don't work because they are written improperly/scanned improperly.</p></div>		</li>

In germany a law was introduced which made it so that they are only allowed to take 1 day and suddenly they all need only exactly 1 day now. If it was reduced to 5 minutes it would probably take 4:59 mins...</p>

They are open during &quot;business hours&quot; to do business with other businesses, and wealthy individuals.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. You be very surprised how many different people, of many different walks of life show up at a bank during the day. People in office jobs also have lunch hours, so they go then. Also people work different hours - some labor and manufacturing jobs start very early - or some people start late. And yes, of course, banks do business with other local businesses in the course of a day. And yes, banks do fall all over themselves for the wealthy people. Although - in my experience - my customers who have more money and better paying jobs (at least the younger ones) tend to jump more on the online, mobile and ATM banking. They can't be bothered to come to the bank. </p>
<p>Also: Banks will always exist in some capacity or another along as we have cash floating around. People come to the bank, who do not have an account anywhere, to cash their pay checks, as long as it's drawn on that particular bank and usually for a fee. People have a vast array of reasons to why they can't or don't want a bank account.  Individuals also come to the bank for a quick transfer of money - parents of college students, someone paying grandma back. And a good portion of people sometimes just flat out refuse to use ATMs. In addition, some small businesses do not use direct deposit, so their employees are issued paper checks for their pay. </p>
<p>So, yeah - banks serve many, many different people. And people still have reasons to come to the bank. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A big advance in portability was the cheque. This was essentially a withdrawal slip filled in and given to someone else so they could get the money, but rather than have to take it to your bank to get the money out, the recipient could deposit the withdrawal slip/cheque at their bank and the banks would do the paper shuffling for everyone. Of course it all took a few days, and there were opportunities for fraud, but generally it worked well enough.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth expanding on this.  An entire system was developed to try to avoid some of the problems the OP is talking about.</p>
<p>A cheque is really nothing more than an order by party A to party B that party B should pay some amount to party C.  E.g. when you get paid for working via a cheque, what you are given is really an order from your employer to your employer's bank that the employer's bank should pay you a particular sum of money.  The cheque isn't money, it's a direction to a third party bank to give you money.</p>
<p>Cheques can be what is known as negotiable instruments, meaning that the benefit of them can be assigned from one holder to the next without them actually being cashed.  If you look closely at a cheque you receive it will usually say &quot;pay <strong>to the order of</strong> <em>your name</em>&quot;.  I.e., pay this money at the direction of the named person.  On the other hand, some are marked (or 'crossed') 'not negotiable' or 'pay to X only'.</p>
<p>Negotiability of cheques and similar instruments (letters of credit, bills of exchange) was critical to the development of international commerce.  Before the days of instant electronic communication, if you (say) had goods in England and sailed to France to sell them, and then got paid via a cheque or promissory note from a particular individual, then without negotiability you would personally have to go to that person's bank, prove who you are and exchange the cheque for cash which would be verified as coming from their account at that time.  Your only other option was to accept cash or gold, both of which are inconvenient to carry around and vulnerable to being taken from you by angry men with swords/guns.  Another issue with this arrangement is that if the foreign bank refused to pay, you were stuck having to sue people in a foreign country under a foreign legal system to try to get your funds, which was nearly impossible before the 20th century.</p>
<p>However with negotiability, you can take a cheque back to England in your pocket and then 'negotiate' via your bank in London.  Your bank essentially 'buys' your interest in the cheque from you and gives you cash (in your home currency, which is also useful).  Because the instrument is negotiable, they can then deal directly with the French bank to get the benefit of the cheque for themselves without you needing to participate in that step.  The instrument becomes something like the following:</p>
<p>&quot;An order from C that B should pay to D the amount that A ordered should be paid to C.&quot;</p>
<p>E.g., &quot;An order from London Trading Co that the Bank of Paris should pay to Lloyd's Bank the amount that Paris Trading Co ordered the Bank of Paris to pay to London Trading Co.&quot;</p>
<p>Angry men with guns and swords can't take the benefit of the instrument because without certain steps being taken it is useless to them.  </p>
<p>There is a drawback to this system though - what if your bank in England gets in touch with the French bank only to find that the original drawer of the cheque is out of money and the French bank refuses to honour it?  In this case the law of most countries (which is more or less harmonised, to allow this to work) provides that your bank can come back to you <em>or</em> the original drawer of the cheque and pursue them for the funds which were advanced (or anyone else who is part of the chain of assignments of the instrument).  If they come after you, you in turn gain the right to go after the original drawer.  So in theory, upon a cheque being dishonoured you can end up with a chain of liability where each person must track down the person who assigned the cheque to them in order to get their money back.</p>
<p>Because of this issue, international commerce moved on to 'irrevocable' instruments, that is to say, instruments which carried with them an absolute guarantee that the issuing bank would pay under them <em>no matter what</em> upon presentation.  A 'bill of exchange' is an example of this, as is a 'bank cheque' as commonly described.  The issuing bank is then be limited to having rights against the original drawer of the cheque, and everyone else would have their money.  </p>
<p>All of that developed against a background where there wasn't much actual cash around, gold was inconvenient and dangerous to carry, and it took a very long time to communicate between countries.  </p>
<p>Today there is actually a market in negotiable instruments - that is to say, banks actually buy and sell these instruments to one another like a commodity.  Your bank might pay you for your negotiable instrument, and then effectively sell the right to payment it represents to other banks (there are reasons why this is profitable, such as that some instruments are only payable after a period of time, or this might permit indirect currency speculation).</p>
<p>Of course cash is the ultimate 'negotiable instrument'.  In principle it remains a promise by the reserve bank to pay to the bearer of the cash the value represented by the cash.  Because this is so universally accepted, you never actually have to get the 'value' (i.e. in gold or similar), because people no longer distinguish between 'cash' and its underlying value.</p>
<p>TL;DR - banks and merchant trading companies put in place ridiculously elaborate but quite elegant systems to avoid the types of problems that the OP is asking about in the days before electronic communication.</p></div>		</li>
