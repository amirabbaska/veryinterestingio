			<div class="markdown"><p>See a doctor if it isn't white. Pus is expected because it's the normal immune response. If it turns a different color (usually yellow/green) then is time to see a doctor. Pus doesn't mean infection. It means your body is responding normally</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't scare me now. I got a big burn blister like 2 weeks ago by cooking. It hurt like hell that same day and for about the next 3 days, it was yellowish if seen with a cellphone flashlight. Then it stopped hurting but the blister was still there. About 4 or 5 days ago it dried and it's still there, I think it'll eventually fall down... But if you see it very closely under the light it looks indeed kinda yellow... Am I gonna die?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not wrong to pop a blister, sometimes it's the best course of action.  It's all about risk management.</p>
<p>Not popping the blister is the least risky option, as the fluid helps heal the wound as well as protecting it. When a blister bursts the wound becomes exposed to bacteria.  </p>
<p>However, the blister might be in a position that is extremely likely to burst. For example, a blister on your feet will probably burst the next time you walk on it. In this case it would be best to pop the blister with a sterile implement, drain &amp; clean the wound, then apply a dressing to keep it clean.<br />
You'll be exposing the wound to bacteria (risky), but you will be controlling the environment that it bursts in, which is less risky than walking around with a sock full of bacteria waiting to get in the blister.</p>
<p>You could leave it as an unprotected open wound and possibly be fine, just like you could eat raw chicken and face no consequences. It's all about achieving an acceptable level of risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting that blisters on the feet need extra attention as far as cleaning. They're more susceptible to infection due to the warm and moist environment they're usually in from being in socks and shoes all day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>POP is the keyword here, no ripping.</p>
<p>A puncture and drain is good, you want the skin there to protect the wound.</p>
<p>If you rip the skin off you end up with a big raw wound that'll hurt like a bitch, and take forever to heal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blood blisters aren't the same as normal blisters. It's not protective fluid, it's a literal pocket of blood trapped between layers of skin because you managed to break the blood vessels without breaking the outer layer of the skin. I don't know what the medical opinion is on draining them (I'm guessing it's better to leave it if you can because otherwise, like any other cut, you bring in the possibility of infection?), but I can say from experience it's an instant way to relieve the pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do this all the time. I have ripped to many open completely in the past. I figure there is more of a danger of infection with a large open burn rather than a small puncture.</p>
<p>Also if it's on my feet from shoes someone once told me to run a bit of cotton thread through and leave it hang a bit out and cover. Seems like it would be ripe for infection but with a simple friction burn I have never had an issue. The thread lets it continue to drain so it doesn't keep filling the hole dries and re-seals itself. </p>
<p>This saved my ass on day 2 of a 10 day Disney trip when I developed a blister the size of a half dollar coin on the bottom of my foot. With the fluid I couldn't walk on it at all, way too painful. As long as it was able to drain little by little I didn't feel a thing. </p></div>		</li>
