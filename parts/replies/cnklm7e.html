			<div class="markdown"><p>Well of course the peak neutrino flux occurs well before the peak flux of electromagnetic radiation, which was one of the most important discoveries after SN1987A.  Neutrinos make up the majority of the energy released in a supernova event, and there is still a delay as the rebounding supersonic shockwave is actually opaque to neutrinos for a period of time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the collapsing core of a giant star that is producing a supernova, a proto-neutron star is formed. That is, the density of the core reaches such great magnitudes that protons and electrons combine into neutrons; neutrinos are a byproduct of this reaction. However, as stated, the region in which these neutrinos are produced is dense. It's so dense that even neutrinos can't travel far without colliding with other particles and scattering. The region is &quot;opaque&quot;, rather than &quot;transparent&quot;, to neutrinos because their flight paths are continually disrupted, and the vast majority of them are therefore trapped within the overdense region.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Chiming in with the other posters, I'd appreciate further explanation. </p>
<p>Theorists surmise that neutrinos must impart some energy to the outer shell to explain their models, but I don't think anyone yet has a good explanation for how this occurs. </p>
<p>Is that the phenomenon you're alluding to in regards to opacity?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that because luminosity is a function of size? That is, the individual atoms aren't getting any more energetic, they are just expanding into a much larger sphere and therefore appearing to us, very far away, as much brighter?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It would be a function of size and luminosity per area (or volume). But there are complicating factors such as opacity and radioactive decay.</p></div>		</li>
