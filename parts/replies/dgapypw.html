Edit: I'm referring to the original question about poisoning, I never implied that I don't wash my hands.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But yeah, you just need the arrow to be a bit dirty and deposit some bacteria in the wound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Jesus christ. Yes, we all know that you know the difference between poison and venom in animals. Poison obviously isn't just related to animals though. Chemicals like cyanide are poisonous, no matter how they are administered, not venomous. I have no idea why you have any upvotes. People are dumb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because people read the titles of TIL posts and decides that's enough to give their 2 cents on a topic, even if they thoroughly misunderstand the point. Instead of realizing that poisonous and venemous are biology terms for how a given organism administers a toxin, they just read the title and completely discarded the well justified distinction in a specific field in favor of what would be a ridiculously stupid English overcomplication (naming similar properties of chemicals different things not based on the chemical, but how it's administered? That sounds like a huge waste of time, and biologists would never set up a naming system that short sighted) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Poison and venoms aren't different you dolt, it's that poisonous things and venemous things are different. They both work the same fundamental way - a toxic substance enters your bloodstream, whether through injecting it like a bite, or through digesting it like eating a poisonous plant. Beyond that, the distinction doesn't matter. Let's say a plant has a specific chemical that kills you, and an animal uses that same exact chemical, is that chemical poisonous or venemous? Neither, because those words relate to method of administration. The chemical is toxic, which in common parlance is also called poisonous. Don't put so much weight into TIL posts.</p></div>		</li>
