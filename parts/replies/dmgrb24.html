<p>Edit: Well since I'm getting downvoted for questioning the &quot;folk wisdom&quot; I've done my own research. My current conclusion is that there is no evidence supporting the idea that we get significantly dehydrated during sleep, in fact, our body has systems which function specifically to prevent dehydration during sleep. </p>

<p>They find that the SCN modulates a circuit involved in maintaining osmotic balance in a way that prevents dehydration during sleep</p>

<p>And this review goes into detail on all the (vaguely) scientifically-supported ways of reducing that morning grogginess and guess what? No mention of dehydration or drinking water, at all:</p>

<p>Oh make no mistake, there are multiple factors involved. However, the OP I responded to was talking about sleeping in excess of 10 hours. Mild dehydration is still dehydration, and can instill a feeling if weakness and tiredness. </p></div>		</li>
