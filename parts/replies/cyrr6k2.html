			<div class="markdown"><p>Try binary counting. By using each finger as a binary bit (0 when down, 1 when up), you can count to 1023 (2^(10)-1) using both hands. One hand will get you to 31. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. And to expand on how a circle was conceptualized in terms of sixty, a circle can be divided into six equilateral triangles. Each triangle has 180 degrees, with the center of the circle at the center of the points of six triangles.</p>
<p>The angles of the six triangles that are at the center are six times sixty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope 180. Think of the special triangles. 90 + 60 + 30, 90 + 45 + 45, 90 + 90 + 0. All come out at 180. </p></div>		</li>
