			<div class="markdown"><p>Ashley P here! Thanks for bringing up pterosaurs - they are a perfect example of how truly weird the world is.</p>
<p>You've asked a couple questions that I'll try to hit in order. </p>
<ol>
<li>You're dead on that pterosaurs aren't dinosaurs, so you're ahead of the game there. When we put together the family trees, they fall out as some of the closest relatives of dinosaurs. Since birds are dinosaurs, that means they are close cousins, but the split was a really long time ago, at least the Triassic. </li>
<li>Because they're close cousins, they use some of the same &quot;evolutionary tools&quot; when they become flyers. For example, both pterosaurs and birds evolved from a bipedal ancestor which frees up their arms to evolve the flight stroke. Higher metabolism and thin-walled bones might be other examples.</li>
<li>*However* Pterosaur flight origins are a mystery!! When they show up they are already complicated, active, flapping flyers. We actually know the most about how birds evolved flight - and that's still a very active area of exploration. This question becomes really cool when you add in bats: we know almost nothing about how they evolved flight.</li>
<li>Biggest flying dinosaurs are birds (obs.) and some of them did get huge. Not Quetzalcoatlus big, but two things to look up are Argentavis and &quot;Bony-toothed birds&quot; (pelagornithids). Both crazy large. Haast eagles are cool too - they took down giant flightless Moas in NZ which was a sort of island kingdom of the birds until people arrived.</li>

<p>Wow I always assumed those were some cryptozoology nonsense (especially <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2d/Argentavis-Magnificens.jpg" target="_blank">that picture</a> you see all over the internet). I didn't know that bats were that mysterious. Thanks for the answers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I can't personally comment about how accurate that reconstruction was, but the general size seems about right from the skeleton. Seriously huge.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello! I'm chiming in here to add in that the construction of the wing is different in birds and pterosaurs. Birds fuse bones in their hands and wrists and use their whole feather-covered arm as a wing foil. Pterosaurs lengthen their ring fingers and support a fleshy membrane from the tip of their finger to at least their hips. Some had additional membranes from ankle to ankle, and from arm to neck. We have an excellent fossil record for how birds acquired their morphological traits, but as Ash said, we don't have a good record for how pterosaurs evolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seconded that. Flight is so beautiful, it's amazing to see there are many 'versions' of it</p></div>		</li>
