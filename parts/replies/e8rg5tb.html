			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh my good god I get weather related migraines as well and sometimes they will last days until the pressure is released in a big storm or if the weather goes from cloudy to sunny very abruptly. I hate it. Nothing helps. I can’t change weather!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Spring and fall mostly I'll get multiple per week. Always when a weather change or pressure change comes through. Not really sure. </p>
<p>Besides the usual ibuprofen/tylenol which doesn't always work. I tend to find cold water over the back of my head provides some temporary relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a life long miagrane sufferer, sometimes when I eat something spicy.  It might not go away completely, but it takes the throbbing pain away from my head; even if for a few minutes. Now, this doesn't work when I'm having a migraine associated with chronic vomiting. Then I just have to lay down and wait till I pass out from exhaustion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here.  I'm very sensitive to bad weather coming.  It seems to be my only trigger.  It can be a beautiful sunny day and I will start &quot;edging&quot;.  I tell my wife the weather is going to change and it always does.  I've had visual and aura.  If I'm awake when it starts I can try to minimize the pain with drugs.  If I wake up with it I'm toast.  Full light and sound sensitivity.  And pain.  It feels like I have a tight toque on.  All I can do is take some medication, bury my head under a pillow, and try to sleep through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get weather-related migraines too. My go-to concoction is Alleve, Benadryl, and a cup of coffee, then sleep. About 80% of the time, the migraine is gone or at least a lot better. I also horde percocet for the really bad ones. Also, an orgasm often helps if I can make myself get in the mood for it! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although of course you can’t control weather I wonder if there are some places that might be better for you to live, where there are fewer changes or less dramatic ones? </p>
<p>Some of our cousins moved a hundred miles to the coast because their kid was suffering respiratory issues and they were in a valley with bad air quality. This might be what puts the idea in my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse in busy ER. Anytime there is a cold front/storm moving in, we have a dramatic increase in patients coming in for neurologic complaints (migraines, stroke, increased confusion in patients with known brain tumors/hydrocephalus, etc). One of the neurosurgeons confirmed that he always sees more patients on days when the barometric pressure changes significantly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll list what I've tried and rate them on a personal scale of 0-5 (5 being most helpful).
I've tried chiropractic - 0...it just made it worse
Avoiding my trigger foods - 3...the problem is that it seems to wax and wane.
Imitrex/Sumatriptan injectible dose- 4.5 ...This IM med seems to work almost 70% of the time.  I think the key to it is that it , by injecting directly into muscle, it doesn't take as long as an oral  dose.  It does, however, trigger a brief flight or fight response in me.</p>
<p>Oral Imitrex- 3...it worked for a while...not as well as injected form.</p>
<p>Doing special neck stretches - 3...it gives relief...but not enough</p>
<p>A mixture of butalbol, benedryl, and compazine.  - 4...depends on how early i can get access to it.</p>
<p>Massage- 1- this was a big fat nope</p>
<p>Hot shower with ice pack on neck- 3.5</p>
<p>SSRI's- 1 - it reduced frequency of attackes, but it required a daily pill, and made the pain I felt much worse.</p></div>		</li>
