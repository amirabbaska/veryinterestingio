<p>Edit: ps. painkillers never helped, vomiting did. It would always take me 48-72 hours to recover fully, by which point I might have another migraine again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No because the doctor said I would have to eat gluten for 30-60 days again to look at the villi to confirm (potentially biopsi a portion too). By that point I had been gluten-free for 1 year, I had done the &quot;maybe I'm not actually celiac, let's eat some pizza...&quot; thing and felt horrible immediately afterwards -- many, many times. So by that point, I had enough experience to say &quot;no thanks&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you brought this up because I take Reglan (traditionally a medicine for digestion? I think) for migraines and I call it the miracle drug. It stops a migraine in its tracks. I found out about it after a trip to the ER with an awful migraine. Some genius doctor recommended it. If I ever mention it to my family doctor for refills they look a bit confused and respond with something like, &quot;Well, if it works, it works...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reglan, compazine are regularly used to kill headaches/migraines. Rarely, weâ€™ll use a low dose of haldol (this has become my go to request for patients when nothing else is working for pain). Neurology has been known to lead us down caffeine drips and high flow oxygen treatments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've considered going to the ER for some migraines in the past (bad enough I almost called 911, like rocking back and forth and ripping my hair out to distract from the pain), but didn't because a lot migraineurs are treated like drug seekers while they sit there suffering from all the bright lights, smells and sounds of an ER. It's also obviously not a life-threatening thing and so you'll get triaged, as you should, and might wind up waiting for quite a while (not complaining, I'd still take a migraine over the guy that comes in with an aneurysm or an amputated leg). </p>
<p>I went to an Urgent Care for one that lasted two weeks. They gave me a shot of Toradol and waited to see if it worked. When I said it had no effect, they basically told me they wouldn't give me any narcotics and to go home. I didn't want narcotics, I just wanted it to stop... I'm pretty sure if I ever tell a doctor that Toradol didn't work for treatment in the past, they're going to automatically assume I want some kind of opioid since that's such a common thing for drug seekers to say. Unfortunately opioids rarely work for migraines, they tend to make them worse. </p>
<p>I'm glad you managed to go to one and not get scoffed at. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reglan is a potent anti-vomiting drug for use in chemo patients, but another common indication is severe migraines mainly due to the kinetic effect on your GI system, glad you have found something that helps!</p></div>		</li>
