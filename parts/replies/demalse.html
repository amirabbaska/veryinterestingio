			<div class="markdown"><p>Singing strengthens you vocal chords.  Look at an old man who has been body building his whole life.  I imagine it's like that.  That being said, trained singers voices apparently do develop with time.  </p>
<p>From personal experience, with constant practice I gain more control over my voice and the way I can make it sound.  If I don't practice I lose notes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally at least, I would answer &quot;yes, but in a non-intuitive way&quot;.</p>
<p>Basically it's well known to singers that voices &quot;mature&quot; over time, that is it's generally accepted that no matter how good a 16 year old sings, he/she will <strong>always</strong> sound better in their 20s.</p>
<p>I would take that a step further and say that extensive vocal training &quot;prematurely ages your voice&quot;... that someone that's ~22 with extensive training may have already peaked where with less training they wouldn't have peaked until their 30s.</p>
<p>In my experience though, that term &quot;peak&quot; is kind of a misnomer, it's very much a plateau and at least from what I've seen the more training (without overuse) you've had the more you can extend it.</p>
<p>As a specific example, at the age of 20 my grandfather sounded exactly like his father at the age of 50 (to the point that in old recordings we can't tell which is which). He's now 80 and still sounds exactly the same... just as his father did. It's not that he's an 80 year old that sounds like a 20 year old... it's that at both ages he sounded like a ~40 year old.</p>
<p>To clarify I'm not suggesting that &quot;because an 80 year old can sound like a 20 year old this is a truism&quot;. More that in my experience if you listen to a bunch of people who have had a bunch of vocal training all sing the exact same song &quot;straight&quot; one by one while blindfolded I defy <strong><em>anyone</em></strong> to make accurate guesses as to the age of the singers.</p>
<p>Same test but without vocal training and I bet you can do pretty well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this is really interesting. I have always been a fan of music and have always loved to sing, yet I knew my limits as far as singing went. I would call myself &quot;average.&quot; Matching pitches was always easy, but my vocal range wasn't very wide for the first couple decades of my life.</p>
<p>Yet, since being in my mid-20's, I've noticed a difference. I did start actively using tips to sing better via controlling my breath. But the difference felt startling, as my vocal range expanded a few notes above and below what I used to be able to do, very quickly. I also became able to hold notes for longer and use vibrato when I couldn't before. I thought it was a interesting that it happened just as I started getting more serious about singing, so I couldn't tell if the techniques worked very quickly or if something else changed. Now that you mention a performance &quot;peak&quot; at about this age, maybe this is part of that physiological development?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is debatable. Some singers are trained with incredible vocal technique, which can translate to your speaking voice. Singing and speaking with proper vocal technique ensures healthy mechanisms of production of the voice and healthy breath support which increases longevity of the voice significantly. However, an opera, musical theatre, rock, or metal singer may have a harder time maintaining voice quality toward the end of their lives solely due to overuse, as those are some of the technically most rigorous genres.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a nursing home. Had an 85+ year old male patient with extremely advanced dementia. His voice when talking was kinda rough, but he spent most of his time just staring into nothingness and singing in falsetto, with vibrato and all. Start singing a song, and he'd finish the whole thing. He had been a choir singer for a long time.</p>
<p>When singing, you use your voice in a very specific and different way, so it usually stays clean for longer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thanks for this. I get that most people don't like metal vocals, but they're not easy to perform. </p></div>		</li>
