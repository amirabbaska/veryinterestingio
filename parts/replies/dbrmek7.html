			<div class="markdown"><p>You misunderstand. </p>
<p>Creating that diagram is an integral part of their design process. It is how they plan out where the different main folds go to form the general shape of the piece. </p>
<p>That one is from my brother's work, he designs mainly insects and flowers, with the occasional deep sea creature thrown in. </p>
<p>Edit:  I should clarify that I do not know how widely this technique is used, just that it is how my brother works. <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/derekmcgann/31148858626/in/dateposted-public/" target="_blank">here</a> is the piece that pattern created. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your brother's work. And yes, I can corroborate that this is generally how designers work nowadays, i.e., NOT by trial and error. I'm sure what your brother did was roughly: 1) decide on a subject, 2) create a stick-figure representation of the subject to determine the length and placement of the various flaps, and 3) compute this circle-river graph to determine where the creases would need to go in order to create the largest possible base with that form that could be folded from a square. From here, he would precrease the paper with this pattern, collapse the paper into the base (easier said than done), then thin out the flaps and shape the model into its final form. </p>
<p>Not all designers use this particular design principle, which is called circle-packing, but all good designers know what they're doing before they take up the paper, and they do not create primarily by trial and error.</p></div>		</li>
