			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I'm a little underwhelmed by that response.</p>
<p>If you magically don't know the speed of light, it's basically cheating to then assume that you know something the frequency of a specific light source.</p>
<p>A more satisfactory exercise would entail directly measuring <em>c</em> without having any given information about light other than that it has a finite speed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You always need to know <em>something</em> about the instruments you use. In this case, it's the microwave.</p>
<p>To be able to experimentally determine c all by yourself, you'd need a relation that relates c to other variables or constants. The actual experimentation is performed on those variables related to c and not on c itself. You'd need to derive some of classical physics to come up with a relation for c and even then, if you don't have any given values for variables or constants, you'd need to determine all of those first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fine, but in the microwave measurement, there are 3 unknowns: speed of light, wavelength, and frequency. We're only measuring wavelength, and we assume the frequency, which for all we know was measured with the assumption of a particular value for <em>c</em>. To do this correctly, we should measure the frequency in an independent measurement that does not assume any other values in the relation.</p>
<p>The disk measurement by /u/Andre-B is much more straightforward and does not assume the values of parameters based on an established value of <em>c</em>. Here, the relation only includes the geometry of the disk and the light source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first demonstration of the finite speed of light involved precise astronomical observation of the bodies in our solar system (particularly Jupiter's moons), after people like Galileo failed and only happened in the 17th century.  It is likely you can have: </p>
<p>1) a &quot;satisfying&quot; determination.</p>
<p>2) something that can be done at home with commonly available items.</p>
<p>pick ONE.  Or better yet, if you find it so &quot;underwhelming&quot; you could also be constructive and provide a better solution if you believe there is one.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Based on a lot of responses, and perhaps /u/Dew_Drops_On_Webs 's comment itself, I get the impression that people maybe simply don't know that it says the frequency your microwave operates at on a sticker on the back:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.possibilitiesendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/microwave-power.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.possibilitiesendless.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/microwave-power.jpg</a></p>
<p>It does.  The manufacturer provides the frequency measurement, you provide the wavelength measurement.  This is no different than saying speed is &quot;distance&quot;/&quot;time&quot; and measuring a distance with a ruler that a manufacturer rated to &quot;one meter&quot; and using a store bought stop watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>great experiment! but I have a question, in the picture it assumes the chocolate bar gets exactly in the middle of the wavelenght, does a microwave only makes 1 single &quot;wave&quot;? and why I can't happen to get the melted spot on the top part of the wavelenght instead of the middle?</p>
<p>thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The diagram is wrong. The places where the chocolate will melt are the points of constructive interference inside the microwave. It just so happens that constructive interference occurs at every half wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, it comes to c=1/(mu_0*epsilon_0)^0.5, where mu_0 is a constant related to the strength of a magnetic field and epsilon_0 related to the strength of an electric field, and we can readily measure both of those constants in a lab. But people were a little surprised at the time to discover that light and electromagnetic waves had the same speed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_wave_equation" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> has the derivation.</p></div>		</li>
