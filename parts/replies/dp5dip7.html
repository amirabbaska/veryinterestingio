			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer. CBT is not for everyone. It's the first therapy I offer clients because it helped me so much but if they don't like it or find it helpful let's try something else. Although I may sneak in some aspect of CBT if it makes sense to do that. Getting some people to see that they are not their thoughts/feelings and that thoughts and feelings are no more substantial than a mist passing through can be a struggle but the concept works for me personally. </p></div>		</li>
