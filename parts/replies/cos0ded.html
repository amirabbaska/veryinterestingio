			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great technical explanation.  Can I try to summarize to see if I understand?  </p>
<p>Strong is quarks pushing and pulling through gluons.  Weak is the same idea, but the push is through bigger intermediate particles so the quarks change type in the exchange.  The leads to the particles the quarks make up changing type as well.  </p>
<p>Does that makes sense? I've always been trying to find a way yo explain it to my high school students.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh.  OK, neat.  And those intermediate particles carry the property of &quot;being up&quot; away from an up-quark (turning it into a down).  Could the W or Z give &quot;being up&quot; to a down-quark (for example) like a photon carries the momentum from one electron and gives it to another?  </p></div>		</li>
