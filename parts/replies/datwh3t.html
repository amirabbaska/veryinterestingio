<p>I was imagining that there would just be one net uniform signal (wobble), but I guess the math doesn't work out that way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically, the period of a planet orbiting a star  is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period#Two_bodies_orbiting_each_other" target="_blank">uniquely determined</a> by the radius of the orbit and the sum of the masses of the star and the orbiting planet^1. The mass of the star is generally much greater than that of the orbiting body^2, so the mass of the orbiting planet is pretty negligible.</p>
<p>Anyway, what that means is that all the planets are going to have different orbital periods since they are at different orbital radii.</p>
<p>1) Ignoring things like perturbations due to inclusion of other stars in the orbit, since those will only result in comparably small effects.</p>
<p>2) but not always, e.g. smaller stars and close in orbiting planets similar in mass to Jupiter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be the case if all of the exoplanets had the same period. However, orbital periods follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler's_laws_of_planetary_motion" target="_blank">Kepler's Third Law</a>, AKA a planet further away from its star takes longer to orbit. Because planets generally don't share orbits, its extremely unlikely that 2 planets will have the same orbital period. </p>
<p>When it comes to the math, any sinusoidal functions with identical periods can be added together to get a new sinusoidal function with that same period. For example, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sin\(2x\)" target="_blank">sin(2x)</a>+<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sin\(2x%2Bpi%2F2\)" target="_blank">sin(2x+pi/2)</a>=<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=sin\(2x\)%2Bsin\(2x%2Bpi%2F2\)" target="_blank">a new sinusoid</a> with a period of 2. As shown above, sinusoidal functions with different periods won't line up as nicely. A fourier transform, in general terms, takes a collection of sine functions and returns their frequencies (and by extension, periods). </p>
<p>Also, the radial velocity (wobble) method is actually being used less and less nowadays in lieu of the <a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/space-topics/exoplanets/transit-photometry.html" target="_blank">transit method</a>, an extremely accurate way of finding new exoplanets. These methods both have their own (large) drawbacks, and they both share the problem that depending on what tilt a star's planet's orbit is at to us, it can be difficult or even impossible to detect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is transit really more common, since only a tiny fraction of exoplanets are orbitally aligned in a way that makes transit detectable at all?</p>
<p>Or has all the wobble been mapped out in the observable part of the galaxy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really fair to say that radial velocity is being used less and less now? While we detected a lot of planet candidates using the Kepler satellite, most (all?) of the confirmed ones have RV followup. Transit by itself can't give us the mass after all, we either need RV data or to detect variations the timings of transits (TTVs) to get planetary masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, it's the biggest peak.  In this case, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/54_Piscium" target="_blank">54 Piscium b</a> has an orbital period of about 64 days, which is the biggest peak there. (It might look like it's more than 64 days, but log scales can be misleading to us.)  Only one known planet here.</p>
<p>The first peak at 1 day is probably caused by the rotation of the Earth.  The peak at about 32 days is probably an &quot;alias&quot; of the 64 day planet.  Strong signals can also show up as a multiple of the frequency (twice, triple, half, etc.).  </p>
<p>Sometimes, the star's rotation period will show up too.  For this star, it's about 40 days, but I don't see a signal there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple weeks ago I was at the McDonald Observatory for the 107' viewing night, and one of the astronomers doing research at the time happened to be working on identifying tight orbit exoplanets. IIRC, his slide show included a graph a lot like <a href="https://thecosmos4.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/orbitalperiod.jpg?w=510&amp;h=364" target="_blank">this one.</a> As you can see, we've found quite a number of exoplanets, and the vast majority of them have extremely short orbital periods. This is mostly because these are the easiest to identify, as to be sure you've got an exoplanet you typically need to see it make 3+ orbits. This means that you'll be observing for at least three times the length of its orbital period.</p>
<p>Imagine an ET astronomer looking at our solar system through a telescope comparable to what we have on Earth. Mercury's orbital period is approximately 88 days, so to be reasonably sure you've identified it, you'd need observe for at least 260 Earth days. To identify Earth, that period would be just shy of 1100 days. Neptune, so-called furthest planet from the Sun, has an orbital period of 164 Earth <em>years</em>, necessitating observation for almost <em>500 years</em> to see it make three orbits.</p>
<p>But let's not stop there! Just to perturb Michael Brown, let's pretend for a minute that my very excellent mother is still serving pizza with her noodles, and that we want to find out if that distant star is orbited by a <em>ninth</em> planet. This theoretical planet, which we'll call &quot;Pluto&quot; because hey, I like Disney cartoons, might have an orbital period of, say, 248 years, so I hope you have 750 years' worth of hot pockets and coke zero in your observatory's control room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/GetInTheFight i agree 100% with u/mfb- but if scientists looked at a star's wobble and it was too weird to be one planet they would watch the star and wait for patterns of the amount of light from said star to dip as a planet passes in front of it blocking a part of the light. the amount of light blocked determines the size and things like how long the light is blocked determines how far away from the star it is and then other
methods are used to figure out atmosphere composition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Transits are very unlikely. You can be lucky, but in general you won't see any transits.</p>
<p>Transit time itself can only give some limits as you don't know where it passes the disk (in the middle or not?). But it gives a nice additional information about orbital period and phase.</p></div>		</li>
