The logistics of making a Walmart with a sloped roof is insane too, would be goofy, for one, but it also directs tons of water towards the lower sloped side and gutters, etc. Low sloped roofs manage water better and leaks are generally easy to repair. Shingles get rather difficult. Also you would never make a metal-framed building with shingles </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've done inspections of flat roofs on large structures (garages, maintenance buildings, etc.) that are owned an operated by public or quasi public agencies. I also have experience designing buildings. I'd like to add to your points because they're an excellent start.</p>

<p>Flat roofs are cheaper to construct than sloped roofs. Not only are flat roofs easier to construct, it take less material. Imagine a square: take the top horizontal line, pinch it at the middle, and pull upwards so that it become house shaped. That roof line is longer than the flat roof. That means more material is needed.</p>

<p>Mechanical equipment, the equipment that provides Heating, Ventilating, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), is often placed on top of roofs because otherwise the unit would take up space at ground level (the building site might be cramped and this often exposes the unit to vandalism) or the unit would have to be located inside (and some units require access to outside air and now additional ductwork is needed). The units that are mounted on the roof are often called Roof Top Units or RTUs.</p>
<p>Now many of the buildings I've been to were constructed before the advent of widespread air conditioning and so mechanical units were placed on top of the buildings because there was simply no where else to put them. This can be difficult to accommodate because a structure that predates the use of such RTUs was obviously not designed to support them. Older structures are often reinforced to support RTUs.</p>
<p>The general trend, at least in my region, has become to place mechanical, and electrical equipment, at ground level. They are placed on concrete pads, sometimes elevated a few feet to raise them out of a flood plain and secured behind a chain link fence. These are often described as pad-mounted units. I'll explain why this is done at the end because it ties into your last point.</p>

<p>Even &quot;flat roofs&quot; are sloped. Every roof must be designed to shed rain water. What the average person would describe as a &quot;flat roof&quot; is usually a &quot;low slope roof&quot;. A low slope roof is commonly sloped so that over 12 inches of horizontal distance, the vertical drop is 1/4 of an inch. The roof is sloped to gutters in the edge of the roof or to drains (which would be anywhere on the roof, including just shy of the edge). If drains are used, you'll often see shoppers nearby. Scuppers are openings through the parapet wall (the low wall at the edges of roofs that is formed by extending the face of the building above the roof elevation) that are used to prevent water from collecting around the drain in the event that it fails because...</p>

<p>Nope. Most agencies are either too lethargic (public) or lack the personnel necessary (private) to perform adequate maintenance. Perhaps I'm biased because, by the time I'm called in, maintenance has been neglected for some time and so I never see the well-maintained buildings.</p>
<p>Regardless, when I've been involved in designing new buildings or facilities, the future owners often put enormous emphasis on ease of maintenance (making sure we consider the resiliency of the building without routine maintenance and providing access to components that would require routine maintenance).</p>
<p>And coming back to my comment about pad-mounted units: this is preferred because the easier the units are to access, the more likely the units will be maintained. If the units are up on the roof, they might be neglected (out of sight, out of mind).</p></div>		</li>
