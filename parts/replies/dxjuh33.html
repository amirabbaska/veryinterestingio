<p>It’s also important not to confuse demonyms with adjectives. You can listen to an Argentinian song, but it is sung by an Argentine.  </p>
<p>Now, what about the Dutch? There are three terms we need to define: Holland, the Netherlands, and Dutch. In Old English dutch simply meant “people or nation.” (This also explains why Germany is called Deutschland in German.) Over time, English-speaking people used the word Dutch to describe people from both the Netherlands and Germany. (At that point in time, in the early 1500s, the Netherlands and parts of Germany, along with Belgium and Luxembourg, were all part of the Holy Roman Empire.) Specifically the phrase “High Dutch” referred to people from the mountainous area of what is now southern Germany. “Low Dutch” referred to people from the flatlands in what is now the Netherlands. Within the Holy Roman Empire, the word “Netherlands” was used to describe people from the low-lying (nether) region (land). The term was so widely used that when they became a formal, separate country in 1815, they became the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The word “Holland” literally meant “wood-land” in Old English and originally referred to people from the northern region of the Netherlands. Over time, it came to apply to the entire country.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But to confuse it further, almost half the country is Holland, with people being Hollanders, as well as the whole country being Dutch people, speaking Dutch, unless they're saying it in Dutch, then it's Nederlands speaking Nederlanders. While the Germans in Germany speaking German, in German is Deutsche speaking Deutsch in Deutschland.</p>
<p>But yeah, I think you're right, but the Dutch and Germans seem to have had their names mixed up somewhere in the past, at least in the English speaking world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd probably call them <em>Hollanders</em>, though I can't really articulate why. It just <em>feels</em> like it's what the demonym should be (if it weren't Dutch).</p>
<p>I'm more confused why people from Canada aren't the obvious Canadans, but are rather Canadian. I assume it's a French thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're right about the &quot;Hollander&quot; thing. That's the demonym Dutch people use for people from North- and South- Holland (2 provinces in the Netherlands). </p>
<p>And IMO, &quot;Netherlandic&quot; would have sounded better than &quot;Dutch&quot; but that's just me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of other Europeans call the Dutch (the local equivalents of) &quot;Hollanders&quot;, but it's pretty wrong since Holland is just an area in the Netherlands. It's like when many Europeans call all Americans &quot;Yankees&quot;, even though it only refers to people from the Northern states.</p></div>		</li>
