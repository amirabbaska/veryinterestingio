			<div class="markdown"><p>As a heads-up, the source on this seems questionable. I'm assuming you read it in  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=MZy9wWi0xX8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=creatures+of+accident&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinzcWs9dPQAhVCiVQKHTZ9DiQQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=creatures%20of%20accident&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Creatures of Accident: The Rise of the Animal Kingdom, by Wallace Arthur</a>. It's on page 128 of that book. The book reads,</p>
<p><em>I once heard an anecode about a primitive human tribe, living in a remote corner of the world, which had an unusually high frequency of albinos. I have no idea whether it is true, but no matter, because it is instructive both about the role of inheritance in the evolutionary process and about the meaning of &quot;fitness.&quot; An anthropologist came to study this tribe and very quickly realized why albinos were so much commoner than in other human populations. Male albinos were considered by the tribal elders to be unfit and so were denied the right to go out on hunting trips with the rest of the adult males. Left alone with the women, these albino males spent their time having sex, thus producing many albino children. In an evolutionary sense, they were very fit indeed!</em></p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be any reference to ancestor ghosts, though I suppose it's possible that part of the story appears later in the book. The index refers to albinism on page 131 of the book, but page 131 is removed in the Google Books preview.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then, we'll laugh in their face much like this tribe has done to the anthropologists.</p></div>		</li>
