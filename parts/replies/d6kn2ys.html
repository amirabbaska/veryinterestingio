			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a graphic I've seen in one for or another.  Not a biology person at all, but this one is famous and adds to OP's description.  Humans are apes.  Humans act very similarly to Chimps and Bonobos.  It's pretty conspicuous IMO.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a little more on the great diagram you linked. It's called a cladogram and is used to illustrate divergent evolution where each joint where two branches meet indicate the introduction of a feature that resulted in different species. </p>
<p>Edit: the diagram the OP link doesn't have specific traits, but the joints still represent a moment that separated ones species into two (or more) different ones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonobos also do French kissing, oral sex, and the missionary position unlike any other creature. They're also the hippies of the ape family, preferring free love and no war, whereas chimps send out patrols and will kill other chimps invading their territory. Incidentally, they are also a female dominated society, whereas chimps are male dominated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We wouldn't have to eat as many fruits and vegetables. The likely reason that we don't produce our own is because with a diet heavy in fruits and vegetables you don't need to produce your own. </p></div>		</li>
