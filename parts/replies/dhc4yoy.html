Parties are going to design themselves to appeal to blocks of voters as collectives. Voters are going to vote selfishly and they routinely associate to formal and informal groups.</p>
<p>Additionally, since the average voter doesn't have any communication/influence with politicians, the way to empower the average voter would be to encourage the formation of more lobbying groups so that groups of non-wealthy people could pool resources to actually plead their case.</p>
<p>I'd argue the problem isn't that the wealthy have lobbyists to communicate their interests well, it's that the average citizen does not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Campaign contributions are vastly different from bribes: a campaign contribution can only be used for campaign purposes and do not go directly to the candidate. We have oversight organizations to ensure that campaign funds are used for campaign purposes only, and there are many restrictions on what counts as &quot;campaign purposes&quot;. </p>
<p>And campaign contributions don't only exist to compel politicians to act differently; they exist so groups of people can boost the chances of a candidate who has a message they benefit from. Example: AARP is an organization that, among other things, advocates for retired people. Donation to the campaigns of politicians who want to increase retirement benefits is a way that the organization gives a voice to its millions of members who pay dues.</p>
<p>And how would a government regulate whether politicians are fulfilling campaign promises? The process of removing officials because they don't fulfill their campaign goals sounds like it could be very politically motivated and arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the reason they exist, but not their function. Yes, sometimes people can have opinions others find valuable without having to be paid off. However, I think in many cases the money creates the incentive when they are in office and can take action, and that the action can be influenced by said money.</p>

<p>Yes, the process would have to be fully fleshed out, but I still think such a process would be beneficial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The election system already has a tax based campaign contribution system. It's opt in for most people. There is a check box that people can fill out when submitting their tax forms that will give a small amount of money to political campaigns. Basically no candidates accept this money though, mostly because once a politician accepts the tax funded campaign money, they are restricted from getting any other contributions. I believe everyone that has accepted the tax funded contributions so far have lost (Mitt Romney is one of them I think). You simply get more money by not using the tax contributions than using it.</p>
<p>Also don't quote me on anything. This is all from memory from college level political science.</p></div>		</li>
