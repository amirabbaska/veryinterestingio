			<div class="markdown"><p>Not very useful info for a smaller displacement engine though, I agree when driving an old Kenworth(or any other manufacturer of &quot;semi&quot; style tractors) or using a piece of old heavy equipment you're spot on, but in a 7 liter range diesel that you'd find in a larger pickup the engine dying is going to be a lot more abrupt, once you're out of the power and rpms are going down it's time to downshift or do something different, that may be partially attributable to being turbocharged but it's mostly due to a huge difference in the amount of torque generated per cylinder combustion, the bigger 16ish liter diesels have so much more mass they retain a lot more rotational energy than a smaller engine as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually referring to farm tractors, not semi tractors! </p>
<p>Though the old Kenworths do lug pretty good, I've never lugged a semi to death as I'd downshift long before that. But on farm tractors with the dual stick crashbox and no pedal, sometimes downshifting is not an available option and you're forced to try to lug it over the hill. It's easy to run out of gears when you picked the wrong range, and sometimes even hard to sync within the range due to lack of pedal!</p>
<p>That's why I specified an old air breather. Even my old 35HP International will lug like this, and I've never actually stalled it as the wheels always slip first. It's rated for little HP but it has huge pistons, and it's really a torque monster.</p>
<p>Indeed, anything new and turbocharged will breathe its last gasp as soon as the turbo spools down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do those tractor engines have glow plugs? I'd figure if you hit the glow plugs when it starts bogging down like that, you lower the point where the heat of compression no longer ignites the diesel. Might help you clear the hill... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gag about the original humm-vees was that being diesels they'd only do 65 mph, but they'd do it up a brick wall.</p></div>		</li>
