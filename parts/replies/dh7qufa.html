			<div class="markdown"><p>The absorption of light by water increases in the longer IR and short UV so there is only a narrow valley around the visible spectrum where you get the rainbow. Also the scattering depends on the relation between the light wavelength and the droplet size.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now our eyes our only sensitive to the visible (by definition), which is why a rainbow looks like a colorful transition from violet to red. </p>

<p>I'm convinced that I can see the UV part of a rainbow.<br />
I've always noticed it. I used to ask about it as a kid and I'd just get confused looks so I stopped saying it, but eventually I learned about the EM spectrum I was like &quot;oh <em>that's</em> what that is, okay.&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;See&quot; is maybe not quite the right word, it's not plainly visible. It's like anâ€¦ interference or something. A sort of eye-confusing &quot;shadow&quot; just below the indigo/violet part. Confusing because it's shadowy yet somehow &quot;bright&quot; at the same time; there's an intensity to it. <em>Really</em> hard to describe. </p>
<p>But there's clearly something there, separating the rainbow from the sky/background. The stronger the rainbow, the more noticable it is. I've looked for the IR part above the colors, but I don't seem to be able to detect anything there. Just the UV below.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our ability to see doesn't just cut off at the edges of the visible spectrum. The rods become increasingly ineffecient at those wavelengths so It fades out. So it's perfectly possible for you to have some mutation that makes you slightly more sensitive to light. Calling it any kind of color would fail of course because your brain is not equipped to work there.</p>
<p>Usually it takes a very high brightness scource to be visible to us, like a very hot bit of metal or a uv lamp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gas stations with the overhead lights off, but with IR security cameras are a good example of this. If you use your peripheral vision (and sometimes your direct vision if you allow for adjustment to ambient light levels), you can see a faintly reddish glow from the ring of LEDs around the camera lens.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ohh that feels close. &quot;Weird glow&quot; evokes it for sure. In my head I always think it must be like what seeing a cloaked spaceship would be like. It's as if you're half seeing something that's there-but-not-there. </p>
<p>Man, this whole thread is so gratifying. <em>Not</em> crazy! (Maybe!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly right. Some of the impressive space images you've seen have been observed in none visible frequencies given 'false colour' translations to the visible spectrum. You sometimes see black and white &quot;infra red&quot; images, where the white just represents lots of infra red, and the black no infra red. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the colours we see are mixtures of signal detected by three different detectors in our eyes. To make an analogy to sound, our experience of the frequencies of light is akin to experiencing music without speakers and only through a spectrum meter like <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/EJv9i.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. Further it's as if we only took the three bars in the middle somewhere and seeing/feeling/sensing them move up and down was our entire experience of a song.</p></div>		</li>
