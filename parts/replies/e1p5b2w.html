<p>More precisely, it's meant to scrape away plaque, the biofilm of bacteria. Removing food particles can usually be covered by a rinse. Insofar as dental health is concerned, it is more beneficial to brush <em>before</em> eating, as once the food is in your mouth, the available bacteria will rapidly produce acid. You want to thin out the herd so that less damage is done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you even get sick from your own feces? I guess the only problem could be if you have guests which are currently suffering from infectious diarrhea.</p>
<p>Edit: Why the downvotes? If the tenuous transmission path from sick people’s feces to your own mouth is enough to get you sick, surely the much more intense contact to your own feces would be enough to make you sick all the time. Since that’s not the case it stands to reason that you can’t get sick(er) from your own feces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a minimum amount of inoculum to make one sick per strain of bacteria. You will get sick from your own feces, but the amount on your toothbrush is small enough for your stomach to kill. More virulent bacteria, like E. coli O157, can be in a small amount and still get you sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a weird conclusion and flawed logic. Of course you can get sick from your own feces. The bacteria in the your intestines (mostly e. coli) are fine if they are contained there but if they are spread and multiply elsewhere in your body will get sick. Go ahead test this out, rub your eyes right after wiping your ass and see how long it takes you to get pink eye. A person doesn't have to be sick for you to get sick from the bacteria in their feces. If they are sick and have an infection in their digestive tract it may also be viral </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some small part of what this poster said that's trueish, as a healthy person should theoretically be able to eat their own feces without getting sick, and I think this poster was probably thinking more along the lines of ingestion given the toothbrush topic and the widespread worry about aeresolized poop from toilets getting on toothbrushes. So my guess is this is what OP is thinking of-ingestion of fecal particles causing illness.</p>
<p>But like you said, that isn't the only concern. Pink eye, getting particles into cuts and scratches, etc. </p></div>		</li>
