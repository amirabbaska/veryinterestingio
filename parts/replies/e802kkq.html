			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a whole documentary on this on YouTube like 5-6 years ago. It was amazing. Basically without the wolves the deer ran unchecked and their population exploded and ultimately they over grazed the valley floor decimating it and iirc changed the flow of a river. When the wolves were reintroduced they drove the deer back up into the hills and the land restored itself. </p>
<p>Edit: found it!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wolves were originally driven out because they didn't stay in the park, and would develop a taste for livestock from the farms in the surrounding area.  Now that wolves are reintroduced, the wolves are back to harassing livestock farms, but ranchers have been working with government scientists to come up with solutions.  The wolves have tracking tags, for example, and they've developed devices to make a lot of loud noise when they sense wolves nearby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied wildlife biology at Wsu. One of my professors ran studies on wolf depredations of livestock. In some studies he worked with ranchers to ensure their grazing lands didn’t come within a certain distance of an active wolf den. Only one rancher refused to participate and kept his cows grazing near a wolf den. He was the only rancher to lose livestock. Wolves tend to resort to preying on livestock while they are caring for pups since they are unable to travel far from their dens and neonates. Therefore if you make sure your cows aren’t grazing near dens, you likely won’t have depredations. </p>
<p>Unfortunately there is a lot of anti wolf sentiment in eastern Washington and Idaho. Many ranchers would prefer to extirpate any large predators rather than change outdated practices. I wish they understood that you cant pick and choose which species to get rid of without suffering the effects of biodiversity loss. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article recently about a professor in Washington who did as you described, and got run out of his university by ranchers pressuring the government funding of said university. Does that sound familiar - are we talking about the same professor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>civilization is due to a large part because we can change and control our environment. we have vaccines because we don't want to be killed by viruses. we have sanitation to to keep our food and water supply safe. we build houses, use heaters, and AC this is what we do. we change the environment. what we need to do is to find ways to sustainable alter the environment for long tern benefit of humanity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! Reintroduction of wolves literally changed the landscape of Yellowstone. The prey animal  (elk) population boom meant that they were feasting on young brush and trees which had a significant impact on the river banks because of erosion.
