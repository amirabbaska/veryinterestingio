			<div class="markdown"><p>I am in awe at the questions this answer raises.</p>
<p>What sorts of show animals eat super specific desert roaches? (My phone wanted to put &quot;dessert roaches&quot; there, which is hilarious in exactly <em>this</em> context.)</p>
<p>Do the roaches benefit from more calories from the bacterial bloom?</p>
<p>What do you feed roaches that are being raised to be food? Do you change their diet when it's nearly their time so that they have a more appropriate gut load?</p>
<p>How did you get this job? Was it something you'd always wanted to do?</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as the roaches go, their normal diet is bread crusts, fruit peels (NON CITRUS) and a banana whole, as a treat once a month.  You have to control their breeding so over feeding and including citrus will result in a population boom, useful short term, but this can have the effect of throwing your colony genetics off. The difference between a fine breeder and a by the Lb breeder you can find online.</p>
<p>When im pulling from the colony for a feed they move into a special container with a lot of Buffalo beetles for a few days where they clean up and the weak, sick, pregnant and nymphs are culled by the beetles. </p>
<p>Then they go on a crash glut to gain their gut load depending upon their destination. Right now i even have some fattening up on rose pollen for human consumption, so its funny you mention 'dessert roaches' because i breed those too.</p>
<p>Its actually a hobby that pays for my expensive taste in cars, im not a drug dealer i breed insects, i keep anywhere between 20 - 25 50 Gallon totes running at any time with 5 feeding containers, maybe 1 - 2  million insects at $1 a piece is some hobby. Some of my master breeders are sold to other breeders and your talking $50 - $100 a roach</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, people eat these things? Like, not only on purpose, but enough that you have a special diet for it?</p>
<p>Is that a cultural thing?</p></div>		</li>
