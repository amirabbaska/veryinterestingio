			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response, but regarding the ballast is cheap comment, I was told by a guy in the railroad industry for 40 years that the ballast is the greatest expense for building/maintaining rail lines (excluding land/real estate).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You do need a literal shit-ton of it per mile, and it doesn't last forever.  I have no doubt that needing a hundred truckloads per mile of track is not cheap when it comes time for fresh ballast.  But its cheaper than anything else you can use, I bet.  </p>
<p>Here is a really neato list of what it takes to build a mile of railroad: <a href="http://www.acwr.com/economic-development/railroads-101/rail-siding-costs" target="_blank">http://www.acwr.com/economic-development/railroads-101/rail-siding-costs</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny that you used the word &quot;truckloads&quot; -- yes, large quantities of aggregate (crushed stone/ballast) can get expensive, but transportation is often the largest cost component due to the high volumes needed for any construction project. So the ability to move train carloads of aggregate right to the needed spot, rather than trucking it, can cut down on expenses significantly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's a &quot;No.10 Switch Timber&quot;.  They're $6,200 per timber which sounds like a hunk of wood.  Is it just a longer tie that goes under a switch?  Why would that be so much when a regular tie is $55.22?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's probably true, especially in areas where it isn't readily available locally. But it's still cheaper than the alternative materials which could replace it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes alternative materials have unintended consequences.  In a certain part of the country they used cheap slag from a nearby metal smelter.  Guess what they're having to clean up now due to environmental issues?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ballast is primarily granite in the US. You can use softer limestones, but that's generally frown upon. Granite, while expensive, is still relatively cheap. To get a one piece counter top... Pretty expensive. To get a broken counter top... Pretty cheap. Relatively the same logic for ballast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just &quot;gravel&quot;, it's rock of a certain dimension and quality. It has to be sifted(?) so that small gravel, dust, clay etc doesn√§t come into it. Ther's a minimum and a maximum size of eah cpiece of rock.</p>
<p>There are also vacuum-clenaers, a train which sucks up the ballast, cleans it and re-applies and adjust. Cheaper than to buy new one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey drainage should be up there. Liquefaction of undrained soils can be a huge risk when considering the large cyclic loads that are exerted, and the huge lateral momentum that the train accumulates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure. I'm only familiar with liquefaction in the context of an earthquake, your point is interesting and makes sense to me. I come from a dry country so it's not the first thing on my mind!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this I work in locomotive shop, it's my job to move the locomotives around the yard (5 mph speed limit) and a few rocks on the track doesn't make any difference. A standard locomotive weights around 420,000lbs and will just crush the rock to sand.</p></div>		</li>
