			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, there's going to be less energy in the new bonds, so the total amount of matter is going to weight (gravitationally speaking) a little less.</p>
<p>The energy that is not in atomic bonds is to be found in the photons emitted by the fire, in the average thermic energy of the air (=temperature), etc...</p>
<p>I'm sure /u/justthistwicenomore knew this, it was just to offer a following ELI15.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is less energy in the bonds, and more energy in the movement. If the environment is &quot;closed&quot; in the thermodynamic sense then the energy will remain constant.</p>
<p>At the bulk scale (weight/mass) the changes in mass will be undetectable at the 1 kilogram, e.g. macro-scale, level.</p></div>		</li>
