			<div class="markdown"><p>For a great look into how much we know about sub-saharan history, look up from the Bantu expansion up to current history in southern Africa. Really interesting read.</p>
<p>It's how the majority population of southern Africa came to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Their conquering of the land over the native people (genocide of the Khoisan people)</li>
<li>Separation into different cultural groups, languages and geography</li>
<li>Fighting (basically genocide) between tribes (look up King Shaka Zulu)</li>
<li>Their encounters with European settlers (look up the Zulu Boer war and 100 year war between the Xhosa and British in South Africa)</li>
<li>European domination of Southern Africa (primarily German, Portuguese, British, Dutch)</li>
<li>Segregation of bantu-descended people by ethnicity</li>
<li>Countries declaring independence and democratizing their governments.</li>
</ol>
<p>An interesting thing to keep in mind while reading is some of the Bantu expansion of the greater empires (such as the Zulu) was still happening almost 200 years after Europeans first landed in Cape Town, around the era of Napoleon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found Martin Meredith's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fortunes-Africa-Martin-Meredith/dp/1471135454" target="_blank">The Fortunes of Africa</a> to be a very readable overview of African history. I'd particularly recommend it to someone who's not overly familiar with history or historical writing.  /r/AskHistorians also has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/wiki/books/africa" target="_blank">a book list</a> on the subject of African history. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, since many Sub-Saharan African societies were pre-literate, most of the documentary resources we do have concerning Africa before colonization were written by non-Africans. If you're primarily interested in much earlier African societies (before European contact, or even before Islam), looking into archaeology is probably the way to go. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/African-Archaeology-Cambridge-World-Paperback/dp/052154002X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1518933515&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=african+archaeology" target="_blank">The Cambridge World Archaeology</a> has been recommended to me before.</p></div>		</li>
