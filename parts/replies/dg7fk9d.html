<p>And in my opinion it is still a hot war. I was stationed on the DMZ in the 80's and we were in firefights at least weekly with DPRK forces.</p>

<p>The Korean War never &quot;ended&quot; with a formal, final peace compromise/negotiation. Since the U.S. still backs S.K. (has troops there, does military training together, etc.), it's arguable the longest war in U.S. history.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It depends how you define war, but the US has been in Afghanistan longer than Vietnam. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>US troops have been officially deployed in Afghanistan from October 2001 until December last year. That is less than 16 years. Vietnam war (at least US involvement) was between 1955 and 1975, making it almost 20 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, the withdrawal of US troops officially ended in December, with 8,400 troops left stationed in a few military bases, not as a war force.
In practice, it's still war.</p></div>		</li>
