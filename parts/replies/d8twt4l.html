			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that this formula applies here.</p>
<p>It's about how much light reaches the eye.</p>
<p>If there was an infinitely small object emitting as much light as a candle the human eye could see it from the same distance.</p>
<p>Or am I missing something here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is because psychology deals with perception and senses, such as hearing and sight. This is something that we sense, so it's in the realm of psychology.</p></div>		</li>
