<p>I can't say that modern digital cameras match the color rendition of these films. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would point out that those colors were scanned by a digital sensor at some point to make that piece of Kodachrome viewable on the web.</p>
<p>Digital can be far more accurate, but accurate is not always good. The sensitivity of the color layers in Kodachrome didn't match the human eye. As such it often created more color separation than we're used to. It also would make blue sky a lot more vivid that real life, which is OK because if I did a study and asked people to pick from a range of color tiles what they thought represented &quot;Blue sky&quot; and &quot;green grass&quot; they'd tend to pick more vivid colors than what accurately represents them. Painters did this for years and then Kodachrome did it. Kodachrome had a great &quot;pop&quot; to it. You can get part way there by adjusting your post processing settings or using a different RAW processors (like Capture One Pro), other people chase camera sensors saying older CCD sensors or the Sigma Foveon sensor has better color separation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kodak invented the bayer CFA (that red green blue checker boarded) their cameras, like pretty much every other digital camera out there, only &quot;see in color&quot; because they interpolate the color from the B&amp;W silicon. Kodak also really doesn't make cameras anymore.</p>
<p>You might be referring to Sigma cameras. They do use a different sensor that they call a Foveon sensor. This does see red, green, and blue at every photo site. However this also does a little bit of a trick, it layers 3 black and white photo sensors on top of each other, and they measure the difference of the 3 to determine how much red, green, and blue there is (higher wavelengths like blue will penetrate more than red). This can make the image about twice as sharp and not have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moiré_pattern#Television_screens_and_photographs" target="_blank">moiré</a> issues, but it will not render colors the same way the human observer does... this is not necessarily a bad thing, Kodachrome colors were not accurate to human vision, but they were very good. But even the Sigma is based on silicon that can only see B&amp;W, it's just that the sensor it self filters out some colors in 3 layers of B&amp;W sensors and the camera does some math to break out the colors.</p>
<p>Is that the interesting fact that you meant?</p>
<p>Some early cameras would take multiple shots in a row rotating filters in front of the lens, this would also get Red, Green, and Blue at ever photo site, but clearly the sensor is just a B&amp;W sensor and also it only works if the subject isn't moving otherwise you get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_shutter" target="_blank">Harris Shutter effect</a>. Some medium format digital companies like Sinar and Hasselblad will physically shift a sensor with a bayer CFA one pixel at a time and take 4 shots so it can record red, green, and blue at each location. But again, the silicon is still only sensitive to light in general and it only works for stationary subjects.</p>
<p><del>Before they stopped making digital cameras</del> A while back, Kodak was experimenting with different filter patterns, introducing clear/white filter areas as well as red, green, and blue. And Kodak and others experimented with adding yellow or aqua colors to the array but none of them worked as well as the bayer CFA they created in the 70's. But all of these were still color filters in front of a black and white sensor.</p>
<p>Edit: Kodak is still making consumer digital cameras, they've shifted gears a little and moved some of their companies around.</p></div>		</li>
