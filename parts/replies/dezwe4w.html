			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;dark&quot; part of both names is misleading. Really it just means &quot;unknown&quot;, and there isn't any link between the two (as far as we know).</p>
<p>&quot;Dark energy&quot; is just a placeholder name for &quot;whatever the hell is causing the expansion of the universe.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Dark matter&quot; is just a placeholder name for &quot;whatever the hell is keeping galaxies together.&quot;</p>
<p>And honestly that's about as far as we are, scientifically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. We are reasonably sure that dark matter is in fact matter, not some unknown physical principle or quirk. We have a reasonably complete list of possibilities for what dark matter could be, some of which we have largely ruled out. It is largely down to two hypotheses one of which is more likely (WIMPs.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in the field of dark matter, and this isn't correct. Dark matter refers to matter that interacts at most weakly. There are other phrases like &quot;modified newtonian dynamics&quot; (MOND) to refer to other theories that don't rely on dark matter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As he wrote, dark energy and dark matter are no more related than dark energy and normal matter. All matter can be converted to energy, and vice versa, according to relativity. This happens when matter and antimatter meets. We don't know what dark energy is, but if it is energy, matter can be converted into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well dark energy is a form of energy. It's just the energy needed to expand space. There was even a postulation that the universe was steady and perfectly creating matter from basically nowhere as fast as space was expanding due to some energy-driven process, but this doesn't fit with what we observe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could there be a dark matter/energy universe operating parallel with our own?</p>
<p>Like, is there some dark matter Reddit where they're looking at the discrepancy and wondering where it comes from?  This is veering into sci-fi, but are we somebody else's &quot;dark matter&quot; as they approach these equations from the other side of the veil?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>people have proposed that their are more dimensions than are visible and gravity may be 'leaking' into those dimensions. another theory states that gravity leaks between adjacent universes. although these are certainly more out there and not testable afaik.</p>
<p>i find the additional dimension idea the most plausible. it could explain how electrons appear to warp around instead of moving conventionally. when they disappear they could be moving through higher dimensions. </p>
<p>for example imagine a 3d ball passing through a 2d plane. if you were a 2 dimensional being, it would look unexplainable, like a line growing and shrinking for no reason. however if you could see a 3rd dimension it would look perfectly reasonable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the behaviour of the electron is very thoroughly described by the wavefunctions of quantum mechanics. The electron would move 'conventionally' if it was a particle, but everything points to the particle description as being inadequate. Quantum level particles exist in a wave/particle duality which is hard to understand, but easily measured. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. We are currently looking at black holes and weakly-interacting particles as candidates for dark matter. Usually postulated &quot;other dimensions&quot; don't interact with our dimension physically, but dark matter and dark energy clearly interacts with us.</p>
<p>But if this other dimension only consisted of matter that is completely different from all baryonic matter except that it is gravitationally detectable on galactic scales, sure. There is absolutely nothing that supports this theory, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it was demonstrated that dark matter doesn't interact with itself too. So it behaves differently from normal matter.</p>
<p>The best evidence is, perhaps, Bullet Cluster: a collision of galaxies. We can observe that ordinary matter was affected by the collision, but dark matter just went through it (and through itself).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure it has anything to do with the original question but when you say the universe is always expanding and we noticed its expanding at a faster rate, is it possible the distance between the sun and the earth is changing? </p>
<p>As a result, could that explain all the changing ecological factors that we account to global warming? (Not to say that I don't believe in it, just curious as to why, if things are moving further apart or getting nearer, this may not have been accounted for) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's my understanding that the expansion only occurs on scales between galaxies. Gravitational fields within solar systems and galaxies are enough to prevent them from expanding locally. So the diameter of the solar system and galaxy itself will not expand. However the space between galaxies does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that it was based on the amount of empty space between objects. So Earth and Sun are moving away from each other but it's negligible and basically neutralized by gravitational forces, compared to say two galaxies quadrillions of miles apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't sound right.  I think it's more like the &quot;expanding balloon&quot; analogy -- right now, every galaxy in the universe is accelerating away from you.  The sun is also accelerating away from you, and so are your fingertips when you outstretch your arm.  But since YOU are also expanding, and so are the units of measure that would track those changes, nearby space doesn't seem to be expanding at all.  The expansion can only be observed over great distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are talking about Astronomy here. &quot;Recent&quot; does not mean &quot;within the last few decades&quot; but &quot;within the last few billion years&quot;.</p>
<p>When it is said that scientists note that the expansion accelerates, that does not mean that they look at a certain star and notice that it moves away faster than the last time they looked at it. It means they notice how super old supernovae look like they are not moving away from us as fast as they should, considering the billions of light-years between us and them. As their light took billions of years to get here, the best explanation is, that they did not move away as fast at the beginning.</p></div>		</li>
