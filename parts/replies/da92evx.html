			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty accurate, but what is missing is the motive.</p>
<p>I've always been thought to, when trying to understand economics, put money last. Understanding how money works is very important, but money is the means, not an end. Money is just a tool we use to keep count of the goods exchanged.</p>
<p>In the end it is the goods that matter, because you can't live in money, you can't eat money. Money itself is useless.</p>
<p>For decades, the US has had the advantage of owning a world currency that is considered desirable. This is because of the US' economic might. Simply put, it is more likely that US dollars will retain value than Ugandan money, simply because so many goods are produced in the US which can be bought with dollars. It is these goods produced that matter. If your country does not produce anything, your money is only worth as much as what other money you can exchange it for. But even if suddenly no country in the world wanted dollars, the US economy alone would still output enough goods to guarantee value for your currency.</p>
<p>Because other countries wanted dollars (money), the US got the best end of the deal in goods.</p>
<p>You see, a trade deficit (import more than you export) sometimes is considered a bad thing in economics. But if you focus on goods, it's the best thing on earth. Other countries are giving you actual, physical, real stuff! And what do you hand out in return? Paper! It's a godlike trade.</p>
<p>So why then would China favor a positive trade balance? </p>
<p>The answer is simple. Economies grow and shrink depending on demand. If nobody wants your goods, you will not hire extra people. You will not invest in more machines. And the economy as a whole (your total capacity to produce actual, physical goods) will not grow as much.</p>
<p>So China has been exporting actual wealth (goods, physical stuff) in exchange for paper, because this helps grow the production capacity of china. And that means that while (comparatively speaking) the Chinese may hold the shorter end of the stick here, they'll eventually end up with a production capacity equal to or greater than that of the US. So <em>eventually</em> they will also wind up wealthier, even if for now it's the US that got all these goods on the cheap.</p>
<p>And does China really hold the shorter end of the stick as far as the trade is concerned?</p>
<p>In my opinion, they do if they stick to dollars (and by extension, bonds). Because the global (economic) power balances are shifting, and if the dollar devaluates, they really did trade physical goods for paper, for decades. Meaning the US practically got them for free, and all China got in return was a growing economy.</p>
<p>If they're smart (and many investors are smart) they invest these dollars in physical assets. So this is why (I think) many Chinese investors are buying real estate and western companies. US bonds may be very safe, but they are only safe in the sense that they protect your dollars from disappearing. They do not shield you from currency devaluation.</p>
<p>And therefore, assets may be safer in the long run. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then in the end, the US benefits more from the trade deficit than China? Because at a certain point, the Treasury can just churn out bills at a much higher rate, hence not only will the US receive the previous imports at a much lower cost, but it can, at any time, reverse the deficit back (i.e. trade surplus with China) and boost production by increasing exports at home using the cheaply acquired goods from China?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When the U.S pays back the debt, it again uses U.S dollars again right? So what can China do with those dollars? Loan them back?</p>
<p>So there is no other use of those dollars other then loaning back to U.S?  If so, what is the purpose of exporting goods when the exporting country cant use the currency it received from the importing country?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>US dollars are treated as the de-facto currency for international trade due to their position within the global economic system following WWII. </p>
<p>Yes. The US will pay the face value and any interest on the bonds in US dollars. China will then use this money to buy more bonds. </p>
<p>The currency isn't unusable. You can use it to purchase things from the US. the problem is that China doesn't need glad many US goods as the US needs Chinese goods. </p>
<p>Normally the values do the two currencies would shift until the trade balance was equal and neither country had excess money from the other. China however doesn't want this, they want a trade deficit because it allows them to sell more goods.</p></div>		</li>

<p>China is a major manufacturing hub, meaning their exports generally far outweigh their imports (positive trade balance). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not really what that means -- you can't long-term have a positive trade regardless of whether you focus on resource extraction, manufacturing, or services.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Trade between two countries will naturally tend towards an equilibrium by adjusting the value of the two counties currencies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.</p></div>		</li>
