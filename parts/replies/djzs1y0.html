			<div class="markdown"><p>For those looking for more information, learn up on &quot;Single Sign On&quot; - its essentially this. Websites that aren't facebook/google/apple can't possibly maintain a level of security and ubiquity that those big companies can. Virtually no one has an account to &quot;joes forum&quot; and virtually everyone has a facebook or google account. Offloading login to those services allows faster login times, easier collection of necessary data for said account, and basically allows them to totally ignore one of the hardest parts of creating a new service: authentication. </p>
<p>Do google and facebook collect more information about the people using their services? 100% yes. If you aren't willing to make these connections for them, simply don't use whatever service wants you to do this. That's the trade off. &quot;Joe's Forum&quot; literally doesn't care about your moral stand against sharing your data with facebook or google - that's not their business. Many a time I have decided making the connection to facebook simply isn't worth trying to get access to whatever service needs it - other times I have. It just depends on how much you care in that moment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, leveraging Facebook (or Google or whatever ubiquitous OAuth provider) to implement authentication and login takes five minutes. If you're making an otherwise simple app that requires login, using FB saves you a ton of time <em>and</em> is near-zero friction for the user. </p></div>		</li>

<p>but they don't know enough about what you're using the app for to target any additional ads to you</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is such an absurd statement that I question either your knowledge of the topic or your motivation for presenting it in this manner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you go into more detail then? If I were to create an app with Facebook log-in and use it to just authenticate you and get your email address, and everything else happens locally to my app or my website, what information does Facebook get?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Facebook knows the app you're using, and that by itself is absolutely enough to target additional ads to you. Depending on the app, it could tell them the type of games you like, if you're learning a new subject or planning to travel soon, if it's a medical tracking app it could reveal if you're diabetic or have another chronic disease, etc etc etc</p>
<p>Also it probably won't just reveal the name of the app, Facebook might know how frequently you use the app and for how long, and that combined with the name of the app is definitely enough to target additional apps or services you might be interested in. </p>
<p>This all assumes Facebook gets no info from inside the app and sometimes they do, which of course just lets them target even more precisely.</p></div>		</li>
