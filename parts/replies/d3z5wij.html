			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't make sense. There are black holes which have their schwarzchild radii greater than that size. The mass in the universe is 10^53kg or 10^23 solar masses. So a black hole with the mass of the universe would be roughly 10^23km, the size of the observable universe. (I ignored a few factors but the order of magnitude is what I'm after)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point - we're cheating a little bit on the volume, because the result isn't a possible physical object - as noted, anything with that mass in that volume would collapse into a black hole. </p>
<p>The answer here is more &quot;how much total volume would be required if all of the mass in the universe was compressed to the density of a neutron star&quot; and not &quot;how big would a single object be if it has the density of a neutron star and the mass of the universe.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It made sense to me, unless I am misunderstanding. If you squished it all together it would be the size of saturn's orbit, but all the mass would collapse into a singularity. The distance from the singularity to the event horizon would be equal to the Schwarzchild radius. Meaning the mass is packed into a point but the &quot;size&quot; of the black hole could be bigger, since size is just the distance from the event horizon to the singularity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the inverse of the formula for the volume of a sphere. V = (4/3)*pi*R^(3), turn it around to solve for R and you get R = (3*V/(4*pi))^(1/3).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you sure about that? If the universe started from a single point and grew from there, at what point did it become &quot;infinite&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The observable universe.</p>
<p>We don't know how big the entire Universe is. Existing observations are consistent with it being infinite in size, but the error margins would permit it to be finite in size. It does seem to be a lot bigger than the observable portion, though.</p></div>		</li>
