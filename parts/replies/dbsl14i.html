<p>Yes, it's a massive volcano with the potential to do lots of damage. However, it's not showing anything about it that hints there's anything like the volume of eruptable magma that we should be concerned about. </p>
<p>Magma chambers - or as the modern terminology prefers - magma reservoirs - are really heterogenous. On the scale of something like Yellowstone, while the reservoir may be tens of kiloemters in each dimenion, the interconnectedness of magma packets within it is largely unknown, but highly likely to be very poor indeed. More importantly, for a super eruption to occur you need thousands of cubic kiloemters of eruptable magma to be down there, and there's just no evidence that that is the case.</p>
<p>More importantly, the overwhelming majority of volcanic activity at Yellowstone isn't super eruptions; there's far far more small eruptions through it's history, and if we ever do see activity at Yellowstone in out lifetimes that is overwhelmingly the most likely route.</p>
<p>People talk about Yellowstone as if it has some kind of cyclicity; it really doesn't. And just because it's erupted before doesn't mean it will again; there can be temporal changes in how magma is supplied to a volcano, and no volcano has remained active throughout earth history.</p>
<p>In short, if you see a news article talking about activity at Yellowstone you can bet your money safely that it is almost certainly scaremongering. Approach it cynically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further on Yellowstone 'going to explode' sort of thought, I was under the impression that from what we do understand of Yellowstone is its a giant deflated pocket of rock (simplistically) that was once was filled with magma and is now a basin (as its empty) where as if we were to see it explode again it would be more like a giant mesa-thing sort of like a filling balloon.</p>
<p>Any of that right at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The simplification isn't quite right (and is way too simplified to be too useful).  Its much less of a balloon that filled and deflated and more like a zit that built up pus under the  skin and then popped, leaving a crater-scar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short, we don't know. There's certainly a good argument for it, but the edifice that makes up Yellowstone now is not the same one that erupted in the past. We really don't know what its capacity for inflation is now.</p></div>		</li>
