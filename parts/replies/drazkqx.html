			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the matter of having a safety cushion. It really doesn't matter if a plane crashes from 5000 or 30000 feet once you hit the ground. Dead is dead. However, when something goes wrong, falling from 30000 feet gives you a lot more time to fix things than falling from 5000. It's like how ships will often avoid land in a storm - the danger zone is where sky or water meet land, so stay away from that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Case in point, for anyone wondering if this really happens: in 1985, the pilots of China Airlines flight 006 reacted incorrectly to an engine failure and allowed the thrust imbalance to turn the plane upside down. The plane fell, turning over and over, for <em>5.7 miles</em> straight down before the pilots managed to recover and land the heavily damaged aircraft in San Francisco. No one died, but had they been flying at a lower altitude, everyone on board would have been toast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  If you're talking strictly safety, higher altitudes become much more dangerous for numerous reasons.  One is that at higher altitudes, if there is a depressurization of the aircraft, the time available to don oxygen masks diminishes to seconds.  We call that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_useful_consciousness" target="_blank">Time of Useful Consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>The other, and more significant, is that at higher altitudes the air is so thin that the Mach number is reduced to the point where air flowing over the wing reaches that speed.  This causes what is called compression.  Compression can freeze the flight controls and cause the airplane into mach tuck.  Mach tuck means that the airplane begins to nose down uncontrollably.  Of course, once it starts to nose down, it speeds up, making the problem worse.  On the other hand, if you go too slow, the airplane may stall.  Stall speed goes up (a bad thing) the higher you go because the air is so much less dense up there.  The result of the speed of sound decreasing and the stall speed increasing is that you have a very narrow margin of airspeeds in which it is safe to fly.  If you get high enough, you get into what is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffin_corner_\(aerodynamics\)" target="_blank">Coffin Corner</a> where the two are very close together.  That is very dangerous.  So flying lower is actually safer.  </p>
<p>Flying higher is mostly about getting above the weather and increasing fuel efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Compression does not freeze flight controls. Compression happens at the leading edge where the motion of the wing compresses the air in front. The flight controls are at the back.</p>
<p>What happens is &quot;separation&quot;, where the airflow no longer conforms to the surface of the wing, but splits away from it. This leaves dead air behind the wing, and the flight controls flap around uselessly in it.</p>
<p>The solution (for military planes) is to use much larger flight controls, such as making the entire stabilizer move instead of just the elevators (called a &quot;flying tail&quot;).</p>
<p>Mach tuck happens when the leading edge of the stabilizer causes enough separation that the elevators can no longer get a 'bite' into the slipstream. The solution for jetliners when that happens is to move the entire stabilizer using the stabilizer trim controls.</p>
<p>Really bad separation happens when the wing causes so much separation that the stabilizer can not be adjusted to get back into the airflow. But by then, you're probably going so fast that the airplane is going to come apart anyway.</p>
<p>That's all subsonic. Supersonic has more problems, from the shock waves passing over the flight controls. I don't know much about that, because the airplane (757) I worked on was subsonic :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stalling at high altitude isn't much of a real safety risk, most aircraft with a well trained pilot can easily recover from a stall given enough altitude, stalling at low altitude where there's no time for recovery is infinitely more dangerous.  Stalling at pattern altitude on landing approach or shortly after takeoff is a major cause of aircraft fatalities, stalling at high altitude is almost never fatal.  As a matter of fact every student pilot will deliberately stall their aircraft at high altitude as part of their training so they become familiar with the plane's stall behavior.</p>
<p>The mitigation of weather related issues at higher altitudes more than makes up for the added risks.  Cabin depressurization is a rare event in an airliner.  </p>
<p>Flying in the dense lower atmosphere would greatly limit speed, require much more power and fuel, allow much less time to react to in-flight emergencies (such as an engine out), subject the aircraft to dangerous up and down drafts when crossing mountainous areas, force aircraft to fly in bumpy choppy air, that would be uncomfortable and stress the airframe, due to convection currents from the warm earth's surface,  and crowd all air traffic (including smaller aircraft moving at much slower speeds) into a smaller space where collisions would be much more likely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern aircraft are designed to fly at these Transsonic speeds and have various methods to counteract the effects.  Most modern airfoil have a dynamic profile. The wings angle of attack and airfoil shape changes along its length.  By the wing root one could have a thicker airfoil (in relation to its length) which would produce more lift. The wing tip would have a shape that would produce less lift but would also be less likely to be effective by the supersonic flow. The tip is where the control surfaces are.  Therefore a stall would start at the root and work its way out, losing lift but leaving the control authority so the pilot can maneuver and recover from the stall. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My pilot friend had this to say: &quot;So, turbine engines are most efficient at hotter temperature differentials.  At 33k feet it's -50 outside, and the engines are up around 600.  The lower drag coupled with the lower oxygen means lower fuel burn.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit to add another comment: &quot;My engines (on a 737) burn around 1500 lbs per hour at idle at sea level. At cruise at 38k feet, it's around 2200&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, jet turbines are like any other engine, in that the primary driver of efficiency is the temperature difference between the hottest spot and the environment. Because the temperature limitations of jet engines (not melting the first stage turbine) mean that increasing the T_hot is impossible without manufacturing a new engine, the best way to increase this difference is to fly in the colder air you find higher up.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mmm the 600 figure is accurate still, the most relevant temperature to pilots is the interstage turbine temperature, and that is what is displayed/most referenced in the cockpit in terms of engine temperature. 600 is a realistic figure for that particular measurement.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Turbine blades are one of, if not the top, crowning achievement of all time in human engineering.</p>
<p>It's incredible what goes into turbine blades. And how reliable they are.</p>
<p>Things like <a href="https://www.theengineer.co.uk/rolls-royce-single-crystal-turbine-blade/" target="_blank">single crystal manufacturing</a> where an entire turbine blade has no grain boundary or inter-crystalline structure because they made the whole damn thing out of one crystal of nickel alloy.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it's true... which is another reason why you don't want to fly too high. For a given wing span &amp; engine thrust combo (or thrust loading), there's a sweet spot for altitudes. Atmospheric density reduces as you go higher and you need air molecules moving over the wing to generate lift (not <em>create</em> lift, semantics). Less molecules = less resistance = less lift. </p>
<p>That's why high altitude recon aircraft have such long wingspans - to be able to &quot;hit&quot; as many air molecules as possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you can save that response for when someone asks why airplanes don't fly higher.  </p>
<p>They're built and geared for it.  That's why they're so inefficient at lower altitudes and can't reach even half their top speed. </p></div>		</li>
