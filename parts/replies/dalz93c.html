			<div class="markdown"><p>And yet America pays the highest per capita health care rate in the industrialized world, plus must insure on top of that. </p>
<p>Canadian here, our system has its flaws and waste, but not paying for an entire level of extra profit saves us thousands per year. </p>
<p>The biggest problem with living next to America is that those with the money to cover themselves even in the face of illness are those who's voices carry the furthest, because they're of the wealthy class. </p>
<p>Besides which the uninsured don't just go die on the corner, they wait til the very last possible moment, then go into ER dying, and require hugely expensive care that they can't pay for. </p>
<p>It's a lose/lose setup. The only winners are the wealthy. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Those with bad teeth end up in the hospital costing us all huge money. </p>
<p>Hooray</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canadian, needing to add some clarity here. While many Canadians (myself included) do have additional private health insurance, usually through work benefits, this doesn't affect the basic care that everyone receives. </p>
<p>Any time I need to go to the doctor, I make an appointment with my GP or go to the nearest walk-in clinic, present my health care card and get treated. Same goes for a visit to the E.R. These things cost me nothing. Additionally, if my doctor decided I needed to see a specialist, this would cost me nothing.</p>
<p>The private health insurance that you're talking about is for non-essential value-added things. For instance, I get $500 per year covered towards each of massage therapists, chiropractors and acupuncturists, among other things. When my wife had surgery, my extra plan paid for a private recovery room at the hospital. </p>
<p>The American way of bankrupting people for getting sick is ludicrous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the health care in the US and the reason why it costs so much is the government itself. It stands to reason all the various blocks the government does on healthcare increase the cost exponentially which gets passed on to the end user whereas in Canada we simply pay higher tax. (see the Epipen fiasco for a recent example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the government has the power to tell a particular company &quot;no, we're not doing business with you at that price. We will pay this, or find someone else&quot;, and that company loses out on 300 million people instead of just 1 if it was an individual negotiating, or maybe a few thousand for an insurance company. They could singlehandedly put a lot of medical suppliers out of business with a decision like that, which gives them a lot of leverage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, it's a huge problem to assume gov't should have this kind of power. Why would they not just choose their buddies company? Say they get a $250k donation and kinda look the other way when better competition comes around?</p>
<p>Let people choose for themselves and you'll see this crony capitalism in medicine disappear overnight.</p></div>		</li>
