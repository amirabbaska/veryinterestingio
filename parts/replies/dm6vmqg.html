			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're referring to a chronoton. This are fictional and made up by star trek. </p>
<p>&quot;A chronon is the length of time it takes one quantum of energy to push one electron from one electronic orbit to the next&quot; . The Ideal Stanley Grauman Weinbaum.</p>
<p>But even that could be wrong </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of a shit definition tbh.</p>
<p>The Chronon is defined as (1/(6<em>Pi</em>E0))<em>(e^2 /(m0</em>c^3 ))</p>
<p>Which means you're basing the definition of a quantum of time on a specific particle.</p>
<p>What would make more sense is the planck time:</p>
<p>tp = Sqrt((ħ*G)/(c^5 ))</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically the amount of time it takes light to travel one plank length of distance right?  Since nothing moves faster than that it makes sense that nothing can happen in units of time smaller than that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beauty, thanks for that! I just googled and cut and paste. I like the planck idea better. I've never thought of time as a particle before this thread. </p>
<p>Cheers! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I brainfarted; but I'm thinking there's no substantive difference aside from one term originating from Physics and the other from SciFi.</p>
<p>In the length-of-time definition; do we know whether that length is standard for all electron jumps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I continued reading and it said 10-24 seconds. Which to me sounds a bit nutty, so who knows? Maybe it's all fiction. Let me know if you learn more in your travels. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The term gets used a lot in TNG-era Star Trek time travel episodes. </p>

<p>You're thinking of <em>chronitons</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true. They are conceptual. You can't prove they exist or don't. What you can investigate is whether time can be quantized. If it can, then the chronon is a thing.</p></div>		</li>
