			<div class="markdown"><p>On your comment regarding countershading: that is usually more important for either pelagic (open water) fish or for those that tend to swim above and around a reef.</p>
<p>For instance, many different (not all) species of sharks that live around reefs use countershading as a means of camouflage - such as a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/2c/Grey_reef_shark2.jpg" target="_blank">Grey Reef Shark</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.igfa.org/Images/SpeciesID_Images/sailfish_Pacific.png" target="_blank">Sailfish</a> are another good example of a countershaded fish, and their niche is in open water, hunting smaller fish and squid.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Bicolor_parrotfish.JPG" target="_blank">Parrotfish</a> isn't going to need countershading, as it typically hugs the reef and avoids open water.  Additionally, it is a fin-swimmer, not a tail-swimmer, and eats algae and small crustaceans, so it isn't camouflaging itself from potential prey.  More important is (as you mentioned) the distinction between male and female, or the distinction between species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, one of the few (but increasing) prehistoric species that's coloration has been deduced from paleochemistry is the Mosasaur, a group of large aquatic lizards that dominated marine ecosystems at the end of the Cretaceous.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosasaur#Coloration" target="_blank">They also displayed countershading.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to tack on about fish vision that many fish can detect different kinds of polarized light and <a href="http://discovermagazine.com/2014/may/2-cunning-fish-camo" target="_blank">some fish</a> have the ability to manipulate the way polarized light is reflected off of them in an effort to blend in with their surroundings.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haidinger's_brush" target="_blank">Fun Fact:</a> Many humans are capable of detecting polarized light as well!</p></div>		</li>
