			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with quite a lot of experience in starvation (thanks, eating disorder), that is definitely a different type of &quot;brain fatigue&quot; that comes with a lot more irritability (after 2-3 days of not eating I turn into a total bitch). Things drain your energy quickly. Everything is kinda fuzzy and distant.</p>
<p>However, my brain fatigue that comes after working for hours on a project feels more like my brain saying &quot;jesus fucking christ I just can't make myself do this any longer&quot;</p>
<p>And mental fatigue after staying up for a few days just feels like your thoughts are taking a long time to &quot;load&quot; (you try to access an idea through a hyperlink except you're running AOL in 2000, not high speed internet, and it takes forever to get the info you want). Also, a lot of crying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now <em>that</em> is low blood glucose. If this is something which happens to you regularly you should consider /r/keto - on a ketogenic diet, you don't start feeling like shit if you stop eating for a few days. If you take a look over in /r/keto, bear in mind that although their faq is weight-loss focused, that's not the only thing it's good for. I'm currently gaining weight on keto.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, my blood glucose level was 46 right before I was hospitalized</p>
<p>and there is no way you wouldn't feel like shit. Your brain can't function on just ketone bodies; it needs some glucose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which eating disorder? I was diagnosed EDNOS (which has since been recategorized in the newest DSM). I met all the Anorexia Nervosa criteria except that I wasn't underweight before being hospitalized (lost 80lb in ~5 mo, was 220lb).</p>
<p>I did restriction and intermittent fasting. 3 day fasts (which I considered as no food or non-diet drinks, though I probably consumed ~10 calories a day in diet pop and black coffee) were not uncommon, and the longest I went without eating was 5 days. Then I had a blood test and my blood glucose was 46 (Should be at least ~80, and 120 isn't uncommon right after eating) and that's when I got put in the hospital</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They seem to be a pretty unfavorable substitute for the brain though because even in starvation they only partly replace glucose.</p>
<p>Still thank you for mentioning that</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry - you're 99% correct. I shouldn't have mentioned it. There is a diet, nutritional ketosis, where the brain and the body adapt to using ketones for the vast majority of energy production, but you're right in the that brain still demands glucose (about 30 grams/day). I only mention it because I follow a ketogenic protocol solely for mental energy and clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This puzzles me. I write novels, so my brain functioning is pretty important to me. I'm also on a ketogenic diet -- about 30 grams of carbs/day. I haven't noticed any real change in my mental faculties since going keto. If anything, I feel I'm slightly <em>better</em> able to think/reason/brainstorm/write. I wonder why that should be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheers for the link.</p>
<p>A friend of mine swears by the ketone diet, he did it a while back (past tense). I'll let him know.</p>
<p>It was a bit weird seeing a buddy drinking a cup of tea with a melted stick of butter in it. That 'clear energy' he reported was probably the primal 'last chance, get some food' message.</p>
<p>Although, lab rats with a minimal supply of food do live longer than ones with a full supply</p>
