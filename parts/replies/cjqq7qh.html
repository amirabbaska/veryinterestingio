			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this explanation! It led me to another question. How quickly does water normalize pressure, and more generally what factors of a fluid dictate the speed of normalizing pressure?</p>
<p>In other words, say Aquaman uses some superpower to create a bubble, deep underwater, in which the water pressure is significantly lower than the surrounding water. Then he suddenly turns his power off. My intuition makes me imagine the low pressure bubble roughly maintaining it's form while it ascends to the lower pressure surface water. </p>
<p>But after reading /u/SherbetHead2010's answer explaining that pressure is in all directions, and your points about the relative uncompressable nature of water, I wonder if something different happens. Does the whole pressure system of the water equalize instantly, or extremely quickly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. it's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation" target="_blank">cavitation</a>.</p>
<p>heres a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3WwQKZ05Uk" target="_blank">video</a> of a propeller undergoing cavitation testing in a lab.</p>
<p>heres a better <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp5gdUHFGIQ" target="_blank">video</a> of a rifle being fired underwater in super slo-mo and you can see the bullet causing cavitations, which in turn interfere with each other and have secondary cavitations. there is a great explanation of the secondary cavitations with science regarding water pressure, vaporization, and cavitation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The large bubble of air if somehow placed in a high pressure water situation, will disperse into millions of tiny bubbles the size at which the surface tension balanced out the water pressure. This is my understanding at least. The speed at which this would happen is the speed of sound through water, or the speed at which motion and propagations will happen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now water is different from air, in that it is relatively incompressible...Water, unlike air, is able to &quot;resist&quot; being compressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure why you're emphasizing compressibility so much. Since you can't make loose soil more compact by increasing <em>air</em> pressure, compressibility obviously isn't the important factor. (Water and air are both compressible fluids.) </p>
<p>The reason the ocean floor isn't compact is that the enormous pressure is <em>hydrostatic</em> (imposed equitriaxially, or from all sides) rather than <em>deviatoric</em> (the alternative).</p>
<p>Hydrostatic stress causes materials to shrink (change size), but not to deform, change shape, or eject interstitial fluid (which is a requirement for compactification). Each sand particle gets slightly smaller, but there's no driving force to push it against a neighboring particle. (You did mention this.)</p>
<p>Deviatoric stress causes metals to bend, ceramics to fracture, and granular systems to become more compact.</p>
<p>It's got nothing to do with air vs. water; it's the nature of the applied load.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this explanation, but I feel that it misaddresses something. If you compress dirt in air, the air is literally squeezed out of it. The air is <em>not</em> being compressed inside but rather is pushed out. Similarly, one can compress a ball of mud and squeeze out some of the water. <del>This is because dirt is more dense than water and air—if it were the other way around you would end up squeezing all of the dirt out of your ball of water.</del></p>
<p>Under the ocean however, the dirt is really suspended in water. So perhaps the individual grains of dirt are compressed (however slightly) by the extreme pressure, but the watery dirt beneath them is still part of the same muddy aqueous solution. They all feel the pressure equally everywhere. </p>
<p>The only reason the dirt is on the bottom is because it is more dense than water. The only force that pushes the dirt down and compresses it is that caused by the difference of the weight of the dirt and water—which is relatively small. Thus despite having the weight of an ocean pushing down upon it, the dirt also feels everything beneath it pushing up. Of course, as landryraccoon points out, the fact that it is an aqueous suspension and that water is practically incompressible is important. It serves to fill in the tiny gaps everywhere and makes the solution a fluid.</p>
<p>The dirt isn't compressed because it is being pushed up almost as much. When something is suspended in water (or any liquid) it only &quot;weighs&quot; as much as the difference between itself and the water. Thus the additional weight of the dirt compared to water is what compresses the dirt to any degree at all.</p>
<p><strong>tldr; basically the reason it isn't being compressed is because in water, the dirt really isn't that heavy and any pressure from the water is felt equally from below.</strong></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is important to understand that pressure doesn't push <em>down</em>. It pushes perpendicular to all surfaces, so each grain of mud will feel the same force from below as it does from above, and from any one side, and from the opposite side. This is why the sea floor isn't compacted <em>down</em>, but each grain of mud or sand will get the full pressure of the ocean exerted on it, squeezing it inwards. </p>

<p>No, you could have a mixture of water and small pieces of styrofoam, and you could still squeeze water out, even though styrofoam is obviously way less dense than water.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>No. How heavy the dirt feels under water isn't relevant. Even above water, a huge increase in air pressure wouldn't compress dirt.</p>

<p>Yes, or more accurately, what u/judgej2 said</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wrong about your first point. I believe that you are misinterpreting the second point you quoted. I was wrong in saying it is <em>the</em> reason the dirt isn't compressed, but it is <em>a</em> reason. If you had lead dirt at the bottom of the ocean too, it would be more compressed than just normal dirt. I wasn't saying that more water pressure would compress the dirt as I think you are implying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Whether in air or in water the fluid is NOT compressing/compacting the solid material at all.  The fluid is pressing on the material from all directions.  A particle of dirt sitting on the ground is being pulled downward by gravity, but the air pressure is pushing on it from all directions: i.e. no net effect at all.  The fluid pressure at the bottom of the atmosphere or the ocean is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The only thing that is relevant is the density of the sediment particles compared to the surrounding fluid.  That downward force is the only thing driving the compaction.  In the case of air, such a low-viscosity fluid easily flows around the particles and escapes, allowing compaction to proceed more easily in air than if it is water, which is higher viscosity and also incompressible.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the weight of the sediment will eventually compact sediment on the bottom of the ocean into rock, once you've got a couple of kilometres of sediment weight on top of it.  But in the top few metres, there's not much compaction going on because there's not much weight on it yet whether you're only a metre under the water or several km.</p></div>		</li>
