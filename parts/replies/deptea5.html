			<div class="markdown"><p>I definitely notice a taste difference in whatever bottle water brand my mom gets. On one hand, the tap water I drink tastes nasty, but sort of like in a dirty way. On the other hand, the bottle water she gets tastes gross in that it sort of tastes like it has a lemony flavor in it or something (even though it's not advertised as such) and I just want completely tasteless water. Both have flavors I'm not a fan of. I just want, basically, liquid air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aquafina is what you want, then. Personally, I think it's gross; water is supposed to taste like something. Aquafina goes through a process so it's basically distilled (but the process is different from distilling). Or, if you don't need it in small bottles, just buy jugs of distilled water, as they're cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tried Evian and it just doesn't taste right to me.  Frankly, I prefer plain tap water that's been stored in the frig overnight.  many of the filtering chemicals evaporate out and its fucking delicious.</p></div>		</li>
