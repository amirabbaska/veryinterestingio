			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent reply. I'm going to add that &quot;particle&quot; usually implies an airborne small clump of solid material, such as is found in cigarette smoke. That's why, over time, a smoker's stuff turns yellow - the solid particles stick to surrounding surfaces and build up.</p>
<p>The stuff you're smelling in a washroom is usually gaseous in nature, containing hydrogen sulfide and other nasty-scented gases, and not solid particles of poo or such. So you're not really smelling &quot;particles&quot; so much as you're smelling gasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean that in e.g. cigarette smoke the particles in the smoke are not really in a gaseous state i.e. they comprise more than one molecule per &quot;clump&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, depending on the who you ask that is the difference between a smoke and a vapor.</p>
<p>Smoke (from any source) almost universally contains solid particulates (ie tar) and liquids suspended in a gaseous medium.  It is typically classified as an aerosol and therefore a suspension.</p>
<p>Smoke is produced from incomplete combustion, where particulates are being carried away by various means faster than they can complete their full combustion reactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh thank god. Ever since the classroom scene in The Ice Storm I’ve had it in my head every time I go into a public bathroom that I’m kind of inhaling poo. I even convinced my kids of this. I need to re-educate them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they are only gasses. It's like if someone's sweat dries on a hot surface. Yes, now that person's water is floating around. Doesn't mean their germs are also floating around in the air with the water molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, I grew up a total germophobe and this was 100% my mother's fault, who would get angry and upset with us about things being dirty, and tell us about how germs caused diseases and infection and all this.. it was traumatizing and I grew up paying way too much attention to everything around me, analyzing whether or not it was &quot;clean&quot; and if I touched it, I felt &quot;contaminated&quot;, like a sense of sickness and a need to wash it off. I grew/educated myself out of it, but it took a while. And it's not like mostly correct information wasn't available back then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fortunately, the things generally associated with really bad odor tend to contain sulfur compounds, which the nose detects at <em>extremely</em> small concentrations. So, you're not necessarily breathing in a lot of poop if you smell it, your body is just reacting strongly to it.</p></div>		</li>
