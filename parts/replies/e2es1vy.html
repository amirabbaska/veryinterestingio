			<div class="markdown"><p>Any time you are trying to find something rare, the problem is not finding it, it is false positives.  Think of a guy on a beach with a metal detector.  There is a gold coin somewhere on the beach, but if there are a thousand pennies scattered about, and you have to spend five minutes digging each time you get a hit, all your effort goes into digging up pennies.  </p>
<p>Except here &quot;digging up pennies&quot; are actually expensive, painful, and possibly deadly operations.  Better to search only when you are pretty sure of the location of the gold coin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The conequences of the surgeries may be a bit exaggerated but the principle is true. Also if look at the stats and see how the false positive and false negative rates are for test it becomes more apparent why we do thing the way we do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The US preventative services task force publishes guidelines on screening exams. For normal risk women screening  mammograms are indicated from age 50 to 74 biennialy. If a patient's life expectancy is less than 10 years (for example if they're on dialysis) they should not be screened. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been more and more pushback on preventative screening mammograms and prostate exams for that reason.</p>
<p>The age guidelines have been compressed in the US.  In England, the NHS guidelines are every 3 years for mammograms (instead of 1 or 2 years by the ACS).</p>

<p>The benefits of preventative cancer screening relative to the costs were largely overstated by the medical community for a few decades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hypothetically yes, but the problem is definitely much worse with a whole body scan because there are so many more opportunities for false positives.</p></div>		</li>
