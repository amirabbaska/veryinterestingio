			<div class="markdown"><p>No, for LCD, almost all the power is sent to the backlight, and the LCD just changes how transparent it is (no light, so very little power). Because of that, power consumption is basically tied to backlight brightness, not weather a pixel is on or off, so an all black and all white screen consume the same amount of power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could switch off the backlight while you don't display the numbers. Some monitors even do this while they display something, if they don't need the full brightness.</p></div>		</li>

There were LED watches back in the 70's. You had to press a button to light them up because the battery could only light them for a few minutes total.</p></div>		</li>
