			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it be dust mite allergy then instead of hayfever? Maybe open windows let pollen in during the day? Long hair traps pollen then you're sleeping right next to it....try washing your hair at night instead of morning time. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dust mites are what cause Hay Fever (aka Allergic Rhinitis) in a lot of people. Just as some people are allergic to pollens, some are allergic to mites, and they all cause histamine release in the different populations that they affect. In a way you are right though. The ones that are allergic to mites will really feel these symptoms after that prolonged period indoors especially while laying in bed and on a pillow where a lot of mites are located.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be different country to country, but where I am from (Australia) the term 'Hay Fever' refers to allergy to various pollens, especially grass pollen, wheras 'Dust Mite Allergy' is where someone is allergic to certain proteins in the waste left by dust mites (dead bodies and poo). </p>
<p>Allergic Rhinitis is just a fancy name for a runny nose, a common symptom of many allergy types. Allergic Conjunctivitis is another nice fancy word, it means red eyes.</p>
<p>All allergies are caused by excess Histamine release due to an overreaction of the immune system to a foreign substance. Anti-histamines, to a certain extent, block type one Histamine receptors and can mitigate some of the problems caused by this excess Histamine release. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get some hepa filters for your home and limit the amount of ragweed allergen entering your home by removing clothing at the door and washing your hair when you get home to get rid of those allergens that trap themselves on you.</p>
<p>Pets drag all the fun allergens in too.</p></div>		</li>
