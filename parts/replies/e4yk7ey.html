<p>Turns out the right lane had a construction hazard randomly thrown in the street and I didn’t see it until the guy swerved out of its way at the last possible second. </p>
<p>Damn near crashed my car in the dumbest of ways</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for being the first to say #3... that's hugely important. It's a defensive position. If there is even a <em>little</em> extra space some clown will try and drive in it.</p>
<p>Edit: Yes, my dudes, there are just as many assholes on motorcycles as there are in cars... I'm sorry for my shitty colleagues. Just remember,  we aren't all assholes just like all people in cars aren't! </p>
<p>Good <em>defensive</em> riding shouldn't aggravate you. Bad <em>offensive</em> riding is what a lot of you are complaining about and most motorcyclists (at least the ones I know) hate riders that do it as much as you guys do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a cyclist I live this reality almost every ride, even if I defensively claim the lane as I approach a redlight/stop sign to indicate I'm stopping and observing right of way. I was sharing the lane at a stop sign with a frontloader this weekend. Parked his bucket (intentionally, I'm sure) about 3 feet from my hip and proceeded to take off at the same moment I did forcing us to be side by side far longer then necessary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've had a rider dump his bike in front of me when he f'd up an off ramp, and that extra space meant I didn't also hit him with my car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get an upvote. We riders appreciate the few who do this. Sadly, most drivers only care about what their little space is doing and don't pay attention to anything else until it's too late.</p>
<p>The one scary exception is old people. They don't purposely ignore you, they literally just can't see you or process your headlight fast enough. I nearly got intimate with the broad side of a dodge caravan an old couple was in, as they pulled across my lane out of a parking lot. Not surprisingly, the driver had those glasses that look like welding goggles on. </p></div>		</li>
