<p>I only have a ok-ish Yamaha and a half-blown older Yamaha Stereo receiver that turns off every 15 minutes but works perfectly fine when you turn it on again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only saw auto gain control in software, basically you crank the level up on it and it increases the lower levels to match the higher levels, so I don't believe so, it doesn't increase the volume of stuff that is already loud</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing I've noticed is that some TVs have this built in. </p>
<p>I recently helped someone who hated the huge volume difference while watching a movie. Their &quot;Audio Profile&quot; on the TV was set to &quot;Speech&quot; so it boomed when people talked but was quiet for the rest of the movie. </p>
<p>This solves one problem (movies with large dynamic range) but creates another one with movies that have a small dynamic range for home viewing. </p>
<p>Damned if you do; damned if you don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My new Roku (Ultra, last year's model because needed optical out) has this night mode dynamic compression, but it downgrades the signal to 2ch so it defeats the purpose of having surround sound.</p></div>		</li>
