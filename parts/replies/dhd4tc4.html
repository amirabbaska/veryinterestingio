			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what OP is asking is when does a drop stop being a drop. For example, a 10nm drop on a hydrophillic surface will rather be a film, not a drop.</p>
<p>I don't know if there is a formal definition of a drop, but one metric could be a mass of water for which the tangent along the water surface becomes perpendicular to the plane it is attached to. With this condition, it depends on the surface tension of the surface as well as the boundary conditions for the thing the drop is attached to (smaller bounded surfaces form smaller drops).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One could consider the minimal droplet size for condensation to happen at atmospheric pressure. Although, this is not the typical case, as a lot of condensation (like in clouds) happens at condensation nuclei (cloud seeds), which lower the minimal droplet volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You flipped your view point, the 150 atm pressure is outward, forcing the drop apart. The wiki article you linked says it in the last few sentences of the surface tension section</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there's no minimum size, could we build a gigantic water droplet like following image:</p>

<p>So that we could swim inside with the opening in the bottom, and with another swimming pool below the opening, just cross the opening swimming and fall to the below pool.. that would be very cool, a great addon for water amusement parks.</p></div>		</li>
