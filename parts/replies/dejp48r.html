			<div class="markdown"><p>The standardized tests (SAT/ACT) don't use the grading system in the image you linked, but they also aren't ranked against other students. If half of the students got everything right and the other half got everything except one question wrong, everyone would have near-perfect scores.</p>
<p>So isn't it impossible to compare your scores vs. other years in Finland? What if one year everyone got almost every question right, and then the next year everyone got almost everything wrong? Wouldn't they have identical scores, despite completely different performance?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tests are really well made and difficulty is quite similar every year. Getting really high scores is really hard so comparing grades to previous year works well.</p>
<p>Comparing different subjects is bit difficult because required knowledge and work for getting L is quite different when comparing really common subjects (like Finnish) and rarely choosen subject (like French). Because usually people who choose French are really interested in it and are motivated, they perform well in tests, but because of this grading system, some people who did quite well get bad grade because overall level is so high.</p>
<p>Actually they changed grading a few years back so they dont have to follow those percents so strictly anymore and grading rarely choosen subjects would be more fair. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a problem. Or at least has never been in a major way in the decades past. You just need good tests and competent graders. There are no multiple choice questions, so that lowers the variance considerably. Most questions are hard and complex, and answers are either long or full-on essays. The tests with concrete right answers, like math, are so hard that getting a 100% is very rare. </p></div>		</li>
