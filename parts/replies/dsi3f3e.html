			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're getting technical, and when it comes to passive components I always am, saturation is a direct function of flux density which is only dependent on current in the primary, number of turns, length of the solenoid, and permeability.  H=NI/le.  Voltage is only important in the secondary for V~Ndphi/dt (mobile, no Greek letters).</p>
<p>Edit: saturation flux also depends on the relative permeability of the entire flux path including air gaps.  That's why anything for power uses a gap: it reduces the permeability making the material harder to saturate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The transformer is only a part in the resonating circuit. It consists capacitors too, and a switch (rotating spark gap) that switches the system on and of at a certain rate. The sparks get large because the previvious one will ionize the air for the next one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The resonance is more about raising the current.  A tesla coil works by charging a capacitor in series with the primary coil- the capacitor and coil resonate together at a specific frequency (.159/sqrt(LC)).  The secondary coil has to be tuned to that frequency to extract the maximum amount of energy.</p>
<p>But the reason you want the capacitor in the first place is so that you can dump a large amount of stored current all at once at a high voltage.  The voltage at the secondary coil determines the length of the sparks, but the current determines the thickness and brightness.  Without enough current to support ionization you'd get a high voltage but no sparks.</p>
<p>The resonance also greatly increases the efficiency, since the energy in the capacitor is completely emptied into the secondary coil.  This happens over a few hundred cycles as the direction of electricity flips back and forth.  Without the resonance the primary coil acts more like a short, and only a small amount of energy per cycle is extracted.</p>
<p>Each discharge of the capacitor causes hundreds or thousands of cycles of flow reversal in the secondary coil- all during a single spark.  You can see this on a high speed camera.  The spark goes through extremely rapid cycles of fast and slow growth corresponding to the resonance frequency (high kHz to MHz).  Meanwhile dozens (for spark gaps) or thousands (for SSTCs) of individual sparks are created each second.</p></div>		</li>
