			<div class="markdown"><p>made a throwaway to post this because it's kinda embarrasing :P</p>
<p>I wet the bed until I was 13. Yeah, I know, it's not exactly normal, but I'm waaaay over it now, so here goes. </p>
<p>The first thing we tried when I was about 7 was a machine that you put under your bedsheets with metal contacts, which would conduct and complete a circuit when wet. This would then trigger a LOUD buzzer, I would have to replace the sheets myself and go back to sleep. This worked for a while, I eventually stopped and was dry for 3 weeks straight. We removed the machine and went on our way. Except after about a month it started again, so we tried medicine.</p>
<p>The first medicine we tried was this stuff you dissolve under your tongue which stimulated production of the ADH you described, can't remember what it was called, but it sort of worked <strong>(EDIT: Remembered the name, Desmopressin. Looking it up it's a synthetic form of vasopressin, which is the ADH hormone, so it was effectively hormones to stop me producing urine.)</strong>, but it was intermittent and we eventually stopped using it because it gave me headaches in the mornings. Tasted pretty weird too.</p>
<p>We then used Oxybutinin Hydrochloride, which works by stopping the muscle spasms in the bladder that cause the feeling of needing to pee. From the very first night it worked perfectly, and within a few months when they ran out, I just sort of stopped wetting and never went back.</p>
<p>So there you go, an embarrasing story about someone who wet the bed until they were a teenager. Reddit, Everybody!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember that buzzer sheet! I think if we had used it consistently it would have worked, I remember a stretch of time where it did. Wet the bed until I was 13 or 14, I'm a girl.</p>
<p>Wish we had tried the other treatments you mentioned, I'm sad to say that as I got older my mom thought I was doing it on purpose. I was shamed a lot for it (rarely by her, she was a kind woman, although on this subject completely wrong), which was very frustrating because it wasn't a choice to wet the bed, I simply did not wake up when I had to urinate.</p>
<p>It took a long time but I know now there's nothing shameful about bedwetting. The only thing that's shameful is how my family handled it, accusing me of being too lazy to get up and pee. I remember my stepdad had a chat with me about how I should knock off the bedwetting, because &quot;don't you want to get married someday? No man wants to lay in his wife's piss.&quot; He talked to me like I <em>wanted</em> to wet the bed, when the reality was not much would have delighted me more than actually sleeping dry. </p>
<p>It all seems so ridiculous looking back on it more than 20 years later. Not one time out of the thousands of times I wet the bed was I awake and thinking &quot;fuck getting up I will just pee here.&quot;</p>
<p>I feel sorry for my younger self, and for anyone who had to go through this with nobody understanding how awful it can be. Waking up wet and cold and smelly is merely unpleasant. The real trauma is when other people bring the shame, be it family or other kids or whatever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter is 8 and struggles with bed wetting. I've been very adamant about explaining to her that it's in no way her fault, she has absolutely zero control over what her body does while she is asleep. It was really important to me that she knew we weren't mad at her or disappointed with her at all. I know it's helped at least a little with her embarrassment about it, but it was clear she was disappointed with herself anyway. </p>
<p>We tried many different things to stop the bed wetting: limiting fluids 2 hours (and even longer) before bed, waking up and taking her to the bathroom in the middle of the night (this was not the best plan because we would pick her up, sit her on the potty, she would pee, go back to sleep, and the next day she had ZERO recollection of it ever happening). I brought it up with our pediatrician a number of times and he insisted she would grow out of it. He did run some hormone tests, but they came back fine. We used pull-ups for the longest time because honestly it was easier on all of us. I felt like I was failing my kid by doing that, like I was doing her a disservice. It was an ongoing conversation with me asking her what she was comfortable doing and letting her know we were willing to keep trying things to get her through it. No judgement. </p>
<p>Here's what changed the game. We had a baby in August. Becoming a big sister has been such a positive experience for her. She came to me and said she was ready to be done with pull ups, partly because it bothered her that she still wore &quot;diapers&quot; like the new baby. And partly because she was just soooo over it. She suggested setting an alarm in the middle of the night so she could wake up and use the bathroom (we had tried this previously but she didn't do well with broken up sleep). It's been 3 months and she's had one accident and it was after a long day and she was sleeping way too hard to hear her alarm.  </p>
<p>I'm really sorry your parents treated you like that. I've explained to my girl that i <em>know</em> she would happily never wet the bed again if she could. It's just not always that easy. It's not her fault. And hearing how your parents handled it with you made me incredibly sad. I'm just rambling here, and I guess I don't have a point. It sucks you were treated that way, so maybe hearing that other parents do understand will be of some comfort to you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess most people wonder if they'll be good parents, but just knowing that I would never talk to a child like your stepdad talked to you make me relax. The not so relaxing angle though is how often you hear stories of adults talking to kids like this. Who the hell are these people?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same experience, female wetting til 14ish and being shamed for it. The whole don't you want to get married is familliar as well. I had some daytime incontenince as well until 10/11 and also severe social anxiety. It was a rough go but im 26 now and am well past it and my OH says he'd still snuggle me even if I started again :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a period of this too when I was about 12, I was usually half awake, dreaming that I woke up and went to the toilet, sat down to pee, and then I woke up in my bed when I started peeing. Usually I could actually stop it very fast and just go to the bathroom to finish.</p>
<p>Should mention I'm a heavy sleeper, I also have a history of dreaming that I'm getting up, putting on clothes and getting ready for the day, and then my mom comes in pissed as hell because I'm still sleeping, and I'm equally pissed because I have to do all that shit over again. It really feels very real.</p>
<p>Long time since I did that now, but last time wetting the bed in this fashion was actually only a year and a half ago, I'm 26.. I've always kind of wondered what makes me dream I'm actually starting my day though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a few years, maybe 5 or 6, (I'm 27, F), but previously it was at least once a year that I'd dream I'd be peeing in a toilet and wake up as I actually started, also was able to stop it quick enough to avoid actually wetting the bed but multiple times I did have to change my underwear. Dreams are weird, yo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't wetted my bed since I was a child, but last week I had my first almost instance; I'm in my early 30s, mind you. What happened was that I woke up in the middle of the night and actually had to pee, but I ignored it and fell back to sleep. Sure enough I got a dream about having to pee, going to the toilet and emptying my bladder in sweet release. This prompted my bladder in real life to release just a few drops, I jolted awake like nothing, clenched my muscles and hurried to the toilet. LOL</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm right there with you, dude. I just wore adult diapers until I was consistently dry. We tried little things like diet changes and such, but we really never had any luck. </p>
<p>Reading OP, I realized that I still to this day don't wake up to pee, no matter how bad I have to go I hold it until I wake up. It's almost like, rather than learning to recognizing the feeling in my sleep, my bladder got strong enough to hold it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the opposite.  I have hypertonic pelvic floor disorder and I always feel like my bladder is full,  even when it's empty,  so I can't trust my nerves to tell me the right information,  if I did I'd be sitting on the toilet all day,  so instead I closely monitor my fluid input and output and I set alarms on my phone and keep notes to know when I should pee. I've had a lot of issues where I've gone to pee, emptied my bladder,  but my bladder still feels full,  so if ignore the full feeling and decide to take a pee break in 1 hour,  then 30 minutes later I have an accident because I was ignoring a real full bladder.  The boy who cried wolf style. </p>
<p>The other problem is that during the night,  I'm producing ADH just like most adults,  so I don't need to pee,  but my bladder <em>feels</em> full,  and I do wake up from that. </p>
<p>So even though I've trained my awake mind to ignore my full bladder feeling,  I wake up constantly during the night to pee,  but my bladder is empty! </p>
<p>I don't know what's worse now,  reading your story and those above,  those experiences sound horrible,  I was lucky in that my issues developed after I was 16, I can't imagine learning to cope with puberty and bladder issues, I'm so sorry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an Non-Serial Killer American who wet the bed into his teens, this is very interesting and might have saved me some terror as a kid. My mom was of the opinion nothing should be done and I should still still do all normal kid things, i.e. sleepovers, month long summer camps, etc. I wish she'd tried a little behavioral training. Instead I just became very good had hiding the evidence and that notion that I must manage the truth of who I am around people continues in other forms to this day. </p>
<p>I think bed wetters have a particularly low or inactive version of the genes which reduce urine production while you're sleeping. Eventually I learned to just wake up every damn time, but it took forever. I still lack the reduced urine production and wake up to pee 3-6 times per night, but at least now I wake up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think that that's an overactive bladder, or maybe it's smaller or never fully developed.  I had asthma attacks from having premature lungs, so I would also assume something similar could happen with other organs.  Peeing 3-6 times a night must be horrible for your sleep schedule :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chiming in to throw out some real world experience for Elimination Communication. It fucking works. My 15 month old hasn't shit his diaper since 7 months old. 9 out of 10 pees are on a potty and not in a diaper. He just started walking over to the potty and sitting down on it all by himself. The amount of work it took to teach him this is miniscule compared to the amount of work it saves. If you have or are about to have a yound child, do some reading at godiaperfree.com</p>
<p>This is just my experience, but it's so much better than other parents that I have seen that I have to spread the word about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha. I wish I could talk more about it, but it really was just my girlfriend telling me what to do. We learned the baby sign language for pooping, peeing and diaper and showed those signs too baby whenever it was appropriate. Eventually he atarted to do the signs as he was doing that action and then doing the signs <em>before</em> the action. There was a lot of storytime while sitting on the potty. If I remember correctly, EC pros tell you not to reward a successful potty use but it's pretty hard not to. </p></div>		</li>
