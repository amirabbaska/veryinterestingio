			<div class="markdown"><p>So the <a href="http://www.cmmap.org/images/learn/climate/gyres.jpg" target="_blank">oceanic gyres</a>(currents) depend on density and temperature. You can see in this graphic there are red and blue arrows which represent temperature (less dense = higher temp, more dense = lower temp, they are correlated).</p>
<p>If we look at the South Atlantic gyre, you can see that water warms up as it travels down the South American coast, it cools near Antarctica and this cool water flows up the South-western coast of Africa. </p>
<p>As the cold waters travel, they tend to move upwards as they warm. They bring with them nutrients from the ocean floor which are essential for marine life. If you'll look at most cold currents, those are usually the productive regions of the ocean. So without this upwelling many marine ecosystems would die out. </p>
<p>The cycling of hot and cold currents creates a conveyer belt like I mentioned before, but I need to elaborate. The temperatures 'pull' on each other through diffusion, i.e. hot water pulls in cold water and cold water pulls the hot water, creating a constant cycle. </p>
<p>The ocean currents also play a huge role in maintaining the climate. El nino and La nina events are caused by changes in oceanic temperatures. So if these currents were to be disrupted, you could expect more severe events like that or absolutely nothing at all (no weather patterns) which is equally dangerous. </p>
<p>I think that covers most points. </p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>I mixed up the density and temperature correlation, it is correct now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These surface gyres are not the primary ocean currents that would be impacted by ice melt. Rather it's the thermohaline circulation. The gyres are primarily wind driven and are tied to the Coriolis effect. Thermohaline circulation includes cold, dense currents at the bottom of the ocean that generally flow in the opposite direction of the warm surface currents. Disrupting this &quot;global conveyor belt&quot; of heat and nutrients would have serious consequences. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favourite example is Gulf stream and Norway. Norway, despite of being a very northern country enjoys very mild winters - the average winter temperature is between -5C and -10C due to Gulf stream. Melting polar caps will eventually stop, or even reverse the Gulf stream, which will mean that Norway will experience winters that are common elsewhere for these lattitudes, meaning average temperatures of between -30C and -40C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it is considered now, contrary to what scientists thought for decades, that the mild temperatures in Europe are explained by a host of factors. The Gulf stream is one of them, but only has a relatively small role not a major one. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I attended a lecture by a climatologist in which he hypothesized a link between oceanic CO2 concentrations and ocean currents. His claim was that carbon concentrations were a major contributor to the Permian extinction, and that the mechanism by which that happened was organic current disruption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, strictly speaking it would be a matter of surviving the transition to another state of currents. Currents would shift, no doubt, but we really don't know how and where. It would be a nightmare, but would eventually stabilize. How pleasant would that new world be? Well that's a big question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering the water level was <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/gornitz_09/" target="_blank">120m lower during the last ice age</a> (20 000 years ago), when all that ice melted it must have had much, much more massive effects on the ocean currents than the current transformations? In fact averaging the melt rate between 20 000 and 10 000 years ago, the sea level rose 1,25 meters every 100 years, which is faster than the current rate of ocean melting caused by global warming.</p>
<p>This was also &quot;only&quot; 10 000 years ago, most species living today survived this, or did most species only evolve since the last ice age? Is there any reason to think it will be different now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water level in itself is not indicative enough, and since the melt happened relatively slowly, the currents probably shifted slowly. </p>
<p>But perhaps the effects would not be as great as scientific models predict.</p>
<p>Though you are correct in assuming that most animals did not in fact evolve within the last 10 000 years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The linked article states the water rose 28m in 500 years between 8700 and 8200 years ago. That is 56mm/year on average, which is <em>twenty times</em> the average speed since 1993 of 2.8mm/year. Do we expect global warming to accelerate to these levels over time?</p></div>		</li>
