			<div class="markdown"><p>Because medium is considered to be cooked to an internal temp of 155 - 160 degrees Fahrenheit (depending on who you ask).  This is the temp at which all the bacteria is killed.  Thus, it's considered safe.  </p>
<p>What I find most disturbing through out this thread is how little food safety knowledge the general public apparently has.  I've seen people who don't know the difference between trichinosis (a roundworm parasite) and a tapeworm (flat worm).  Or how sushi grade fish is prepared, or even whether farmed or wild is worse (hint, wild anything carries more risk than anything farmed, especially for parasites).  </p>
<p>And people are spouting these things as facts.  FFS; I've been a chef for 25 years now. Gone through multiple rounds of food handling, food management, Serv safe certifications, CP-FS...  You name it, I probably have it or have had it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't pasteurization dependent on both temperature and time? </p>
<p>The BC Centre for Disease Control (Canadian provincial government organization) published a document that has a chart of temperatures and times at temperatures to achieve pasteurization in (sous vide) cooking; at 130°F it takes 112 minutes to achieve pasteurization, while it only takes 22 seconds at 155°F. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pasteurization is all temp AND time. There are some non thermal pasteurizaton methods (Pascalizaton, pulse pressure, and microwave volumetric) though used in commercial pasteurization, such as dairy products. And there's pickling, canning, and curing that make and keep food safe via chemical treatment (salt and/or vinegar solutions) or pressure+high heat... These methods usually change the character of the foods though, such as pork belly to bacon. Or cucumber to pickles.</p>
<p>But for the animal products, temp and time pasteurization is the ticket in everyday cooking. You can eat basically raw chicken if it's been cooked at the right temperature/time ratio.</p>
<p>Cooking chicken sous vide, you can hold the meat's temp at 136f for ~70 minutes, and it's pasteurized. It's also instantly pasteurized upon internal temp reaching 165f. (According to USDA chart)</p>
<p>This is one reason why the home cook rules have always erred on the side of &quot;get it food safe&quot; as opposed to trying to educate on food safety. Because there is a such a dynamic range of temperatures and times, and not being able to account for how well temps are held by home equipment as well, cook overall ability, etc.</p>
<p>To my parents generation....The rule is 165f for chicken... Period. This also completely disregards the parts of the chicken.... Breasts don't need to get as hot as thighs. The rule for 145f pork was very recently changed, and you'd think I was serving my mother-in-law something still alive by her reaction to the color.</p>
<p>This is why every home cook needs thermometers. If you don't have them you're severely limiting your abilities.</p>
<p>I recently watched *Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat* on Netflix, after having loved the book. She cooks a chicken and pulls the &quot;juice color&quot; method to tell when the meat is done. I was so irritated because it's not hard to throw a probe in there and just wait until the thickest part of the breast hits 150f.</p></div>		</li>
