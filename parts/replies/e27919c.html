			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about &quot;originally&quot;, but what you're talking about is called <em>boustrophedon</em>.</p>
<p>I've also never heard of the idea that it was written this way because it's easier to read. That sounds suspiciously like folklore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boustrophedon yes. In greek &quot;Βουστροφηδόν&quot;, from &quot;Βους&quot; meaning ox, and &quot;στροφή&quot; meaning turn, because it resembles the way an ox moves when ploughing a field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a projectionist, I sometimes get confused while doing rear projection blending.  As in, I get done with dialing in the image after several hours and it takes a few seconds for my brain to recognize whether the text I am reading on screen is the correct way around or not because it all looks the same after a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't pretend to read upside down easily but with some patience it is fairly easy... Some characters like d and p may be confusing. I can't imagine thinking that others wouldn't be able to read it. I mean, a triangle still looks like a triangle whether the tip is pointing up or down, and it is the same for letters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. My mother still tells the story about how I once startled her by reading something from a newspaper across the table when I was young.</p>
<p>I very much take it for granted and have a hard time accepting that it's not a common ability. </p></div>		</li>
