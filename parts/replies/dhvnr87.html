<p>I have that problem where my gf and I will be totally looking forward to a show but if I happen to watch an episode before her she will lose all interest in the entire series no matter what... Some people just need to feel like they're the entertainers I think.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think part of the reason is the fact that she was looking forward to sharing it with you, and you went ahead without her. Now instead of associating the show with interest and curiosity she can't help but associate it with a sense of you watching it without her. Perhaps I can better explain with an example from my own experience:</p>
<p>A few years ago, me and 2-3 friends used to game online together in coop games all the time. Around Christmas we were all looking for the next game we could all play together. I then had a family vacation for 2-3 days around Christmas, but on Christmas Day I online gifted everyone in our group a brand new coop game that we all had been looking forward to playing together. In the gift email I excitedly mentioned how I was looking forward to playingâ€‹ it together with everyone. </p>
<p>I return home the following day to see all of them in the process of playing it together without me. They all started without me, and they had almost a dozen hours into it with just the three of them. They told me they would help me &quot;catch up&quot; to where they were in the game, but playing it with them at that point utterly ruined the game because they kept spoiling the surprises and I was always underleveled compared to the them. I'm sure I could have eventually caught up to them, but it totally turned me off from the game and I never wanted to play it again.</p>
<p>It wasn't that I was being purposefully spiteful, it's just that my entire emotion I subconsciously associated with the game was totally ruined by what happened. I had been really excited and looking forward to doing this thing with them and experiencing the game with them. I had this whole mental image of the fun we would have all struggling with the challenges of the game together. But by them playing the game without me, it shattered my idea of how things would go, and now the only emotion I felt myself associate with the game was a sense of betrayal. I bought the game for everyone to play together, and they couldn't even wait for me to start it.</p>
<p>I think your girlfriend was in a similar spot. She's not <em>intentionally</em> avoiding the show to spite you. It's just that whatever mild  curiosity she had towards the show has been overshadowed by a negative emotion by the sense that you watched it without her when she had been looking forward to sharing the first viewing experience with you.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it was a show you both agreed to watch together, then you watching the first episode yourself is lame. However, blacklisting it forever is stupid as fuck, and she should probably get over it and watch the first episode herself, then you two can continue on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is she probably feels a bit hurt that he watched it without her, and that feeling is a lot stronger than her slight interest in the show. So the prospect of watching the show right now gives her only slight interest, but a more substantial sense of sadness that her boyfriend watched it behind her back. It kind of ruins the entire emotion she associates with the show. </p>
<p>A fairly extreme analogy would be if you suffered some huge tragedy on what is normally a happy day. Like if your wife dies on Christmas. For the rest if your life you're not going to be smiling on Christmas, because the negative memory of the death far outweighs any positive emotion you have for the holiday. A much less extreme version of that is going on with OP's girlfriend and Westworld, her desire to watch the show was mild at best to begin with, and now it really only makes her think of how her boyfriend went behind her back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but it really isn't that big a deal if this is a one time thing. If he fucked up and admitted to fucking up, I say she should eventually watch the first episode and forget about it. If this is a common occurrence, they should probably talk about their feelings and rules they feel they have in regards to watching television.  </p></div>		</li>
