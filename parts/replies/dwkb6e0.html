			<div class="markdown"><p>Bonus: Ear popping is a real sound that's not just in your head! When your ears pop, your ear drums shake back and forth from the air rushing around them. It's a bit like the balloon springing back to its normal position. This movement of your ear drums actually <em>produces</em> sound waves. These sounds can come out of your ear and be heard by other people! A good way to make your ear pop is to swallow, as this tends to make those little tubes to open - this is why chewing gum on planes is good, as it gets you to make and swallow spit. </p>
<p>So if you put your ear against someone else's and they swallow you'll be able to hear their ears pop!</p></div>		</li>
