<p>Edit:</p>
<p>See You Later, Alligator‚Äù is a song written in 1954 by Bill Haley, from Bill Haley and his comets. ... The words are taken from a popular rock-and-roll song of the fifties. It was written by a Cajun from my area of Louisiana and made famous by the group, Bill Haley &amp; His Comets.</p></div>		</li>
