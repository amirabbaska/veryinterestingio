<p>But I do think great. I think the greatest. People come up to me all the time, tell me how great I think. Just the other day one of the world's greatest thinkers calls me up on the phone, he says to me,  &quot;Donald, how do you think so great? More people need to think great like you.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
