			<div class="markdown"><p>Well put. Your explanation made me further understand. </p>
<p>Whether that mass is in motion or not, determines what energy state it is in, I.e. Potential or kinetic </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I don't understand what you mean, but an object can have both potential and kinetic energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. As nuclear reactions happen in the sun, photons are produced which carry away energy and therefore mass. In turn, the sun's gravitational field at any given distance will be decreasing. </p></div>		</li>
