			<div class="markdown"><p>what prevents the matter that's inhabiting the spacetime from expanding at the same time and rate?
I'm assuming it's gravity but would everything just spontaneous explode outwards without this force?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You cannot move faster than the speed of light <em>through</em> spacetime, but spacetime itself can expand faster than the speed of light.</p>
<p>Think of ants walking on a rubber sheet. The ants have a maximum walking speed, but if you stretch the sheet fast then they can move away from each other much faster, and the farther away they are, the faster they move away from each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but gravity and electromagnetism tend to overcome the effect on a localized scale.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every point in the universe is expanding,  its just on such a minute scale that it doesnt really come into play untill you start talking about intergalactic scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All is expanding, but on micro-scale it's impossible to notice because there is very little &quot;space&quot; there to expand. The more space there is to expand, the more visible the effect.</p></div>		</li>
