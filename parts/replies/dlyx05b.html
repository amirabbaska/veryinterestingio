<p>The Widow’s Offering
41 Jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury. Many rich people threw in large amounts. 42 But a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins, worth only a few cents.</p>
<p>43 Calling his disciples to him, Jesus said, “Truly I tell you, this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others. 44 They all gave out of their wealth; but she, out of her poverty, put in everything—all she had to live on.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real disappointment here, unspoken, is that Jesus sees no <strong>practical</strong> problem with a poverty-stricken woman giving all her money away <em>as an offering.</em></p>
<p>He points out to his disciples, essentially, &quot;hey, look at that poor woman giving away all her money.  <em>That's</em> dedication, fellas.&quot;</p>
<p>And then proceeds to leave the building, saying &quot;but mark my words, this place is going to be a torn-down dump not long from now!&quot;</p>
<p>So, uh, Jesus.  Why not use your prescience to spare this woman giving away what little she has to a lost cause?  Because she could <em>definitely</em> use that money if it is--as you say--all she had to live on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean.. There are the parts where the disciples are told to give <strong>their</strong> money to support &quot;widows, orphans&quot; etc.. so it's a bit circular and needs to be taken as a whole</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying, but why would someone with no money who preaches a life of disdaining money care about a follower giving away all of her money? </p>
<p>(Also, upvoted because you make a good point.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree with the phrase meaning.  The parable isn't so much about percentages of totals, as it is about what's in your heart. </p>
<p>Personally, I heard it described once as the ante for a card game.  Like buying in, it lends a little weight to your words.  Given the nature of the English language, it's probably the mixture of a lot of things.  Idioms are cool!</p></div>		</li>
