<p>If there is any chance that a VIABLE human life is inside, you can guarantee that every firefighter on the scene would risk their life without question to save the person inside. </p>

<p>and that right there is why i have nothing but respect for firefighters, its the selflessness and courage in the face of danger. And they do it because its the right thing to do, not for glory or medals or accolades...big props to you guys</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks your insight. It makes sense after reading your comment, but I had no idea about the high level of judgment that goes into reading a scene (e.g., the car in the driveway. The kids' toys).</p>
<p>Is such judgment made by your scene commander alone  or is it a group discussion while en route and when you arrive? Said another way, how and when do you formulate your plan of action?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our incident plan starts at dispatch and our plan of &quot;attack&quot; starts there. Time of day is a huge factor as well. If we are called to a fire during school/business hours, there are no cars in the driveway, and we have to force our way into the structure, there is a high probability that the residence is empty. But dispatch info can help our insight as well. If a neighbor called and reported the fire then we can start to guess that either the residents are not home or were incapacitated enough to not be able to call 911. Technology is great these days though, and smoke detectors SERIOUSLY save lives. 99.9% of the time a small amount of smoke sets off a smoke detector and the entire family is outside safe and the first thing we hear upon arrival is that everyone is safe and accounted for. That's when our mind switches gears.... We take a deep breath and thank our lucky stars that you are ok. Then we try our very best to make sure all of your favorite things dont get ruined. Insurance will buy you a new house but pictures of great grandma can't be replaced and we don't what you to lose that. Red cross will help you tremendously after the fire but we really do try to leave as little damage as possible when we tromp through your house. And please don't get mad at us for talking a crew picture with your house in the back ground. We aren't trying to brag or make fun of what you are you are going through. We have trained our whole career to save your house and we are proud of our work. We don't get real deal fires as much as we used to and every chance to prove ourselves makes the job worth doing. We are proud and love being servants of the general public. We don't ask to be labeled as &quot;Heros&quot;, we are all just caring people who want to do our part to help anyone, anyplace, anytime.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a dispatcher  (police, not fire, but dad is a fireman), thank you for recognizing them as the start point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We risk a lot to save a lot. (Our lives for your lives, even if the risk is very high.)</p>
<p>We risk a little to save a little. (Our lives for your property, but only if the risk is very low.)</p>
