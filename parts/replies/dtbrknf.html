<p>Lapstrake predates carvel so it's a more ancient technique. I find it simpler in construction too, but that's just a builder's preference. </p>
<p>There are more measures that are less intuitive, such as remembering to install a stopwater, which is nothing more than a little dowel of a compatible wood that is driven in cross grain wise at the low point of that spine structure where you will have no access after planking - more or less around where the keel, hog, stern post, and stern knee meet. The point being that if water winds it's way behind the garboard rabbet deep in the structural joinery, it will hit the stop water which will expand perpendicular to the other pieces -as you put it in against the grain- and it will swell and prevent further channels from starting early stages of erosion and rot.</p>
<p>If we go back even more ancient to the Phoenicians, they started with reed boats made from bundles of woody grasses. I am no expert in their construction techniques, but I think their solution to keep water out of the hold was to layer the bundles thick enough that some would be saturated but the buoyancy physics would mean that at a certain thickness, the high part of the hull would be left dry until loaded with extreme weight. For more information there, I'd suggest reading about Thor Heyerdahl (sp?) 's KON TIKI where he tried to recreate one with the help of a boat builder from Chad in the fifties then tried to sail it across the Atlantic. I haven't read it yet but I'm aware of the adventure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kon Tiki was in the Pacific. If I recall correctly from having read his book over 30 years ago, Heyerdahl was trying to prove that Polynesians may have come from South America.  His raft was made of balsa wood, which is naturally buoyant. He may have had another project after that involving reed boats. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of this.  I had wooden Chesapeake Bay skiff growing up.  We'd haul it out over the winter to scrape it and repaint it in the spring.  Once it went back in, it would leak for a few days but after the boards swelled it was as tight as a drum.</p></div>		</li>
