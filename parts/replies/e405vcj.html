			<div class="markdown"><p>If you shed half you decrease your distance to the sun at closest approach by some number less than half. You'll be in an elliptical orbit so you'll just swing right back to the same plane as earth. To make your closest approach a permanent orbit you'll have to double the energy spent to counteract the speed gained from the free fall. The only way to actually fall into the sun is to get rid of all relative motion otherwise you'll fall towards the sun but always miss causing a slingshot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you go slowly enough, your closest point of approach will be below the surface of the sun... So you don't need to lose <strong>all</strong> relative motion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. You would end up in an elliptical orbit which reaches closer than the sun than your original orbit.</p>
<p>In order to arrive at the sun, you must cancel enough of your lateral velocity that your orbit intersects the sun's spherical surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is <em>so</em> much easier to escape the sun than to reach it, that the most efficient thing to do is to leave and come back. The most efficient thing to do would be to go to a far-out body like Sedna, then use a gravity assist to reduce your orbital velocity as much as possible.</p>
<p>Earth's orbital velocity is 30 km/s. So, at absolute <em>worst</em>, we need to load up a ship with 30km/s delta-v to reach the sun. For reference, if you teleported the Saturn V into orbit, you'd only get a delta-V of 18 km/s based on <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/3972/maximum-speed-reachable-by-saturn-v" target="_blank">this</a> stackexchange post. </p>
<p>If we use <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SqdzxzF.png" target="_blank">this</a> delta-V map (ideally we'd use a porkchop plot, but I can't find an online generator for them), we can get an estimate for how much velocity that would take.</p>
<p>Starting from a low-earth orbit, we add up all the line weights until we get to Neptune. This gives us a necessary delta-V of 8.6 km/s to reach Neptune. From there, we need to negate the 5.4 km/s orbital velocity that Neptune has. So, a total delta-V of around 14km/s, which is just slightly lower than the Saturn V.</p>
<p>So it would be possible, if we constructed a Saturn V in <em>orbit</em>.</p>
<p>The lowest-bound would be to go to <em>just below</em> escape velocity, then at your furthest point negate your orbital velocity. Using that delta-V map again, we'd need 8.75 km/s to escape the sun. If we go <em>just barely</em> below this speed, we could wait the (probably thousands of years) needed to reach the top of our orbit. Then we'd need a negligible thrust  to slow down before we began falling into the sun.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>Saturn V had 18 km/s of delta-V.</p>
<p>Delta-v requirements:</p>
<p>Earth Orbit --&gt; Sun: 30 km/s</p>
<p>Earth orbit --&gt; Neptune --&gt; Sun: 14 km/s</p>
<p>Earth orbit --&gt; Near-solar escape --&gt; Sun: 8.75 km/s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm not sure this explains why going OUT is easier than going IN.</p>
<p>i recall a few years ago we landed Philae on a lump of ice .. now that's much more of a 'point source' than the sun. why cant we make use of slingshots the same way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that it's a small target. We can do the math to arrive within meters of a point we want to hit, so in that respect hitting the sun would be trivial. The problem is that the trip itself would take an insane amount of fuel. You're basically required to stop orbiting in order to hit the sun, and our orbital velocity is quite fast. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>okay, so we have established that you have to get rid of all the lateral velocity to get into the sun. Now, If you want to get away from the sun instead, you have to add lateral velocity until you are going fast enough that you are no longer in an elliptical orbit but in a parabolic trajectory.  That necessary velocity is ~42 km/s  (Vesc = SQRT( 2GM/R) ). Whether it is is easier to hit the sun or leave the solar system entirely depends on our starting velocity. The lateral velocity of earth is ~30 km/s  ( it varieties somewhat because earth's orbit is elliptical), so any satellites we launch are going to have a starting velocity of around that value.  That means we need a change in velocity of around 12 km/s to escape or a change of around 30 km/s to hit the sun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, because that lump of ice had some velocity relative to the sun, so all we had to do is match that number, and we can land on it. Slingshots are only going to increase your speed relative to the sun, so it’s impossible to increase your speed to 0. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that: because nearly all stuff in the solar system originated in the same protoplanetary disk of gas and dust, it all orbits in approximatly the same plane, in the same direction, which helps tremendously.</p>
<p>A hypothetical comet in a plane perpendicular to earth's orbit would be uttererly unreachable (well, it would be reachable, but we wouldn't be able to match it's velocity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what if you make the elliptical so within a few thousand miles in width, that it would reach jupiter if sun was pointal gravity source, and then hits the sun because it's not?   Not talking close orbit to sun, talking one time boom 'reach the sun'.</p></div>		</li>
