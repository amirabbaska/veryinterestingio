			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. Say the material is absorbing 10% of the amplitude per oscillation, in our example a 20 Hz sine would only be 10% quieter on the other side because only one oscillation was affected. At 100 Hz, you'd have lost 50% of the amplitude, and you shouldn't be able to hear anything over 200 Hz at all, because the energy at those frequencies would be dissipated too quickly to make it across. 200 Hz is on the top end of what's still considered &quot;bass,&quot; so you can see how it'd be difficult for sounds toward the top end of the audible range to make it through much of anything, no matter how little it damped the signal. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's additive, not multiplicative? I'd have expected 2 oscillations to reduce the sound by 19%. 10% of the original 100% strength on the first oscillation, and then 10% of the remaining strength, 90%, on the second oscillation. Is that not what happens? </p></div>		</li>
