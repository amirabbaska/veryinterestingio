<p>I never had anyone question me when I said &quot;and I'll need your password&quot; they just gave it over freely. It's against company policy, and no one gives a shit.</p>

<p>I run a service and I really have to work hard to <em>stop</em> users giving me their passwords. I'll routinely get emails where they try to tell me their username and password. I don't need their passwords: I've already got root on the box they're logging into. I used to be more-militant about it, and if anybody told me their password I'd invalidate it, add it to the password exclusion list, and force them to pick another, in the hope that they'd learn that they should never tell <em>anybody</em> their password for the service I run, not even us. But it didn't help much, and people still did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's completely understandable why people would give out passwords though. How many times do you give out &quot;personal info&quot; on a daily basis. I probably tell 3 strangers a week my social security number or I can't pay my trash bill, or buy a fucking drink at the commissary because their ID scanner is broke, or want a gym membership. Asking me for my gov't/work password means nothing when we are desensitized to giving out even more personal info on a daily basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had IT ask me more than once for my password and I flat out refused. If you have authority over my account, you don't need my password. They did, so they'd reset it and do what they needed, then let me change it again when they were done. Then again, I'm a competent dev.</p></div>		</li>
