			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, wow. I mean, I knew the human body was disgusting in its beautiful self-contained efficiency, but knowing that we produce lil guys that eat our dead cell-debris for us is a whole new (microscopic) level.</p>
<p>I feel like I can write at LEAST a trilogy of horror movies based on evil scientists who alter our natural macrophages to start eating us from the inside out!</p>
<p>Now that I think about it--that's already a real bacteria that exists, isn't it? Dang.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fluid build-up causes the swelling and dilatation of blood vessels that leads to higher blood flow causes the redness.</p>
<p>Basically the skin is inflamed. Inflammation is defined by:
Rubor - redness caused by vasodilatation.
Dolor - pain, caused by different pain pathways consisting of signalling molecules, mechanical pain receptors etc.
Tumor - swelling, caused by the extra leakage of fluid into the sourranding cellular matrix as Karnman wrote.
Calor - heat, also caused by vasodilatation and higher blood-flow.</p>
<p>Sometimes you add functio laesa which translates to loss of function and function depends on tissue-type </p></div>		</li>
