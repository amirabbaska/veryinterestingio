			<div class="markdown"><p>It was a very leading question I guess. But it is just because I am bad at phrasing things in a non biased way when I have an opinion. I did do some research and found out that there is two major drivers that keep it from popping.</p>
<p>1) Its government backed which is basically like saying the whole nation has to be in an economic down spin for it to collapse.</p>
<p>2) You cant just not pay or default by going bankrupt. The only way out is to die.</p></div>		</li>

<p>7 million college debtors have yet to make a single student loan payment in last year. The college debt bubble grows.

<p>Yes. But it doesnt seem like a likely situation.

<p>25 years seems like the shortest time to be forgiven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think these defaults are leading to new payment structuring though correct? Since the loans are government backed they're not calling in on their debts, just allowing the people to pay less, but still pay.</p>
<p>They're not forcing them into bankruptcy, so there is no &quot;bubble&quot;.  The government just isn't collecting on money owed.</p></div>		</li>
