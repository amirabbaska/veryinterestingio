			<div class="markdown"><p>You've basically described <em>[sous vide] (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sousvide/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/sousvide/</a>)</em> cooking, which has been used by commercial caterers for years but is becoming more popular for home cooking. If you can control the temperature precisely, your steak can be as rare or well-done as you like, while being less time-critical i.e. you don't have to time it to the second. Such a steak still needs to be seared, of course: no sizzle, no steak! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a sous vide waterbath at home, and the things that come out of it are truly spectacular. I've never had a better steak. I really recommend trying it. Just sear it with a blowtorch afterwards. Honestly, it's amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly.  Sous vide is an excellent example of cooking without a temperature gradient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why doesn't the inside of the steak take a proportional amount of time to heat up based on the heat on the bottom? Why doesn't the middle of the steak just heat up uber-slow on low heat and produce the same effect of if you used high heat for a shorter time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The low heat prevents burning the outside and allows the long cooking times needed to get it evenly heated. There's also less heat being put into the steak for a given amount of time so there isn't as much of a temperature gradient to begin with. Once the outside reaches the highest temperature it can go, more of the heat goes into cooking the inside and getting it up to the same temp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>barbarian! obviously you live in a country where you wouldn't know a good piece of beef to save your life. a good steak should always be grilled black and bleu or raw at the most. anything more is either for plebes or you have a poor cut of beef.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly, I do live in a country where they don't know a good piece of beef if it slapped them in the face.  But this in and of itself bears no reflection on my understanding of quality beef.  This is where you out yourself as an overcompensating hipster who flops to the opposite extreme, beyond any measure of good sense, and in a weak attempt to distinguish yourself as having the mildest streak of originality or culture.</p>
<p>The only correct way to cook a steak has always been, and shall always be, medium rare.</p></div>		</li>
