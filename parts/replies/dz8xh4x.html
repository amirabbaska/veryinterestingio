			<div class="markdown"><p>I had several friends ~10-15 years ago who worked for Google modeling buildings in my area. If I recall they used sketch up back in the day. Their teams each had specific areas, modeled the buildings, then moved on to the next area. It was pretty cool and the software may be outdated or not used anymore. </p></div>		</li>
