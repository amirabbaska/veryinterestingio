<p>Also if you had 100 tons of a material w/ a half life of 100 years, after 1000 years you would still have nearly 1 ton of the original material, and also a bunch of other radioactive goop. </p>

<p>No you wouldn't, you have about 98 kg of the material (100/2^10 ). But yes, potentially other radioactive daughters depending on their own half lives. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are 3 different (edit: common) radioactive decays, the above is alpha decay, where an alpha particle is ejected from the nucleus.</p>
<p>Beta decay and gamma decay are somewhat different, gamma is simply an extremely high frequency em wave caused by relaxation of an energetic electron, often following one of the other decay processes. </p>
<p>Beta decay is where a neutron spontaneously decays to several other particles, including a proton and an electron. But as to why it does so, you'll need a more knowledgeable physicist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The neutron decays to a proton, which is kept and changes the element, an electron which is ejected as a beta particle, and a neutrino which is also ejected. As far as I'm aware, the weak nuclear force enables this. As to why - most simply the new state is a lower energy than the old one, and thus more stable, which atoms will always prefer.</p></div>		</li>
