			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: No. You are correct in thinking that He-4 takes more energy when evaporating (roughly 3.5 times as much).  However, because of the missing neutron in He-3, the quantum properties change - and these matter quite a lot when playing around near absolute zero.</p>
<p>A He-3 refrigerator in itself can reach 0.2-0.3 K, and a dilution refrigerator using a mix of He-3 and He-4 gets to a few milliKelvin.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not silly at all. He-4 is often used to get to 4K, and you can pump on that to get lower (roughly 1.8K if memory serves). subr0utine was talking about using He-3 and He-4 together in a dilution refrigerator. These fridges rely on a phase separation that occurs in a mixture of the two isotopes below ~0.8K. These types of fridges can get down to the few milliKelvin range.</p>
<p>The wikipedia article on dilution fridges has some nice diagrams, and a photo of an open fridge. They look really neat since the lower stages are usually gold plated copper. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_refrigerator" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilution_refrigerator</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How expensive is HE3 compared to the generic mixture? I know that many lab isotopes can go for $200,000+/gram. Also, how easy would it be to separate them? I suspect that the high mass differential would help, unlike Uranium where the target and waste are within .4% of each other. </p></div>		</li>

<p>He3-D fusion also produces no stray neutron radiation and quite a lot of energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You still get some DD fusion in such a plasma. The neutron yield is lower than with DT or DD fusion, but it is not zero. You need He3-He3 fusion to get rid of neutrons completely.</p>
<p>We don't even have a DT fusion reactor delivering power to the grid. Helium fusion, if feasible at all, is much more challenging and far away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For a rough estimate of the difficulty, the repulsion between a Helium nucleus and a Hydrogen one is twice as big as the repulsion between two Hydrogen ones, and Helium-Helium repulsion doubles in strength again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of a long story, but helium-3 on Earth is made artificially. Thermonuclear bombs <a href="https://www.seeker.com/the-fallout-of-a-helium-3-crisis-1765179641.html" target="_blank">slowly accumulate it</a> as the tritium in them decays, and helium-3 was cheap during the Cold War. Tritium is made in nuclear reactors from fission of lithium-6, and is used in a bunch of things such as pacemaker batteries.</p>
<p>Helium-4 on Earth mostly comes from alpha decay of radioactive minerals in natural gas wells. It is a byproduct of the natural gas industry.</p>
<p>Helium-3 and helium-4 elsewhere in the universe were made in the Big Bang. Stars and gas giants have plenty of it, and vastly more gravity so they can retain most of it. This is continually re-gifted to the moon from the sun by solar wind; high-velocity hydrogen and helium slams into and embeds itself within exposed moonrocks.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>AFAIK, most reactor bred Tritium is produced by Deuterium capturing an extra neutron. This is one of the side effects of heavy-water reactors such as CANDU, it breeds a significant amount of tritium which needs to be dealt with. In nuclear weapons, on the other hand, it's produced as you say from the fission of Lithium 6 by fast neutrons (one of the reasons why the Castle Bravo detonation was 2.5x expected yield).</p>
<p>The &quot;Nuclear&quot; pacemakers you're referring to use were a brief thing back in the 70s, prior to the development of more modern lithium batteries. They were powered by miniature versions of the RTGs used on space probes, and were based around a small sample of Pu-238 and thermocouples. Aside from the (small) nuclear risk, should someone be cremated with one, Lithium based batteries gave the pacemakers a 10 year lifespan, and the medical industry realized that having people on a 10 year update cycle would give them the benefit of new technologies and the like.</p>
<p>The primary use for Tritium, other than in nuclear weapons (where it's a critical component of boosting the initial fission reaction), it's mostly used in specialty applications for permanently illuminated things like watch faces, gun sights, etc... In that case, it's sealed into tiny glass ampules which are coated with a phosphor, which is excited by the decay electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helium on earth is mostly alpha particles from radioactive decay, which doesn't produce any He-3. (It then gets trapped in some geologic formations, of the sort that also trap natural gas.)</p>
<p>Helium on the moon comes from the solar wind, which does include He-3. It impacts hard enough that some of it gets trapped just inside the surface of dust and rocks. In theory you could grind up lunar rocks, collect the minuscule amounts of gas that comes out, and refine He-3 from that. (If you're thinking that sounds like a big project with low yields, you're correct.)</p>
<p>The moon only has &quot;so much&quot; He-3 in comparison to our normal sources of helium. It doesn't actually have all that much by absolute standards.</p></div>		</li>
