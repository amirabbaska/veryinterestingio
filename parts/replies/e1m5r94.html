			<div class="markdown"><p>Why does it so often destroy color, while leaving the rest of the material intact? Destroying bonds willy-nilly would presumably turn a shirt into a pile of goop, so why does the shirt instead come out intact but white? Are the dye / pigment molecules just that much more delicate than cellulose?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chlorine bleach is a powerful oxidizing agent that turns carbon-carbon double bonds into carbon-oxygen bonds. Colored dyes contain Long Chains/stretches of Carbon-carbon double bonds exhibit a property called conjugation, which, simply put, allows for colors to reflected. By oxidizing these carbon-carbon double bonds, much of the conjugation effect is removed.
The molecules in the shirts material are not affected by chlorine as much as the molecules in the dye, so the cotton/wool/polyester is left intact</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bleach will eventually destroy whatever fabric it is used on. Ever had a shirt that got a couple of drops of bleach on it? over time those spots will become holes. You've seen it yourself, I'm sure.   </p>
<p>Bleach destroys molecular bonds. It's just that the ones in fabrics are less easily broken down than pigments. Additionally, bleach does not rinse out easily, it needs to be neutralized, or this molecular bond destruction continues unabated. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once learned this the hard way. Spilled some bleach on my bed covers, threw them in the washing machine thinking maybe it would stain but that would fix it. </p>
<p>When it came out, the fabric had the texture of wet tissue paper and fell apart in my hands. It just completely disintegrated, but only locally.</p></div>		</li>
