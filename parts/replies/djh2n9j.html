			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is right I don't think it answers what OP was asking. I think he wants to know a reason why since electrons and protons are opposite charges, the electrons don't get sucked into the nucleus like two magnets. Beyond the results of the schroedinger equation saying that the probability is almost zero, is there a force or phenomenon that causes this to be almost zero?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The total probability within the nucleus might be small, but the probability distribution is still densest there. <a href="http://www.chemistry.mcmaster.ca/esam/Chapter_3/section_2.html" target="_blank">See the graphs here.</a> The probability does not actually decrease as you move towards the very center of the nucleus.</p>
<p>This is partially a quantum mechanics question, because Heisenberg uncertainty means that the electron can't <em>only</em> be at the center (r=0), but it's also a geometry question, because the effect of volume increasing faster as radius increases makes it hard to notice that probability density is not also increasing with radius. In other words, it's not likely for the electron to be in the tiny volume of the nucleus, but it's even less likely for the electron to be in any other volume of the same size elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this a bad analogy: electrons are kind of like gas clouds that surround the nucleus? To concentrate an electron into one spot (i.e., next to the nucleus; aka high probability of location) would mean a high momentum (i.e., a high amount of energy)? </p>
<hr />
<p>On that link, on figure 3.6: it looks like the probability is highest when r=0? Or is there a little gap there right at r=0?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I understand correctly... since you can't know the position <em>and</em> the velocity, that means the more certain you are of the position, the more uncertain the velocity. And if you have the position nailed down to the very small volume of a nucleus, the velocity/energy must be really, really large. Do I have that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are important quantum aspects to it, but just because two particles are attracted to each other, it doesn't mean that they'll proceed to collide at some point.</p>
<p>If a positively-charged particle is pulling a negatively-charged particle in, that means that it's accelerating it. Something has to stop it, otherwise, the negatively-charged particle will shoot out the other side and keep going, this time slowing down until it stops, turns around, and falls back in. </p>
<p>This can go on indefinitely, unless some other force burns off the excess momentum. On subatomic scales, you can't talk about friction, like large objects colliding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that the uncertainty in momentum and in position are inversely related. Since the nucleus is extremely small if an electron was in the nucleus the uncertainty in position is extremely small. So small that the uncertainty in momentum gives us that the electron's speed could be extremely close to C. In fact it's energy would be over 10 MeV. This is signifigant because most B^- particles are between 100 KeV and  10 MeV though higher is not unheard of. What this means is an electron in the nucleus would have to have so much energy it would undergo electron capture almost instantly. EC being just the opposite of B^- . </p></div>		</li>

<p>The way I read it one time, to give an idea of the masses and scales involved, if the nucleus of a hydrogen atom were the size of a tennis ball, the electron would be like a grain of sand orbiting for the most part from several kilometers away.  This gives a pretty good idea of just how much the probability approaches zero to many decimal plates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When considering a single electron and a stationary nucleus, there's a probability density field everywhere in space which is densest at the center of the nucleus, and which gets smaller as you move further away.</p>
<p>The chances of an electron being a specific distance r away from the nucleus are given by chopping space up into a bunch of infinitesimal segments which together make up a spherical shell of radius r with infinitesimal thickness dr.  Each of the pieces making up this shell is then multiplied by the value of the probability density field at the location which that piece occupies.</p>
<p>Thankfully we can take advantage of the symmetry of the problem and realize that the value of the density field is constant over the entire shell.  All we have to do now is to multiply the area of our shell by the probability density field, to get the actual probability of our electron being a distance r away from the center.</p>
<p>The area of our shell goes as 4 π r^2 , which means that when we get arbitrarily close to the center the area of our shell goes to zero.</p>
<p>Here's an image depicting the first few solutions of the probability density as a function of radius.  We've so far only been talking about the first solution, so let's ignore the other two:  <a href="http://imgur.com/DpYXZdL" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/DpYXZdL</a></p>
<p>And one depicting the product of that probability density with 4 π r^2 , the area of our spherical shell, again we are only talking about the first graph: <a href="http://imgur.com/sqMbsky" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/sqMbsky</a></p>
<p>Note that even though the probablity density is highest at the center, the area of the shell causes the product to fall off to zero.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Electrons don't actually orbit the nucleus. They exist in complicated probability distributions called orbitals.</p>

<p>I've always been confused by this explanation.  If you found and recorded my location day after day at lunch time, you could eventually come up with a probability distribution describing where I might be.  But I'm not in the office, at arby's, and sitting on the couch enjoying a day off all at the same time.  I'm only actually in one location.  Why aren't electrons the same?  Doesn't our need for probability distributions only indicate that we don't know where the electron is in its orbit around the nucleus, and not that it's everywhere at once?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons have a wave-like behaviour in addition to being a particle, much like a photon. A wave has a certain size. Like yourself: your head is in front of your computer, but your feet are on the floor (a wild guess at your computer using behaviours). You might claim you're just in one spot but actually your head is in a whole different location than your feet, which are in a different location from any other part of your body. It's similar for an electron: it exists around the nucleus at multiple locations at the same time. If you look at it from afar it's at the atom like you're at your chair, but if you look closer it's all around the atom like you're simultaneously on top of, next to, and below your chair. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that make s a lot of sense.  In school they always taught us that electrons were particles, and that if you zoomed in far enough you'd find a little orb whizzing about around bigger orbs.  Sounds like that was an over-simplification.  It also raises questions about the nature of waves and how they differ from fields, but that's a question for a different thread...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The probability distribution of electron does not come from the fact that it moves and that we don't know where it is. It comes from the fact that the electron is a wave of probability itself. It doesn't have a defined position until you measure it: Its position is delocalized. In fact, in some circumstances, an electron can have a kinetic energy equal to zero, meaning that its speed is zero, but you can still measure it being at different positions from measure to measure. </p>
<p>We don't experience this behavior on a macroscopic level (thats why it feels so unreal) because the Planck constant is so small that we, as big bodies, always have wavelengths so small that we actually don't behave like wave of probability at all. But for small objects, such as electrons, this behavior is quite normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly because electrons aren't governed by the same laws of nature that you are. Electrons are both a particle and a wave and have to be described using quantum mechanics. I just had a class on quantum chemistry last semester and I'm still not completely sure why this is other than there's discrete energy levels corresponding to ground and excited states. I think it has something to do with the accuracy of the measurements, where the more certain you are of the particles velocity or location, the less certain you can be of the other value. Measuring an absolute value for one would mean absolute uncertainty in the other.</p>
<p>Someone else feel free to chime in and correct me if I'm wrong, im not totally sure about most of this</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, that's not really true. We don't <em>exactly</em> understand how classical and quantum mechanics are related, but there are good reasons to believe classical mechanics can be derived as an approximation for large, heavy things from QM. One simple way to see this is by taking the limit ħ -&gt; 0 in some QM equations. You'll see by doing this that the discrete energy levels merge to a 'classical' spectrum, also that the Heisenberg uncertainty relation will vanish.</p>
<p>If you want to know more, search for 'classical limit of quantum mechanics'.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The uncertainty principle isn't about knowledge (or measurement, for that matter), it's about how a quantum system is, fundamentally. A well localised electron cannot have a well defined momentum, irrespective of our knowledge or our attempts to measure it.</p></div>		</li>
