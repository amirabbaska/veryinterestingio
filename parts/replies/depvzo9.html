			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  He is right.  Mainly acidity is the issue.  Very rarely do we not drain them (brain and other risky places).  Then it takes 3 or more months of antibiotics...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use to do wound packings a lot for abscesses, the gauze is very important to make sure the wound heals from the bottom up as well. If the top heals over first the empty cavity is closed off, can't be cleaned properly, and becomes infected again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our current recommendations in ER literature is to not pack abscesses, as it hasn't been shown to aid in healing. If the abscess is thought to have a deep cavity and a narrow incision after drainage, sometimes a &quot;wick&quot; of gauze is placed in it to hold the incision open so it doesn't recur. It's different from traditional packing in that it isn't stuffed in there - so an abscess where a few years ago I would have placed say half a foot of packing in, I'll now just put 3-4cm with the end coming out the incision. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting! Thanks for the update. Do you guys have a specific preference for what type of incision you like to make? Last summer we had a labial abscess and the attendings got into an argument afterwards about what shape incision to make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Labial abscesses (assuming the lady parts, not the parts on your face haha) are complicated cause usually they are an infected Bartholin's cyst, which tend to recur. Technically they need a catheter sewn in, or OBGYN to perform a &quot;marsupialization&quot; where they're sewn in, to prevent recurrence. </p>
<p>Usually the incision is made lengthwise across the body of the absence. The direction of incision depends on the area of the body, with attention given to skin lines of tension to allow a cosmetically appealing scar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Abscesses are mostly bloody from venous ooze. You expect them to be a little oozy for a bit, but the bleeding stops because it's a low pressure environment. In the event an abscess is near an important vascular structure (e.g. Peritonsillar abscesses where you needle aspirate only, which lie adjacent to the internal carotid) you observe the patient afterwards to ensure the vessel is intact. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It stops on its own, saline flushes help flush it out and expose the vessels to clotting agents/tissue particles, it will ooze some as expected...  there are usually only really really small blood vessels around the capsule, no big arteries in the actual pus pockets...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To comment on the medicated gauze, I've had several abscesses drained and only once did they use the gauze. Abscesses fucking hurt, especially when they are an inch from your asshole. Curing and draining it fucking hurst and then shaving more shit back into it is 10x worse. Every time they've been drained they have been resolved and only ever returned a year or so later, despite not having any gauze in them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some people use it, some don't, seems like the overwhelmingly important thing is just to open it up, let it drain, and get oxygen in there. That seems to do the overwhelming majority of healing.</p>
<p>I've helped drain a number of them, they're always so painful for the patients even though we throw everything at them for pain relief. I'm so sorry you've had to go through it so many times.</p></div>		</li>
