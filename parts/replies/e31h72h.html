			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer while the physical therapists here are answering intelligently from the Simon's and travell myofascial trigger point school of thought many recent studies have called that school of thought into question. The real answer is more nuanced because the trigger point model has proven itself in some studies but other factors are also at play.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There is absolutely no clear scientific consensus on what a “knot” is, with some researchers questioning whether they even exist (as traditionally explained) and others questioning their relevance to the experience of pain altogether. </p>
<p>Might be irrelevant, but most of us who do hands on work have felt tissues”release” when we work on them. My feeling based on the research is this is more of an interaction with the nervous system. If the nervous system appraised some threat to an area, it rallies the troops to protect it. The troops are things like increased muscle tone, early sense of stretch, trigger happy danger signal nerves, pain, etc. </p>
<p>My approach in helping people manage their own symptoms is to chase what works. If massaging, foam rolling, lacrosse balling, etc helps you feel better in a lasting way, great! Do that and introduce some non-threatening movement, and you’re in the right track. The answer to how it works will hopefully come eventually. For now, chase lasting and timely results over fancy mechanical explanations. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What!? A chiro using evidence based approaches. Now I’ve seen everything.</p>
