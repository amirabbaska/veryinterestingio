			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean you could take a hormone to get darker skin instead of exposing yourself to UV?</p>
<p>Seems like that might make a good replacement for the cancer-pits of tanning salons, assuming no major health impact from the hormones occur. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's technically incorrect. The melanin compound is the same. The cells that produce it are different in the skin versus the eye. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up &quot;but why&quot; :</p>
<p>Why would there be 2 different types of melanocytes? </p>
<p>Would there be any drawback if eyes did produce more or less melanin based on exposure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would be the advantage? Typically mutations that are passed on are those that make an organism superior. Our eyes are such that no regulation of UV is needed. Your skin however is easily damaged. The perception might be that these cells were always reactive but eyes ceased to react at some point. It's much more likely that they weren't reactive (eyes or skin) and skin needed to protect itself and that mutation flourished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because blue and green eyes are an evolutionary advantage. They allow 'honest signaling' and are a marker of a sub-tribe that has other successful genes correlated in ancestry. And because people find them more attractive and they have a higher value as mates, allowing them to demand more resources and better partners.</p>
<p>Blue eyes evolved AFTER brown skin and became common because they are superior.</p></div>		</li>
