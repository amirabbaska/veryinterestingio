			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called COR-TEN steel (everybody just says &quot;corten&quot;).  Also called weathering steel, and I've heard it referred to as self-rusting steel as well.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I purchased steel by the thousand ton from mills all over the world for years.  We called it high strength instead of cor ten because it was a trademark and we were importing very very similar chemistry from mills in Korea, what is now the Czech Republic (several name changes in the last 40 odd years) and other places. So yeah it was essentially cor-ten but we avoided trade mark difficulties with a more generic name for the same stuff. I was doing this in the 70's. At that time there was a world shortage of steel due to lotsa construction going on, and we had to bring in stuff to meet chemistry and mechanical properties specifications, not necessarily brand name. Like generic drugs are the same molecule as the branded drug.</p></div>		</li>
