<p>Believe it or not, there was almost no security at airports until airlines and the federal government realized this. </p>
<p>In fact, the official position of most airlines before this was appeasement. Bring the hijackers wherever they want to go (read: Cuba), put everyone up in a hotel for a night, then go about your lives.</p>
<p>Then a hijacker in (I think) the early nineties threatened to crash the plane into a nuclear plant in Tennessee. It took this for the Fed to require airports to have security. It was then people realized the true danger of hijacking. </p>
<p>Of course, the airlines wanted the government to foot the bill for the security. That didn't happen until after 2001 and the advent of the TSA.</p>

<p>Other thing to remember is that train is much harder to hijack and control. A train can be really really long and have many passenger wagons. All it takes is one person to pull the emergency brake and the train stops. After that the doors open and everybody can run off. At most you are looking at a hostage situation in the middle of the forest. Pretty pointless hijacking unless hostage situation is the exact thing you want. For political reasons this could be an option.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On that note, it takes a lot more manpower to fully control a train. For the most part, all of the passengers in a plane are in the same &quot;room&quot; or perhaps a pair of closely-adjoined rooms. On a train, they can be spread out over a much larger area, and it therefore takes many more hijackers to keep the hostages under control.</p></div>		</li>
