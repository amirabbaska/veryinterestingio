			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to that, it's also a good impromptu pain management technique.</p>
<p>Pain itself has one of the highest priorities in the body, so competing pain somewhere else can be a great way to cut the original pain in half, if you do it right.</p>
<p>Me, I use my husband for that - he's got strong nails and a strong grip. When I'm dealing with intense, acute pain, he'll dig his nails into my arm until I tell him it &quot;balances out.&quot; Best way I've found, to date, to immediately provide a measure of relief for extreme, unexpected pain.</p>
<p>Other things, like pulling on my hair, rubbing my face, tugging eyelashes, biting my hand, tugging my ears really hard, and punching my thigh are also good ones, since you can generally make sure you don't cause injury while addressing the pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with med student poster above, Would like to add that pain fibers are slower than vibration and pressure fibers, which is why pressure or vibration reaches the spinal cord first and soothes - this is how TENS units can work - they utilize the pathway of vibration that literally wins the race against the pain to the sensory interpretation sites in the brain. See chiropractors are smart too :P </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only part of the truth, IIRC. The sensor  nerves for pressure/touching sensibility have direct inhibitory effects on the corresponding pain nerves for the dermatome in question in the spine. So holding your thumb on it's base inhibits the processing of the pain signal before it reaches the brain. Plus: As you need the other hand to hold your thumb you cannot hit it again while still in pain.</p></div>		</li>
