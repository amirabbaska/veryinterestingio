			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably the massive amounts of sodium in store bought soup as compared to homemade. When I'm looking for &quot;feel better&quot; soup, I actually prefer the dried package noodle soup that you reconstitute. It's got to have a week's worth of sodium content in it, which is why it tastes so damn delicious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh the problem with high sodium pre prepared food is that most of the sodium is preservatives other than salt that don't effect the flavor as much. Most of that sodium is non tasty chemicals, not salt.</p>
<p>If you make homemade soup you can make it just as or more salty while still having significantly less sodium. </p>
<p>If you like powdered soup more its probably something else besides chemicals only in there to make it last a century.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhhhh, what? What exactly do you mean that most of the sodium content is &quot;non tasty chemicals&quot; and not salt? Because sodium is sodium, and it is sodium ions that trigger the taste buds that give you the sensation of salty taste. It doesn't matter what that sodium bonded to before it dissolved and hit your tongue.</p>
<p>You sound like you really don't know what you're talking about and are just repeating something someone once told you about &quot;chemicals&quot; in your food.</p></div>		</li>
