If there's minimal water, you'll still be making contact with the slide in parts. The reason you slide on completely dry skin/slide is thanks to all your body's tiny hairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no, as the surface pressure is formed between the liquid particles itself, it doesn't get affected by the air. you can check a drop of water in the shutter, where there's no air, and it forms a (almost) spheric drop because of the surface pressure.</p></div>		</li>
