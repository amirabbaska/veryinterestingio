<p>One thing though on the point about the corporate cultures, I always thought that it would be empowering for the employees to know how much each other earn for the exact reason that you can then negotiate your wages with the managers if you're being severely underpaid compared to someone doing the same job as you?
Sort of like a union if you will. </p>
<p>Obviously, this would be a pain in this ass for the managers which is why they'd advise against it, but as u/Bullseye_Baugh mentioned above, in some places it would be completely illegal for them to fire you for discussing.</p>
<p>I'm guessing there's a bigger picture though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Opening up the books and showing everyone what all their peers make could end up costing the company WAY MORE money than just keeping it quiet. The net value the company gets from doing this could be on the negative side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly why it's taboo. Corporations don't want workers capable of seeing exactly how much the company is taking advantage of them, which leads to them firing people for spreading salary info, making people fearful of answering questions like that for fear of being let go.</p>
<p>Keeping workers in fear of losing their job ensures the corporations can fuck them as long as possible</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People don't always deserve the same pay. Two people doing the same job, can do so at different qualities. If the guy doing a less than stellar job finds out the other guy is making more, it will cause problems for no reason. He'll come up and ask to be paid the same as the other guy when he doesn't do the same quality of job. No you don't deserve to make the same when you turn in stuff with errors all the time or don't perform your job well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Openly sharing wage information also makes it easy for rival corporations to poach employee's; Several companies have gotten into trouble for anti-poaching agreements, ergo we now have the unwritten agreement that despite the Law employee's should not share their wage or salary information.  </p>
<p>Also, if you meet someone who is &quot;busting their tail&quot; to do an awesome job and that person shares their wage; They are in fact applying for a better or higher paying job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are plenty of websites providing anonymous data about salaries in each field or even company, so trying to hide these facts it's just amusing</p>
<p>i mean i know why you could hesitate to share your salary with coworker, but with someone from completely different company? it's helpful for both of you especially if it's same field to discuss these things when switching jobs</p>
<p>for instance in Austria each full time job offer must show also minimum salary (often the real salary won't be far from it) so anyway you pretty much know how much one earn if you know their position, so i still don't get it why it's rude to ask about salary, but not about position or even company, because i can figure your salary already from these data</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're missing an important point here though. </p>
<p>Anonymous data about salaries isn't the same at all as PERSONAL data about an INDIVIDUAL salary. One's industry data, the other is personal data. </p>
<p>In professional fields with decent pay, there are lots of cases where people are well outside the guidance these averaging sites provide. I know, I've seen many actual salaries and these sites are not always representative, and sometimes not even close.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And in some corporate cultures, it can be a bad thing if other people learn how much you make, particularly if what you make is more than your co-workers. A number of years ago, a financial-team coworker found an IT team's paystub and absolutely freaked out that the difference in salaries was so high, and it caused a real shit-storm.</p>

<p>In the US, despite there being this taboo about discussing salaries, <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/sites/default/files/attachments/basic-page/node-3788/employee_rights_fnl.pdf" target="_blank">it is actually illegal for your employer to prevent you from discussing your salary with coworkers</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Under the NLRA, you have the right to … [d]iscuss your wages and benefits and other terms and conditions of employment … with your co-workers</p>
