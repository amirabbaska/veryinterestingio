			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I mean I know this is ELI5, but I feel like someone should have at least made reference to the fact that the % numbers OP is asking about come from an equation that calculates the exact balance of matter/dark matter/dark energy required to match the expansion we observe.</p>
<p>Also, it's cool that we have an equation that describes the expansion of the entire universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I didn't see anybody mention the Friedmann Equations yet. That's where the numbers really come from.</p>

<p>Seriously, thank you. The top-rated comment here doesn't even answer the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question. You seem well-educated, and you don't have 300+ comments to answer in your inbox, so I'm asking you. </p>
<p>Do we have a way to measure how much of the earth's mass is attributable to dark matter? Surely it's all around us right now. Could there be a pocket of dark matter inside the earth right now? </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's probably virtually no dark matter in Earth (even assuming &quot;cold dark matter&quot; which is the popular hypothesis), because it doesn't interact electromagnetically. It will generally interact through gravity, which is an extremely weak force, and earth just doesn't have that big of a gravity well. </p>
<p>Any dark matter we plow through will have its orbit changed a little as it goes through us. There's nothing to &quot;stop&quot; it and make it stay in the Earth. </p>
<p>And even then, we have not been able to detect any dark matter going through us. Many research teams have been running experiments and we're yet to have a detection. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was curious so I tried to calculate it to an order of magnitude. Using a density of rho=0.01M_sun /pc^3 and an earth volume of 1*10^(-29) pc^3 (arxiv and Wolfram alpha respectively), the amount of dark matter inside earth is about 1*10^(-31)M_sun, which is roughly 200 grams.</p>
<p>So, very conservatively, I estimate there is between 10 grams and 10 kilograms of dark matter within Earth. Neat stuff. </p></div>		</li>
