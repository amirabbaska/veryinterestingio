<blockquote>
<p>Aspergillosis.</p>

<p>I just looked up the meaning of this, can you please tell me how using bud could lead to this ?</p>
<p>I assume that it means that if you're touching moldy bud, that you could inhale spores ? This would be a long-shot unless one was deeply involved in production or distribution.</p>
<p>I doubt that smoking moldy bud would be a cause of ingestion as it would be burnt in the process, surely ?</p>
<p>Cheers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that we don't know.  It's probably just from handling moldy bud, but we don't know if the hardy fungal spores can survive being burned.  You don't need much to set up an infection.</p>
<p>Of note, this is exceedingly rare in people with normally functioning immune systems and structurally intact lungs.</p></div>		</li>
