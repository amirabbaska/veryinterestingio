			<div class="markdown"><p>My town has the Paper Mill. It almost went under some years ago but a very wealthy member of the community who left long ago returned to save the mill and also open up a very nice hotel to try and attract tourists.</p>
<p>The town would have 100% died without the mill. It stinks, it bellows smoke into the air, its extremely dangerous for the workers, etc, but its all that keeps our town alive.</p>
<p>We have no cell phone towers (you have to bounce off canadian towers which is $1 a minute or so) no internet, no product other than our paper, no walmarts or shopping. Only small craftsman stores, 1 mcdonalds, 2 bars, and a shop'n'save which is like a tiny version of target.</p>
<p>The winter is so long that you can't really farm for food etc. Without the mill nature would probably reclaim the land within a hundred years.</p>
<p>Scary to think about, its a charming place to visit and the people are the best.</p>
<p>Other than the mill, people pretty much do everything they can for themselves. Knit clothes, chop firewood, repair things, minimize reliance on outside help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This scenario - without the wealthy savior - has claimed thousands of small towns across America.  It's great that yours has been given a second chance.  Small towns are having a really rough go of things, thanks to globalization (i.e. cheap imports) and lately, the opioid epidemic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone works in a bigger town away from them. Used to live in a town of about 1300 people. The cost of living is a bit more than in a city, but the average property value is crazy low. </p></div>		</li>

By the time you get back home, you've spent like 1/10th of it already! And some people live even further. its like spending more fuel to get fuel. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you not have to drive your car to a gas station?? Sure, the distance varies, but if you have to drive a decent distance for gas, you're probably spending less on other expenses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but it’s not like you leave home just to get gas and then drive straight back home again. You get gas on the way to/from a destination be it work, grocery store of friend’s house. </p>
<p>Source: good friend of mine lived in a town of 150 in rural North Dakota. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of small towns will have at least one gas station, the price of fuel was just A lot higher. A town without a small station won't be any farther than like 30 km away from a town that has gas. </p></div>		</li>
