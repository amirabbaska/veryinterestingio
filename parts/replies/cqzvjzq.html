			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember asking on /r/linguistics or a similar sub years ago why some languages sound &quot;faster&quot; to my ear, and was directed to all sorts of research on language density and language speed. <a href="http://www.adn.com/article/language-study-japanese-spanish-fastest-spoken-tongues" target="_blank">Here's a little article for example</a> that points out that languages have a spread of densities - basically how much information is expressed per syllable, and it's typically inversely related to the speed at which the language is spoken. Vietnamese is the most dense common language (English is up towards the top), while Japanese and Spanish score fairly low densities. But, in a syllable/second ranking Japanese and Spanish come in towards the top, and for the most part the ability to transmit information runs at a similar speed across all languages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this not mean that unless those Japanese and Spanish speakers read their languages faster, English transmits information faster in text form? Or are they moving through words faster because the language is less dense? Still seems like not all of these languages were created equal as the product of density and speed wasn't strictly equal either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The factors that would determine that in text are very different from speech. You'd have to consider things like the &quot;efficiency&quot; of spelling or writing systems. For example, in Chinese each syllable is written as one character, and words are therefore one or two characters. So you can say a lot more in, say, a Chinese tweet than an English one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you define &quot;faster in text&quot;? Japanese uses chinese characters, which make possible to read a word or phrase much faster than in english (i.e: The amount of symbols one has to see in order know what is written is larger in English)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The determining factor in reading rate (assuming basic proficiency) generally isn't the number of symbols you need to interpret, but the complexity of what those symbols describe. We can visually process characters very quickly, and so the efficiency of character use is not a major factor in reading rate across languages.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now that you mention it, I can't think of a correct one word translation of 'mujhe'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Mujhe&quot; is the first person singular in the dative case. I'm not sure how cases are done in Hindi, but in Marathi, we would refer to the equivalent (<em>&quot;mala&quot;</em>) as &quot;chaturthi&quot;; the dative case.</p>
<p>An equivalent in a European language would be &quot;mir&quot; in German.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your Sanskrit example works exactly like Spanish &quot;me gusta&quot; or German &quot;mir is kalt&quot; with a dative subject marking the experiencer. An experiencer is an argument of a verb that doesn't actually <em>do</em> or <em>undergo</em> anything, but only <em>senses</em> or <em>feels</em>, for instance the subjects of &quot;I see&quot;, &quot;I know&quot;, &quot;I love&quot;, etc. Some languages like Engliwlsh mark those like any subject, other like Dravidian languages (and I think Sanskrit too, but I know it less) have a special way go mark them with the same form as the recipient of a verb (&quot;You give <em>me</em>&quot;, &quot;you tell me&quot;,...) and are more consistent about it than Spanish or German.</p>
<p>It looks weird if you try to give them a naive word-for-word translation, &quot;to me it pleases&quot;, &quot;to me is the cold&quot;, &quot;to me is the knowledge&quot;... but then that's not an argument for the language being weird, it's an argument showing that word-for-word translation is fundamentally flawed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And that the speakers of other languages they're holding as examples were educated in English in former English colonies, so they were taught math and science terminology in English rather than their home languages.</p>

<p>As a physicist and a non-native English speaker: This is due to the use of English textbooks, and that most international journals are written in English. There is nothing in English itself which makes it more suited to maths/physics etc., even if this language has acquired a lot of speciality words which are missing in my native language, making it harder to discuss some topics in my field without switching to English.</p>
<p>If I go back in time to before WW2, the journals are mostly written in German. The shift from German to English had nothing to do with the languages themselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a fairly common misconception. You'll get closer to the truth if you say that most people published in one of a few &quot;big&quot; languages and most articles were translated into all of them. Mostly English, French, German and, to a somewhat lesser extent, Russian and Latin. Therefore, most of the scientists of the time were able to publish in their native tongue, but would at least understand the others or be able to get ahold of a translation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be true overall, but at least in my field(s) - particle accelerators, especially high gradient linacs, and a side of radiation detection devices - old stuff tends to be published in German or English. At least, that is what is usually referenced...</p>
<p>Also, I'm not so sure about the translation bit - I've read a lot of old big articles in German (which were not available in English), and I've cursed my inability to comprehend Russian more than once (quite a lot of microwave, vacuum arc, plasma and accelerator research took place in the USSR after WW2).</p>
<p>A funny side-note: Some of the first work on particle accelerators was done by Rolf Widerøe (his brother founded the Widerøe airline, in case you have heard the name before), who happens to be a native speaker of the same language as I am. You can clearly see Norwegian phrases shining through his German writing :)</p></div>		</li>
