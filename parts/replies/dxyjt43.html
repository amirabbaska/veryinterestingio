			<div class="markdown"><p>Please don’t misunderstand. It is a business, yes, but maybe I presented too much of a one-sided argument. </p>
<p>Putting on shows (especially for independent promoter, like myself) is an extremely volatile and risky way to make money and it’s a volume game. I run the largest independent concert promotion company in my state, and we do roughly 10m in annual revenue. We have an office staff of 11 people and only in the past couple years have we been able to sustain the kind of volume of shows to have what I would consider healthy cash flows and labor stability. I would put my life time average of shows that lost money at roughly 30%. And you can lose a little or lot of money on shows depending on a million different things, many of which may be out of your control (read: bad weather, artist sickness, bus breaks down, artist goes to jail, etc). Due to the way that artist deals are often structured, they share a great deal in the profits of a good show, but do not share in the losses of a poor one. So when I lose, I can potentially lose BIG, and when I win I usually win modestly. If I don’t squeeze every drop out of a winner, I will soon go out of business, because I need a couple modest wins to cancel out a monstrous loss and still have some money for the trouble.</p>
<p>We’re not monsters, but we are here to make money and keep our businesses above water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have their own expenses that I don’t share in as well. But where my risk is wildly variable there’s is semi-fixed. They pay for things like: tour buses, touring production, touring crews, backline (usually), gas (which is a sizable expense for even a single tour bus).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only if you fault anyone for wanting to make money.  Aren't you yourself motivated to make more money? Wouldn't you like to if you could?  I don't think the problem is so much that the truth bears cynicism, but that the judgmental are idealists, who are by their very nature highly impractical.  Today's world thrives on practicality. </p></div>		</li>
