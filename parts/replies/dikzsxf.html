			<div class="markdown"><p>Very much so, maybe I should have put that. But an important thing to note is that these approaches aren't mutually exclusive, and whilst some partisans of these approaches may claim that their approach solves almost all of personality, the reality is closer to these all being parts of a puzzle, each holding truths within themselves as part of a bigger picture</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was this case where a man developed some sort growth in his head that ultimately resulted in his brain being smushed up against the inside of his skull. If I remember right, as a result of his condition, his brain was only 1/10th the size of a regular brain.</p>
<p>Now, as far as I remember, this man with 1/10th a brain had no problems functioning, although he had an IQ of around 75 (so not legally retarded). He had a wife, kids, and worked a full time job. He didn't even know something was wrong until he had the brainscan. </p>
<p>Now, the reason for this story is that as a result of his brain being smushed, he didn't have the part of the brain that current popular science attributes to consciousness, and yet, he was conscious, and living, and working, and raising kids.</p>
<p>We don't know shit about the brain, or personality, or even consciousness.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so important. I can't stand when people chose one and defend it as if it's the ONLY possible explanation. It's very rudimentary. Reminds me of the &quot;nature vs. nurture&quot; argument. Or hell, almost any theoretical construct in psychology (e.g. diathesis-stress model vs biopsychosocial model, mechanistic vs organismic developmental theories, etc.) </p></div>		</li>

<p>Tailing on this, is there any reason why we wouldn't think that <em>all</em> of these factors, from conditioning to hereditary would play a part in the greater puzzle?  Forgive me for being obtuse, but to a lay person like me I don't understand why it is a case of 'either/or'?  </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for elaborating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tenured professor who specializes in personality, among other things.</p>
<p>I wish people wouldn't cite Funder on this sort of stuff. I have nothing against Funder, he's contributed a lot to the field, but things like Funder (2001) and his book have this &quot;everybody has won and everybody gets prizes&quot; mentality. It's also extremely dated in its perspective, like by a few decades at least, and gives a misleading perspective on personality and individual differences psychology. Separating things into the &quot;behaviorist perspective&quot; and &quot;psychodynamic perspective&quot; is just not something that is done in personality science anymore, and hasn't for a long time. It's like asking &quot;how do we define a species&quot; and then (aside from accepting &quot;species&quot; as a valid concept) going on and on about Linneaus's methods as if that's how modern phylogenetics is done. </p>
<p>That said, your general sentiment is correct: we don't really know, and what we do know won't fit into a reddit response. You could write a book on the topic. We do know it involves genetic as well as environmental factors, but exactly how is unclear. Attempts to find specific genetic as well as environmental factors controlling for the other has been difficult. Part of the problem is effects change over time: the emotional trauma you experience in childhood might impact you a lot at the time, and might have long effects, but it won't last forever if the circumstances surrounding it change. It might lead to a self-perpetuating chain of events, though. We just don't know. There's so much randomness in life and so much that's idiosyncratic to a person. Another problem is that people tend to make their environments (but only to an extent). It's all full of dynamic mutually causative processes that are difficult to disentangle. We also have difficulty measuring personality, and measuring the environment, and measuring outcomes, so that adds to things. There's lots of opportunity in the area. </p>
<p>My point in writing, though, was that to some extent there seems to be an assumption in the question that might not be accurate. Personality isn't really &quot;formed&quot; in the sense that there's some endpoint. Personality continues to change through life--not completely, but there is change. A better way of approaching the question is &quot;what causes personality&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice to hear from you! Yeah most of the evidence is a bit dated, but there's only so much that you can include in a reddit answer, and funders (2001) paper seemed to be a good round up, plus what I know on the subject is just from a signal 10 credit module. It's nice to hear the perspective of an expert on the subject who can explain it better than me :)</p>
<p>Also, on the processes of change I'm only vaguely familiar. Studies such as Soto et al.(2011) and Harris et al. (2016), come to mind, but those come with their own problems. Thanks for the info :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So would saying that personality as we current interpret it is an inherited trait. That is molded by its interactions with its environment and the subsequental response to the stimuli. Also both the environment and the response may be that of a physical or mental nature. </p>
<p>The impact of a stimuli, frequency of its occurrence, and/or its co-occurrence with other stimuli would also play a role on personality. But defining the actual personality would be impossible since they are fluid in nature and ever changing. So at best we could only describe a persons personality in relation to a chosen stimulus/i ,but even then that is ineffective as the relationship may change at any point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good stuff. I would add that the genetic vs environment effects has a lot more recent and solid results that you suggest. For example, the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart (MiSTRA) ran for almost 20 years with 170 studies coming out of it. A fantastic summary of their findings is in Dr. Nancy Segal's book, <a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674055469" target="_blank">Born Together, Raised Apart</a>. Dr. Segal also currently Professor of Psychology and Director of the Twin Studies Center, at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), which she founded in 1991, with over 120 publications on the topic. </p>
<p>While these studies cover many components of human psychology, personality is certainly one (or rather many) of them. The key power of such studies is their richness in being able to separate variables. Identical twins (monozygotic, MZ) share 100% of the same source genes. Fraternal twins (dizygotic, DZ) share 50% of the same source genes (on average), unrelated people of the same age (peers) share 0% of the same source genes. If you take them in pairs raised together and apart, you get 6 categories. Raised together means two people the same age raised in the same general systematic environment (short of everyday random differences). Raised apart means they have different environments, on average. (The degree of difference is an interesting topic, but it isn't of primary relevance for primary conclusions, as you'll see.)</p>
<p>MZ twins raised together are common. MZ twins raised apart happen from adoption and occasionally from being switched at birth. For an interesting layman story to understand personality and psychology of this sort of thing, I recommend the NY Times article, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/magazine/the-mixed-up-brothers-of-bogota.html?mcubz=1&amp;_r=0" target="_blank">The Mixed-Up Brothers of Bogota</a>. It mentions the science, but the story itself can give you a representative result of what is similar or different due to genes or environment.</p>
<p>DZ twins raised together are common too, and raised apart are adoptions and switched at birth, which are rarer. Unrelated people raised together are generally adoptees of the same age (within a few months, adopted while a newborn). Unrelated people raised apart are common, called peers, but must be compared within similar age range.</p>
<p>That gives 6 categories. What's interesting is that when you give them a battery of tests across psychology, behaviour, personality, habits, hobbies, and so on, a pattern emerges. To a rough approximation, what you get is the following scenario. Imagine that you have 6 rooms corresponding to pairs of people of these 6 categories. You get the results back from the above tests of similarity. You notice 3 groupings. Two of the groups have the pair highly correlated at about the same correlation. Two of the groups have medium correlation at about the same correlation. Two of the groups show no correlation. The first two are MZ twins raised together and apart. That is, identical twins raised apart are about as similar as identical twins raised together. The second two groups at about half the correlation are DZ (fraternal) twins. Again, you can't tell which ones were raised together or apart. The third two groups are unrelated, and again you can't really tell which is which based on these tests. (Of course you can tell by asking them specific knowledge and events that people together would share.)</p>
<p>Now MZ twins are not <em>identical</em> in all of these traits. For simplicity, they average about 50% of similarity across the variation of people. DZ twins are about 25% similar then, and unrelated are about 0% correlated. Now the actual correlation for a given trait will vary from these numbers. Some traits seem to have higher genetic components.</p>
<p>So what does this mean? Well, it suggests that about 50% of these traits (including personality) come from genes. Close to 0% comes from the <em>shared</em> environment, meaning household, parenting style, etc. That leaves the question about the remaining 50% or so. That would be from <em>unshared</em> environments, meaning things like random life occurrences, from random physical events in utero, to random events in life that have an effect on you, to random friends and sub-cultures you enter that differ from even your identical twin.</p>
<p>For some reason, many people don't like the idea that parenting style doesn't appear to have much of an effect, but the data looks pretty solid across decades and many independent studies across countries. And it makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that normalizing to peer groups, not parents, are more important, since that is where you get your mates, status, competition, etc.</p>
<p>Now I've simplified the science from the above references so only take this as a first order approximation, and each trait can be quite different. But to answer the OP's question, this appears to be the best available answer. About half of personality is genetic from your parents, about half is from random life events for which random (unshared) environments (rather than systematic/shared environment) is likely a large portion. This also makes sense from what we know about social norming, and ingroup/outgroup psychology. A large part of personality is based on which tribe/ingroup/sub-culture you adopt.</p>
<p>Also, personality changes over your lifetime. When younger, parenting appears to have more of an effect, and certainly behaviour in the family home. (But, people behave very differently in different homes and places, typically norming to the local cultural norms. Behaviour isn't the same as personality, but they are related.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One clarification I would make is that 50% heritability plus ~0% shared environment, does not mean that the remaining 50% is nonshared environment. For the most part it just is a placeholder for unexplained variance.</p>
<p>It could be that some of the unexplained effects are due to interactions between genetics and shared environment, for example. That would suggest that parenting style <em>does</em> matter, but that different children experience it differently due to their genetic predispositions. </p>
<p>It might also represent epigenetics, various genes being switched on or off by the environment (including parenting), or other factors other than classical additive genetics.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Unless I misunderstand, that is exactly what &quot;nonshared environment&quot; means. 50% heritability plus ~0% shared environment indeed means ~50% nonshared environment, which includes random mutations, epigenetics, diseases, and other such miscellany.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Within the first few days of life, humans are colonized by
commensal intestinal microbiota. Here, we review recent
findings showing that microbiota are important in
normal healthy brain function. We also discuss the relation
between stress and microbiota, and how alterations
in microbiota influence stress-related behaviors. New
studies show that bacteria, including commensal, probiotic,
and pathogenic bacteria, in the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract can activate neural pathways and central nervous
system (CNS) signaling systems. Ongoing and future
animal and clinical studies aimed at understanding
the microbiota–gut–brain axis may provide novel
approaches for prevention and treatment of mental illness,
including anxiety and depression.&quot;</p>
<p>It's becoming more and more obvious that gut bacteria play a role in brain functions more closely related to 'instinct'. Mechanisms like stress, the fight or flight response, etc. are likely influenced by gut bacteria activating signaling pathways in the CNS. It's still unclear, however, how much this phenomena influences personality. Personally, I think that there must be at least some connection between personality development and the actions of gut bacteria. </p></div>		</li>
