<p>A deep freezer without defrost cycles will store food nearly indefinitely without much degradation. </p></div>		</li>

<p>With a very minimal oxygen flux into the bag, stuff easily lasts years and years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would the next order of timescale be where new mechanics of degradation come into effect? For an arbitrarily low oxygen influx and continuous freeze that is.</p>
<p>Thousands of years? Millions? I'm guessing background gamma radiation could, on an extreme timescale, further reduce the consistency of the proteins and such contained in the food. </p>
<p>On the very extreme timescale we could (if it exists) expect the food to either undergo proton decay in 10^40 years, or cold fusion via quantum tunneling into iron in 10^1500 years. Those both count as <em>spoiled</em> in my opinion.</p>
<p>And before anyone says &quot;the freezer will break&quot; or &quot;the sun will explode&quot;, remember we can also encase the food in rock and shoot it far into deep space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm aware some lab environments use these for samples, but I'm curious about practical consumer application.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once told by a guy who worked in the food frozen warehouse industry, they had vast warehouses at -40C. He said they froze everything. Even foods you wouldn't think could be frozen. And at -40C things stored much better than home freezers at -5C.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about the nutrient value ? Is that still as it was when you first froze it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of the taste and texture changes.  They do not want you to dislike their product.  It may still be safe to eat, but if it is gross the customer will complain and not buy the product again.  You see this with all sorts of products “Best if used by...”  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also because fridges/freezers are different. The FDA guideline mentions freezing as -0°F or -18°C,  these are temps that cheaper standard household appliance combined freezers (which are compartments in refrigerators) might not reach, IIRC they usually just operate at a little below 32°F/0°C.</p>
<p>Most if not all single purpose freezers (like chest freezers) reach the temperature the FDA is talking about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read elsewhere that that expiration date for many products, such as chocolates, is the date that the product <em>should</em> taste slightly different from the norm. Whether it is still edible or not isn't even brought into the equation. I'll try and look for source when I'm on pc</p></div>		</li>

<p>That doesn't mean the product will be any less fresh after that date, just that there is no longer any form of guarantee.</p></div>		</li>
