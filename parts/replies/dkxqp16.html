<p>The Battle of the Bastards is actually a decent representation <em>of what it is</em> - a duel to the death between heavy cavalry. When cavalry fought cavalry hand-to-hand, they probably charged into contact but broke up after the initial shock of impact. The horses simply refuse to cooperate enough to maintain a formation once they're in the melee, which means you'd get individuals and small groups swirling through each other.</p>
<p>This is obviously a chaotic clusterfuck, which is one of the main reasons you didn't usually get battles like the Battle of the Bastards. It's an inefficient use of heavy cavalry's shock power. If you need to fight heavy cavalry, you don't use your own heavy cavalry if you can help it - you use formed infantry with polearms, light cavalry, and/or missile weapons. This is why combined arms tactics are so important - any given weapon system is unlikely to counter itself.</p></div>		</li>
