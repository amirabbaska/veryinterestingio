			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand upon this, waves are very rarely perfectly perpendicular to a coastline. Therefore the wave very very rarely hits the shore all the same time, it starts at one end first then continues to hit over the length of it over an extended period of time. This causes a small portion of the wave energy to be at an angle parallel to the shore. This energy picks up sand and moves it sideways, parallel to the shoreline. If there is a rocky piece of land which sticks farther out into the ocean (aka a headland) it stops this sideways energy and therefore stops the sideways movement of sand depositing it. When a beach is eroded away it isn’t taken out to sea instead it’s just slowly been migrating sideways. The rocky cliff (headland) is why the sandy beach is where it is.</p>
<p>Edit: the process is known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longshore_drift" target="_blank">Longshore Drift</a>. The linked Wikipedia article explains it much better than I did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to expand upon this, those outcrops (including man made jettys) often cause the beach on the other side to be eroded away (because they are no longer being “refreshed” by currents).</p>
<p>When humans think it’s a good idea to engineer jettys to preserve a beach, it often destroys one further down current. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well preservation is by its very nature selective. If beach A is in a highly visited area that humans can access and enjoy while beach B is a hard to get to spot of no importance and you need to pick one to preserve, every single time you’ll pick A. It’s just logical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s this really amazing island on the central coast of British Columbia. Most of the area is very lacking in beach space with cliffs and Fjords all up the coast. But this island has a series of bays formed by these headlands creating these spectacular beaches lined with dunes and coastal rainforest and flanked by tides pools. It’s not open to non educational groups for the most part but if you ever get the chance it’s an increddible experience. Usually called Calvert Island but also referred to by locals as Hakai </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting story out of the town of Cornwall. Their sandy beach washed completely away after a tide. Looked like it was lost forever, but a storm came and remade the beach! </p>
<p>Edit: My memory betrayed me. After re-reading the story, the beach was only gone for a few hours. There was not actual worry it was lost forever. Also, Cornwall, not some made-up town named Corvish. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Storms have more energy than your day to day waves so they move the sand much quicker and can jump it past headlands due to the extra energy involved. So one storm may remove a beach then another with waves dominantly in a different direction may bring it back again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Equally important is different types of rock in different places and shapes on the land. Some rocks are softer or more soluble than others so they get washed away faster. Some areas don't have as much rock in one place as other areas. Or some areas are flatter than other areas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes Geology is very important here. Headlands are headlands because they're made from rock that's more resistant to erosion. The gaps between the headlands become beaches. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing not said is that most beaches we know and love aren’t entirely natural. A lot of them are engineered. </p>
<p>Because it’s apparently not clear. Not saying they are made from scratch I’m saying many of them constantly undergo preservation to maintain them and a lot of them were no where near as large as they are now naturally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the beaches in NJ dredge sand from offshore and redeposit it on the beach. Cape May point st park does this. They have crazy erosion and the beach would be gone if the didnt. I believe LBI and the wildwoods do it too</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think when people hear “man made beach” they think it means there was no beach then some guys built one. Really what it often is, is taking the naturally occurring beach and doing things to it so that it stays in the same condition we want it to be. </p></div>		</li>
