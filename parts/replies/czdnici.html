			<p>I assume he means deer that die or freeze to death do so because they didn't find enough food. English may not be his/her 1st language. Or could just be tripping. Sometimes the two are verbally indistinguishable. </p>		</li>

			<p>In this case, 'winter kill' is a single adjective.<br><br>&gt;I want to say that winter-kill deer freeze to death primarily because they didn't find enough food.</p>		</li>

			<p>Exactly, in the midwest if theres say 6 inches of snow or more the deer will have a hell of a time getting food.  I've been walking through the woods and found big patches where they've pawed the snow out of the way and ate the grass underneath but i'm sure they use a ton of calories in the process.  Hooves arent exactly shovels.  <br><br>So when snow plows go down the roads, and they push the snow off a few inches off the side of the road, it leaves a thin strip of grass.  Good luck driving home at night without hitting deer.</p>		</li>
