<p>24 frames per second is a pretty standard frame rate for video, and most people perceive such video as continuous motion.</p>

<p>Only if it's video that was recorded with a physical camera, thus incorporating a realistic amount of motion blur. If it's computer-generated video such as a game where the images are effectively instantaneous snapshots, then 24 frames per second can easily appear to stutter, and there are noticeable improvements for increasing the frame rate well beyond 60 frames per second. (This is strongly influenced by whether you're viewing things on a low-persistence display or on a standard LCD that is illuminated for the entire frame time. In analog terms, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_disc_shutter" target="_blank">shutter angle</a> should be similar for both the camera and the projector.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The actual motions of the inner ear are much higher. We are sensitive vibrations up to about <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2003/ChrisDAmbrose.shtml" target="_blank">20,000 vibrations per second</a>. Those sounds are detected by sensing the membrane in our inner ear vibrating at the same frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no structure in the retina (or anywhere else) that vibrates at 770 THz. There is no 770 THz motion corresponding to the 770 THz light.</p>
<p>Parts of the membranes in the inner ear, however, vibrate at 20,000 Hz in response to 20,000 Hz sound, and the sensory receptor cells in those parts of the membrane bend back and forth at 20,000 Hz in response to 20,000 hz sound. So there is a 20,000 Hz motion in the ear in response to 20,000 Hz sound (at multiple scales, from macroscopic to sub-cellular).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Below 20Hz, sounds are perceived as discrete events rather than tones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, the upper limit of our hearing is that high. However, that doesn't mean your brain processes that information as 20 thousand <em>events</em> – it doesn't. </p>
<p>The brain can process distinct &quot;neural events&quot; (such as a drum hit, or the beginning of a note) with amazing timing accuracy under certain conditions (for example the time difference between the sound reaching your left vs. your right ear, which can be fractions of a millisecond), but once the event &quot;happens&quot;, the brain cannot readily treat following events independently with that accuracy. For example, any single repetition of the a sound within 50 ms of the original sound is perceived as the same sound (Haas effect). </p>
<p>With regards to separate similar-sounding events, as the above comment says, any (constant) repetition of sounds of more than 20 times per second starts being perceived like a tone. Think of an airplane propeller: it starts to &quot;whine&quot; because the sound made by the air and the mechanism behind it is doing the same sounds at the frequency of rotation. The faster the movement is repeated (which is a whole bunch of sounds being repeated, not just one), the higher the pitch of the whine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I didn't say it did.  I was very specifically talking about physical motion of the inner ear structures, not brain processing.</p>
<p>The limit of the brain perceiving individual events is between 2,000 - 4,000 Hz. That is the maximum rate at which the brain processing the individual cycles of a sound wave as individual cycles.</p>

<p>You are mixing up perception with brain processing. Yes, we can't perceive sounds as distinct waves at 2,000 hz, but our brain nevertheless processes them as discrete events, with one spike per cycle of the sound (this is called &quot;phase-locking&quot;).   This is essential, in fact, for our ability to detect sound direction for &quot;low&quot; frequencies, among other things. Our brain processes the timing of the sound waveforms arriving at the two ears.  This information is thrown away in higher levels of the brain because there is no benefit to perceiving it, but the lower levels of the brain make use of the information in several ways.</p></div>		</li>

The mapping between game actions and physical movements isn't always 1-1, but it's a reference point for conscious, repetitive actions.</p></div>		</li>

As you mentioned the amount of inputs they make is insane and they often have to make these inputs on a split second decision or get punished. It doesn't surprise me when people hurt their hands when playing given how much time they play without break and how many inputs they make.</p></div>		</li>
