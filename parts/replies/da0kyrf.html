			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand the basics of shifting tectonic plates(college undergrad so please correct any mistakes in my logic here), Then I think a lot of evidence will come from crust composition and how different minerals and water from different locations flow into and out of the mountain ranges.
When Sibblin refers to a &quot;significant time gap,&quot; it's probably measures in millions(potentially billions?) of years so as the plates shifted the soil and water that washed over them both eroded the surrounding layers of rock, and at times deposited it's own. If there are similarities in composition of the rock and soil at specific layers, that's one way to establish a line of evidence for a particular context</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember from my A-Level Geology studies that tectonic plate theory in general was established using fossil records and looking at rock formations that seemingly end on one continent and seemingly continue on another. There's <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Plate-Tectonics/Chap1-Pioneers-of-Plate-Tectonics/Alfred-Wegener/Fossil-Evidence-from-the-Southern-Hemisphere" target="_blank">lots of sites</a> with examples of such finds.</p>
<p>With the Appalachians, it appears its more to do with the composition of <a href="http://certmapper.cr.usgs.gov/data/noga95/prov67/text/prov67.pdf" target="_blank">rock layers</a></p></div>		</li>
