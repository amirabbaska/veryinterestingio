			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes because the vomiting reflex in regards to over consumption of alcohol is due to the fluid in the semicircular sacs in your head by the ears (basically motion sickness). Fun fact: if you drink heavy water at a particular ratio to alcohol, you won’t feel dizzy and won’t vomit if you over consume. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Should do - iirc vomiting from alcohol comes mostly from disruption to your balance, which would still happen. Some of it comes from irritation to the gut, so you might vomit a bit less easily since that wouldn't be happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is that more dangerous? It just means you achieve the same BAC with less liver strain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn’t make it any more dangerous. I’d guess that if anything, acetaldehyde is a more harmful chemical to the body, and getting to a higher BAC faster would result in a higher AUC for ethanol than GI absorption, and probably lower AUC for acet since you'd excrete more ethanol unchanged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I know ethanol interferes with the surfactants that keep your lungs from collapsing.</p>
<p>Is it just an absurd amount to ethanol to overcome the surfactant?</p></div>		</li>
