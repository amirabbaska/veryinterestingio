			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add to this - aside from the computing requirements, someone still has to build the photo realistic assets. It's not cheap and it's not easy (see recent Mass Effect face debacle). </p>
<p>Even current gen systems are capable of rendering much more realistic faces than we see in games now. The problem is that no one is capable of actually building them on a scale that works for commercial games.</p>
<p>That may get better in the next 10 years, but it won't be solved. I imagine we'll be able to play racing games or robot games that look entirely real, but we're still a way off from doing it with humans.</p>
<p>Basically, whatever were capable of doing in CG for films now will be what we're doing in video games 10-15 years later.</p>
<p>Edit: Tossing in another thought here. There's a reason Avatar took $500 million to make. And very little of it had to do with the limits of technology. As tech gets better, demands just increase to make use of the better tech. If you want to start seeing games with that level of realism, it's going to cost much more than that. In standard CG production, you know what your frames are going to be. If you can't get stuff to work correctly, you can always just paint the frames to make a delivery as a last resort. You can't do that shit in games where everything actually has to work.</p>
<p>I'm very curious to see how high the budgets for AAA games will go in the next 15 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, even if you have the manpower to produce the assets, you still have artistic expression to worry about.  Porting real world graphics to a game would result in a lot of unbelievable or underwhelming effects.  Look to movies, where realism is quite achievable, and is not used, as proof.  Just because you can replicate a real car explosion, doesn't mean its the best way to achieve your goal (tell a story, entertain, scare, thrill, etc).  Game developers will likely make intentional changes from reality, to achieve realism in the eyes of gamers.  <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ntI9jgA.jpg" target="_blank">Example of Reality</a></p>
<p>Even if we can render reality, you still need the ability to create it, and even after that, you need to want to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another problem is not just creating photo realistic assets, but populating a world in a convincing way. As it is, only specific animated assets will move, but in the real world, there are so many tiny details which can be interacted with and which interact with everything else. Nothing in the real world cannot be interacted with on some level.</p>
<p>It's not just a question of adding in assets that can move, but a question of programming these interactions between the player, other entities and the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is another huge issue.</p>
<p>I love thinking about long-term player interactions as well.</p>
<p>As a programmer, looking at a game like Minecraft can be instructive. It offers some degree of interaction ... with blocks that are 1m square ... but laws like &quot;amount of water is conserved&quot; (ie, can't cover a tall hill with water just by placing a single water block at the top of a tall hill, or allowing a small pond to drain completely into another lower reservoir) would require simulating every block in an infinite world, not just the (still very large) numbers of blocks that surround the active players.</p>
<p>In fact, even in minecraft, <strong>those blocks are all static.</strong> In the real world, they're not, in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>physical laws mean cave-ins can happen, and floating islands can't. Constantly running physics sim, anyone? ... but, wait, how to we display a block-based collapse? How do we animate it? None of the blocks are active bodies; they're static geometry, and the game is premised on adding or removing one unit of static geometry at a time. So now you're into next-gen voxel engines, and their attendant development and content creation woes ...</li>
<li>the real world has natural laws for other things -- like vegetation. If you bring water to the desert, eventually it will green up. But ecosystems are either totally static or pre-defined in most games. What would it take to start making them dynamic? Well, think about a cellular automata in 2 dimensions (like Conway's Game of Life), and imagine that you had written a much more complex version that took into account different layers (like amount of water in the soil, the elevation and temperature of the land, and current amount and kind of vegetation inhabiting that point) -- never mind how you're computing and constantly re-computing the values for those layers, and feeding world events back into them! You have a simulation that can let plants spread, flourish, and maybe even compete, following some natural laws. Now, just ask yourself: how much data is required for this? (Even in a 1m-per-dot situation, it's easily into gigabytes for a decent-sized play area). It gets worse: because of how interconnected these things are, simulation needs to be done everywhere, at once, not just where the players are. Yowch.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasons like that mentioned above are actually why I'm bullish on really rich simulated worlds coming back, eventually, as MMO's. Because it'll be possible to have a cluster of machines constantly simulating and recomputing the state of <em>all</em> of a world in at least this amount of detail, and that's what you need for changes to actually propagate through virtual worlds. The sheer physical size of the worlds involved needn't even be that big; the richness of the interaction (on the dimensions of time and propagation throughout the world, anyway) would be the selling point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this is very true.</p>
<p>There's a potential interesting development there though. If VR becomes extremely popular, and we get facial and full-body tracking in some form for VR, that may make it much easier to do realistic humans.</p>
<p>Developers could then only worry about the rendering/lighting and creation a realistic skeleton/puppet, but the user would actually be doing the 'animation' in real-time while playing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's already very realistic rigs out there, and for games, too. VR only compounds the problem imo (you have to worry about other stuff).</p>
<p>Realism depends on detail and aesthetics. VR depends on perspective and how our brain perceives it.</p>
<p>The cool thing about stuff like VR is that, after a while, the brain accepts the reality being experienced. It's like when you play a simulator game for too long, the graphics become more and more irrelevant. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If ~900x the power of a GTX 1080 was not sufficient for completely realistic graphics, I'd be gobsmacked.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, 300 times as much would likely not be nearly enough. The big problem is that the amount of performance needed to increase visual quality tends to grow exponential. A good example for that is the resolution: Imagine the steps from 720p to 1080p to 4k: Each of these steps roughly quadrupels the number of pixels, yet the improvement in visual quality is far bigger when you go from 720p to 1080p (edit: 720 to 1080 doesn't quadruple, I can't math). This tendency continues in both directions.</p>
<p>It's very similar with texture size, polygon count, particle effects, shadows, lighting, texture filtering, anti-aliasing and pretty much any other scalable effect. And you can see that in real life: Pick a bunch of similar games with good graphics from 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. Very likely, the difference between 2000 and 2005 will be <em>far</em> more significant than that from 2010 to 2015. </p>
<p>This trend will continue into the future, to a point where significant improvements cost an immense amount of computing power. So the closer we get to photo realism, the more difficult it will become to get even a tiny bit closer to it. And if you want to look at just how difficult it will be: Look at the immense computing power required to render CGI effects for big budget movies. Even they can't achieve photorealism, and they'd need closer to a couple million times the processing power of a GTX 1080 to render that in real time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good point.
There's a fine edge between convincing and completely realistic when it comes to required power. </p>
<p>For example we can have SSAO for good and more or less realistic looking lighting, but to get to the level of absolutely realistic representation you'd have to calculate all the light rays precisely individually and without approximations, which requires tremendously more processing power.</p>
<p>Also separate complexity affects every aspect of the calculation as well. If we have a X-polygon face and calculating a current lighting model for it takes Y seconds, and calculating realistic lighting​ model takes 10xY seconds, if we then also increase the face resolution, to 10X - time required will multiply as well resulting in 10x10xY</p>
<p>Tl/dr the more complex the scene is - the more costly it is to improve every particular element of the image quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a bad idea to look at 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015, etc. for 1 important reason - consoles.</p>
<p>In the majority of that time, a lot of games were console focused, and consoles made bigger leaps in performance than was possible at the high-end because they started out using lower-tier hardware.</p>
<p>i.e. It's like jumping from the $100 tier GPU in 2005 to the $500 tier GPU in 2010. This would result in a larger increase than the $500 to $500 GPU in that timeframe. If you see what I mean.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to choose a decent direct comparison though. Maybe a good one would be Far Cry 1 in 2004, then Crysis 1 in 2007, then how Star Citizen was looking in 2015 ish.</p>
<p>All of those games were purported to be pushing the envelope at the time, and even the top-end GPUs available would suffer.</p>
<p>EDIT: Possibly a simpler way would be to look at the Unreal Tournament games. That would cover 1998 to Unreal's release (next year?), on Unreal Engine 1-4. And, again, the Unreal Tournament games are meant to show off the best graphics capability at the time they come out. And there's an enormous difference between those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're probably right. There are a couple other PC games that would fit into that list: Unreal ('98), UT 2003 (2002), Doom 3 (2004) and Gothic 3 (2006) for example were very demanding games in their time. </p>
<p>Crysis however is kind of an outlier, since it wasn't even playable on its highest quality setting on any single graphics card on the market when it released. It took two GTX 8800 to get it above 30 frames in full hd. It's basically a 2009 or 2010 game, just released a couple years early. Perhaps a better contestant for 2007 would be Bioshock, which could actually run on high end hardware. It was basically the point where PCs had once again caught up with consoles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually just looking at games from the past 30 years and comparing graphical advances.  In 1987 we had stuff like the original Double Dragon and Monkey Island.  Unreal Tournament was in 1997 then in 2007 we got the first Crysis.  Take a look at Star Citizen in its current form to see what we can do now.  Those are pretty large graphical leaps every 10 years, in another decade I imagine we will see some spectacular graphical improvements.</p></div>		</li>

The ray tracing is too expensive and the other methods can't render a large environment (multiple square miles) with realistic shadows throughout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear I'm not saying that 20 years ago was the only point at which we thought it would be done in 10 years.</p>
<p>I'm saying every year since I've been in the games industry people have been saying photorealism is 10 years away, including last year, five years ago and 15 years ago.</p>
<p>The point is there's always a new problem to solve. We already have photorealism for some kinds of scenes (simple ones with static lighting, solid bodies and no animation), but the goalposts keep moving as we include different types of scenes.</p>
<p>Of course we knew what photorealism meant in 1997. The term was invented before the computer. It means 'indistinguishable from a photograph of the same scene'.</p></div>		</li>
