			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was little I used to basically suffocate in the wind. I've also always hated swimming since it's just drowning with style for me. Nice to see they're related.  </p>
<p>Edit: Always wanted to skydive and now I'm realizing I'll probably hate it.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me while sky diving! Ultimately, I was fine as I was able to stay calm. But I couldn't breathe for a good 30 seconds. I finally figured out how to override it by breathing through clenched teeth. It protected my throat from feeling the rush of air. There was no way I could breathe out of my nose. </p>
<p>That being said, 10/10 would jump again. </p>
<p>PS, I'm the same way with swimming. Unless I plug my nose, I feel like I'm drowning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get the same thing. Did my first tandem last summer and now I'm desperate to get my AFF done and get a Class A. My dad has 1200 jumps so I have some guidance there.<br />
Be damned if I'm going to let some mammalian reflex ruin it for me. I've never felt anything as peaceful and free as freefall, man...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. Was terrible for a few minutes but I just tried to enjoy the ride. Figured it would all be OK once the shoot opened. It was. Would do it again for sure. But after asking people if they had the same thing they all said no. Thought I did something wrong. Guess it's just a thing. But yeah, made me afraid for sure. And being afraid, while free falling, is just doubly terrifying. But awesome. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skydive instructors will often tell tandems to yell out &quot;woo hoo&quot; or the like on exit. The large exhale is followed by an inhale and the passenger continues to breathe. </p>
<p>It's hard to tell how effective it is as most do not have this problem. So did it work or would the passenger breathe normally without instruction? </p>
<p>Either way, you can go to a wind tunnel and try it out  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can you say that we can't feel what &quot;wet&quot; is? If we can feel a physical stimuli and determine based on that information that we are feeling a liquid, then we are perceiving wetness. Seems pedantic to say otherwise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With some basic research, I found the following:</p>
<p>We have four different types of nerves to detect four types of feelings: Cold, Hot, Pain, and Pressure.</p>
<p>The feeling of wet would be the feeling of cold with a specific pressure, but there are dry things that have this same combination of senses. This is why things like smooth metal can feel wet. </p>
<p>What OP here is saying is that we don't have a &quot;wet&quot; sensation, just a sensation that we associate with wet, even if it isn't necessarily a wet object.</p></div>		</li>
