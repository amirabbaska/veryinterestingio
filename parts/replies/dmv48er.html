			<div class="markdown"><p>And by knowing what store had the iTunes gift card you sub-consciously made a connection with that store that it would be able to satisfy your shopping needs.  </p>
<p>You probably still shop at that store/chain today for other things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Last saturday we meant to buy toilet paper and some other needed stuff (&lt;$120) and ended up with a $350 expense. </p>
<p>Still I can not say that money was not well spent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>aka Costco's gas strategy</p>
<p>They sell it at cost (sometimes it fluctuates slightly above or lower than, but for the most part it is at cost).</p>
<p>Why, because you have to have a Costco membership to buy it and there are people who will pay the $50 for the membership just to get gas but eventually they'll end up going into the store and buying other items. Next thing you know they are buying all milk, toilet paper, paper towels, cereal, etc from Costco.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up on this, I can specifically say that in Walmart, there are a bunch of items that are sold at a loss to get people in the store. There are things that also are never supposed to go out of stock. These usually coincide. There are other items that are marked up like fricking crazy to make up for it.</p>
<p>Examples: 50' Ethernet cable costs the company $1. They sell it for $25. Kraft macaroni and cheese costs the company $1.25. They sell it for $1. (May not be entirely accurate, but it's stuff like this.)</p></div>		</li>
