			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting, if their goal is retain users for a longer period of time, why would Netflix release all their shows for a season simultaneously?</p>
<p>I could sign up for Netflix, binge watch the shows in a week, and then cancel until the next season.  With a weekly release I'll have to retain my membership for at least a few months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They'll be hoping that the show will be enough to get you to sign up and then you'll stick around because of the other content they have in their library, as well as other new shows they add. Of course, if you're only interested in that one show each year then it won't work like that, but for most subscribers, it does. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>are you going to pay $10 to watch 4 episodes of a show?  Probably not.  But for a whole season, yeah.  But then you see that they also have this other show, so you start it.  Boom.  You are now a loyal subscriber.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shows weren't the original draw to Netflix. They've become that now because there are so many shows on Netflix, both among their originals and the other shows they carry, and they smartly started producing a lot more originals as that shift was happening.</p>
<p>That leads then to the simple answer to your question: they keep rotating/releasing shows as well. Why you won't cancel after binging on a House of Cards season is because you're expecting more seasons of great shows coming the next month.</p></div>		</li>
