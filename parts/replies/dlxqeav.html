			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that is super bizarre, and I have so many questions if anyone knows. Has a burning building ever actually been evacuated by helicopter? Does the LA fire department, or some other department, actually keep a fleet of helicopters on-call somewhere for this purpose? Exactly how many helicopter flights would you need to evacuate a burning building, and how many helicopters would you need to perform this evacuation in a reasonable amount of time, i.e. before people start burning to death? What do the pilots of these helicopters, if they actually exist, think of the idea of landing on a burning building to evacuate people? That doesn't sound terribly safe, especially doing it dozens of times in a rush. How much money is being spent on keeping fleets of helicopters on-call for this? If not much and nothing is actually on call, how do they expect to get enough helicopters on the scene fast enough to do any good? If lots and lots, wouldn't it save a lot more lives to spend that money on more fire trucks or something instead of the ridiculous idea of evacuating skyscrapers by helicopter? Is the real reason for this more related to super-rich executives being able to commute via helicopter, and the fire evacuating thing just an excuse to get the Government to require it?</p></div>		</li>
