			<div class="markdown"><p>What you posted above is correct from an inertial frame, or one &quot;stationary&quot; to which the object is rotating.   Normally, this is easier because the physics is easier to set up.  In this frame, there is no centrifugal force and at least one centripetal force is doing the work.</p>
<p>However, if you translate this system to a rotating frame, centrifugal force is now a real force.  (This is the frame we'd use when we are <em>in</em> the object rotating, for example).  So be careful when arguing that centrifugal force is just an illusion - you're not telling the whole story.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just have to point out here that there really is no such thing as &quot;centrifugal force&quot;, that is &quot;created by spinning&quot;. </p>

<p>Yes there certainly is. In rotating frames of reference, there are several inertial forces that appear in Newton's equation, one of which is called the centrifugal force.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The so called centrifugal force is an illusion caused by Newton's first law (Roughly &quot;A body in motion wants to stay in motion&quot;), and does not actually exist, but people still talk about it from time to time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It may not exist in an inertial frame, but it does absolutely exist in the frame of the satellite. You say that &quot;people still talk about it from time to time&quot; as if to dismiss it, but the fact is centrifugal forces and other inertial forces are widely encountered in the physics literature. Open up Classical Mechanics by Goldstein or another graduate mechanics text and you'll see them everywhere.</p>
<p>If you started your post with the hypothesis that what follows applies only to inertial frames of reference, then it would be right. But in general, centrifugal forces are very much &quot;such things&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My most sincere apologies. For once I thought that I actually knew an answer to a question here, and was happy to reply. Now I see that my knowledge on the matter is rather limited, more so than my writing style above would let you assume.</p>
<p>Would you like to briefly explain this to me? As someone who has only encountered stationary frames of reference, the idea of a man-made arbitrary choice of reference &quot;creating&quot; additional forces sounds bizarre. I am not trying to argue that what you said isn't true, I am genuinely curious here and would like to learn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to explain it. Let's start with the inertial frame of reference.</p>
<p>You are a guy floating in space. You see a satellite orbiting. The satellite happens to be a cube. Let's call the wall in the direction of its movement F, the &quot;back&quot; wall B, and the &quot;outer tangent&quot; wall T. A guy is sitting in a chair next to wall B, facing wall F, wall T on his right side. He throws a ball towards the middle of wall F. In our chosen frame of reference, the ball continues traveling in a straight line, and it hits wall T (actually, it might hit wall F, just not in the middle - the distinction doesn't really matter here) because the satellite is orbiting. The ball wasn't pulled towards T, instead T &quot;got in its way&quot;. The physical model without a centrifugal force matches what happened in reality.</p>
<p>Now let's look at this from the perspective of the guy in the chair. In his frame of reference, he is at rest. As the satellite isn't moving relative to him, the satellite is also at rest, and so are walls F and T. He throws the ball towards the middle of F, and the ball swerves to the right and hits T (or hits F but not in the middle). Clearly, a force must have pulled the ball in the direction of T, or it would have hit the middle of F.</p>
<p>The physical model without a centrifugal force is obviously incorrect, because when a stationary guy throws a ball towards a point on the stationary wall F, in the absence of other forces our model predicts the ball will hit that point on wall F, but it hit wall T instead.</p>
<p>The cause for this mismatch between the two reference frames is that you can't apply Newton's laws of motion in the same way in non-inertial reference frames as you do in inertial ones - it simply stops being a meaningful way of describing the physical world - it gives you a prediction and then something entirely different happens. </p>
<p>Also, you've probably encountered non-inertial reference frames. Imagine being in a car. When you hit the gas pedal, a force pulls you towards the seat. From your frame of reference, we can't say the seat is moving forward and pushing you along (which is what the outside observer in an inertial frame sees) because you are stationary and the seat is not moving relative to you so it is also stationary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>i never understood this completely. i tend to think that the explanation [of what's happening] from the inertial point of view is somehow superior. (as in cleaner, &quot;truer&quot;.)
while the non-inertial view creates/conjures up centrifugal force as a construct to help explain and utilize the effect of what is actually &quot;just inertia&quot; in the outside perspective.
isn't that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which reference frame is superior depends on what you're trying to calculate.</p>
<p>Let's say you're playing darts in a satellite (or you're programming a robot to play darts in a satellite). It is intuitive and way easier to use a non-inertial frame of reference - the centrifugal force is pulling the dart in one direction so you compensate for this by aiming slightly towards the opposite direction (same as with gravity on Earth). The problem can be reduced to projectile motion. It would be way more inconvenient to translate this into an inertial frame and calculate the movement of the satellite and the dart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it depends on the mass and the radius of the neutron star. You can calculate the orbit radius at the given rotational speed with the equations for gravitational force and the centripetal force, you get r=(GM/w)^(1/3), where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the star and w (standing in for omega) is the angular velocity of the star. To get the best chances of us staying on the surface, let's suppose the neutron star is only about 1.1 times the mass of the sun. The angular velocity comes from OP, 716 rev/s. I calculated that the orbit radius with these figures is about 19.3 km. This is a bit more than the usual neutron star radius (usually 12-13 km). However, I can not explain how this star could even hold together at such speeds, as this calculation would suggest the minimum radius to be more than it actually is. There might be more to this, but this is the limit of my knowledge on the matter.</p></div>		</li>
