			<div class="markdown"><p>Tip for anyone reading this: If you want to donate blood after a disaster, wait until roughly a month after the disaster.</p>
<p>When the disaster first hits, a lot of people will be out donating blood to help. After about a month, all the unused blood is going to be too old. Feeling that they already did their part, people are unlikely to donate again so soon. This means a serious need for blood donations, and is the perfect time for you to donate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, I didn't know that! Someone I know used to give blood for money very often, but now that I think about it they might have been doing more often than they were technically supposed to. (It was a while ago, and they were desperate for the money at the time.)</p></div>		</li>
