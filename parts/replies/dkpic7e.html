			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I think when people refer to a divorce they are referring to life long monogamous species breaking that life-long rule. Unfortunately for them the species that do mate for life and totally don't cheat or break up in winter are hard enough to find and even harder to say yes 100% breed for life that we would find instances of divorce. </p>
<p>I mean isn't the instances of divorce evidence against breeding for life? Widows and adultery are far more common than scientific communities deciding, yes these are lifelong pairs except for when they aren't and they get divorced. It makes very little sense. </p>
<p>Birds that are non-adulterous and mate for a season imo are far more interesting. They literally put all their eggs in one basket. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans as usual are going to be strange, and it would be unusual to assume that there is going to be one collective mating strategy. Polygamy seems to be a good strategy for primates in general, as it creates social bonds, however resources scarcity could potentially lead to monogamy, look at penguins in Antarctica. A monogamous or semi-monogamous system keeps social order, and helps with resource distribution. Resource scarcity also could lead to polyandry in extreme cases, check out &quot;When Brothers Take a Wife&quot;. Again, humans are just too strange to categorize since we do not always take the best evolutionary strategies and favor our feelings.  </p></div>		</li>
