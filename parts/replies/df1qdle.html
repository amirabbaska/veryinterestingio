<p>Thanks, this is the key point. I didn't understand why people here on reddit seemed to hate <em>every</em> boomer, instead of the ones at the top. It's not your regular Joe's fault he was able to buy a house working as a mailman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate this mindset of &quot;it's just a few crooks, the rest of us are innocents, at worst we just stood by!&quot;. That's not how voting works. It's not that the baby boomer generation stood by while somebody set up a system to benefit them and screw over the next generation. They voted for these things and the people who put them in place. They are entirely to blame for what went on.</p>
<p>Not to say any other generation is any better, we've all got legacies of shit that we're building up to leave behind. But to absolve the baby boomer generation of the guilt they rightly deserve for setting this nasty precedent of stealing from the next generation is just silly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, like most they vote to benefit themselves.  </p>
<p>But gen x and millennials far far outnumber boomers.  It's just we don't vote regularly.   </p>
<p>So if any elected leader, ballot, or initiative screws over future generations at the expense of boomers......they only have themselves to blame.    Young people have to start voting </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There weren't any policies that created the postwar prosperity in the 50s and early 60s. The fact that most of the other industrialized nations were in ruin from the war had a much larger impact.</p>
<p>Without competition for the US's manufactured goods it could grow faster and take higher margins. Growth like we saw in this time makes a lot of things that would ordinarily be difficult really easy.</p>
<p>When you're growing, companies can afford to pay high wages to low-skill manufacturing workers, you can afford huge social programs, you can fund big infrastructure programs. When growth slows, companies and governments have to focus on costs instead to make ends meet. Things like wages and social programs have to get cut.</p>
<p>Why did growth in the US slow? The biggest reason was increased competition from other nations. Europe eventually rebuilt its infrastructure after the war. Germany and Japan grew especially fast because they were banned from a lot of military spending and could invest that money at home. At the same time, a lot of US investment was crowded out by Cold War defense spending (I don't have a view on whether this is good or bad).</p>
<p>Growth returned in the 90s because the US again lacked competition in internet and technology industries. America's advantage in tech still remains somewhat, but Europe slowly caught up and India and China caught up rapidly. Tech industries in the US are still growing because of its remaining advantages in education, infrastructure, and finance.</p>
<p>I think humans have the (understandable) tendency to list human action as the cause of things that actually occurred independently. The economics of the postwar global competitive landscape wouldn't have changed depending on who was president. I think governments can make an impact on the margin, but have little ability to make sweeping changes. That's why I believe we need to be skeptical when someone when a charismatic politician like Trump or Bernie Sanders promises amazing growth or prosperity.</p>
<p>I think Americans have an entitlement problem. We look at the growth and prosperity of the 1950s as a sign of American exceptionalism. We believe we DESERVE this prosperity. The truth is we're a nation of people that are pretty much like people in other countries. Our growth in the 50s was a result of structural advantages in world economy, not our people or government policies. The same is true today. Wage and economic growth has slowed because of a tougher global competitive environment, not because we got lazy or made the wrong policies. I think we should learn to accept the realities of our world and focus on the small (and important) things we can control. I think education is a good example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for you incredibly insightful post. I am now starting to believe it is more the attitude that Baby Boomers have towards younger generations that has contributed to their negative reputation rather than their actions. </p>
<p>As a non-American this was very enlightening. I will be sure to continue reading about this topic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a highly debated opinion.  Many would argue that the new deal didn't really do much and that the war effort and the total destruction of European manufacturing had more to do with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The New Deal was not &quot;democratic socialism,&quot; you walnut. It was classical Keynesian economics, where deficit-spending was seen as a necessary evil to offset production loss in a recession. </p>
<p>We're not in a recession right now, so free college, healthcare, $15/hr minimum wage has nothing to do with New Dealism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that it's many Boomers who regurgitate &quot;when I was young, blah blah blah&quot; cliches at the other generations doesn't help the hate situation.</p>
<p>Just yesterday some old Gen X'ers /young boomers were posting about a local Blizzard from 1978 and how they went to school the next day! Wow! And guess what? Kids these days don't go to school after big storms like that! Why? Oh, because the people who went to school during the storm in 78 are now the school administrators and they decide to cancel it.</p>
<p>But that's the millennials fault. Or something.</p></div>		</li>
