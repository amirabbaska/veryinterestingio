			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine they're getting at the fact that adrenaline tends to affect blood sugar, though I'm not sure exactly what their point is regards it. As far as I'm aware, it releases sugar stores so that they're more available for muscles to utilise, but I'd imagine that it would be the inverse that would be more dangerous for diabetics. </p>
<p>Or they could just be talking about how the body reacts to an allergic reaction in the absence of insulin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No itâ€™s a typo. Adrenaline relaxes the smooth muscle around the airways and prevents airway collapse. Blood sugar fluctuations due to adrenaline release are short and not dramatic enough to cause harm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An unfortunately common misconception. It's the most <em>well-adapted</em> that survive, and the ones with higher reproductive success whose kinds continue to succeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happy Darwin Day!  Darwin was born 206 years ago today!  Natural selection and Darwinian evolution have nothing to do with who's the strongest, and everything to do with who can have the most children to survive to have children of their own.  Sometimes being strong is useful, but sometimes the traits that are most successful are being smart, or fast, or sneaky, or being a really good parent, or having a beautiful tail, or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTcfDCjBqV0" target="_blank">doing a little dance to attract the ladies</a>.   <a href="https://sciencing.com/darwins-four-main-ideas-evolution-8293806.html" target="_blank">This article</a> does a great job of clarifying what natural selection actually is.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>And also for the expanded explanation too, but evolutionary theory has and is still my current focus if study for my degrees. Hopefully it will help other peopke though! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not even that.  It's who has at least 1 child that isn't <em>unfit</em> enough to be eliminated before they can breed.</p>
<p>And then there are the highly recessive traits.  If a trait rarely manifests, it can survive a long, long time in the gene bool even if it's fatal at birth.  If it rarely manifests, it doesn't manifest to get selected against, and doesn't get eliminated.</p>
<p>&quot;Having more children&quot; is only one strategy towards gene propagation.  If it was the only good strategy, we'd all be breeding like rabbits, which self-evidently isn't the case.</p></div>		</li>
