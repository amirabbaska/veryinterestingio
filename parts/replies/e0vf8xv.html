			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually only the contemporary use of the word diet is something to do for a short time. Originally a diet meant a guide to follow forever. Itâ€™s sort of like how a budget is a guide to spend money, but people use budget as a temporary fix to save money over a certain season. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's why you need to sit down and read up on proper nutrition and exercise ASAP but also ease into it. Go to the grocery store and pick out things that are <em>improvements</em> to your diet with the eventual goal of weaning yourself off of the bad stuff completely. Start eating more realistically sized portions but don't starve yourself. Start doing something active once a day but don't set a meaningless start date of when you're <em>really</em> going to take it seriously.</p>
<p>If you eat nothing but junk food and sit around all day and tell yourself, &quot;Ok, at the start of this next month/year, I'm going to quit drinking beer/alcohol/soda and I'm only going to eat salads and grilled chicken and I'm going to go to the gym six times a week&quot;.....you're probably going to burn yourself out immediately and go right back to what's comfortable.</p>
<p>The key is to start making better choices that turn into better habits and become how you live - not a way that you spent one week or month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been doing IF for six months now, skipping breakfast every day. This has helped me lose 35lbs so far! Almost at my goal weight.</p>
<p>No breakfast, small lunch (300-400 cal; usually a tuna sandwich w/ avocado and mustard) and a large dinner (800-1000 cal, cook up a storm) + a protein shake (200 cal) and it has been great and surprisingly easy to maintain. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's just a tool. Not eating breakfast makes it easier to reduce your caloric intake.</p>
<p>It's the same thing with Keto, for many people. Although Keto does have actual benefits metabolically, at the end of the day most people who lose weight on a Keto diet would lose just as much weight if they simply cut down their caloric intake, and avoiding grains and sugars naturally reduces your caloric intake dramatically. </p>
<p>Simple rules like &quot;no eating between 8pm and noon&quot; or &quot;no grains/sugars/fruits&quot; that are easy to follow are a useful tool for people who have issues limiting their food intake to reduce how much they eat. </p>
<p>Literally all weight loss is &quot;just a cal deficit.&quot; That's what weight loss is: putting in less than you take out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copying part of another comment I made here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While I'm sure CICO was a big part of the change for me, I attribute a large portion of the weight loss to IF. Refraining from eating when you normally would is so important because it forces you to become comfortable with the feeling of hunger. Once I became okay with being hungry, CICO was so much easier.</p>
