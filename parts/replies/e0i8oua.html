			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia has (since December of last year) made some changes in the screening process, so I'm wondering how that will affect things ie changing the frequency from two to five years and first screening for HPV rather than cell changes, and then only looking for cell changes when HPV is detected. (i got really excited by this change, thinking at first it might be blood test or something, but no, it's still a pap smear - the changes are in what they look for at the laboratory - frankly I think screening rates would be much higher if it was anything other than a pap smear!)</p>
<p>I'm also sad that the vaccine still costs hundreds of dollars for people who were too old to qualify for the free vaccine :/ Take advantage of that free vaccine, people! By the time you realise why it's important, it might be either too expensive or too late for you :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I developed dysplasia and either I don’t have HPV, or I have a strain which is not tested for (in 2 different countries including Australia!) so I’m not so comfortable with the every 5 years neither - if they only tested for HPV then did a smear 5 years later they would’ve never found it in time.</p>
<p>To this day my specialists can’t explain why I had it, and still haven’t found anything in further testing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's unlikely that you would have been exposed to all dangerous strains. But yeah, it's safer and more cost effective to get in early. Doesn't help for those of us who were around before the scheme tho :(</p></div>		</li>

<p>In Australia, where they introduced the hbv vaccine in 2006, if I remember right, they have a vaccination rate of over 70 %. (All genders). Their pappiloma caused cancers dropped from 22.7% to 1.1%.</p>

<p>22.7% and 1.1% of what?</p></div>		</li>
