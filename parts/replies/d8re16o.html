			<div class="markdown"><p>They supplement their diet with food but for the most part when we talk about bleaching, we're talking about reef building corals like acroporidae. They only have very tiny tentacles (polyps) and can't feed themselves entirely with phytoplankton collected from the water column. Other corals like anemones and corallimorphs (soft corals) can collect a large portion of their diet from the water column because they have much larger polyps and mouths, but these are not reef building corals and are less critical to the health of the reef overall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some time ago, coral created a mutualistic relationship with the dinoflagellates. The dinoflagellates undergo photosynthesis and provide the coral with energy, while the coral give the dinoflagellates carbon. For them, this was more efficient, so coral no longer &quot;hunt&quot; like other Cnidaria. Whether they still do or not, I don't know. But it wouldn't be a very efficient process, hence we see coral bleaching with the expulsion of the dinoflagellates.</p></div>		</li>

curious about the word usually. how often have we seen this?  </p>
