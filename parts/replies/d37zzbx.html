<p>Edit: nope just acrylic. I don't know where I got that from</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah we use what is called a linear abrader. Basically we add weight to a rod that is cycled back and forth a specified distance at a certain speed. Testing companies sell specific tips that are used to simulate the wear of different real world objects. So we have special ones that we can use to simulate a finger and for testing a glass coating we generally shoot for the 250,000 to 500,000 cycle range depending on the use case. So we set up the machine and let it run and I stop by a few times a day ~ every 10,000 cycles to see the progress.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am really annoyed by the fact that I need to frequently wipe greases after 1 year of phone purchased... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately no. It's a fairly complex process that requires controlled conditions to work properly. My best recommendation would be to try your luck with a screen protector, I tend to get fairly minimalist cheap ones that can be replaced without much fuss (I tend to about every 6 months).</p></div>		</li>
