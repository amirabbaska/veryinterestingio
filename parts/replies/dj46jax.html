			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of it. You aren't going to be &quot;uninstalling&quot;, for example, TouchWiz, with just root. You'll need to install a complete OS (usually requiring a hackable bootloader - something that cannot always be achieved even when root can) to remove the biggest piece of bloatware on most phones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The vast majority of apparent performance and battery life improvement comes from simply removing the carrier branded UI and replacing it with stock Android UI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This.</p>
<p>I had a Google Nexus 6, and it had issues with the USB port so I couldnt keep it charged over night. The USB kept falling out.</p>
<p>T-Mobile put me in a Samsung S6 Edge because they &quot;Don't sell google phones anymore&quot;</p>
<p>Out of the box, the phone was crap. Utter Crap. It was slow, wonky, not to mention the shit UI TouchWiz.</p>
<p>I ended up Rooting and putting a custom Rom (60% Stock as it was called) and the phone was night and day different. Still crap, but better than it was out of the box.</p>
<p>Had the phone for about 4 months and finally got tired of it, picked up a Google Nexus 6P which was the same generation as the S6E but running stock Android. My world made sense again</p></div>		</li>
