<p>Now, why are the hairs in one spot more sensitive than the hairs in another spot? No one knows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recent science seems to suggest that its actually the muscles at the front and the back of the head pulling on the top of the head (galea) down like a drum, causing reduced blood flow, and thus, higher DHT concentration.  If you take a look at arnold, he wasn't really losing his hair when he was injecting insane amounts of DHT/Testosterone derived steroids into his body.  But now that he's off the juice, he's losing his hair.  It doesn't make much sense if DHT is the cause of MPB.  It also doesn't explain Female Pattern Baldness.  The above accounts for both.</p>
<p>They know this because they injected botox into these muscles, and the hair began growing back. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The proposed mechanism for hair growth in androgenic alopecia after botulinum toxin A treatment is that paralysis of the scalp muscles enhances blood flow to the scalp by reducing the tension on the scalp skin. Because the conversion to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is enhanced in a low-oxygen environment, oxygenated blood reduces this conversion and increases conversion to estradiol. This might be the same mechanism by which minoxidil affects androgenic alopecia. The 18% increase in hair count is similar to that achieved with finasteride. How injecting BTX A into scalp muscles could be protected as intellectual property is difficult to see. </p>

<p>There also is a fungal component for men.  If you're losing your hair as a man, get some Ketokonezol shampoo. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hormones are absolutely the ultimate cause. Check out any male to female transgender transition with hormones. You'll see people who had severe hairline recession and bald spots regrow thick heads of hair when they move from a male to female hormone profile. </p>

<p>The issue is dht accumulation in the scalp, not dht IN General.</p>
<p>Transgendered m to f nuke their dht so that's not an applicable case to this.</p>
<p>Or you could just read the clinical study that's been replicated and proves the point...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That fungal component is terrifying.  I believe my hair thinned quite a bit because of it.  No one notices at all but me, and when I bring up that &quot;oh god, I'm going bald&quot; people think I'm crazy, but once I started having seborrheic dermatitis outbreaks, I noticed a thinning of my hair in the front, middle section where most of the fungus collected.</p>
<p>I now use anti-fungals, and if I go off them and try to use anything else that doesn't dry the fuck out of my hair, it comes back after a wash or 2.  I used to be able to use it and not go 6 months without another use :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told that men have three different types of hair on their heads: the top part (which is the typical bald zone), the sides and back (not typically affected), and facial hair. This is why men's beards and mustaches can be coarse and even a different colour. The top hair is what is most affected by the change in hormones. </p></div>		</li>
