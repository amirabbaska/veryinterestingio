<p>EDIT:  They do, thanks everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Red Cross pairs the two units together often but they are not strictly the same thing. You can take the AED class without CPR and vice versa, but every time I've ever been certified it was through a &quot;CPR and AED&quot; refresher because that's what most employers demand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe they include aed training now as well. Mine did about 6 years ago in Illinois. Probably because they are becoming more common and code in schools and govt buildings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the same true of AED's? The whole point of an AED is that a lay person can use it successfully with no training if they follow the instructions on the device. I think the better ones will also relay spoken instructions during use in response to what it senses in the patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually gotten to go through a fire extinguisher course once, can't remember the reason why.  It was hosted by the Fire Department and was well done.</p>
<p>It didn't just cover how and when to use an extinguisher along with actually using them to put out fires, but also fires where you need to smother the flames as opposed to the extinguisher (like a large grease fire).  It was fun running up to a roaring fire with a blanket like &quot;I got this!&quot;.  It was mostly a confidence course, since that's really what you need to fight a fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a fun but also super useful course. Fire is such a panic enducing situation that any prepractice would be awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. One of the things stressed in my first aid class is that when someone has a cardiac event, quick response is critical. Literal seconds could be the difference between 20% chance of survival  and 60%. </p></div>		</li>
