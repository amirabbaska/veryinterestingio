			<div class="markdown"><p>With my poor understanding, if there were a hole in your lungs, perhaps at the bottom, and a pump installed that continually evacuated water from your lungs, would you be able to get enough/any oxygen from the water using our otherwise unchanged lungs? Would we be able to remove co2? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A person could get some oxygen that way, but there's just way less oxygen dissolved in water than is present in air.  It would not be enough to maintain consciousness, and I'm unsure if it would be enough to prevent brain death.</p>
<p>I think a common amount of dissolved oxygen in habitable water is 8 mg/L.  Compare this to air, which has on the order of 284 mg/L oxygen.</p>
<p>(Air density is 1.225 g/L at sea level and 15Â°C, and the weight percent of oxygen is 23.2%, so .232 * 1.225 = 0.284g/L or 284mg/L)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But, following from what /u/BitOBear said, the process of breathing goes through water anyway.   So you've got that 8 mg/L absorption bottle neck already in place, don't you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, your lungs are a tree with the air on the inside. Gills are a tree with the air (oxygen source) on the outside.</p>
<p>So look at a tree. There is no place to put the drain where it would drain all the leaves, it would only drain the path from the trunk to the drain.</p></div>		</li>
