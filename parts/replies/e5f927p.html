			<div class="markdown"><p>All the &quot;stand up and honor our vets!&quot; stuff you get at some games. Any time you have a pregame event where they are doing an &quot;honor this game's vets&quot; thing and you see a person up there, that is literally a paid advertisement by the dod. The military fly overs, big events with a color guard or making a big deal about folding or unfolding a flag. All the same.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of American sporting events have an elaborate pregame ritual that involves the presentation of the colors (the flag) by the color guard, singing of the Star-Spangeled Banner, and depending on the importance of the game - a military fly-over involving jet aircraft or helicopters.  </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvGUWJW4YUA" target="_blank">Here is just one example</a> of which there are so many others.  Its an impressive spectacle - but also completely unnecessary in my opinion.    </p></div>		</li>
