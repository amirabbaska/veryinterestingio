			<div class="markdown"><p>I think using network effects best explains the phenomenon here.
With operating systems there are very strong networks effects: developers will only produce software for the most popular operating systems and hence we will naturally gravitate towards very few (or perhaps only one) operating system.</p>
<p>With cars there are fewer networks effects, and so more competition is permitted. Hence we can have 5+ competitors. The only benefit now is from economies of scale, which are obviously limited at a certain value (I guess if there were no choice in types of cars then there would be more EoS possible and hence competition may be further reduced to a monopoly).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same happens with videogame consoles.  Often games are only released on the most popular platform, rather than all three.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a lot of cars are based on common platforms and share a majority of parts. VW does this for the Golf and Audi A3 for eg. but itâ€™s common throughout the industry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but economies of scale are only important if you have a large output. In the car market people want different types of car etc meaning that the optimal quantity is lower than the minimum efficient scale of the industry (because, as you point out, these are very capital intensive industries)</p></div>		</li>
