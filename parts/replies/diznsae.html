			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Reef&quot; (and similar words in other European languages) also refers to the folds in a sail when it's taken in to reduce its area; this usage may have preceded its application to similar ridge-like underwater structures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>fwiw, the &quot;reefs&quot; around Cedar Key and up the coast are just sand bars.  There's no coral anywhere around there.  I used to fish there a lot when I lived in FL. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reefs are all pretty much the same stuff world wide (obviously I know there are different species but they all work the same basic way).  A big part of it requires something for the coral to attach to to start with.  That is why artificial reefs are so successful.  Artificial reefs work anywhere that the water temp/ph/nutrients/turbidity are within the range that coral like.<br />
Ceder Key is far to the east of the Mississippi River Delta and does not appear to have any other major rivers dropping a large sediment load nearby.  So the water probably meets the requirements.  As long as the coral had something to attach to they would do fine.  Looking it up it seems artificial reefs are common in the area.  I imagine it has something to do with what the bottom is made of in the area but I do not have that info readily available to confirm my hypothesis.  </p>
<p>As for different types, yes there are a number of types usually having to do with the shape and general location of the reef relative or absent of land forms.</p>
<p>extra bit.  Found this site: (<a href="http://www.floridagofishing.com/reefs/nc-reefs-levy-county.html" target="_blank">http://www.floridagofishing.com/reefs/nc-reefs-levy-county.html</a>) that shows what the reefs in the area are made from for Ceder Key (ie Levy County)</p></div>		</li>

<p>water is too deep for coral to form and thrive.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not true at all. There are several species of deep-water, reef-building corals in the Gulf of Mexico (ex. <em>Lophelia pertusa</em> which can be found over 500m deep). You can check out more about them on <a href="https://deepseacoraldata.noaa.gov" target="_blank">NOAA's website</a>! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree but was limiting the response to try to be in line with his question.   When i used to use Deep sea ROVs we would see the structures far below the light limit giant coral fans and the like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>true. I was limiting my answer to shallow corals as that seemed to be his concern.  </p></div>		</li>
