			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean maybe but I doubt the salt alone did this. Something else must have been wrong too. If you lift a heavy suitcase your blood pressure may (temporarily) be twice it's normal resting level. This normal change is far outside the variation you might see from diet.</p>
<p>tl;dr: salt can't change your BP very much; look for another explanation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It started because I wore the largest pair of work boots I could find and still couldn't fit my feet in them. </p>
<p>I no longer wear the boots, but it's still healing. </p>
<p>I don't have health insurance in the US either. I don't deserve it because I'm was a temp worker.</p>
<p>I quit to work part time and now I don't deserve it because I'm not working 40 hours like I was before.</p>
<p>I've come to accept that I'll die of something preventable and have to live with my pain.</p></div>		</li>
