			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and it should be that also in plasma. The radioactivity is caused by unstable nucleus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  The atoms' nuclei don't change when they are freed from crystalization.  In fact, the gas is put in a centrifuge to concentrate the heavier U232 atoms which are less stable, in order to create so-called atomic fuel.  (I, for one, disapprove of this behavior!)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, like CO2, pretty sure if it's hot enough the carbon and oxygen don't stay together as CO2.</p>

<p>Anything should fall apart to periodic elements if heated enough. </p>
<p>his is about air heated to high temps:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then, at much higher temperatures (30,000+ K), they will dissociate into individual atoms (unless they're already single atoms, like argon or helium). Finally, at a significantly higher temperature yet (above 100,000 K), they start losing electrons and become a plasma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It really doesn't matter what compound it is and what kind of bonds it has, around those magnitudes of temps they will break apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, the radioactivity is in the nucleus. If you heat that high enough that it breaks.... well, that is whole another ballgame then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They mean chemical bonds, not nuclear bonds. The nucleus still stays the same, you just liberate the electrons. Nuclear decay can't be influenced by simply heating them up. Unless you hear them to temperatures where fusion is possible. But that's not a simple plasma anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Actually all elements have a boiling point, no mention of plasma:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lenntech.com/periodic-chart-elements/boiling-point.htm" target="_blank">https://www.lenntech.com/periodic-chart-elements/boiling-point.htm</a></p>
<p>Tungsten is the highest at 5660K.  The boiling point on the new man-made elements is unknown.</p></div>		</li>
