<p>Female viewers are more habit driven in the morning, and more likely to just <strong>let the TV talk in the background</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Describes me fianc√©e to a T. She does this, and always has while she showers/does her hair and make-up routine every morning. Never once does she ever actually watch the tv. I've turned it off, only moments later here her complain that her background noise is off.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Male viewers are more often driven ~~~~ getting the weather before they tune-out in the morning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This describes myself daily, I watch the news either the night before, or in the morning, simply to see if its going to be really hot/really cold, so I can dress appropriately. and to see if it will rain/snow on me since I often work outdoors, and I need to know what to expect, I tune out everything else and channel surf until I get that info. </p>
<p>I only watch local news for the weather, otherwise I'd watch the national news shows like Good Morning America on ABC, CBS This Morning on CBS, or Today/Today This Morning on NBC and never watch them for weather</p>
<p>Additionally, ABC and NBC often, and usually are the screaming crowds in the background, play way too much celebrity BS and can be tuned out after 10 minutes. CBS is the only national morning news that keeps it watchable, about the fucking news!</p>
<p>The first 15 minutes of each national news rarely has and commercial interruption, but after that a lot more, and the last 12 minutes of their broadcast is basically unwatchable because they play 2 seconds of news followed by 3 minutes of commercials. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No commercials in the first 15 (the A-Block) is by design. Keeps the viewer locked in for more than 5 minutes = ratings. If a viewer stays for 15 = ratings for the half hour. You add to the hour cumulative rating that way. Then in the back half of the first half hour they have to load it with ads to ensure they deliver the ad spots they sold are shown. </p>
<p>Then the process repeats at the bottom of the hour. Roughly 15 minutes of news (at least more than 5) and rinse and repeat to the closing of the hour. The last 5 minutes of the top of the hour will be chalk full of rapid fire news stories and a crap load of teases. Got to keep those viewers engaged and make them stay through commercials. It's all about playing the ratings game.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and here i thought the first segment of the show i watch was long because it was more in depth. </p>
<p>do DVR views count towards ratings? i never figured out how they count those. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weather apps don't have that personal touch. Younger people and lately for more and more (past 6 months) the trend is to use apps during your average day more often. But older people place more trust in being told the weather rather than just seeing it. They trust the weather forecaster more because they are talking to you, the viewer. A smartphone doesn't talk to you - it's not human. It's great for the weather check but to get a forecast that's where the human connection, the trust, comes into play.</p>
<p>When there is severe weather - people still turn in droves to local news - because they are going to tell them the weather. What it means, what to expect. It's being told by another person, that reassurance that if they are in the studio telling you something that it is important and you can trust them. Weather apps don't give you that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of a former co-worker I had. When I built houses in a very liberal city I worked with a ~50 year old dude who had lived in that city his whole life but was very conservative. Every day at lunch we'd sit down at one of the diners in town, he'd order the daily special and a side of french toast and open up the cities local paper. After about a minute he'd start groaning, wincing, sighing, and shaking his head. Then after about 15 minutes he'd put down the paper and look at me with a very concerned face and say &quot;Can you Beeelieeeve what these libberuls are doing?!&quot;. Every day for the three years I worked with him and from the others I spoke to for many years before, he's probably still doing that shit today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Granted my post was a little late to the party - it seems to be being well received now after a bit. </p>
<p>Sometimes, it is hard in my line of work not to boil every person down to the stereotypes or demos they fit or should fit. Seeing individuals is actually pretty hard to do now because of all the exposure I get to the collective mindset of viewers and consumers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Profiling works though.  If it didn't then millions of people wouldn't watch.  If people downvote you it's because they can not handle the truth of reality:  They are being manipulated and objectified as a &quot;viewer&quot; rather than a human being and that's a tough pill to swallow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not even particularly offensive; it's just a description of what different types of viewers are looking for based on lifestyles and schedules (morning time maybe being more free, the difference between programming designed for background noise while multitasking and more active viewing). There's a comment chain further down which actively <em>does</em> imply that women demand vapid programming, but this ain't it.</p></div>		</li>
