			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't. Another poster mentioned creating a ring by destroying another body so that it produces a &quot;debris ring&quot; around the star. These aren't stable, they need to be replenished constantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was thinking something as visible as Saturn's rings (and I have no idea how one goes about describing or measuring that). </p>
<p>So, when a star ignites, it blows away all the little stuff and close stuff. I suppose if a couple of planets collided (as unlikely as that may be), they could form a debris field but the amount of material would be so small that it would not be much of a ring ... or, if there was sufficient amount of material, it would just coalesce into a planet.</p></div>		</li>
