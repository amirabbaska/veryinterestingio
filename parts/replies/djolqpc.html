			<div class="markdown"><p>this sounds like a really shitty system. I don't know boxing at all, but I always assumed it was slightly more objective.</p>
<p>So in a close round where one fighter is doing one thing well, and the other is doing a different thing well, it's essentially down to what the judge subjectively prioritizes?</p>
<p>Do matches somehow shake out in such a way the system works, despite sounding garbage on paper?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if one fighter is getting effective hits in, is the other fighter's defense really that good? </p>
<p>Frankly, a close round is one where both fighters are doing the exact same things just as well. If you have two fighters who are really aggressive and letting their defense suffer, and they both get a lot of effective hits on each other, it's harder to score. If you have two fighters who are both defending really well at the expense of their offense, it's harder to score. But if you have one fighter focusing on offense and one focusing on defense, then it's kinda simple to see which strategy is working out.</p>
<p>I mean, I don't see what it would mean to score rounds &quot;objectively&quot;. One's definition of an &quot;effective hit&quot; can make one style seem stronger on paper than it actually is. For example, if you wanted to score a person's offense based on the number of hits they land past the gloves, no matter how hard, then you favor fighters with rapid, weaker styles over fighters with slower, stronger styles, even if the eye test shows that the second fighter is basically sacrificing a few weak body shots in exchange for devastating blows. </p>
<p>If you want a truly objective victory, then you're looking for a knockout. Otherwise, the eye test has actually worked surprisingly well over time. </p>
<p>It also doesn't hurt that, as there are 3 judges, if one judge has a subjective bias and values something very differently, if the other two judges score normally, their decision would overrule that unorthodox judge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean yes and no if it goes the distance it could be pretty clear one boxer was on top and just couldn't land the knockout. Michael Conlan an Irish boxer lost by decision in Rio and it was fairly controversial because he seemingly had the upper hand but their decision said otherwise. On top of that Mayweather is an expert point scorer and frankly it makes a lot of his fights seemingly pretty boring because he's not looking for a knockout he's just looking to win, and if you look at his fight stats like punches landed vs punches thrown he wins on paper a lot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is there <em>any</em> logical reason at all that Pacquiao lost the fight last night besides corrupt judging? He connected with nearly double the % and amount of connected punches, total and each round. He almost TKO'd the opponent in the 9th, ref told his opponent he needed to stop now and that if he didn't see something in the 10th he was going to stop it. Pacman just generally fucked him up most of the fight. </p>
<p>Jeff Horn won 115-113 unanimously in his home country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The metrics you are referring to are also subjective (marked by humans). Horn looked shaky in the 9th but he was still standing, defending and contesting. Throughout the fight Horn had ring control (where are the stats for this??) while Manny was waiting (did an alien swap Manny with a clone? He was a shadow of his former self) doing what he could to neutralise Horn's aggression by ducking and clinching. Horn had quantity throughout, Manny had quality moments. I thought it was a split decision and I couldn't tell the winner. I think Manny let too much of the fight pass by waiting for opportunities, also that the judges didn't like Manny's defending: I thought Manny guard was being broken, the judges agree, the statistics apparently do not agree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was counter punching the fuck out of him the while fight. As for the &quot;subjective&quot; stats I listed, while they can be wrong if one fighter has double the percentage and punches as the other it's a pretty safe bet a miscount here and there doesn't matter. Ring control doesn't mean anything in a fight where you can't hit your opponent. </p></div>		</li>
