			<div class="markdown"><p>This one is legit. Anybody who knows anything about speech anatomy and physiology knows they are vocal <em>folds</em> not vocal <em>cords</em>. </p>
<p>Have to agree with other commenters though, this is a bit too advanced for an ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cords is the colloquial term, just like &quot;voice box.&quot; Your vocal &quot;cords&quot; are flaps of tissue made of a jello-like outer layer and a muscle-y inner layer. Because they are flaps, the way air pushes through them causes them to vibrate a certain way, depending on how loose/taut the flaps are (edit: and how close they are together).</p>
<p>Picture them like your lips. Put your lips together but not tightly, then blow air through them until you blow a raspberry. This is a very dumbed down demonstration of how your vocal folds work (this is ELI5 afterall!). They aren't literal cords like a cord of rope.  </p></div>		</li>
