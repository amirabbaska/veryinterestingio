			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure but so does the definition of &quot;east&quot; and &quot;west.&quot; We define our N,E,S,W such that the earth rotates in a way that you will drift east in a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My initial simple thought believed the object would hit the west wall, due to the direction the Earth rotates.</p>
<p>The last sentence says &quot;Explain why the deflection is always to the east.&quot;</p>
<p>Am I using an incorrect reference frame or something?  Are they talking about the direction of rotation of the Earth, or the delta between starting position at the top of the shaft to the impact at bottom?</p>
<p>I read it as the object's movement...  Somehow I've needed something simple up and I don't know how.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top of the building, being further from the center of the earth, has a higher linear velocity than the ground. A falling object will, absent external forces, retain this velocity as it falls, and will move faster to the east than objects at a low height. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your angular velocity is the same but since the circumference of your path increase as your distance from the centre of the earth increases, your tangential velocity is higher at the top of the shaft. If you fall in a vacuum youâ€™ll keep your forward velocity, but the tangential velocity of the point of the shaft on the same level as you will gradually decrease, causing you to hit the east wall. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Once it clicked, I got it and now it makes logical sense.  I just couldn't get it reconciled in my mind earlier.</p></div>		</li>
