			<div class="markdown"><p>Having researched this subject for all of about twenty minutes now, I do not believe that the switch from lithium to aluminum would be easy, or even doable. For only one reason: aluminum batteries are non rechargable. Unlike lead acid, or Lithium batteries, in order to get the power out of the aluminum batteries, the aluminum undergoes a change that it irreversible by standard charging techniques, and would have to be recycled. </p>
<p>However, all hope is not lost. If all car companies could agree on a standard battery design, and have it be quick to change, a gas station would only need an attendant and a forklift to change the battery, get the old one to a recycling center, and the new one in the car. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe its tesla that has an automated system for this already. Theres a plate on the ground that you drive over and it has a mechnism to simultaneously unscrew all the locations that hold the battery plate on at once, then pops a new one on. I think the whole thing takes half the time of a fill up.</p>
<p>EDIT: It appears the program is cancelled now, but heres the original unveiling <a href="https://www.tesla.com/videos/battery-swap-event" target="_blank">https://www.tesla.com/videos/battery-swap-event</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They look promising only because they are theoretically possible. I work in a materials lab that does work with batteries and aluminum is super early in development. You can get it to work, but for such a short amount of time that they are essentially useless in their current state. There is an incredible number of criteria you need to satisfy to make the switch to a new battery chemistry from lithium actually worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How so? As I recall Lithium is near the top of the standard electrode potential list. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_electrode_potential_(data_page" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_electrode_potential_(data_page</a>)</p>
<p>I would assume the biggest gain would be in Strontium Flourine batteries. Of course, these materials are kind of volatile so I don't expect Strontium Flourine batteries to appear for a long time.</p></div>		</li>
