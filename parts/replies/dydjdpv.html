			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably more like vinyl to CD since neither are lossy and one simply has a higher definition than the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, which is better, vinyl or mp3?</p>
<p>Edit: I have to ask because there used to be an ad for digital protectors that said it's like going from vinyl to mp3.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically mp3s are less precise than vinyl since they are a lossy algorithm (they throw some stuff out in exchange for a smaller file). Think about it like jpeg, when an image is saved as a jpeg, it's usually smaller but the process degrades the image quality which is why you'll often see some form of artifact in the image.  </p>
<p>Now as for which is better is purely subjective on what you value.  If you value warmth, character and the experience of listening to your music, vinyl is probably for you.  If you value straight accuracy then CDs are probably the way for you to go.  </p>
<p>MP3s were great because a full lossless rip of a CD was something like 600MB but MP3s could cut that down to less than a tenth of the size.  When digital music players only had hard drives in the 500MB to 5GB range, that meant either carrying just a couple albums around with you or carrying around as many as 100 albums with you at the cost of some highs and lows but given the quality of headphones at the time, I doubt anyone would have noticed.  </p>
<p>So you have to decide for yourself which is better based on what you value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MP3 can vary in its bitrate. I think no one can differentiate a 320kbit/s MP3 from Vinyl in a blind test. This bitrate is also used if you have Spotify Premium for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The microphones weren't that bad in the sixties, some of the best sounding microphones today are from that time or modeled after their circuitry.</p>
<p>It was largely the medium on which it was stored that degraded the quality, due to compression, saturation or self-noise. Additionally, much of the recordings from the time of the 60s that was stored on inferior tapes have degraded before being digitized or restored, so some of the bad sounding movies would have sounded better at the time too.</p>
<p>But as another commenter said, Kubrick used material that has a great sounding and apparently long-lasting strip for its audio, and the tapes were probably stored very carefully. Hence, still a great sounding movie.</p>
<p>Anyone more knowledgeable on the details, please correct me if I am wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about the color, but microphones were actually quite good even back then. The signature bloated midrange sound from older films may have been due to worse noise reduction technology. They probably didn't have much noise leaking into their soundstage so the audio remains relatively pristine.</p></div>		</li>
