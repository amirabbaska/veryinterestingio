			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. If a ref believes a fighter has sustained an injury that would prohibit him/her from fighting (more importantly, being able to protect him/herself), the ref would call in a doctor to examine the fighter. The doctor will usually ask the fighter if they wish to continue fighting. However if the doctor believes the injury is too severe, (a major cut over the eye that affects the fighter's ability to see, a fractured arm/leg/jaw, joint dislocation) he will say the fighter is unable to continue and the ref will stop the fight.
Of course, each situation is up to the ref's discretion. But for the most part, a swollen face wouldn't be enough to stop a fight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little late to the discussion, but it's in the rules that you need vision in both eyes to fight. A swollen face is enough to stop the fightfight if the fighter can't prove to the doctor that he can see out of that eye. Then again, that does mean that the ref would have to call a doctor to look at it in the first place. Source: am a Mma fighter. Jake shields actually almost won the gsp fight due to an eye poke. He poked gsp in the eye a couple times, and gsp kept complaining to his corner about not being able to see with it. If for any reason a doctor was called to look at it and confirmed that gsp could only see one eye he would have lost the title. Good thing he didn't because that would have been some bull. </p></div>		</li>
