			<div class="markdown"><p>You put the /s but that's actually a valid statement.  Major life changes are a legitimate trigger for depression, whether that be the birth of a child, marriage, divorce, a change in or loss of job, etc. </p>
<p>You learn that, yes, your life is not your own, and you've got big responsibility in ways that you might never had before, it can be a lot of pressure.  Maybe you comforted yourself in a rocky relationship that you could leave at any time, but with a child now this has an impact on their life.  Maybe you were kind of on the edge with stress to start with but could manage it because of the freedom you had in the evenings and you come to realize that this freedom is gone. </p>
<p>I wouldn't say it's caused by it, but that realization certainly contributes to potential causes. </p></div>		</li>
