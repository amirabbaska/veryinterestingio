			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, the redshift when light hits a stationary mirror is negligible. A 1 kg mirror will get a delta V of around 10^(-27) m/s from a green photon. That implies the energy lost to the mirror is on the order of 10^(-54) joules. The redshift of the photon will be on the order of 10^(-36). That would be... hard to measure.  </p>
<p>You get much more significant redshifts if the mirror is already moving, and in that case the Doppler redshift is proportional to the velocity of the mirror. Note that you can also get a Doppler blue shift - if a mirror is moving towards the light, the photons gain energy during the reflection. </p>
<p>You can compare it to throwing an ideal elastic ball at a bus. If the bus is coming at you, the ball will bounce back with more kinetic energy than it had when you threw it. If the bus is moving away from you, the ball loses energy. If the bus is still, the ball bounces back with nearly the same energy. Technically, the ball does push the bus+ earth back a little in the last case to conserve momentum, but you can feel pretty safe ignoring that effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not quite correct. The amount of energy the photon loses is dependent on the material structure of the mirror. When the photon reflects from the mirror, some number of atoms in the mirror will recoil, and that recoil determines the energy loss. The material structure determines how many atoms recoil, and thus the magnitude of the energy loss.</p>
<p>Mossbauer Spectroscopy takes advantage of this. In Mossbauer spectroscopy, a very highly crystalized gamma radiation source is used. The material and crystal structure are chosen so that the entire crystal is forced to recoil when a gamma is emitted. This happens because the recoil energy of the gamma is below the first excited state of the crystal lattice - therefore, the crystal cannot vibrate.</p>
<p>So to reiterate, the actual energy loss during a reflection is dependent on the material type and material structure (ignoring molecular absorption etc etc).</p>
<p>You cannot assume that the entire mirror is recoiling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is still not fully clear and correct - a high energy photon may inelastically scatter with electrons in the crystal, but I don't think this is quite what OP is getting at. For visible photons, and a mirror at rest, the photons which reflect are reflected perfectly elastically. The loss of energy comes from the absorption of photons and the dissipation of their energy. within the mirror. This resuces the beam intensity, and hence the total beam energy. But the photons which are reflected emerge with exactly the same energy.
You can bounce a blue laser beam off a million mirrors - it won't be red afterwards. :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the mirror is not fixed to anything (eg floating in space) one could assume the whole mirror would react eventually, even if the single photon was long gone by time the outside edge of the mirror felt the &quot;push&quot; the momentum would transfer eventually right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I read those explanations about reflecting of a mirror and the weigth of the entire mirror being involved just seemed a bit <em>off</em>. Thanks for clarifying</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you happen to know how this works out in terms of relativity? So whether the mirror is moving or not is dependent on my frame of reference, but the light always travels at the speed of light. Does that mean my perceived redshift of the light changes based on the velocity of my relatavistic frame of reference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If you are moving, the photons going towards you become blue shifted and the photons moving away from you become red shifted. So what I think is a green beam before and after the reflection, you would see it as a red beam hitting a moving mirror and turning blue (or vice versa, depending on the sign of your velocity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not even taking into account that mirrors are usually mounted on something much heavier than themselves and would reduce the change in energy by even more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe that's accurate. The delta-V would be smaller, but the energy transfer would be the same. Wouldn't it?</p>
<p>As a classical analogy, if I bounce a baseball off of a basketball, I'd expect to see the basketball start moving. If I bounce a baseball off of a stadium, I expect the stadium to remain stationary. In both cases, I think the amount of energy transferred is the same. But maybe I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will happen pretty much instantaneously to the naked eye too.</p>
<p>But I recall reading something about the speed of light being so low inside of synthetic diamonds  that they can continue shining for a noticeable amount of time.</p>
<p>I may be wrong but I thing that's what explains diamond fluorescence. When exposed to UV or X-rays, the light slowing down inside the diamond emits visible cherenkov radiation.</p></div>		</li>

					<ul class="replies">
		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/empireofjade" target="_blank">empireofjade</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Internal reflection is still a reflection.  Actually, perfect mirrors are achieved using this phenomenon and dielectric mirrors.  When absorption occurs, the energy from the light is converted to internal energy of the reflector, usually by the electrons and usually in the form of heat.  Depending on the material absorbing the light, only certain electron energy states will be available.  For this reason materials will not absorb light of all frequencies equally, but only light at frequencies which match the energy needed to reach a new quantum state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, does the fact that the photon transfers energy imply that the photon does not actually reflect off the mirror with -p, but rather a value slightly more positive?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RedGene" target="_blank">RedGene</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Total energy is conserved, so if the photon transfers finite energy to the particles of the mirror, it must then be reflected with a lower magnitude of momentum.</p></div>		</li>
