<p>Aeby wore welder's goggles, though one of them had a crack in it and the brilliant light burned into his vision for some time apparently. The only mention I can find of where they were relative to the blast is Hans Bethe saying that the observation site of Compania Hill was 20 km away.</p>

<p>Dick Feynman watched it through a truck windshield, but at 20 miles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They gave out dark glasses that you could watch it with. Dark glasses! Twenty miles away, you couldn't see a damn thing through dark glasses. So I figured the only thing that could really hurt your eyes (bright light can never hurt your eyes) is ultraviolet light. I got behind a truck windshield, because the ultraviolet can't go through glass, so that would be safe, and so I could see the damn thing. </p>
<p>Time comes, and this tremendous flash out there is so bright that I duck, and I see this purple splotch on the floor of the truck. I said, &quot;That's not it. That's an after-image.&quot; So I look back up, and I see this white light changing into yellow and then into orange. Clouds form and disappear again--from the compression and expansion of the shock wave. </p>
<p>Finally, a big ball of orange, the center that was so bright, becomes a ball of orange that starts to rise and billow a little bit and get a little black around the edges, and then you see it's a big ball of smoke with flashes on the inside of the fire going out, the heat. </p>
<p>All this took about one minute. It was a series from bright to dark, and I had seen it. I am about the only guy who actually looked at the damn thing--the first Trinity test. Everybody else had dark glasses, and the people at six miles couldn't see it because they were all told to lie on the floor. I'm probably the only guy who saw it with the human eye. </p>

<p>Turns out he wasn't the only one; Ralph Smith, later to be assistant director of LANL, watched with one eye behind welders glass, but the other eye unprotected.</p></div>		</li>
