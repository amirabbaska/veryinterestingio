<p>Isn't that basically what the difference between gaits is--you change the frequency and phase of your steps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm very green to the field but as I understand it gaits are defined by two distinct moments in the gait cycle, The duty factor and the support cycle. </p>
<p>So kinda. If you just change the phase I believe the gait for something with as many legs as a centipede still falls under the same category of wave or ripple gait. But I guess each one is technically a unique gait. This spring I'm taking a class in anatomy and kinesiology so my understanding could be incorrect. </p></div>		</li>
