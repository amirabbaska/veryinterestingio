<p>There are also reports coming out that it was a rebel weapons cache. </p></div>		</li>

<li>He's not actually &quot;winning&quot; just yet.  This has gone on for six years, even with Russian support there's still large areas of bitterly contested territory.</li>
<li>His image is already at rock bottom.</li>
<li>Despite all the recent bluster, there's still insufficient reason to believe there will be a significant response from the west.</li>
<li>Russia support won't be &quot;destroyed&quot; by this.  It may suffer a mild and/or temporary setback, but the support will continue.</li>
<li>&quot;Makes no logical sense&quot; -- untrue, but let's assume it's true.  It's still irrelevant, decisions in war are often illogical, or based on the more brute logic, &quot;kill the enemy any way we can, don't get killed&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;there is something deeper going on&quot; -- that's automatically true, historically war is more complex than the initial news reports, and take years to properly analyze for deeper information.  However, that does not inevitably lead to a &quot;false flag&quot; conclusion; you actually need actual evidence to lead to that, not &quot;just asking questions&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;you can't trust anything you hear, see or read in the media&quot; -- false in the way you pose the statement, which implies &quot;therefore, the truth must be the opposite of what you hear, see, or read in the media&quot;, or more likely, &quot;I'm going to only believe information that confirms what I already think&quot;.</li>
<li>&quot;The conflict in Syria is far more a complex issue than what it appears to be&quot; -- too tautologous and therefore useless for our particular issue.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's not actually &quot;winning&quot; just yet. - He's in a far better position in the war than he was. So again, why would he do such an attack which is almost definitely going to cause international outrage/intervention?</p>
<p>It's still irrelevant, decisions in war are often illogical, or based on the more brute logic, &quot;kill the enemy any way we can, don't get killed&quot;. - LOL strategic planning is something I guess you haven't heard of.</p>
<p>However, that does not inevitably lead to a &quot;false flag&quot; conclusion; you actually need actual evidence to lead to that, not &quot;just asking questions&quot;. - nobody said its a false flag. Nevertheless, US immediately blamed Assad without any actual evidence &amp; released statements about wanting to take action over the attack. This attack is just what they needed for international support to spread US'freedom', kinda like those elusive WMD's in Iraq.</p>
<p>the truth must be the opposite of what you hear, see, or read in the media&quot;, or more likely, &quot;I'm going to only believe information that confirms what I already think&quot;. - I guess you've never heard of media agendas? Again, who benefits most by potraying that Assad did the attack? The US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's in a far better position in the war than he was. So again, why would he do such an attack which is almost definitely going to cause international outrage/intervention? -- doesn't mean the war is A) ultimately going to turn in his favor B) going to be resolved quickly enough to avoid turning the country into an easy target for other countries.  In fact, that's a good argument against a &quot;false flag&quot; by Turkey or the US, as a longer civil war just makes the country weaker; why run a &quot;false flag&quot; op when you can just let the war drag on even longer and waltz in after both sides are decimated?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LOL strategic planning is something I guess you haven't heard of -- I'll assume you're not trying to be insulting, but that's not even a rebuttal to my statement, unless you're asserting that there's never been an illogical or irrational act in the history of war and everyone has engaged in sufficient &quot;strategic planning&quot; as you put it.</p>
</li>
<li>nobody said its a false flag -- patently untrue, although perhaps by &quot;nobody&quot; you mean yourself and your peers.  Sure, I've seen some alternate explanations of it being accidental (bombing a site that was a rebel stockpile), but that's stretching almost as much as the false flag scenario (largely dependent on the chemical involved, if Sarin the logistics are ridiculously difficult), and the &quot;false flag&quot; group is, if not the majority, rather strident here.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, US immediately blamed Assad without any actual evidence -- also untrue, unless you discount all news sources that don't fit your beliefs.</p>
<p>&amp; released statements about wanting to take action over the attack -- what do you expect?  A big &quot;meh&quot; over this?</p>
<p>This attack is just what they needed for international support to spread US'freedom', kinda like those elusive WMD's in Iraq -- ohgeezenotthisagain, seriously, even if you take 100% of every anti-US allegation as gospel truth, there's nothing to make the opposition more trustworthy, so if you're going that route you might as well throw up your hands and state you have no idea what's going on at all.</p>
<p>I guess you've never heard of media agendas?  -- which does not prove or disprove the allegation that Assad used chemical weapons on his own people.  I can think all day that the media is conspiring to find evidence against group x, but that doesn't mean the evidence against group x is invalid.  Sometimes people with agendas do find the proof they need, so just saying the media wants Assad to be the bad guy here means nothing.</p>
<p>Again, who benefits most by portraying that Assad did the attack? The US.  -- Which, again, proves nothing.  Who benefited most by proving the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor?  The US OMG IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE AMERICANS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO BOMB JAPAN.</p></div>		</li>
