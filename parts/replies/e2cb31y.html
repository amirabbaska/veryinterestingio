			<div class="markdown"><p>There are those that will tell you that neutron stars are just gigantic clumps of neutrons, but they are only stable because of their gravity. A neutron on its own, or in small numbers (less than the mass that will produce significant gravity - still <em>huge</em> numbers), will decay into the components of a hydrogen atom - a proton and an electron - because doing so puts it in a lower energy state than remaining as a neutron.</p>
<p>The half life of an unbound neutron is about 10 minutes. They turn into proton/electron pairs fairly quickly, but not as fast as a lot of radioactive atoms decay.</p>
<p>EDIT: your nucleus of 5 neutrons, assuming it stays together, would have one of them decay to a proton, producing Hydrogen 5, which would then decay to Hydrogen 3 (by ejecting 2 neutrons) so quickly that the Hydrogen 5 could hardly be said to have existed at all. The Hydrogen 3 will then eventually decay into Helium 3 when one of the remaining neutrons ejects an electron and becomes a proton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this the reason hydrogen embrittlement is such an issue for materials in nuclear reactors? They trap neutrons which become H atoms which, with their high mobility, can move around the lattice until they hit a void and combine with another H to form a H2 molecule?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of that hydrogen comes from sources other than neutron decay. Free neutrons in a reactor have a much higher probability of being absorbed by something than they do of sticking around for several minutes until they decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protons can become neutrons through a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture" target="_blank">electron capture</a>. This happens in nuclei that have too many protons. Such nuclei have a number of sources, including the products of nuclear fission and the products of nuclear fusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Z is the atomic number (i.e. the number of protons in the nucleus = no. of elections in the neutral atom)</p>
<p>A is the mass number or the number of nucleons (i.e. the number of protons+the number of neutrons)</p></div>		</li>
