			<div class="markdown"><p>A great way to look at it is as a water tower!  Why do we use water towers?  Because we pump water up there all night so that when everyone wakes up and showers at the same time, there is enough water and pressure (that's why they're tall and on hills) for everyone. </p>
<p>Without the towers storing the water, water pumps can't keep up with peak demand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, water towers have also been looked into (maybe used) as energy storage. When we have extra electricity, it can be used to pump water up a hill.  Then the uphill water can flow down and turn a watermill to generate electricity. So it's like a big water-based battery (I'm sure it's less efficient, but it's very cheap and basic).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of a battery farm, it would be better to use already established very efficient energy storage methods in the large context. One such method is storing molten salt in underground storage cells and then extracting the heat when you need the electricity back out. Another great method is by pumping water vertically and then releasing the water out to generate electricity from hydroelectric generators. </p>
<p>Some notes: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Battery storage technology is typically around 50 - &gt;85% efficient</p>
</li>
<li>Energy Grid storage methods already exist that work fairly well and there is a lot of data on such a subject even on Wikipedia. See here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_energy_storage#Flywheel" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_energy_storage#Flywheel</a></li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except you can't spin up either of those quickly or easily add extra storage capacity. We already use hydrostorage in Australia, but it's neither cheap to implement or quick to find land, get approval (friggin NIMBYs) and then build. </p>
<p>Molten salt requires far more foresight + time than South Australia currently has to fix their issues. Ideally its co-located with the turbines, but South Australia's just mothballed most of theirs. They could spin this up at pelican point but it'd be years before they got it running.</p>
<p>If Elon can actually meet the required amount of batteries, this would be a great initial trial of very large scale battery storage and quick to put in place. Great promotion for Tesla as well</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia also has this problem where a lot of their power generation is located at a fairly low amount of places but fairly localized as I have been informed. Since some parts of the population lives far from the power generation, large cables are needed to supply these zones. When wildfires and similar stuff damages the cables, batteries could be the solution to the resulting blackouts in the populated areas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor correction.</p>
<p>The primary point is not to store and displace the energy. The batteries will not have sufficient capacity for that. The proposed battery plan has about 300 MWh storage capacity, whereas daily consumption is about 35 400 MWh.</p>
<p>Rather the batteries are supposed to provide power just long enough for the sluggish coal power plants to catch up to the peak.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few years ago I worked on 1MW trailers using LiFePO4 batteries similar to what Tesla is doing (except they're on an even larger scale).</p>
<p>Something that most people don't know is that traditional power generation always generates more than it needs due to the issues in raising output to meet demand.  They then dump the excess into huge resistive banks to regulate the output.  If you're familiar with LDOs (and what 5yo isn't?) you can think of them as massive shunt regulators.</p>
<p>You can imagine how awful this is from the energy efficiency and planet resource usage POV, but the utility company can just factor it into your bill.  Trailers of batteries that can replace these load banks by sourcing/sinking energy as needed are a much better solution​. </p>

<p>This is one thing that concerns me with all the exciting new energy innovations.</p>
<p>Now that this trend in pricing is set, even if energy company's efficiency goes up and their costs go do, why would they pass THAT onto the consumer?</p>
<p>We're already used to paying what we do and most energy companies are at least (partially) government created monopolies. If Tesla just contracts out and builds battery trailers for energy companies will that even mean anything to consumer's bills?</p></div>		</li>

<p>........non-renewable sources that can be easily turned on and off (like a coal plant)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coal plants need weeks to be turned on, you are thinking of gas plants that can operate on as little as 1/2 an hour notice. In fact Pelican Point was standing by during recent &quot;crisis&quot;  but was not utilised for some reason.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of South Austrians generation is done through wind power........</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generating capacity is not the same as supply.</p>
<p>South Australia has around 38% of its generating capacity in wind but, it does not rely on 38% of its supply on wind. There is enough gas capacity to generate 100% of the states needs and wind has supplied up to 85% of needs.</p>
<p>Edit: Also notice how the critics of wind and renewables are strangely quiet about Tasmania. Tassy has been 100% renewable for quite some time using Hydro electricity and wind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Incorrect, that is current agenda of coal industry. </p>
<p>Wind is predictable and reliable, it is when you fail to use your back up that it becomes a problem like failure to turn on Pelican Point Station during recent &quot;crisis&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
