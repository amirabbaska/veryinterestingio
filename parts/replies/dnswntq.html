			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, one reason is an electrolyte imbalance.  This can be caused by a variety of things, including diet, disease, strenuous exercise, and medications.  Deficiencies in various vitamin B compounds—especially B1, B5, and B6—and minerals like calcium, magnesium, and potassium can cause muscle cramps.  </p>
<p>You can get B-vitamin deficiencies through a vegetarian diet, so many vegetarians and vegans supplement with Brewers yeast.  People who do strict low-carb diets sometimes lack magnesium, which is mainly found in whole grains, beans, and nuts; and potassium, which is mainly found in high-carb vegetables such as squash, potato, and sweet potato; which are banned during the induction phase of the Atkins diet.  </p>
<p>Diseases that interfere with digestion, such as Crohn's and celiac can cause these deficiencies.  Having bariatric surgery is another risk factor.</p>
<p>Exercise causes the body to sweat, and electrolytes are lost during this process.  This is why it is so important to stay hydrated, and why Gatorade was invented.  </p>
<p>Some medications can interfere with electrolytes.  Antacids and insulin block potassium  and magnesium absorption.  Some blood pressure medications and antibiotics interfere with calcium absorption.  </p>
<p>I have a personal connection to this at the moment.  I donated platelets through apheresis this weekend.  The anticoagulant used to prevent your blood from clogging the tubes and machine is a calcium antagonist.  Usually I'm sensible about this, but for some reason I was taking vitamin C supplements instead of calcium supplements.  As a result, I became moderately hypocalcemic—called in this case &quot;citrate toxicity&quot;—and had muscle cramps for hours yesterday, followed today by severe pain as if I'd done a long and intense workout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gatorade supplements certain electrolytes that are depleted through exercise, so yes. But unless you're a professional athlete, you're typically not going to need the full concentration. Half-diluted Gatorade or Pedialyte is usually best for people not exercising at those levels.</p></div>		</li>
