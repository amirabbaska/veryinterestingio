			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. And number systems which themselves use the irrational number as a base (e.g., base π) don't actually make sense. Consider. Base 10 has 10 possible symbols. How many symbols would base π have? Fractional representation does not make sense as a base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Irrational bases do make sense. They have been designed and implemented already. The most well-known example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio_base" target="_blank">Golden Ratio base</a>. </p>
<p>The symbols used for base Pi would be {0,1,2,3}. Numbers between 3 and Pi would have a '3' in the units place and then some other stuff after the radix point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you are in base 3, and you say &quot;I have 11 apples&quot;, you will show that you have 4 apples.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can write that, but you would still say, &quot;I have four apples,&quot; not &quot;I have eleven apples.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. Only redefining the English language so it fits better to a base 3 system will change &quot;four&quot; apples to &quot;eleven&quot; apples. Four is the integer after three, no matter how you want to represent it.</p></div>		</li>
