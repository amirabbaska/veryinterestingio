<p>I've always kept an old water bottle in the slot of my car door to sip from. After several years of daily use, combined with freezing solid on  cold winter days, the bottle can fall apart. But they've never made me sick.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I keep a pack of them, and I like to puzzle my engineering students by showing them one that stayed there over a Colorado winter without being opened; it's partially collapsed and I invite them to explain it...;-)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or increased gas solubility at low water temperature causing absorption from the head space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>where do you live? I've made the mistake of finishing half a bottle of water or gatorade that had sat in my car for a couple of days and definitely had the shits. I live in florida though and my car can reach upwards of 90F if parked in the sun probably over 300 days a year. </p></div>		</li>
