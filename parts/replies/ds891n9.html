			<div class="markdown"><p>The basic idea is that you can write <em>any</em> physically reasonable configuration of the electric field as a (possible infinite) combination of photons. For example, if you want an electric field that is static in time but that oscilates like a sine wave in space, you can get this by combining two photons that are moving in opposite directions. If you want to have a single laser pulse with a with of 50 fs, you can write this as a certain combination of photons all with different frequencies and phase offsets but all moving in the exact same direction.</p>
<p>The reason we do this is that we know exactly how to treat a photon in a quantum-mechanic context, but not how to treat an arbitrary field configuration. In principle we could develop a quantum-mechanical way to treat 'easy' field configurations like a linearly changing electric field, but it is significantly easier to simply write everything using photons because in that way we cover <em>all</em> possible situations with one theory.</p></div>		</li>
