			<div class="markdown"><p>With student loans, they're generally a whole lot more friendly about it than a credit card company would be because they know you're never getting out from under it unless you die.  They'll call, send you letters and all sorts of stuff to try getting you on some sort of repayment plan - even if it's just $20/mo - just to keep your loan in good standing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the truth right here. It's extremely hard to default on a student loan because they basically beg you to pay anything and they will keep you in good standing. I know because I did default on mine. I was young and dumb and just ignored the loan altogether. They waited years before they put me into default and then when they did, they gave me a way out. Seriously, if you are defaulting on your student loan it's because you aren't paying but also because you aren't communicating with them. If I had just told them I was having a hard time paying, I never would have defaulted but I ignored it instead and got what I deserved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did the exact same thing. Once I got talking to them, they bent over backwards to help me get everything going. Were actually quite nice too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I currently have defaulted loans, and they do not want to budge on the payments. When defaulted, i have been able to work out payments with collection agencies in the 50-100 dollar range. Once out of default they want almost 600.00 per month, which is way out of my budget. So i let them default again and pay the reasonable payments. Not the best option but i cannot afford the regular payments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They told me I made too much to lower my payments with the income driven repayment plan. I assured them I didn't due to the high cost of living and a few medical bills at the time.</p>
<p>The next month I explained the situation and they still couldn't help me. At the 3rd month I made a half month's payment to show I was at least trying, but couldn't afford the rest.</p>
<p>Point is, they didn't harass me during this time or the next 3 months it took me to get caught up. Honestly, the library is more aggressive than them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. That “you make too much but not enough in a high CoL” paradox.</p>
<p>It’s the same with MediCal. There’s a huge grey area of underinsured because you weren’t “poor enough” on paper last tax year but you know this tax year you’ll be paying double or triple out of pocket.</p>
<p>Plus paying for your shitty HMO plan which covers nothing and still paying 100% out of pocket for all your meds and visits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience was different. I ignored for a few years then bam, they garnished my check. And we're talking like 40-50%. Had i not being staying with in-laws it would definitely have drove me to suicide. This went for 6 months or so before they would drop it to something more manageable.<br />
I don't remember exact number but I'm saying initially  $350-400 a month.<br />
On the other end my wife has made no payments, no contact. They just take my tax return each year, hence i have to get the dependants and allowances just right so there's none there.</p></div>		</li>
