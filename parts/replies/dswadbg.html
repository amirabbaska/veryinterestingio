			<div class="markdown"><p>Look at the spacing of the legs. When the controller vibrates, the way the legs are shaped and spread out make it want o move forward instead of another direction. You can change this by putting it on an incline, the shape and spacing of the legs, and I think the vibration of the controllers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have something in the shape of the robot shown there and vibrate it, it moves preferentially forward. Think about it like this: if you vibrate something, you’re moving it back and forth really quickly. If you then make it in such a shape that it resists forward movement less than it resists backwards movement, when you vibrate it, it will go forward more than it goes backwards, so it moves. That’s what he means with “preferential movement”.</p>
<p>Now, if you do that in 2 pieces, one on each side, and control them separately, you can steer. Just vibrate one side more, making it move forward more than the other, and that will cause it to turn to the opposite side (imagine taking a small step with your left leg and a big one with your right - you’ll end up facing slightly left). That’s the gist of it.</p></div>		</li>
