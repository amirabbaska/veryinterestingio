<p>Why isnt there more competition in this space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an issue with a few things, most notably the natural monopoly for transmission. Liberalizing power markets is a real thing, but there's draw-backs as well. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if Idaho Power can charge whatever they want in a practical sense, but there are legal limits. This is because they are a public utility, and almost all public utilities have more regulation than other industries.</p>
<p>They are regulated by the <a href="http://www.puc.idaho.gov/about/about.html" target="_blank">Idaho Public Utilities Commission</a> which has power under <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title61/" target="_blank">Title 61</a>. The section of interest is <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/Title61/T61CH3/SECT61-301/" target="_blank">61-301</a>, which requires that charges are just and reasonable (as determined by the IPUC).</p>
<p>I'm not certain how often this power to regulate is actually used (call your congresspeople!) but it exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's kind of a difficult question to answer as every company has different costs and environments.  Nobody can really say &quot;well, at this rate, some will be bankrupt by 20xx&quot; because some will be bankrupt due to other reasons such as mismanagement.  However, I could see there being some layoffs if the trend continues but imo it's unlikely to cause many bankruptcies.  Compare to the coal industry, demand has been dropping due to cleaner and more efficient practices but the industry still exists nonetheless.  </p></div>		</li>
