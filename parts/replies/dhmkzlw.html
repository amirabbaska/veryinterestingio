			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify this, the snapping sound isn't the result of pieces of wood snapping. (like you would snap a twig) It's the studs and beams 'snapping into place' as they shift, expand/contract due to the above reasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hear these cracks all the time in my house.  I always envision some slippage of the nails in the wood.  </p>
<p>I wonder (and hope) the slippage works in both directions; if, during a thermal contraction event, the nail slips out of the wood a little bit, does that same nail work it's way back into wood the same amount during a thermal expansion event.</p></div>		</li>
