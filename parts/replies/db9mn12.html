			<div class="markdown"><p>pi is a number. You can work with it without knowing its positional representation. You use the symbol to notate that number, and use the number's special properties to manipulate it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not if the things in real life are pi-based. For example if we want to build a wall of length 10 pi meters. If we have measuring sticks of length 1 meter, we have to convert our 10 pi metres to decimal. However, if we have measuring sticks of length pi meters, we simply use 10 of those without having to convert. </p></div>		</li>
