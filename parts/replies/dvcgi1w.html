			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible that dark matter and dark energy don't actually exist, but this would lead to a more dramatic upheaval than you might be thinking. A absolute disproving of dark matter would likely lead us to throw out most of modern astrophysics. As you might imagine, this would also be pretty hard to accomplish, what with it not reacting to light and all.</p>
<p>These kinds of additions have been revoked before, though. Aether was introduced into early scientific models to give light a material to travel through (much like sound and other waves need). The famous &quot;Michelson–Morley experiment&quot; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>) showed this couldn't be the case, and so science moved on to realize that Light was made of Photons and therefore didn't need a material to transmit.</p>
<p>Other examples exist, but for now we know that if our observations are correct and that there our current model is accurate to some respect, then some matter exists that we can't see.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's more likely that at some point it's going to get a better name. We haven't proven that it exists. There is something fishy going on, and we have inserted something into the model and now things jive. Dark matter and dark energy are just an aptly name placeholder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work directly in this field.</p>
<p>The phenomena you're referencing is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics" target="_blank">modified newtonian dynamics</a>. While this question is still certainly open for debate, the general consensus within the field has shifted to the point where we almost certainly believe this is a particle and not some unknown property of gravity. There are many reasons for this, but my favorite and probably the most straight forward comes from our observations of the Bullet Cluster. </p>
<p>Take a look at this <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/30094" target="_blank">graphic by NASA</a>. The pink represents where most of the 'normal' matter is. Loose gas, stars, etc. The blue represents where most of the <em>gravity</em> is in the photo. Even though you can't see the mass directly, it warps and distorts our image of the galaxies behind it by a phenomena known as gravitational lensing, which can be preciously measured. When these two clusters collided, all of the gas got slowed down as the galaxies began to interact and merge. However, since dark matter doesn't interact with normal matter very easily (otherwise we would have detected it by now), it flows right through. MOND simply doesn't have an elegant solution to this while the dark matter model does.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a beautiful image. Thanks for that. </p>
<p>I understand that matter and dark matter do not generally interact, but does dark matter interact with <em>other</em> dark matter in a similar (Newtonian) fashion that matter interacts with matter? The linked image makes it seem that the left-bound dark matter didn’t interact with the right-bound. </p>
<p>Edit: after a quick search it appears they do not. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm absolutely a philistine when it comes to these topics, but I can't help notice the fact the dark matter look circular vs the normal matter more spread thin. Any hypothesis on why? I suppose this also hints that the dark matter is pretty evenly spread, and not highly concentrated in black holes type events?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is dark matter all sorts of masses like planets, dead stars, and other things that aren't able to be directly observed because there is no light near enough to them to see or is it something else entirely?  Looking at Wikipedia it seems to indicate this dark matter is made up of things entirely different than objects and materials we're already familiar with, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good explanation. One specific place we see a discrepancy between the matter we can see and the gravitational effects is in the rotation of our own galaxy. At the speed the Milky Way is rotating, it should fly apart because there isn't enough mass to hold it together based on what we can see. This effect is even more noticeable when we look at clusters of galaxies like our local group. They interact with each other much more strongly than they should. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One issue is that we've been unable to detect it locally, and some studies indicate that the mechanics of the local region of space are such that dark matter density locally must be lower than it &quot;should be&quot; for the galaxy to have the amount of dark matter that it supposedly does. However, other papers dispute this.</p>
<p>Dark matter's best evidence for its existence is gravitational lensing disconnected from visible matter, which is an indication that it is something other than just a mathematical kludge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I see estimates of the number of stars in the Milky Way from 100 to 500 billion. How can we be so certain about the percent of normal matter when we have such a large uncertainty in our own galaxy? I assume the uncertainty in the mass of other galaxies is similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is a lot of uncertainty. Just recently, the mass of the <a href="https://www.space.com/39751-andromeda-galaxy-not-bigger-than-milky-way.html" target="_blank">Andromeda Galaxy (our nearest neighbor) has been revised downward.</a> The uncertainty gets smaller (relatively) as the scale of things you're looking at gets larger, though, and the effect of dark matter gets bigger as the scale of things you're looking at gets larger. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that we're actually too close to the stars in our own galaxy to be sure.  Much of the galaxy is effectively invisible to us due to the effect of the central hub and the intervening dust.  We need to rely on various methods of other detection and simple estimates based on what we know in order to make up for our blind spot.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, when you look at other galaxies, you have more of an opportunity to see them head-on and from a further perspective.  </p>
<p>So, there will be some things in our own galaxy that we will have a much better view of, but we can't get a 50,000 foot view of our own galaxy because we're already in it.  We can see <em>other</em> galaxies with that sort of perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats assuming we even got the scale and rotational speed of the milky way right. Which we very very well might be wrong about. </p>
<p>We could be wrong about anything and there's no way we can ever test any of this. We're using certain facts which we just cant know are facts. Until we invent teleportation and send a fleet of a million space ships out there to physically observe all the stuff in the galaxy we simply are more likely to be wrong than right about any of this stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can see and measure other stuff as well. </p>
<p>For example we can see clouds of stuff by looking at a star and seeing how some of the light that is produced by the start doesn't reach us. Because it is being blocked by the cloud of 'dust'.</p>
<p>Also we can measure stuff directly though things call forbidden transition. (Which are just low chance of occuring events.) A good example of one is clouds of 'dust' will simply just produce radio waves in a narrow bandwidth. Just using a radio telescope we can map them out using red shift to give distance and intensity to give density.</p>
<p>And many other methods to see stuff that's not stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Due to how Black holes, rouge planets, and stuff forms, we are able to account for all of that. For there to be 5 x as much dark-regular matter as there is light-regular matter, all sorts of things would have to be different (We wouldn't be able to see out of the galaxy due to dark-regular matter blocking light, for example)</p></div>		</li>
