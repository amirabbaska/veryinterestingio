			<div class="markdown"><p>why?</p>
<p>there's no reason to believe that planets only get intelligent life once.</p>
<p>maybe there are planets out there that have generated intelligent life 1000 times. maybe exo-planets just keep churning out intelligent life over &amp; over. we only have our own planet as reference.</p>
<p>and yes I've seen the equations. but this whole idea that intelligent life can only develop during a limited window is an assumption based on very limited data.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that time is also required to get to life so the opposite argument about their existence is as valid as your argument for their location.</p></div>		</li>

<p>this is simply the first hit on google, but gives an estimate of 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 ( 10^24 ) planets which is exactly one more zero than u/sshostak gave. </p></div>		</li>
