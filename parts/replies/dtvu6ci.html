			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. The long skeletal muscles have major veins and lymphatic vessels that run alongside them or interspersed between the muscle bellies. Using those muscles helps to push venous blood and lymph back toward the heart. This is why sedentary people get swelling in their feet. </p>
<p>Secondarily, there are a list of hormones, drugs/poisons, and metabolic wastes that are fat soluble and will absorb into fatty tissues, then leach back out during weight loss. Losing a morbid amount of fat should not be done carelessly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One factor if you are gaining large amounts of muscle through excercise is that the heart becomes much stronger and you have a lower resting heart rate.  Steriods are probably a different story though</p></div>		</li>
