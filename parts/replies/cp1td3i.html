			<div class="markdown"><p>This post should be a lot higher. As a auctioneer myself, this is correct. I work large volume auctions (2,000 lots +) and try to sell one lot every 20 seconds to keep the sale moving smoothly. It’s important to speak fast, get to the money quick, then move on to the next item without pause. It’s extremely important to have a well organized and professional crew as well.</p>
<p>No one, especially dealers will continue to attend if they feel you are waisting their time.
Selling a sale slowly, or starting items for a value far less then what they are worth can add hours to a high volume sale. This is something most auction houses can’t afford due to additional wages, and loss of customers throughout the duration of a sale. </p>
<p>As far as OP’s question, I’ve been to a fair amount of auctions where the auctioneer is fast, but clear to me.  I’ve also been to a fair amount of auctions where you hear the price the auctioneer has, then a bunch of legit gibberish for 4-5 seconds, then the price being requested. I personally can’t stand this, but to each their own. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can totally understand if you haven't been to many auctions how confusing it must seem, but believe me - it ain't rocket science, you really do catch on quick. People who go to auctions don't really even have to think twice about &quot;following the money&quot;. If I have newbies at one of my auctions, and I can see the confusion on their face, I slow it way down - and even stop the action all together at times to make sure they understand what's going on.</p></div>		</li>
