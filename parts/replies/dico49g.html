<p>Generally they are supposing much larger climate cycles than we are able to measure accurately.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another argument that builds off this: proper use of the scientific method requires an experimental setup where you observe the outcome after changing a single variable. </p>
<p>Climate is difficult to study because such an experimental setup is not possible. There isn't another earth we can use as the control. Furthermore, <em>climate</em> is not just one thing, it's a huge complicated mess that is defined only over a large span of time. We can collect data going back into the past, but no amount of correlation can ever equal proof. </p>
<p>These same arguments can be made about evolution, and I guess some people also don't believe in that. Slightly different though, because it is possible to study evolution on a small scale with organisms that go through generations rapidly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe we have been able to test models though, for example when volcanoes go off and you punch in the levels of sulphur dioxide that was released they have accurately predicted the levels of cooling globally over the coming years. So there are some ways we can predict/test models.</p>
<p>There have been lots of predictions made by Darwin's theory and later scientists that have proven to be true.

<p>As well as question how much impact it could possibly have, given that Earth has had &quot;warming periods&quot; and ice ages forever. </p>
<p>When you don't understand the science behind any of it, nor the scale and speed of change, it's easy to deny it. :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the heart of the issue: people don't understand that the last time we were at certain conditions we have now, it was millions of years ago. This isn't something that happens every couple hundred years or something. Not at this scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's just as easy to accept it when you don't understand the science behind it. There are quite a few climate scientists that don't believe in man-made climate change (Or atleast as far as I know don't agree with the model many people seem to go with)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a scientist, but one thing I've noticed is that a lot of climate change skeptics are scientists or engineers of some kind themselves: geologists, physicists, chemists etc.  They see differences in how they practice and what they see in climate change research which make them believe climate change is pseudoscience.  Two examples of this criticism:  </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model selection</strong> Climate scientists have been building and refining models for decades to predict changes in global conditions.  Many of the models have been wrong and when they are, they are changed or thrown out.  This can lead to survivor bias.  </li>
<li><strong>Lack of falsifiable hypothesis</strong> The scientific method says you have hypotheses which you test and try to reject.  Related to the first point, when climate models miss on their projections, scientists can update them or change models.  Skeptics then look at that process and wonder how, if climate change were not real, scientists would allow themselves to be convinced of that.  </li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with these objections, in my view, is they don't recognize that the challenge in climate science is different from many other sciences.  The earth is a complex system which is always changing.  Capturing every variable is impossible.  You can't really run controlled experiments, all you can do is gather better data and observe.  So climate scientists do what they can and draw the best conclusions they can.  And all signs point in the same direction.  </p>
<p>For skeptics though, these differences between what they see as hard, rigorous scientific practices and the science of climate change are enough to sow seeds of doubt. From there you can concoct stories of ulterior motives (e.g. fear mongering to drive up funding), groupthink (e.g. everyone in the field has the same conclusion, then works backwards to look for evidence), profiteering allies (e.g. green technology investors), and bad risk-return profiles (e.g. why sacrifice economic growth if we don't know for sure if climate change is real?).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for posting this. I was on /r/changemyview earlier debating the effects of climate change from this point of view. I see how wrong researchers are in my own field and tend to assume they would be in other fields too. Then I also see skeptics get silenced like they're science heretics and think there needs to be someone playing devil's advocate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that there are multiple psychological effects that affect this.</p>
<p>It is difficult to accept that your very way of life might lead to a disaster and that in order to survive, you would necessarily have to give up so many things that you and the most recent generations have enjoyed. People who believe in things like this like the Gospel of Prosperity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosperity_theology</a>) won't easily accept a worldview that would require reining in unfettered economical growth. It also conflicts with general notions of a static, safe world where you can raise kids in and where you can plan your future. Accepting a terrifying reality is hard, and not everyone wants to do it.</p>
<p>There is also the thing that certain anti-authoritative mindsets have a tendency to attempt to disbelieve anything that respected and reliable sources state. In their social circles, having a contrarian opinion is seen as enlightened and is inherently valuable, and thus encouraged. You can test this yourself by asking climate change deniers about 9/11 being an inside job, vaxxing, whether we actually landed on the moon etc. Chances are you will find out that they have a much higher chance to be conspiracy theorists in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds very reasonable. I mean, who would blindly trust some scientists who have solutions for problems which you never heard of. Those scientific explanations are often complicated and, like you said, require a lot of effort and work. But if my local church has a simple answer, and also a rather relatable one, then I would also go for the churches solution.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The thing is that it's not clear that our quality of life should decrease at all. thing will be different, sure. Electric cars, electric heating, meat grown in vats, etc. But it's not like we have to go back to the stone age or anything.</p></div>		</li>
