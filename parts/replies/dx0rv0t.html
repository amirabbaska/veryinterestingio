			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, but the reason you get the spins while you’re drunk AND hungover the next morning is pretty interesting. Your brain can actually adjust to the differences caused by the alcohol while you’re drunk eventually. When you sober up the next morning, your brain has adjusted and the change back to normal upsets that equilibrium again. So you get the spins when you first get drunk, your brain adjusts, then the alcohol leaves your system and you get the spins again. Pretty cool stuff, unless it’s happening to you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, the first drink in the morning is just a &quot;fix&quot; so to speak to help with the withdrawal from the lack of alcohol. We call the first drink of the next day &quot;hair of the dog&quot; from the saying &quot;hair of the dog that bit you.&quot; There is an old folktale that believed that of you got bit by a rabid dog, to put some of that dog's hair on the wound so you wouldn't get rabies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But people don’t get the spins when they first get drunk, they get them much later, typically when they lay down. If we got spins at the beginning of drinking people probably wouldn’t drink as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, those hairs in your inner ear are within a jello-like fluid that when you move your head, the fluid wiggles, and moves the hairs which send a nerve response to the brain that your head is moving. It works similarly with acceleration as well; when you’re accelerating, the fluid moves, so the little hairs in the fluid move, which tell the brain that you’re accelerating, so you feel like you’re accelerating.</p>
<p>So when you drink lots of alcohol, that alcohol goes into that fluid in your inner ears. Picture dropping oil in water, it swirls because they’re different densities as well as properties of their chemistry (oil is hydrophobic so instead of its molecules bonding with water, and dissolving away, water, in a sense, pushes the oil around because it doesn’t want to bond with it).
When alcohol mixes with inner ear fluid, it does a similar thing and starts swirling in the fluid. This swirling moves the little hairs in the inner ear fluid which then is transmitted to the brain to tell it that you’re moving. But you’re not moving. So the brain thinks you’re moving when your not, so you become dizzy. </p>
