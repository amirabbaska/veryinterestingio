<p>how did they entangle two already given photons???</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The trick is to measure them without it being possible to gain any information about which photon came from where. To do this you need a beam splitter (basically a glorified prism) which has two inputs and two outputs. When you put the two photons into the two inputs and set up your experiment correctly, at the two outputs the information has been deleted and you have transferred the entanglement (mathematically this corresponds to taking a partial trace of the density matrix). </p>
<p>This alone is kind of interesting as there is an entropy cost for deleting information: so to keep the thermodynamicists happy, there is a quantum entropy associated with collapsing an entangled state (check out Von Neumann entropy). </p>
<p>Edit: reworded some bits </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>how well does this work... ? 'almost every time' ... or similar to SPDC (one success per 10^12 inputs) or somewhere in between...?</p></div>		</li>
