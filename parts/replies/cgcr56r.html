			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actually do this experiment. Take two eggs, leave submerged in water and one in a liquid containing no/low water (corn syrup is a good option). </p>
<p>Over time (30 mins+) you'll notice the egg in water has expanded slightly and the egg in syrup will have shrunk. You can film it and timelapse it for a good visualisation, or just get a video off YouTube.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;What are we doing?&quot;
&quot;We're gonna learn about osmosis!&quot;

<p>Skin, for the most part, is impermeable to water. </p>
<p>Maybe if you opened up the anal cavity enough to allow water into the colon, he'd survive, but humans cannot survive by osmosis through the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Your nasal passages are NOT designed to deal with large amounts of water. You won't absorb the water efficiently, so the hydration benefit will be very minimal, but the risk of inhaling water into your lungs is very high and that's a good way to cause yourself to drown. Also water helps breed bacteria and you really don't want a sinus infection on top of being dehydrated.</p></div>		</li>
