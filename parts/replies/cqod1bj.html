<p>I think a lot of people here are focusing on the fundamental frequency of the note, in which case, no, you can't tell the volume. But Weyl's law says that, if you know the volumes of the little quieter notes in there (the other eigenvalues), you can work out the volume. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, if you focus simply on the &quot;main&quot; frequency of the sound then no, you cannot work out the design, but if you analyze the full signal there is a lot of information in the overtones, and you could in theory work our the shape of the cavity.</p></div>		</li>
