			<div class="markdown"><p>It was an electrically heated windshield in in the 80's. Of course they did quite a bit of engineering. But it can be very, very hard to account for all the ways a part in a car can fail - especially more complex parts and electrical parts. As much as you can try to simulate conditions and do real world testing, you can't really recreate years of usage - normal usage, corrosion, daily temperature fluctuations, vibration, customer misuse/abuse/neglect, etc. </p>
<p>If automakers spent the time to identify and correct nearly every possible scenario, you would have a $30,000 economy car with features/technology and styling that would likely be more than 7-8 years old. That's why you have warranties, departments minimg data and releasing service bulletins to the dealers, recalls, and even NHTSA to a degree. Even some of the cars most thought of as being reliable have had recalls (Toyota, Ford, Honda, etc). </p></div>		</li>
