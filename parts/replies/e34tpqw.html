<p>I wonder if some of the high energy radiation given off from an atomic bomb would do similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly possible. I am better with effects on electronics than with the human eye, so I am not in a position to rule that out. </p>
<p>Most that stuff (x ray, gamma ray, neutrons) are pretty well blocked by the atmospher and distance. But I have no earthly idea what the energy threashhold would be to fire you eye ball to percieve that.</p>
<p>I cant say I have heard of this happening to anyone back in the day when they ran atmospheric testing, however. But I could be wrong</p></div>		</li>

<p>another options for @OP to consider might be the temperature changes caused by the explosion going through different phases, but that's likely caused on camera </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't find the original story, but I read it here on Reddit couple years ago. If I recall correctly, and I very well might not, the story was written by a person who went to see a nuclear blast as kid with his parents. Apparently there was a visitors section to come and watch the blast or they were on top of some building, I can't remember. Seems crazy either way. But googling around I did find this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When we turned around to look at the blast site it was like fire and brimstone as far as you could see, with every color of the rainbow in the mushroom cloud</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this article, person who witnessed the Hiroshima bombing also describes seeing &quot;every color in the rainbow&quot; in the blast:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the top of that mushroom cloud was the most terrifying but also the most beautiful thing you've ever seen in your life--every color in the rainbow seemed to be coming out of it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats neat, I would do just about anything see witness a blast.</p>
<p>As far as rainbows or whatever, that likely would have nothing to do with high energy radiation or cosmic-like rays (alpha, beta, neutron, gamma, x rsy) because that stuff comes and goes in less than a second, it doesnt linger.</p>
<p>I would guess the rainbow thing is light refracting?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is certainly possible. It is a shame that I cannot find the original post I keep referencing, because the way it described these colours made it stuck in my head, for good I'd imagine. Then again the writer was a kid when witnessing the blast, so perhaps his imagination added something to it.</p></div>		</li>
