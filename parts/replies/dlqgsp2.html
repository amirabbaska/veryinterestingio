			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no Doctor and cannot really ELI5 for you, but I've heard about the Stanford experiments. One of them was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment" target="_blank">Stanford Marshmallow Experiment</a>, where they tested instant gratification vs. delayed gratification with toddlers. The experimenters placed a marshmallow on a table and left a child in the same room. The children were told that they would get a second marshmallow if they didn't eat the one on the table after a few minutes.</p>
<p>The inability to delay gratification has also been linked to <a href="https://cognitivedynamics.blogspot.de/2017/01/attachment-theory-attachment-styles-free-personality-test-secure-avoidant-ambivalent-disorganized.html#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.sort=" target="_blank">early maternal withdrawal</a>, (which can result in a multitude of personality changes and mental health symptoms) where the child is unsure about if he gets a gratification at all, if he doesn't immediately take his chance. </p>
<p>The &quot;laziness&quot; you describe can be partly from that. If you choose an example like financial responsibility or studies , where you conciously have to choose delaying an instant gratification (splurging on something and delaying a long-time financial goal, or the unfun studying and not playing a fun video game for now), then it gets more obvious its part of how our brain got wired since early childhood.</p>
<p>The children who were able to delay instant gratification where statistically more likely to also have a better BMI, better finances and better SAT scores as they were older.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Be predictable and reliable to your children. If you promise a reward, always follow through. Else, your kid may become fat and unable to save money.^^^Exaggerating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I recall reading a while ago about a follow-up to the marshmallow experiment that highly questioned its conclusions, particularly about future success. It found that the choices made depended more on previous results than on intelligence: meaning if the child was used to disappointment from waiting then they would choose short term rewards. Since this correlated more strongly with other factors (kids from more poor families would have learned that if they wait for something then they may not get anything, so take it now. Kids from wealthier families could more rely on long-term rewards since it was far less likely they'd be cancelled in order to pay food, rent, or whatever else a poor family is likely to have trouble with), it is more likely that the lower SAT scores from the short term kids is due to a simple lack of nutrition and access to opportunity rather than an inherent lack of willpower.</p>
<p>Basically, if you live in an environment where waiting for a larger reward doesn't work, then logically you will stop doing it. This doesn't mean you are dumb, it means you're used to shitty situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it be reasonable to conclude that children who are rewarded for making rational decisions will form rational, long-term reward habits which serve them well in adulthood?</p>
<p>This would explain why children with little structure are more impulsive as adults, and why it's critical to encourage long-term thinking at an early age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that the OP's example was about delayed gratification since:</p>
<ul>
<li>The outcome from using either method was almost certain to be the same; and</li>
<li>The screwdriver option cannot be presumed to generate overall greater gratification.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many possible outcomes that determine the degree of gratification obtained by getting the screwdriver. This was about establishing that getting the screwdriver will in fact lead to greater gratification overall.</p>
<p>This is simply <em>cost-benefit analysis</em>, albeit crude, but nevertheless where he dynamically reviewed the changing variables as the mission progressed.</p>
<p>He made a quick conclusion that the screws could be undone using the butter knife and the efficiencies gained from using a screwdriver instead were not greater than the inefficiencies determined as a loss of time and increased physical effort.</p>
<p>He then continued to review the variables as the butter knife proved less efficient than thought initially. As this method proved to take more time and more effort, the &quot;costs&quot; with getting the screwdriver became more and more insignificant compared with the much greater perceived benefits.</p>
<p>In truth there were probably many more variables being subconsciously considered, such as the potential time spent accurately locating the screwdriver (or whether he has it all), the effort and time preserved relative to his skill with using the screwdriver, whether the screwdriver he has is actually the correct one for those screws or any number of minor considerations including the feeling of &quot;being in the middle&quot; of a greater task (opening several appliances) and not wanting to interrupt that motivation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily a dumb system.  And things like how tired or stressed you are play into it.</p>
<p>Your brain is constantly evaluating and prioritizing rewards. Short term rewards are safe, so if you can imagine do it with a butter knife, you feel like you will succeed. Long term rewards are harder to evaluate and carry more risk and analysis. Do you know where the screwdriver even is? How long will it take you to find it? Those stairs make you tired, is that worth it? You have to take multiple steps to find the screwdriver. It takes work to even determine whether or not it's worth it. And what if you end up not even being able to find the screwdriver at all? You know the knife is there.</p>
<p>This isn't bad. Neither is feeling stupid about it afterwards.  The thing is you underestimated the difficulty of using the knife for the job. You thought it would be easier and it wasn't. You feel dumb for that. This is part of the way we make judgments. Next time you are in a similar situation you might remember that using the knife was more frustrating than you thought and give more thought to getting a screwdriver.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the knife had been easy to use, and maybe it was in the past for similar jobs, you wouldn't be posting about how you feel dumb for using the knife instead. You would instead just reinforce the idea that a knife is a reasonable substitute for the screwdriver.  I would hazard a guess that you have used a knife instead of a screwdriver in the past and it has worked out, likely more often than it has failed.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Like you mentioned, this can probably be influenced by how tired or stressed you are correct? In that if you are feeling tired, you may be inclined to overestimate the success you will have using the knife, giving your brain incorrect information when it determines whether or not getting the screwdriver is worth it. Your brain deludes itself to believe that a knife will be fine, because it knows this means it avoids the extra effort it takes to go out and get the screwdriver. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually reading this book right now and it reminds me a lot of &quot;The Inner Game of Tennis&quot; (which is used by people across sports, esports, other competitive endeavors) and, with Self 1 being System 2 and Self 2 being system 1.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is in the tennis book the &quot;fast&quot; thinking which is dumb and emotional is preferred. Thinking Fast and Slow makes it seem a bit negative but the other book mentions that this is where flow state comes from.</p>
<p>Basically you can make the &quot;fast&quot; system smart by priming it with good training, practice, analysis, and ideas. So when the time comes you're making good choices rapidly without effort-full thinking. I still don't know where tunnel vision falls into all of this since it seems like just a bad flow state to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah as an 8th grade counselor and I'm not going to go into brain function but we call it the lizard brain and the wizard brain. We have an internal animalistic instinct in us that pretty much overrides the wizard as we call it side of the brain which is the rational sensing side that is weaker. But as humanity has evolved it  has clashed with the other instincts inside of us. That is a classic case where your lizard brain pretty much the caveman part of your brain overpowered your thinking. Funny enough this description is used in our highschool camp as well hahaha. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I've read &quot;Emotional Intelligence&quot; and it depicts 3 instead of 2 brains: the Reptilian Inner layer, the Primate Middle, and the Human Outer.   Like how we evolved and each one has own ways it wants your brain to function.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry excuse my run on sentences, I had to type quickly and still do atm. So I should have explained this better. The lizard brain is the part of the brain that makes us act like our caveman ancestors who had under developed brains  at the time so we used our fight or flight mechanics on a daily basis. What that means is okay a tiger is coming at me do I throw a rock or do I run. Now as humanity has devolved our wizard brain comes into play and we can logically think over the situations. Say the tiger is coming after me what do I do. Most peoples instincts would kick in and they would revert to those old instincts where as some can say I can quickly grab this large piece of wood and hit it in the head because a rock is to small and the tiger is faster than me and I have a long reach with this club. That is our intelligence coming into play instead of instinct.  </p>
