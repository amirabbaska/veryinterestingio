<p>Humans have 46 chromosomes so an additional chromosome equates to roughly a 2% difference from the norm.</p>

<p>Tiny nitpick: chromosome 21 is the smallest human chromosome so one copy of it only accounts for about 0.7% of the human genome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the chromosome.  Chromosome 21 is the second smallest autosome, so there's fewer genes on it and the inactivation/overexpression of those gene products apparently don't cause spontaneous abortion.  However, the only other two autosomal trisomies that commonly occur in humans are Trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome) and Trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome), which are right smack in the middle in terms of size.</p>
<p>And then as far as the sex chromosomes go, if trisomies or polyploidy occurs, it can be virtually silent.  XXX females or XYY males might be totally unaware of their genotype.  Although if you take away a chromosome from a girl (XO) then you get Turner syndrome, and if you give a guy an extra X, then he's a Kilinefelter male (XXY).  So the human body's weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if an info graphic or website have brief explanations of various types of syndromes/disorders and their associated facial features? I'm finding this thread extremely interesting and would love to learn about more syndromes and how to identify them based on facial attributes and mannerisms. </p></div>		</li>
