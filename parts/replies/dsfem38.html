<p>He then re-calibrated his scale using the melting point of ice and normal human body temperature (which were at 30 and 90 degrees); he adjusted the scale so that the melting point of ice would be 32 degrees and body temperature 96 degrees, so that 64 intervals would separate the two, allowing him to mark degree lines on his instruments by simply bisecting the interval six times (since 64 is 2 to the sixth power).[11][12]</p>

<p>What makes it better is that Americans still use the Fahrenheit system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still a pretty great system for general (meaning non scientific) use. 0 degrees is a really cold place on earth and 100 degrees is a very hot place on earth. It's 0-100 for the temperatures that humans regularly experience. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When we switch to metric and ditch the penny I'll know we have finally rounded the corner back towards rationality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People really need to stop suggesting that we change everything. It's really not practical. The metric system taught in schools, scientists use it, most tools for home use include SI units as well as US Customary units, and a quick google search or online purchase is available for people who aren't used to it. The US has already adopted the metric system into its consciousness. It's not practical to change the roadsigns, maps, and tools that use the current measurements, not to mention replacing <em>every single mile marker</em> on roads and highways with kilometer markers. Machine parts that use inch and feet measurements would be incompatible with newer parts that use cm and meter measurements. Furthermore people who have less formal education who rely on their knowledge of customary units and tools that use customary units to do their jobs would have to relearn everything and be unable to do their jobs for a while. Not to mention that there are still human rights issues and <em>literal Nazis</em> that this country is facing. Until the country no longer has health problems, environmental issues, human rights issues, poverty/class disparity, and other problems of similar severity to deal with, any proposal to overhaul the systems of measurements that the country uses is frivolous. </p></div>		</li>
