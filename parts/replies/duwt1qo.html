			<div class="markdown"><p>The first doctor we saw said the following:
&quot;Let's look and see what we have to work with and we'll just make the child whatever sex you choose.&quot;</p>
<p>We dropped him like a hot potato and went to the CAH clinic at the University of MN.  Dr. Kyriakie Sarafoglou is the best Pediatric Endocrinologist in the business. Her and Dr. Aseem Shukla immediately said, let's just make what's there work right, and then it's her call when she gets older.  Aseem is the best Pediatric Urologist in the business.</p>
<p>Never pick a kids sex for someone.  I saw Sleepaway Camp.  Every parent that thinks they should pick a sex/gender should watch that movie. She may change her mind about gender later.  That's her business, not anyone else's.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fun anecdote about my daughters care in the first few months of her life:</p>
<p>We had to have her checked for urinary reflux.  The radiologist, whom I'd never met before, greeted me with the question, </p>
<p>&quot;I assume she pees and poops from the same hole?&quot;</p>
<p>My first though was &quot;Do you assume this of many people? If so, you may want to reconsider your greetings.&quot;</p>
<p>Instead I just said, &quot;No, she has CAH.  Details should be on the chart in your hand.&quot;</p>
<p>Someday, I hope to teach my children his greeting as the best pickup line you could ever use in a bar.  &quot;Hey handsome!  I assume you pee and poop from the same hole?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
