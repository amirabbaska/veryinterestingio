			<div class="markdown"><p>We appreciate the offer.  Being the first issue means it's a bit rough around the edges. We did have a (non-redditor) graphic designer help work out the major kinks in our layout, but for the most part we're a group of volunteers producing this stuff and, well, that poses some limitations. </p>
<p>It's very heartening to see that the community is willing to help us out in the future. Seriously, we're touched. We will certainly keep this in mind as we work on future issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or lack thereof? I enjoyed reading this quite a bit but found it rather perturbing to find headers to be missing capital letters. It looks... really bad.</p>
<p>I do not intend that to be a stab at the efforts of the authors. It just seems that such a glaring grammatical error wouldn't feature so prominently in a piece such as this. I understand you're doing it for formatting purposes but it is not palatable in any way.</p>
<p>Edit: a word.</p></div>		</li>
