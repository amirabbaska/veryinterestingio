			<div class="markdown"><p>Very rarely will governments print money - as outlined above it leads to currency depreciation which isn't good.</p>
<p>They prefer to deal through bonds to create money </p>
<p>A 10 year bond brings money into the economy the second they sell it, but that money is only around for 10 years. At the end of those 10 years, the money which exists is the interest paid on those bonds.</p>
<p>On the point of printing money, if you sell bonds, then print money, you're not going to be seen as being too trust worthy by the people who bought your bonds... so it's going to be more expensive to sell bonds in future.</p></div>		</li>
