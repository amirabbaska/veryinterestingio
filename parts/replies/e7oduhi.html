			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Glues like Epoxy and cyanoacrylate polymerize as they cure forming long polymer chains (generally a one way reaction). Sugar just forms H bonds. That's why you can pull apart things stuck with sugar and they'll re-stick (as long as it is still moist and not dirty) but you can't do that with glue</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask how that &quot;perpetually sticky silicone pad&quot; works?</p>
<p>For phone mounts in cars and things. It eventually collects dirt then you just wipe it with a wet rag and it's clean and sticky again. Stuff is magic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another kind of stuff is sticky because of their surface tension and viscosity, like vacuum oil.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If you wanna know more, look up “Van der Waals” forces. </p>
<p>Tbh idk why any of these other commenters didn’t actually name the force, they just kept saying “forces” haha</p></div>		</li>
