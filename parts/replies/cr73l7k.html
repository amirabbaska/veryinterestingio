			<p>Just to expand on your answer a bit more:<br><br>Each website could, if they wanted, run their own ad network which would be nearly impossible for a general ad blocker to block... but that would require a lot of effort from the website's owner.<br><br>It's because so many websites have outsourced ad revenue to ad networks that ad blockers are effective. The efficiencies that allow a large ad network to operate create a finite, predictable pattern which the ad blockers defend against.</p>		</li>

			<p>Let me expand on this. Ad revenues are TINY. A small fraction of a cent on a click. Those companies depend on sheer volume for their revenue. <br><br>That's what makes AdBlock work. Unless you get your ads routed from a worldwide mega-operation site, you'll never get a profit from your ads.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Those ads that had annoying sounds when you mouse over (some even without mousing over, often I had to refresh youtube videos because if I got one of those I couldn't hear the video), the multiple download button mimics. <br><br>Ads got so annoying that when adblock appeared it became an almost mandatory instalment for people with any computer knowledge.</p>		</li>

			<p>To add to what /u/Sterkenburg is saying, /u/Jrrrff, you should look for an addon in your browser likely version 1.1 with  a suspicious name saying it betters your browser experience. You should also look in your programs list to uninstall the same thing.</p>		</li>

			<p>They still add a lot of clutter to my screen. Contrary to what people might think, I'm in charge of deciding what runs on my own computer. That's why I use userscripts or browser extensions to change some sites, for example (like RES). Or use services like readability.<br><br>The ad revenue is between the ad network and the site owner, I'm not a party on this process. I didn't sign any contract, and I never agreed I would show ads on my computer.</p>		</li>

			<p>Agreed.  I'm peacefully reading some website and all of a sudden I'm hearing sounds from some obnoxious ad that loaded in one of the tabs or something.  So I have to hunt the POS down and close whatever page its on.  No thanks.  Internet advertising is so much more intrusive and obnoxious than television, radio, or newspaper advertising ever was.  These advertisers deserve to get blocked.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah. I'll generally not use adblock on sites I visit often... with one exception. If you run ads that play sound unprompted? Blocked. Immediately. <br><br><br>I'm sorry. I'm just not willing to accept that.</p>		</li>

			<p>First of all, the ratios are way higher.  So its like a two or three minute ad to watch a 30 second clip.  But more importantly, its the tactics.  Pop up ads, pop under ads.  Ads that open when you drag your mouse over certain text.  Ads that block the content of the page until you find some stupid X box to close it.  Ads that play audio on what's really the digital equivalent of a newspaper - on websites with no other audio.  Having to hunt down that POS ad and close it or else being forced to listen to it.  Having the ad service track me and show me the same shitty ad over and over and over on every website because I googled something about the company once three months ago.    <br><br>TV ads on the other hand are simple.  You're going to get two commercial breaks during a half hour show.  They're each about three minutes long (though some networks have chosen to eliminate the commercial break between shows and have a third break during the show instead).   There are more of them then there were in the past but there's no tricks.  You're going to watch three minutes of ads (unless you mute, change the channel, or leave the room).  You're not going to watch 20 minutes of ads because you couldn't find some X button.  You're not going to have an ad blocking you from viewing your program.  You're not going to have ads pop up every time you hover your thumb over the number five on your remote.  You're going to watch the same ads everybody else is watching.  I mean don't get me wrong, that shit has gotten kind of out of hand too (which explains the appeal of DVRs) but internet ads just have way more obnoxious mechanisms for their fuckery.</p>		</li>

			<p>My favorite ones are the animated ones that cover up the entire page until you find the tiny hidden X in one corner which may function to close the ad, or may just count as an ad click anyways.<br><br>These are a great way to make me never access your website again.

			<p>You know, I wouldn't run adblock if it wasn't for video or audio ads.  I usually unblock ads for a site if I go to a site more than a few times.  But if they have an autoplaying audio or video ad, adblock goes right back on.  If adblock won't block that kind of ad, I just close the site.</p>		</li>

			<p>Same. There are a bajillion other sites covering similar information. If site X serves me annoying ads that I can't close/manage, I'm just going to give the whole website the middle finger and simply stop visiting it, and go to a competing website. There are many losers here but the user (with a little effort) is not one of them.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, you're definitely an outlier since pretty much all the adblock discussions I ever read the ad people are always saying blocking hurts them.<br><br>Because if you're right and adblocking doesn't really hurt you guys, then there's no problem if we keep escalating the arms race right?

			<p>I use luakit and havent gotten the adblockers to work yet. I just basically disallow all off-domain requests, and add some exceptions for particular domains. Idea being that many servers probably dont send data back to the ad-publishers, instead relying on the browser to report itself.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper-luakit-stuff/tree/master/urltamer" target="_blank">It</a> breaks more things than i'd like, and i really would like something better,(probably a more fluid exception-adding mechanism so i can just except-as-needed) but really, it seems to be surprisingly effective. A second thing it does is cut all non-excepted traffick after two seconds, so it cant like.. track my mouse all the time and stuff. Probably the easiest improvement i can do is just make looking at what connections are requested writing exceptions more convenient.</p>		</li>
