			<p>Just to expand on your answer a bit more:<br><br>Each website could, if they wanted, run their own ad network which would be nearly impossible for a general ad blocker to block... but that would require a lot of effort from the website's owner.<br><br>It's because so many websites have outsourced ad revenue to ad networks that ad blockers are effective. The efficiencies that allow a large ad network to operate create a finite, predictable pattern which the ad blockers defend against.</p>		</li>

			<p>Let me expand on this. Ad revenues are TINY. A small fraction of a cent on a click. Those companies depend on sheer volume for their revenue. <br><br>That's what makes AdBlock work.

			<p>First of all, the ratios are way higher.  So its like a two or three minute ad to watch a 30 second clip.  But more importantly, its the tactics.  Pop up ads, pop under ads.  Ads that open when you drag your mouse over certain text.  Ads that block the content of the page until you find some stupid X box to close it.  Ads that play audio on what's really the digital equivalent of a newspaper - on websites with no other audio.  Having to hunt down that POS ad and close it or else being forced to listen to it.  Having the ad service track me and show me the same shitty ad over and over and over on every website because I googled something about the company once three months ago.    <br><br>TV ads on the other hand are simple.  You're going to get two commercial breaks during a half hour show.  They're each about three minutes long (though some networks have chosen to eliminate the commercial break between shows and have a third break during the show instead).   There are more of them then there were in the past but there's no tricks.  You're going to watch three minutes of ads (unless you mute, change the channel, or leave the room).  You're not going to watch 20 minutes of ads because you couldn't find some X button.  You're not going to have an ad blocking you from viewing your program.  You're not going to have ads pop up every time you hover your thumb over the number five on your remote.  You're going to watch the same ads everybody else is watching.  I mean don't get me wrong, that shit has gotten kind of out of hand too (which explains the appeal of DVRs) but internet ads just have way more obnoxious mechanisms for their fuckery.</p>		</li>

			<p>I've never seen a youtube ad that required you to watch for more than 30 seconds. Longer ads always have a skip button. Even still, if the ad is longer than the video, I just hit &quot;back&quot; and don't even give the ad revenue (I think you have to watch for at least 15 secs or half the length of the ad for it to count as a view).</p>		</li>

			<p>What, have they changed something? It used to be that if your ad is over 15 seconds, it automatically becomes skippable after 4-5 seconds. Everything under 30 seconds an advertiser could pay extra to be unskippable IIRC. If the people who made the video get a cent or two from me watching the whole 15 seconds I'm ok with it. 5 minutes I'm not ok with but I'm kind of suspecting they wouldn't do that.</p>		</li>

If we're judging internet advertising against TV advertising or radio advertising by what advertisers want us to do then you're watching that three minute ad.

			<p>Really? I actually think ads on the internet are the way, way less intrusive on compared to the ones on TV or radio. I do have adblock installed but I rarely use it, considering that most (all) of the revenues people on youtube get come from ads. I don't mind watching those ads if I know the person who made the content for me gets a few fractions of a cent from me. I'm just saying that if everyone used adblock, there'd be a lot less pro content on youtube. Or free news for that matter.<br><br>What does bother me is this new notion that the ads on the internet should be based on your interests all the time, you know, reading the cookies you visited etc. I guess it comes down to repeating your message, which I do not think works on the internet. It does sometime, but most of the time it's just oh jesus christ, yes, I visited that Amazon page yesterday, I don't have to be reminded again.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm just saying they went about intruding in so many more ways than TV or radio and adblock was necessary to put a stop to that.  TV ads take up time but when the show is on the show is on.  You don't have to click to close the ad.  Nothing will ever pop up in the middle of a program.  Nothing blocks the screen while the program is running.  I personally think TV ads are excessive too - but that's exactly what you'd expect when dealing with the cartel that is TV networks in this country.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why not just charge a set fee to display ads to users who block the ad network? The advertiser wouldn't know how many views it received but they'd know that it would be displayed on at least some screens, so they'd pay a certain fee per week or month to put it into the site's rotation.</p>		</li>

			<p>I feel that the whole &quot;adblock doesn't recieve the add from the add network&quot; is a little misleading, because then it would be very simple to just tell people they can't access the website unless they disable their adblock. the website could make a simple &quot;did you send this ip that entered our page our ad?&quot; what happens is that we are sent the ad on the computer but adblock removes it on our end after we already recieved it (or after we're requested to download it). so it is actually sent, and it register as sent from the ad networks end. The only way they can really check is if it's some sort of video and the ad has a return if time mark is reached.</p>		</li>

			<p>Adblock doesn't actually send the request - if it did, the content providers wouldn't care and the ad networks would be the only one affected. That isn't true - the content provider does not get credited with the impression. </p>		</li>

			<p>This isn't true, and I believe that's this is actually a myth spread by the ad networks since they can do literally nothing else than make people feel bad about having adblock. Why wouldn't websites and youtube videos simply block your access till you disabled adblock? If no request for the ad was sent it would be super easy to counter.</p>		</li>

			<p>Do you have any evidence for this?  From googling, everything I see supports what I say.  For example, from Adblock Plus' Wikipedia page, &quot;Adblock Plus blocks HTTP and HTTPS requests according to their source address and additional context information and can block iframes, scripts, and Flash&quot;<br><br>It could be determined for sure by doing a snoop of your own traffic if you use Adblock Plus - if you see connections to the ad network, you are right, but as I say, everything I look at says that it does not connect to the network.</p>		</li>
