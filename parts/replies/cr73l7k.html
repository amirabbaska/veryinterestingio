			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to expand on your answer a bit more:</p>
<p>Each website could, if they wanted, run their own ad network which would be nearly impossible for a general ad blocker to block... but that would require a lot of effort from the website's owner.</p>
<p>It's because so many websites have outsourced ad revenue to ad networks that ad blockers are effective. The efficiencies that allow a large ad network to operate create a finite, predictable pattern which the ad blockers defend against.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me expand on this. Ad revenues are TINY. A small fraction of a cent on a click. Those companies depend on sheer volume for their revenue. </p>
<p>That's what makes AdBlock work. Unless you get your ads routed from a worldwide mega-operation site, you'll never get a profit from your ads.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are other charasteristics that you can use to filter ads. And manually you can use <em>right click &gt; block element</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is easily defended against on the website's side of things and, again, what you're describing isn't a general ad blocker... Anything that requires user effort to circumvent will result in a net gain of impressions vs. a general blocker </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not just charge a set fee to display ads to users who block the ad network? The advertiser wouldn't know how many views it received but they'd know that it would be displayed on at least some screens, so they'd pay a certain fee per week or month to put it into the site's rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel that the whole &quot;adblock doesn't recieve the add from the add network&quot; is a little misleading, because then it would be very simple to just tell people they can't access the website unless they disable their adblock. the website could make a simple &quot;did you send this ip that entered our page our ad?&quot; what happens is that we are sent the ad on the computer but adblock removes it on our end after we already recieved it (or after we're requested to download it). so it is actually sent, and it register as sent from the ad networks end. The only way they can really check is if it's some sort of video and the ad has a return if time mark is reached.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adblock doesn't actually send the request - if it did, the content providers wouldn't care and the ad networks would be the only one affected. That isn't true - the content provider does not get credited with the impression. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use luakit and havent gotten the adblockers to work yet. I just basically disallow all off-domain requests, and add some exceptions for particular domains. Idea being that many servers probably dont send data back to the ad-publishers, instead relying on the browser to report itself.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/o-jasper/o-jasper-luakit-stuff/tree/master/urltamer" target="_blank">It</a> breaks more things than i'd like, and i really would like something better,(probably a more fluid exception-adding mechanism so i can just except-as-needed) but really, it seems to be surprisingly effective. A second thing it does is cut all non-excepted traffick after two seconds, so it cant like.. track my mouse all the time and stuff. Probably the easiest improvement i can do is just make looking at what connections are requested writing exceptions more convenient.</p></div>		</li>
