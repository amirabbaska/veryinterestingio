			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd think with the vast array of sounds and arrangements possible we would have more variation than that :P </p>
<p>Thank's for the help!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if the vocals have a melody they'll need to be placed over music in the same key. If the vocals are a rap you have a lot more flexibility in putting it on top of a  wider range of songs. You just need the bpm to match up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Songwriters are unimaginative with song structure in the same way that writers are &quot;unimaginative&quot; with sentence structure. It turns out that there are fixed patterns for how sentences are built, and for how words belong together. You can try varying them — think experimental prose — but then most readers tune out and your ability to communicate suffers. Similarly, chords and notes travel through some pretty conventional patterns. You can be a hero and break those patterns, but you risk losing the listener.</p>
<p>The dominant fifth chord returns to the root and not to the flattened second for the same reason that it's &quot;the ugly green sweater&quot; and not &quot;the green ugly sweater&quot; or &quot;the sweater, ugly, green of hue.&quot; The latter is grammatically possible but is a chore to parse; the first sounds right.</p>
<p>Also, tempo. Certain tempos convey &quot;walking&quot; or &quot;dancing&quot; or &quot;moping&quot; and they are right in the dot. Move them up or down a few BPM and they no longer convey that. So you will find a lot of songs matching each other pretty closely. <a href="https://youtu.be/3XeI9H2__gM" target="_blank">This mashup</a> of &quot;Sex Machine,&quot; &quot;Whole Lotta Love,&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way&quot; works because they're all at the tempo of &quot;strut&quot; + &quot;sexual heat.&quot; Vary the clock by just a shade and the feeling changes. Again, you could be a hero by doing &quot;Walk This Way&quot; in 13/8 at 136 bpm, but then what you have is just a showy failure to communicate.</p>
<p>And I will assert there is nothing inherently better about exotic chord changes or weird tempos. Only music snobs would give those inherent value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now can you try and explain this assuming that some people don't know what chords, scales, or rhythms are technically? I mean, if I knew what these are, I'd probably have no need to ask this question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me preface this by saying words can only explain so much. If you have time and really want to understand this, download a piano app and maybe crack open an intro to music theory youtube video.</p>
<p>Scales are a set of notes that fit between an octave (two notes that sound the same, but one is higher). The most common of these is the major scale (think 'Do Re Mi Fa So La Ti Do if you've heard it before). The (major) pentatonic scale is 'Do Re Mi So La Do,' named after its five unique notes.</p>
<p>A song's harmony is which chords are used.  Chords are groups of notes that are placed together for a certain sound. The simplest chords are three unique notes, skipping one note in the scale between them. The most important chord in each key is the I (one in roman numerals) chord. In major keys it is Do Mi So. Very rarely do you hear pop songs with more than four chords. 'The Key of Awesome' performed a mashup of these songs and it's very telling. Think</p>
<p>Rhythm is where in time the notes lie in relation to each other. You can feel the beat of music, but two songs in the same key at the same speed can be very different depending on their respective rhythms.</p>
<p>Honestly I get a little excited when pop songs stray from the norm and give people these tangential learning opportunities.</p>
<p>Hope this helped.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A scale is like a guideline for which notes can be used in a bit of music. Complex music will often use different scales at different times. </p>
<p>Chords are multiple notes played simultaneously. If you play a C note and an E note and a G note simultaneously (or in quick succession), it creates a chord (or the sense of a chord). </p>
<p>Harmony is the progression from one chord to the next. It is responsible for most of a song's emotional feel. </p>
<p>Rhythm is the pattern of emphasising and de-emphasising sounds from one moment to the next. Most songs use a pattern of multiples of 4.</p></div>		</li>
