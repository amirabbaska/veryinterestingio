			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to be suggesting that hippocampus size is genetic and static. It's not. The brain is very plastic.</p>
<p>The famous study of London taxi drivers showed that they have considerably larger hippocampi than other people. The hippocampus, among other things, is very involved in spatial navigation, and this was before the GPS era, so taxi drivers were figuring out the best route to take in a very complicated environment every day for many years. Unless only super-hippocampus humans are becoming taxi drivers (unlikely for an effect of this size), the more likely explanation is that as you develop a skill, your brain starts to reflects that.</p>
<p>Such an effect has also been observed for the motor cortex of musicians and even the visual cortex of blind people, which starts to develop other non-visual functions such as reading Braille.</p>
<p>Don't fall into the trap of believing you lack the capacity to develop a skill. While talent can give you a head start, perseverance goes a way, and as you change, your brain does, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick clarification. If you're taking about the Maguire study, the total volume of the hippocampus was not significantly different between populations. It was the <em>distribution</em> of hippocampal grey matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We found that compared with bus drivers, taxi drivers had greater gray matter volume in mid-posterior hippocampi and less volume in anterior hippocampi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The posterior hippocampi is associated with memory concerning spatial location. In fact, this ability developed by taxi drivers comes at a cost:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We then tested for functional differences between the groups and found that the ability to acquire new visuo-spatial information was worse in taxi drivers than in bus drivers. We speculate that a complex spatial representation, which facilitates expert navigation and is associated with greater posterior hippocampal gray matter volume, might come at a cost to new spatial memories and gray matter volume in the anterior hippocampus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the taxi drivers didn't get blanket &quot;better at memory.&quot; They developed capabilities in one area of memory at the expense of others.</p>

<p>To be fair, this could very well be possible, IIRC to become a London taxi driver you need to pass a hard test. E.g. anyone can aspire to be one but it's entirely possible that those with smaller hippocampus are more likely to fail the test or fail to making a living as a driver so they take some other career path instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The studies done actually accounted for this. If I remember correctly they measured hippocampus volume before studying and after having taken the exam through brain imaging. Also, there was even a difference between people who completed training but did not pass the exam and those who did pass. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The test is knowing routes around London and people study it for years - by driving the routes. So it's still practice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read up on memory techniques for fun. There’s a peg system that equates a letter to a number: 1 = t (one stroke down), 2 = n (two strokes down), 3 = m (3 strokes), 4 = r (as in fouR)...
11 = tt or tit, 12 = tn or tin...</p>
<p>When trying to memorize lists really quickly it’s first, best to have a good imagination, and second, to think really dirty filthy thoughts as those things stick around in your short term memory for a really long time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It plays a role in turning short-term memory to long-term memory, but it's still not clear if the hippocampus &quot;stores&quot; memory. It would be more accurate to say it is responsible for consolidating memory. </p>
<p>Edit: And my description obviously doesn't do the hippocampus full justice. It has a complex role in many aspects of memory.</p></div>		</li>
