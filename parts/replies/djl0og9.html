			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's the problem - I feel like toilets were designed (and size standards were set) by people who didn't consider the output of a 6'4&quot; 250-pound man with a voracious appetite.</p>
<p>I feel like they're designed to be plugged :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Was forced to buy one of the new high-performance ones because I have a corner toilet and the tank cracked (they don't make cheap corner toilets). That old one clogged all the time. The new one could probably take on a competitive eater without blinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A normal flush will usually be enough water to reach the rim and overflow a bit. Not so much on the newer loflow toilets though. </p>
<p>If you have an older one, a clog almost always means an overflow unless you catch it and close the flap in the tank fadt enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see this design working in a large number of scenarios. A backed up toilet with feces and paper floating on it, while slowly filling will clog that little overflow line with, wait for it, feces and paper, at which point, it'll continue to fill and hopefully stop before it spills the shot water all over the floor...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have time to watch the toilet slowly overflow, you have time to open the toilet tank and manually close the flap valve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true whether you have that little overflow drain or not. My point was that overflow drain will surely plug with shit and/or paper rendering it useless</p></div>		</li>
