			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, nylon is more durable than silk and nylon stockings were originally marketed as the more modern, longer-lasting alternative to silk. It was only when sales fell from lack of needing replacements that nylon stockings came to be just as if not even more delicate than silk stockings.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nylon also became a substitute for silk during WWII when silk, usually supplied by Japan, stopped coming. Available supplies were needed for wartime purposes, like parachutes for instance.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your source doesn't actually say what you state.  It merely says that manufacturers did not have a strong incentive to innovate away fragile stockings.</p>
<p>Stockings also used to be thicker. As did condoms. Customers choose the thinner version of both, despite them being more fragile.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not true.</p>
<p>u/Bajs_er_najs ,I know a lot about stockings so let me show you something:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yQCqBaHC6Y" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yQCqBaHC6Y</a>
and <a href="https://youtu.be/3hmoQWnYW_I?t=1m28s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/3hmoQWnYW_I?t=1m28s</a></p>
<p>Those stockings are 100% nylon. Today's stockings are a mix of Lycra and nylon (aka polyamide 6,6), usually in 95% nylon to 5% lycra relation (both fibres developed by DuPont).</p>
<p>Nylon is a non-stretch fibre, while Lycra is an elastic fibre and that's what makes modern stockings &quot;shrink&quot; in size.</p>
<p>Also, the stockings in the video were knit in a different way and were really durable (My gf has a few authentic ones in her collection, they do not run at all, but they feel a bit different to touch than modern ones).</p>
<p>Some companies that still produce 100% nylon stockings stockings are Cervin (French), Gio (UK) and Secrets in Lace, mostly as fully fashioned stockings (flat knit then seamed at the back). Mind you these are not the indestructible ones, even with being 100% nylon, because of how they're knit.
The only way to get authentic 50s-60s stockings is by buying an actual pair from the time.</p>
<p>That said, if someone did start manufacturing those again, I'd buy my gf every color and type.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, AMA :D</p>
<p>Sure, if enough people are interested. I'm not in the hosiery industry, it's just a long time fetish of mine and I did extensive research into the topic.</p>
<p>Otherwise, feel free to ask me anything here.</p></div>		</li>
