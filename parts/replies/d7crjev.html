			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add more related info:  People can form the genitals of the opposite genetic sex.  ie:  A genetic male (XY chromosome pair) may have female genitalia or a genetic female (XX chromosome pair) may have male genitalia.  It's a condition called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_adrenal_hyperplasia" target="_blank">congenital adrenal hyperplasia</a>.  </p>
<p>That's not really directly related to the original question, but I find it interesting.  Just an FYI for the readers, really.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. The scrotum and labia are analogous body parts, as are the clitoris and head of the penis. The scrotum is a stitched-together labia and the penis is an overgrown clitoris. The clitoris actually has the same spongy tissue that the penis has and likewise becomes &quot;erect&quot; when aroused. Another fun fact - testicles start out in the same place as ovaries and only descend into the scrotum shortly before birth. All of this is caused by the presence or absence of testosterone or estrogen. </p></div>		</li>
