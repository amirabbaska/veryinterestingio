			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. However smartphones will tend to drift from the reference atomic clock during the day. Hence you would need to sync again and again and you wouldn't want for this to happen, for example when your car is exiting a tunnel having lost its GPS signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But drift rates are almost imperviously constant. So, within 2-3 days, your phone could sync up 2-3 times and calculate its drift rate, and then drift milliseconds per year between syncs. I feel it is likely there is some application I don't recognize and am curious what it is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If drift rates were that constant and deterministic, why would we even need an atomic clock, we could just correct for the drift right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah thatâ€™s not quite the case. Temperature drift and bias voltage drift cause inconsistencies in the internal clock. Use your phone more? Temp increases, and so does drift, and not linearly. That temp increase also alters the voltage and currents driven through the circuitry of the clock, which change the drift more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drift rates are not constant, they are highly dependant on temperature, which can be compensated to some extent by thermostating the quartz, but even this wont get you close to the precision of an atomic clock: we are talking a drift of 10^-6 for the thermostated xtal as opposed to a drift of 10^-14 for the atomic clock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But isn't the drift so insignificantly tiny that no smart phone user is ever going to be able to make use of the increased accuracy of the internal clock? I mean when you factor in the general input lags and other causes for inaccuracy on most smart phones I really don't see cause for the application here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drift is significant enough to keep your phone from locking on to the signal immediately- it needs to search for it. You wouldn't care if your clock lost a minute per year, but that level of inaccuracy would be unacceptable for radio communications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The user won't have use for increased precision, for the same reason that I'll never reasonably need an atomic watch; quartz timekeeping is sufficient. That doesn't mean the increased precision isn't still useful to the device itself, which already executes instructions on a nanosecond timescale.</p>
<p>When you keep time with a quartz clock, that limits your timekeeping accuracy.When you regularly check it against an atomic clock you negate the drift that a quartz clock would experience. You still can't measure or track lengths of time with greater accuracy than quartz. This additional accuracy would be beneficial to radio and GPS signal processing.</p></div>		</li>
