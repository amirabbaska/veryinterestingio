			<div class="markdown"><p>Ants have multiple layers to their pheremones and we're still heavily studying it.</p>
<p>The best way to associate it is language. While humans from different parts of the world can speak English, one will notice we have several different dialects <em>and</em> accents.</p>
<p>Its kind of the same principle. I know scientists found two different species when first introduced attacked each other and had different pheromones. However when the colonies were raised next to each other, separated only by a mesh, slowly over time their pheromones began to blend and the two colonies became friendly.</p>
<p>This kind of hinted at ant pheromones having an 'accent' and when communicating with other colonies their accents slowly blend in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not sure if this is a typo, but if they were different species, then this would be unsurprising based upon my earlier response. </p></div>		</li>
