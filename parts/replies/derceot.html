			<div class="markdown"><p>I've listened to people say this over and over for years (30+) I like staring at the sun, always have and I still have 20/20 vision so either I'm super special (not likely) or maybe it affects different peoples eyes differently?  I don't know the science or claim too but I do know what I do do all the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True story: As a kid I heard all the time you should not stare at the sun or you'd go blind. Not wanting to go blind in both eyes I stared at the sun with only my left eye. I was only 7 or 8 and I don't recall all the repercussions but I seem to remember getting a headache and having a hard time seeing out of that eye for a short while after.</p>
<p>Fast forward to adult hood and I'm getting my eyes checked so I can get a pair of glasses (I'd been sitting too close to my monitor for years). Optometrist ends up spending a lot of time looking into my eye and then finally tells me there are spots in the back of my eye that need to be checked out by an ophthalmologist and my eye pressures are high too.</p>
<p>Go to the ophthalmologist and he spends a long time looking at the back of my eye and determines it's &quot;Photo toxicity&quot; which is a fancy name for burns on the back of your eye. The concern with these is that they could lead to degeneration of the eye and blindness but everything looks stable so other than a permanent after image that I rarely notice, the brown spots are fine. </p>
<p>However, turns out my pressures are much too high for a normal eye so they did some scans of my retina and that's how I found out I had glaucoma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The science is that naturally when you look at a bright light, your pupils contract accordingly in order to limit the amount of light entering them to preserve themselves. But when the pupil contracts, it also causes the light that enters to be more focused. The light from the sun is filled with very high energy UV rays which when focused can cause a lot of damage to the cells of your eyes. Normally side effects appear if someone stares at the sun for a long period of time, but its better to be safe so its not recommended to look at the sun for any period of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can respect that science, it sounds very legit and a lot more accurate than anything I could come up with. I'm simply asking what could be at cause for me after 30 plus years of staring at the sun, it seems to have had no noticeable effect on my eye sight? So either there is more to it, or the information is incomplete in my 100% unscientific opinion. </p>
<p>Or I am a strange mutant with a weak ass super power, but at least it's better than being able to grow your fingernails quickly! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, stop staring at the sun. No really, stop. Second, your pseudoscientific ignorance and rationalization is the reason you're probably going to be blind when you're old.</p>
<p>Have you been to an ophthalmologist recently? An actual medical eye doctor MD? Have you had them do a thorough examination with eye dilation and the works? You probably have burns or scars on your retina that just haven't affected you yet but may cause problems when you're older.</p>
<p>When an optician/optometrist gives you an eye exam, they're not checking for in-depth eye health. They're usually doing a cursory exam to get your prescription and sometimes a quick puff test to check for glaucoma. Just because they give you a clean bill of health, it doesn't mean you're in the clear. They're not medical doctors.</p>
<p>Seriously, stop looking at the sun. You're behaving extremely stupidly and permanently damaging your health. Go get yourself checked out so you can determine if there's any damage (and how to deal with it if there is) and you can talk to an actual doctor about why staring at the sun is a bad idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your advice was good up until you mentioned the stuff about the ophthalmologist/optometrist/ optician</p>
<p>Actually a number of decades ago it was an ophthalmologist that promoted the use of looking at the sun to improve eye health. An opthalmologist isn't the one to see for a general eye exam, they are typically surgeons and specialists. The optometrist actually is the most qualified to do a general eye exam; they are doctors in the sense that dentists are doctors. Training and schooling is similar between dentistry and optometry.  An optician sells you glasses.</p></div>		</li>
