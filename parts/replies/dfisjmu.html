Taking a complicated subject and breaking it down in a way that someone with no background in it can get.  Thank you.  I'm a little smarter today because of you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am also not a five year old, am pretty decent at science, ok at math, and I understood up to the fourth dimension. Maybe I should re-read this at another time...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Y'know, I find it incredibly difficult to imagine a 4th physical dimension. If you take 2 vertical lines intersecting each other (A and B), that represents 2 dimensional space, and then take another line (C)  intersecting both at a right angle, that represents 3 dimensional space. How, then, if you add another line at a right angle, would that explain another 4th dimension? I mean, if you add another line (D), intersecting the 3, wouldn't that just add another measurement in the 3rd dimension?</p>
<p>I understand that time is a dimension, like the wedding example, but time isn't a physical thing, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another way of explaining it is to say: </p>
<p>Imagine the universe is a cake, sort of. Like Bohr's raisin cake. You've mixed in butter, raisins, sugar, and some rgb colouring, but didn't stir it together too well.</p>
<p>So this cake floats in space somewhere. It has a location and occupies an arbitrary volume. All other space is empty.</p>
<p>The cake has three spacial dimensions and each point within the cake also has the properties of fat (0-100%), raisin (either 0 or 100%), sugar content (0-100%), temperature (0K to pretty much open-ended) and red (0-255), green (0-255), and blue (0-255). With this you can describe those properties of the cake in relation to the spatial coordinate. And as you can see different dimensions can clearly have vastly different properties and describe different things.</p>
<p>You've just described the cake as a 10-dimensional object.</p>
<p>If you want to have some real fun you can apply as many properties as you want, call them dimensions and then describe everything in the universe with vectors.</p></div>		</li>

You said that temperature is zero Kelvin to &quot;pretty much open-ended&quot; is there a measurable, maximum amount of heat / energy which can occupy a specific volume / for a specific time / insert other conditions here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, but how has a line two sides? Isn't a side a name for a certain line, namely that one that occurs in a poliygon? Therfore one line = one side? Square = 4 lines = 4 sides? In this manner, hasn't a cube got 12 sides? Sorry, I'm German, and I think I mistranslated the word &quot;side&quot;. I'm used to counting the corners and not the sides in polygons, but that would also make 8 for the cube. It does consist of 6 squares, but if an area makes a side, then I don't understand how a square can have 4 and not 1. I'm really confused. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be more specific, a line has two &quot;endpoints&quot;, a square has four &quot;edges&quot;, and a cube has six &quot;faces.&quot; By &quot;sides&quot; here I'm just talking about the number of lower-dimensional shapes you'd need to connect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a problem with the last non-bold paragraph. At small scales the universe doesn't obey &quot;normal&quot; three-dimensional laws, but it does obey weird three-dimensional laws, aka quantum mechanics. There's no evidence at all (so far) that there are more dimensions, and the weirdness of QM is not at all related to the number of dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be higher. The authors description of the math was spot on. But the last bit about physics is nonsense</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics has nothing to do with the 11 dimensions of space time required in string theory. That's far more complicated</p></div>		</li>
