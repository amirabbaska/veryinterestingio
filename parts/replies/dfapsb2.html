			<div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple theories on this topic. Some argue that mind wandering is your default state of mind and fidgeting is part of this state. Fidgeting in this case does not use executive resources. </p>
<p>Other theories suggest that fidgeting is a way to stop being bored and that it represents one's attempt at staying on task whether it's to relieve stress or to stimulate the brain and occupy the floating attention.    In this case it does require executive resources, but not very much.</p></div>		</li>
