			<div class="markdown"><p>The low pressure due to bernoullis principle would only apply if you turned your head sideways and the air would rush past you. If the air comes straight at you, the pressure should be in fact higher than normal because you now feel the dynamic pressure, too. </p>
<p>But it's actually easier to breath to the side in a strong wind so I'd say it's somewhat difficult to explain only with bernoullis principle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the problem with Reddit and explanations: what gets upvoted is what <em>sounds</em> right, not what <em>is</em> right.</p>
<p>I'm actually surprised at how often Reddit gets it right and upvotes the right comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many forces acting all the time. Gravity, the low pressure in the stream vs. outside the stream, the pressure zones created by the aerodynamics of the ball in the air flow.</p>
<p>High and low are relative terms. Yes, there is higher pressure created at the front of the ball by the contact of the ball with the moving air when compared with the air that is not obstructed by the ball. But the air is still moving and still creating lower pressure relative to stationary air (like the air in your lungs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you clarify on how fast moving air causes low pressure? I, and apparently lots of others here, aren't quite clear on how to interpret Bernoulli's principle here. I would expect on a knee-jerk reaction for the low pressure to be on the back of your head if the wind is in your face. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the easiest concept to explain, since it's definitely not intuitive at all. But <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fWSTXDQ8eE" target="_blank">this video</a> explains it really well.</p>
<p>The air from the fan creates a region of low-pressure around your nostrils. If the air is aimed around your face, the air pressure outside your nostrils will be lower than the air pushing against your chest (as well as the air in your lungs). This forces your lungs to work harder to breathe in.</p>
<p>A good way to visualize it is with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zmG2ksqSIc" target="_blank">straw experiment</a>. Imagine the clear straw as your nostrils, and the liquid as the air in your lungs.</p>
<p><em>Fun fact:</em> Old-school <a href="http://mycampus.nationalhighschool.com/doc/sc/physical%20science/ebook/products/0-13-190327-6/sx7097a3.gif" target="_blank">perfume atomizers</a> actually work because of this principle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That video isn't strictly accurate. Bernoulli's principle (the idea that fast moving air has lower static pressure that stationary air) is true only for bounded systems as it is based on conservation of energy. The reason the balloons in the video move together is due to the curvature of the balloon surface, known as the Coanda effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it it's due to the air actually <em>not</em> blowing into your nostrils? The turbulence generated &quot;around the corner&quot; (inside your nose) by the air hitting the front of your nose causes the low pressure.</p>
<p>If all fast air created low pressure, you'd expect the fast air on your face and chest to exert equally decreased pressure.</p></div>		</li>
