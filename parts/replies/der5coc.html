<p>&quot;The Holy Spirit&quot; special account... ...a fundamentally different sort of thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your explanation is good but completely side steps answering the question with that last paragraph. I suggest:</p>
<p><em>God keeps sending messages and buffs to players using &quot;The Holy Spirit&quot; special account, which isn't his Jesus player account, but more like a game moderater account.</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>You would think something so fundamental to an entire religion would have an...I don't know, definition? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>holy shit, i have been raised in a strict and devout Christian household and been around Christians my whole life, and i have never had the Holy Trinity explained so succinctly and completely as this...</p>
<p>I wish someone would write the whole bible using video game analogies so i could understand it :(</p>
<p>Kickstarter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is it's not terribly accurate. It sacrifices accuracy to the Bible and to the doctrine in exchange for the analogy. That's what ELI5 is for though, so that's cool, but (from a Catholic point of view) none of the 3 of the Trinity behave quite like that. </p>
<p>But theology is complicated af so if you are cool with ELI5 bible, God Is Disappointed in You is a fantastic book that aims to sum up each of the books of the Bible in 2 pages or so and a single panel cartoon. And it's written by a Christian, so it's not an angry atheist critiquing the Bible, it's a guy that did this to try and help himself and others understand what is going on better and decide if they are interested enough to read deeper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of them believe this. But every Christian also believes that God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are the same thing. It's all god. Three parts that are separate and whole.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. To continue the analogy, some believe that there is only one person behind all three accounts (either an actual person or an unknowable entity depending on the religion). Others believe that they are three separate people under the same dev studio, &quot;Godhead Studios&quot;. They have a single mission statement and focus, same production schedule, etc., but they all are separate people working on the project. Those people typically believe that Jesus the community manager is actually and literally God's oldest son.</p></div>		</li>
