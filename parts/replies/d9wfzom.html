			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly it. Even though hard to understand for non-medical professions, it's at least not as misleading as the top comment in this thread. If we follow the line of reasoning from the top comment, you should start crying if you consciously contract all your facial muscles (for a prolonged period of time). This doesn't happen. </p>
<p>The correct explanation is basically that the parasympathetic nervous system gets over-excited during laughter. As a side effect, other parasympathetic nerves get excited as well, which includes some branches of the facial nerve (CN VII) that control the lacrimal gland. Exciting this nerve causes contraction of the lacrimal gland, and thus resulting in crying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Idk wtf the top post is talking about here. There's no compression of tear ducts. Laughter is a parasympathetic activity. Lacrimation (tearing) is a parasympathetic activity. When you have a big boost in parasympathetic function it causes all types of parasympathetic output. </p>
<p>Add to that, when you laugh you express intense facial expression. Facial expression is controlled by the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII). Lacrimation is also controlled by the same nerve. </p>
<p>So, intense burst of parasympathetic activity (laughter) + powerful facial expression (CN VII activity) = overflow of CN VII into the lacrimation gland (tearing). </p></div>		</li>
