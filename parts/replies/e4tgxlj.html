			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, this is proof of intelligent design. God wanted us to wear pants, so he made belly fat stop at the waist. There’s no other possible logical explanation /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>do we see this shape in populations that does wear pants? is the line less obvious with those populations?</p>
<p>seems intuitive that clothes can cause things like a waist line. we see the effect with bunions and braces. and that repeated impact to a region stimulates fat growth in that region. why wouldn't fat loss or shape work the same way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two traditional ways to wear pants. I won't get into wearing pants pulled down below the ass to display the undershorts, for that is an abomination.</p>
<p>One way involves the pants being worn waist-high. The waistband is approximately level with the bellybutton, and is the narrowest part of a fit body. This is common with suits, and rare with jeans. A fat man wearing pants in such a fashion will often hold them up with suspenders, as it is the most rotund part of the body.</p>
<p>The second way involves wearing the pants at the hips. On a slender woman, the pants may be held up by the wide pelvis. A man will likely wear a belt to help keep his pants up. Fat or skinny, most men have no ass. A fat man will cinch his belt below his gut for maximum effectiveness.</p>
<p>The fat distribution is the same in men who wear suit pants at the waist, and men who wear jeans at the hip. If you wear your pants high and cinch the belt down to 26 inches, that's different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of....human biology..? It’s a fact that humans store fat in the location it is stored because of genetics. Wearing pants doesn’t alter the genetically-driven distribution of fat molecules. We aren’t tubes of toothpaste</p>
<p>If you are obese and wear tight pants all day then sure, there will probably be an indentation in the waistline but it doesn’t actually move or change fat distribution </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was because pants form the fat. Kind of like a waist trainer. </p></div>		</li>
