			<div class="markdown"><p>Radio waves are actually modulated to hold information.Think of morse code using dits and dats, where long tones and short tones are used together to share information through a binary language. Radio waves use variations in voltage and frequency to store information. Voyager is able to modulate whatever information into the radio signal it sends back home (probably speed, craft data, power levels, and similar info) and the receiving station will decode the signal and the information contained in it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they will, but they are gradually losing energy, and you need quite a bit to power that system. imagine your little LED takes 2 Watt per hour, if your battery is providing 10 W per hour at the beginning you have no problem. the battery will get worse and worse now, and after a few years it will just generate 1.5 W per hour and you cant power ur LED anymore :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. They only use extremely tiny amounts of nuclear fuel, and it isn't used as in a reactor, but they only use the remaining radiation.</p></div>		</li>
