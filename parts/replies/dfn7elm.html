			<div class="markdown"><p>The company I work for does recovery auditing for companies around the globe. Part of that, but a very significant part is looking at mass amounts of internal emails to look for deals and promises and all kinds of things that we can turn into claims to our client's vendors. For example: Lets say a salesman promises 20% off to our client if they purchase X amounts of product by Y date.. If we can prove that we fulfilled the discount requirement but didn't' get the discount then we can create a claim for our client, which they in turn deduct from a future purchase and we take a percentage that money saved. </p>
<p>That's an incredibly simplistic explanation but there's a metric fuckload of money in it. The software used to query years of emails in seconds is unbelievable as it can query attachments as well and it's designed to understand different currencies after conversion and other weird complexities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but in an extreme case you could change the decimal to a comma and add a zero. $100.00 -&gt; $100,000.00 Just playing devil's advocate. Lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if there isn't a decimal, changing $1,000 to $1,0000 would put its comma in the wrong place. Meanwhile, if you add a comma and 3 zeroes ($1,000,000), the incredibly large sum would raise suspicions.</p>
<p>But that still doesn't affect anyone changing $100 to $1,000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't agree with the anti-forgery slant. It's just as easy to change $1000 to $10000. The most plausible (unproveable) explanation I've seen points out that the English system originally had three units - pounds, shillings and pence. e.g. 19 pounds, 6 shillings and threepence was written as £19/6/3. In this case, to me, it seems clearer to place the £ character next to the number that it refers to than at the other end. Then again, who knows :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you literally never seen the margins on a piece of paper before? </p>
<p>Also you do realize they basically had columns/boxes for each decimal place right? They would then have to have 2 numbers in a box if it was forged.</p>
<p>The smart question for you to ask would by why don't they just align the numbers to the left margin and then put the dollar sign on the right</p></div>		</li>
