<p>Edit: this is my most upvoted comment ever guys, thanks. Who knew we all hated the way we sound so much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But think of it this way. Maybe if everyone heard your voice the way you hear it, they wouldn't be able to stand having you talk anymore. So you prefer your version , they prefer the recording version.  </p>
<p>Or, everyone also hates the way you sound and they're just too nice to say anything. </p>
<p>Well fuck that. I'm not speaking anymore either :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's just a recording of your vocals, it will definitely sound strange. I recorded myself singing along to a song and just listened to the recording and hated it. But I decided to take my vocal track and add it to a karaoke version of the song (no vocals) and it sounded better. I'm not good enough to be a pro, but the combination of backup song and vocals can help mask some of those things that might bother you. </p>
<p>Another fun trick is to search for popular songs with the vocals isolated. A lot of major singers sound slightly off with an isolated track. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about this last week.  Could someone make an app that processed voices to sound like what the speaker hears?  Is the difference in bone such that it would be too hard to find a common setting?  Could you just put a couple things to tweak a bit to make it sound closer to what the speaker hears in their on head?</p>
<p>I'm never gonna make the app so I'll throw the idea out there.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc phones cut off a lot of the higher and lower frequencies to save bandwidth, without those frequencies it could be harder to hear what makes someone's voice unique</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Narrow band voice is 300Hz-4kHz, wideband voice extends to 8kHz, and super wideband goes up to 16kHz. (20kHz is considered the upper limit for hearing.)</p>
<p>All the &quot;S&quot; and &quot;th&quot; and &quot;f&quot; sounds are dependent on higher frequencies, so the more band limited the harder someone is to understand.<br />
Plus, phones don't even faithfully reproduce the frequency range they operate in. Some frequencies are emphasized more than others as an artifact of the microphone, speaker, and other factors.<br />
All this adds up to voices sounding different on the phone than they do in person.  </p>
<p>The same thing happens with ALL recordings, to some extent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone always says my mom and I sound exactly the same on the phone (when my sister calls my mom and I pick up just saying “hello”, no name mentioning, she’ll think she’s speaking to my mom). But in real life our voices are not so similar, they’re pretty different. For example my mom’s singing voice is high soprano while I’m an alto. Always wondered why we sound so similar on the phone.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Phones don't actually transmit the audio signal as is, but note specific distinct sounds that you make and then synthetize the speech from those notes. (relevant: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocoder" target="_blank">vocoder on Wikipedia</a>)</p>
<p>So, when you call someone, they don't hear your voice, but an approximate reconstruction of your voice.</p></div>		</li>
