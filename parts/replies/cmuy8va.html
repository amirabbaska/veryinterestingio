			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there is no evidence that raw food is better for dogs and <em>a lot</em> of evidence to the contrary:</p>
<p>&quot;In what is thought to be the largest ever nutritional evaluation of recipes for home-prepared dog foods, the researchers found that very few of 200 recipes analyzed provided all of the essential nutrients in amounts adequate for meeting established canine health standards.&quot; <a href="http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10666" target="_blank">http://news.ucdavis.edu/search/news_detail.lasso?id=10666</a></p>
<p>&quot;The accusations that commercial dog foods are nutritionally inadequate or unsafe are not supported by any objective or scientific evidence, only anecdotes, intuition, and conspiracy theories. There is, in contrast, significant evidence that commercial dog foods are nutritious and healthy and that they have contributed to greater longevity and reduced nutritional and infectious disease morbidity of dogs fed these diets.
The benefits promised by advocates of BARF diets for dogs are numerous. Greater health, less disease, better quality of life, and much more. Dr. Billinghurst’s web site even claims, “Eating bones for a dog is a joyous experience. It is so enjoyed by dogs that it actually of itself boosts their immune system.” However, there is absolutely no scientific evidence to support these claims. BARF proponents have no shortage of opinions and anecdotes to demonstrate the benefits of their diets, but they have a severe shortage of data.&quot; <a href="http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/raw-meat-and-bone-diets-for-dogs-its-enough-to-make-you-barf/" target="_blank">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/raw-meat-and-bone-diets-for-dogs-its-enough-to-make-you-barf/</a></p>
<p>&quot;No objective scientific evidence has yet demonstrated that feeding Grain Free, Natural, Holistic, Organic, or Raw diets to otherwise healthy pets, when compared to conventional diets, leads to a better outcome for the pet.&quot; <a href="http://vet.osu.edu/vmc/myths-and-misconceptions-surrounding-pet-foods" target="_blank">http://vet.osu.edu/vmc/myths-and-misconceptions-surrounding-pet-foods</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs certainly did not evolve to eat raw meat: <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/23/science/la-sci-how-dogs-evolved-20130124" target="_blank">http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/23/science/la-sci-how-dogs-evolved-20130124</a></p>
<p>There's no credible evidence to suggest that commercial pet food is harmful or unhealthy for dogs. <em>None.</em></p>
<p>People have been promoting raw meat diets for dogs for decades with all kinds of touted benefits and yet no one has produced even a single lonely little study to support any of these claims.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That said,  I will say briefly that dogs and cats are carnivores.   I don't need a lot of peer reviewed studies (who the hell would even find those?) to tell me that they should not be eating a corn based food: I just need two brain cells rubbing together.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not only are dogs evolved to digest carbohydrate-rich foods, virtually every anatomical structure on a dog related to hunting (teeth, senses, brainpower, jaw strength, etc.) is dramatically smaller and underpowered compared to a wolf's. All you need to do is compare a wolf skull to a dog skull. Look how much smaller and weaker the dog skull is. The evidence is astonishingly clear: dogs did not evolve to hunt and eat meat. They evolved to hang around humans and eat our trash. I know it's fun to believe that Buster is a mighty predator in cocker spaniel clothing, but your dog's natural diet is what it would find in a dump.</p></div>		</li>
