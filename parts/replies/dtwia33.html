			<div class="markdown"><p>There is internal friction, happening inside the material as it gets deformed during vibration.</p>
<p>One way to think about it is that &quot;big&quot; vibrations slowly get broken down into lots of &quot;smaller&quot; vibrations in random directions, which in turn get broken down into even smaller vibrations, and so on. Vibrations at the &quot;smallest level&quot; are nothing other than &quot;thermal energy&quot;, i.e. energy in random motion/vibration of atoms. That's what heat is. In fact, the smallest units of sound or heat in a material have the same name: phonons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP could think of this as a sort of 'internal friction' within the material. As the material flexes, the atoms 'rub past each other' generating heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All matter that is above absolute zero has some heat and thus emits heat as radiation. This is one of the basic principles of physics.</p>
<p>What we consider temperature is that average thermodynamic vibration at the molecular level. So, even if the fork doesn't vibrate it still emits heat. And if you make it vibrate, it will eventually dissipate that vibrating energy as heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not as well as an acoustic, sadly. The pickups in the electric guitar do provide some dampening of the strings simply by the interacting magnetic field. In other words, part of the string vibration has to be used to turn it into an electrical signal going to the amp.</p>
<p>You're probably not going to get much better sustain out of an electric guitar string in a vacuum than you do normally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because the tuning fork, along with anything else with a nonzero temperature, is constantly radiating electromagnetic energy, and the hotter the object, that higher the radiated power. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">here</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you shoot a lead bullet into a hard steel target, the lead slug upon impact will flatten into a disc and all of its kinetic energy will convert into heat. You can calculate the speed that you need to shoot the lead slug at such that upon impact it turns into molten lead. I'll leave that as an exercise for the readers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought some proportion of its kinetic energy would be transferred into the target.  Granted the much higher mass of the target normally means that doesn't impart much acceleration, however it should act as a destination for kinetic energy other than heat in the bullet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hit it enough times, yup.</p>
<p>If you know the mass of a tuning fork (idk, 200g?  400g?), assume it is made of iron, you can work out how much energy it'd take to melt it from a given starting temperature... </p>
<p>Then you work out how much energy each tap will generate.</p>
<p>Then you need to work out how quickly that energy dissipates and what rate you need to hit at to keep adding more and more energy before it radiates off...</p>
<p>Then it's some simple division and multiplication - and you have the answer.</p>
<p>I suspect it's something stupid like half a million taps per second, for a month or two.</p>
<p>In the same way, you can heat a cup of coffee up by screaming at it.    Someone did the maths and apparently if you yell at top volume for 8 years, at the cup of coffee, you may well heat it up to be drinkable.</p>

<p>I've not gone through their math, so whether or not they took into account the drink cooling as it heats (as coffee tends to do when you leave it standing there for 8 years) I dunno.  But the principle is sound. (that wasn't a joke).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would also have to account for evaporation, which would be another vector for heat to escape.  It would also reduce the mass of the coffee though, allowing subsequent energy input to heat it faster.  Depending on the shape of the cup, the reduction in volume of the coffee could reduce or increase the surface area exposed to the air, further altering evaporation and heat exchange.</p></div>		</li>
