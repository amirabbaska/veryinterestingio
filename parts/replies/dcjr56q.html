<p>And if it's nerve endings, would women theoretically have a similar sensation if they used the same soap on their girly bits?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, so you actually enjoy it.  Most of the other responses are negative.  </p>
<p>I can see it being a pleasant feeling in the summer, though I'd personally be more inclined to just take a cold shower and experience the cool everywhere.  Not just the tip of my dick / balls / gooch.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, cutaneous nerves (those in the skin) are specialized. You can imagine that the cold detectors are more plentiful in areas like the skin of the scrotum, which actively responds to temperature changes to maintain the slightly lower than body temp environment ideal for sperm cells. Incidentally, cold receptors (specifically those with TRPM8 channels) are also sensitive to menthol. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm laying in bed next to my wife, and when I read it I stopped, put my phone down, and asked if she ever called her vagina a fluffy sausage wallet. </p>
