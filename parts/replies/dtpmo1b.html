			<div class="markdown"><p>Do realize that this may not be feasible. Sometimes these formats/codecs would be too difficult to decode in real-time without a hardware based decoder. The processor in your TV is likely just powerful enough to do the most expensive thing it's called to do, with no wiggle room. It may not have the oomph to decode a new format in software without accelerated assistance.</p>
<p>As an example. Many people are consternated that the 2017 model of the NVidia Shield TV is incapable of decoding HDR YouTube video, even though YouTube supported HDR video before this device came out. Well, YouTube uses a new version of Google's video codec to stream HDR content, which only devices with hardware support seem to be able to handle. The shield TV has older hardware that wasn't updated when they revved it in 2017. Since it's got a really beefy CPU, though, it may feasibly be able to do it in software, but that device was built to be a game console. generally speaking, TVs aren't designed with a lot of CPU overhead, though.</p></div>		</li>
