			<p>It's important to point out that Neustonic fish aren't constantly fighting against the current.  Even in the most rapid of rivers, there will always be eddies, fissures, and washouts where fish can literally duck into into to sleep, eat, and mate.</p>		</li>

			<p>Trout are just a beautiful example of this. I can't even  in good conscience say they &quot;fight&quot; the current, because they spend most of their time at the bottom where the current is weakest, and they're so hydrodynamic that it takes negligible effort to stay in one spot. It's the amount of effort needed for a human to stay upright in a breeze.</p>		</li>

			<p>I have caught huge bull trout out of class 4 rapids in MT. They sit right behind the big boulders and dash out for food.</p>		</li>
