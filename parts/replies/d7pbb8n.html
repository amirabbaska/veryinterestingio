			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to point out (as someone who guides people down rivers for work) that there are parts of rivers called &quot;eddies&quot; where the current is actually going upstream after it passes an obstruction. When the water passes by an obstruction, rock or fallen tree, it parts around it and water from slightly downstream comes upstream to fill the space. Similar to how bikers use teams circulating who is in the back, getting the easiest time because of the reduced air resistance from this effect.
This is why fishermen will often fish directly after a river bend where the bend in the river creates a natural eddy and perfect pool where fish do not have to swim upstream</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trout are just a beautiful example of this. I can't even  in good conscience say they &quot;fight&quot; the current, because they spend most of their time at the bottom where the current is weakest, and they're so hydrodynamic that it takes negligible effort to stay in one spot. It's the amount of effort needed for a human to stay upright in a breeze.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If they are being pushed downstream, when they reproduce their offspring can't really be catapulted upstream I'd assume</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plankton are generally not found at the top of a river. They're typically only found in high-order (large, and lots of tributaries flow in) streams. Food webs in headwater streams are generally based on terrestrial carbon (e.g. leaves from surrounding trees) that falls into the river. It actually makes for a really cool continuum of animals from headwaters to large rivers, where in each section of the river continuum, you can find animals with different feeding strategies - eating dead leaves, filter feeding, scraping algae off rocks, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they develop better on slow currents and are generally more present at large and slow rivers on plains, that receive waters from smaller rivers and streams.  (3rd or higher order rivers) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that part.</p>
<p>But at some point the river has a start.  I can understand the downstream slower sections being able to build up a critical mass of plankton so that the amount being washed downstream doesn't wash out all of the plankton at that location or it is sufficiently replaced by plankton flowing downstream.</p>
<p>My question is why don't you see cascading issues where upstream plankton is all washed downstream (preventing future plankton from existing in a location to be washed down).</p></div>		</li>
