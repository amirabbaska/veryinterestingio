			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. I imagine a lot would either be pulled into the sun, a planet, or orbit around either. We might have periodic showers of iron, calcium, ect., but maybe we'll get rings out of it. I can't help but wonder how much of an influence the ort cloud has on these sorts of things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The very hot ones are usually either supernova remnants, shock fronts, or the intracluster medium of a galaxy cluster. The supernova remnants are hot because the supernova deposits a gargantuan amount of energy into the ejecta and its surroundings. Shock fronts are when gases or plasmas collide at high relative velocities, and are essentially heated by the kinetic energy of the particles. The galaxy intracluster medium is the more interesting one--it's heated largely by the activity of the AGN in the central cD elliptical galaxy and the collisional heating of galaxies and subclusters when they infall, merge, or interact with the cluster. When the gas gets superheated to millions (or tens, or hundreds of millions) of degrees kelvin, it's pretty optically thin and so actually doesn't cool itself very efficiently, allowing it to remain at high temperatures for long timescales (though the continued input from the AGN and other sources is necessary to keep it that hot over the long term).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the reply! So if I am not mistaken, me floating through one of those clouds (like the one you mentioned in the end with the AGN nearby), I would not burn to death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is an average of the kinetic energy of molecules.</p>
<p>Very small numbers of molecules can still have very high temperatures.</p>
<p>As an example, contrast hot water (80 degrees C) to steam (120 degrees C). The steam will have perhaps one thousandth of the density of the water, but still has the higher temperature.</p></div>		</li>
