			<div class="markdown"><p>Lightning thunder is caused by air being suddenly heated to a very high temperature, which is not the case around HV line, unless there's a short circuit.</p>
<p>Corona discharge produces a hissing sound, modulated at 120 Hz, that's one of the causes of the sound you hear. The other is the magnetic field making the cables vibrate. When you have parallel cables conducting current, they will create a magnetic field that will make each other vibrate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Corona discharge being described as &quot;baby lightning&quot; is correct. It's a hot plasma like lightning, but the arcs are physically short and low current density. In fact you cannot hear the negative discharges from the ground because it's much easier to get an electron to release from the metal so they are very small, You only hear the corona streamers on the positive half-cycle (60 Hz fundamental).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was due to the line vibrating because of the 60Hz AC current passing through it - the vibration transferring to air, that we hear as hum</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Fun fact, transformers sound different in North American than they do in Europe, as NA uses 60hz and Europe mostly uses 50hz.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, I was thinking of being in a bath with Natalie Portman. Good guess though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: getting a lot of upvotes. I was wrong, the magnetic fields induced can cause the cables to vibrate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what a thunderclap is. When the electricity travels through the air it gets momentarily hot enough for the air itself to turn into plasma (hence the light). This leaves a vacuum where the plasma is, and the sound itself is caused by how the surrounding billions of tons of air in the atmosphere rushes to fill the gap, colliding into itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but as far as I understand, that's the crackle before the bang. The bang itself is the atmosphere filling its gap. I could be wrong though. My intuition could be stronger.</p></div>		</li>
