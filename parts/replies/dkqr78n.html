			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 99% sure &quot;to insure promptness&quot; is a false etymology for tip.  Aside from it having the characteristic flavour of a folk etymology, and words formed from acronyms being essentially nonexistent before the 20th century, </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&quot;insure&quot; means &quot;pay money to protect against the risk of loss&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>&quot;ensure&quot; means &quot;make certain something happens&quot; </li>
</ul>
<p>so according to that explanation it should really be &quot;tep&quot;.</p>
<p>Snopes also deem it false, pointing out the word &quot;tip&quot; meaning &quot;small monetary gift in exchange for service&quot; has existed for centuries.  While it might be entirely true to say &quot;the New York times gave it as the origin&quot;.... they were wrong if they did so :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is only one definition for &quot;insure&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/insure" target="_blank">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/insure</a></p>
<p>1:  to provide or obtain insurance on or for</p>
<p><strong>2:  to make certain especially by taking necessary measures and precautions</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK it looks like insure and ensure are used interchangeably so as good little descriptivists perhaps we can strike that point.</p>
<p>The difference in meaning still applies because under definition 1 of &quot;insure&quot;, the outcome would be paying a tip at the beginning which entitles you to monetary recompense for poor service. </p>
<p>&quot;Insuring my phone&quot; doesn't prevent me from breaking it, it means I pay some money so if I do break my phone the insurers pay to repair it, which isn't the same as a tip guaranteeing (or ensuring) good service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused as to why insure would not be the correct word to use here. If insure means to pay money to protect against the risk of losing something, and tipping is paying to protect against the loss of promptness then why would it not be correct to say the acronym is tip rather than tep?</p></div>		</li>
