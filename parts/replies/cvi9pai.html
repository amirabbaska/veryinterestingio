			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen some videos talking about a cheaper way to signal would be to make something orbiting the star very close that is of an unnatural shape. Some sort of large flat square or triangle.</p>
<p>The idea being that anyone looking for dips in the starlight to find planets in the way Kepler does, would see the dip from this artificial satellite, and would be able to tell by the shape of the dip that the orbiting object has an unusual shape, and might deduce it is unnatural and was put there as a signal.</p>
<p>This could be a passive way of having a permanent 'beacon'.</p>
<p>It's an interesting thought</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, are square and triangular orbits even possible? How would you achieve nearly instantaneous acceleration required at the vertices when gravity is constant? I would guess that carrying any kind of propellant to accomplish this would not be feasible beyond maybe a few orbits, if that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the orbit, the <em>satellite</em>. Space has a hardon for rounded objects, but straight lines are rare. So having a perfect cube / pyramid / w'ever orbiting the sun would be a point of interest, if anybody noticed it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but it is an interesting thought to do so in this manner.</p>
<p>Also might be worth searching for these. As far as I know, seti hasn't looked for something like this, but Kepler's data is public, anyone could have at it looking for non-spherical satellites</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that concept assumes there is something <em>better</em> than light to communicate across lightyears.</p>
<p>If there's such a reliable system, our physicists haven't found it.  That doesn't mean it doesn't exist, but its a lot less likely we'll find something to replace radio waves as easily as radio replaced smoke.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An advanced civilization would be efficient. They wouldn't waste energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily.  If they have a source of virtually unlimited and clean energy then there's no reason to not be wasteful.</p>
<p>In regards to possible advanced alien civilizations I think either outcome is equally likely (they are efficient and conservative vs. they are wasteful of an abundant supply).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's true we aren't in a very exciting area, but for all we know that is for the best in regards to life. It might be that highly variable conditions such as those found in a nebula or closer to the galactic nucleus are detrimental to life because life does not have enough time to adapt to the changing conditions. </p></div>		</li>
