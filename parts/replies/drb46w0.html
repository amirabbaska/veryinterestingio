			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that one of the reasons cold air has a positive effect is that the combustion process is negatively effected by the presence of H2O. Therefore, as cold air can hold less moisture that warm air, the combustion process losses less energy to heating the unreacted H2O. Additionally, the presence of H2O can lend to side reactions that take away from the energy of combustion.
Also, the primary source of thrust of turbofans is due to the difference of momentum of the exiting air from the nozzle of the engine to the momentum of the inlet air. My intuition tells me that due to an equal exit temperature of the engine of both scenarios, the higher the temperature difference from outlet to inlet, the higher momentum difference. Although this would almost certainly be paralleled by a loss of efficiency due to lower pressure in the colder scenario (cause altitude).

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turbine engineering guy here - </p>
<p>Air density (as a function of altitude, temperature, and humidity) is more important than just humidity for a turbine engine.  I work on ground-based systems that actually inject water into the intake to increase air density at higher temperatures, thereby increasing the power output of the turbine.  This doesn't have much to do with combustion efficiency - in fact, there are systems that also inject water into the combustor to control the emissions.  Aero engines don't use water injection for emission control, but there are sophisticated systems (such as the TAPS combustor) that control the fuel to maintain efficient emissions without water injection. </p>
<p>Higher inlet air density, as a function of temperature, humidity or altitude =  higher power output with the same amount of fuel, since the compressor does not have to work as hard to get the same compression as it does with less dense air.  A turbine at sea level produces MUCH more power than the same engine on the top of Mount Everest (possibly as much as twice the power, depending on the engine).  Also, note that turbines use about 50% of the power they generate to just keep themselves running.  They're terribly inefficient but awesome when a high power-to-weight ratio is required.</p>
<p>The thrust from an aero turbine comes almost entirely from the big ass fan bolted to the front of the engine. The thrust generated from the combustion gases escaping the LP turbine is a small percentage of the total thrust, and is also small compared to the thrust generated by the turbine's compressor itself.  </p>
<p>The altitudes that aero engines operate at are a good compromise to get the best engine performance and the least drag on the aiframe.  There is always a treadeoff between the ideal and the realistic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any issues with impact damage to the blades or possibly even cavitation with the water injection into the intake?<br />
This is a big point of disagreement in the high performance car/bike world, whether to inject water or water-meth pre or post turbo due to concerns about blade longevity. As someone who deals with a similar process in an industrial setting, where things like longevity of the equipment is generally pretty well thought-out and accounted for, I'm interested to get your input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cold air intakes on cars exist for this reason; cooler air, pulled farther from the engine, is more dense than warm air from the engine bay, providing more oxygen per unit for combustion.</p>
<p>Edit: I’ll be honest with you guys...I wasn’t considering the fact that air is less dense to begin with higher in the atmosphere. So I’m not sure that this would be valid reasoning. I specialize in terrestrial vehicles, I’m no good with aeronautics!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was just the same as in internal combustion engines in that you can fit more cold air in to the combustion chamber at the same pressure, which enables you to burn more fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although that has an effect, I believe the presence of humidity is of a higher factor.
Also, at a high altitude to achieve such cold temperatures, the engine needs to direct much more energy to the Fan blades in order to adequately pressurize the combustion zone to an equal pressure as at a lower altitude. This pressurization energy given to the fan blades, in turn, takes energy away from the exiting flow of air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is referring to isentropic efficiency, which would increase. Not noted however is the drastic decrease in efficiency due to pressure drop. </p>
<p>Also: many many many assumptions made in the Carnot cycle that can’t apply in this case. Especially since the Carnot cycle implies work is being done on the surroundings with the excess energy (which is the case in an internal combustion engine), and turbofans don’t really use that principle to their advantage, instead they just use the change in momentum of the air to produce thrust.</p></div>		</li>

<p>May as well just call it velocity, really.  Whereas indicated airspeed is based on how much pressure the outside air is applying to the pressure sensor on the nose of the plane, and can be wrong and influenced by all sorts of factors, &quot;true air speed&quot; is how fast you are actually moving in 3D space.</p></div>		</li>
