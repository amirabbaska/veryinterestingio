<p>if radiation is even a significant factor at the depths in question.</p>

<p>Nice question. Surely the martian atmosphere is not thick enough to provide meaningful protection against cosmic rays, so any bacteria on the surface would be exposed. However the soil is very dense. It's a high-Z material, so the probabilities of collisions with atomic nuclei and spallation are significant, most likely causing secondary radiation. However this one is stopped as well if your shield is thick enough.</p>
<p>Therefore, at shallow depths like a few cm or tens of cm, radiation must be even worse than on the surface. But if you go much deeper, like several m, then it can be much lower.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wow is this really the case ? I am just an interested layman but my guess would have been, that even a few cm of this Mars soil should offer good protection. Is this secondary radiation that big of a deal ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow on from what katinla said, at a depth of 3m below the surface the radiation levels equal that at the earth's surface. At 1m depth the level has dropped sufficiently for the radio resistant bacteria <em>D. Radiodurans</em> to survive over evolutionary time scales (they can survive acute doses 5,000 higher than we can). </p>
<p>In on mobile at the moment but can get a reference once I get back to my computer. </p>

<p><em>&quot;Suggesting that Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) radiation is no longer the dominant source of radiation below ~3 m.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Even the radioresistant organism D. radiodurans would, if dormant, be eradicated in the top several meters in a time span of a few million years&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Applying the RAD dose results, we estimate that only a 1-m-depth drill is necessary to access the same viable radioresistant cells.&quot;</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>Does that mean that all possible human shelters must be located 2m below mars surface, or a similar protection layer on top? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not like if you're at the surface you get instantly fried. The surface is 100 times greater than Earth's surface, or about a mammogram a day. Definitely not wise to be under that level of radiation, but it's also not Chernobyl levels.</p>
<p>Ideas have been put forward to basically shovel Martian regolith on top of your living quarters to shield the radiation. If you wanted to reduce it to Earth's levels then yes, you'd need 3m of dirt above you (not counting any effect of the shelter material itself), but you'd most likely be able to get away with less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meters of dirt also has the convenient property of putting pressure on your habitat. It's one of the better colonization plans, imo - brick vaults built several meters underground - the brick is made from local soil, and the dirt above it both pressurizes and radiation shields the habitat. All you need to do is put a spray on coating on the inside of the bricks to make them airtight (and that 3m of dirt means it doesn't need to be 100% airtight, since leak rates will be low) and you're set.</p></div>		</li>
