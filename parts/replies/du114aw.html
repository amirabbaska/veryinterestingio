			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of rogue biochemistry going on in this thread! The first 24 hours of fasting is special because your liver is doing what it does overnight - release the glucose (sugar) store, then making glucose (sugar) from muscle parts + fat. This mode is used to limp your body through a short fast without damaging the really valuable-and-hard-to-make energy stores (fat) too much. </p>
<p>In that first 24 hours of a fast your body is burning through all its stored glucose. This is <em>not</em> something your body ever wants to do because glucose is a quick-release energy source in the form the brain needs. This is probably why this first 24 hours is so tough, because the body really wants you to just eat something instead.  </p>
<p>Once you push through that 24 hours the body switches gears, the fat stores are up for grabs, the kidneys get involved, and the supply, conversion and conservation of energy sources become the goal. </p>
<p>edit: whoops, got a bit technical here, edited for simplicity. </p>
<p>Edit2: keto fans, this comment describes the lead up to ketosis, not what happens once ketosis is occurring. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pretty much, although your body also knows your usual dining times so even when youre fasting your hunger levels (ghrelin) will go up around the times you usually have breakfast/lunch etc. Your body adapts over time so after 4-5 days it gets used to the new eating schedule and those peaks also change</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that it can take 3-6 months for ghrelin and hormone levels to adjust to a new eating schedule fully. It makes sense why changing a diet is hard, considering even with the best of intentions your body just wants what it wants, like an angry toddler that can constantly kick you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you follow some basic ground rules you should be safe:  </p>
<ul>
<li>drink enough water/mineral water  </li>
<li>do it gradually, don't start with a 3 days fast. try 24 hours, then stop and a couple of days later start again and increase a bit  </li>
<li>at first I'd avoid exercising and hard physical work during your fast. Later, when you're used to it's not a problem  </li>
<li>more than 3 days fasting I'd ask a specialist for advice because your body needs micronutrients. 3 days or below should be fine.</li>

It can even be quite healthy, obviously discuss it with your doctor first, tho, there are many conditions that can make it dangerous (pregnancy, growth, illnesses, wounds, major physical tasks you are not used to (like a multi day hike), etc.)</p></div>		</li>
