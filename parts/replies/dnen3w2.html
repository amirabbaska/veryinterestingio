A lot of what people say is microwave mythology. The real reasons things are heated in a microwave oven are: Dielectric losses, Hysteresis losses, and Ohmic Heating or combination's thereof. I wish people would get off the usual microwave &amp; water kick and all the other simplistic reasons.</p>

<p>On Dielectric losses:

<p>In addition to dielectric losses there are Eddy current losses (Ohmic or I^2 R), the electric currents that are induced to flow in the material, and cause Ohmic heating. Think about the conductivity of an ionic water solution. Currents are flowing through basically a salt water resistor. Try microwaving deionized or distilled water versus adding some salt to it.</p>
<p>Some microwave browning plates use magnetic hysteresis losses. They have ferrite embedded into the plate.

<p>In short each item has to be analyzed specifically for the loss mechanisms that are responsible for the heating of that material in a microwave field of X frequency. </p></div>		</li>
