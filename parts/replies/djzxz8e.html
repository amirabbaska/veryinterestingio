<p>In a sense, yes.  Though before expanding on that, it should be noted that withdrawal generally doesn't produce a large degree of <em>pain</em> in the commonly accepted, physical sense (for most individuals.)  It does tend to cause some muscle soreness and aches, as well as some pretty bad headaches, but why people might describe it in terms of a &quot;reverse orgasm&quot; is likely the many other symptoms that occur.  Chief among them is simply a very powerful sense of depression/dysphoria, lethargy but constant restlessness, severe difficulty sleeping, sweating, and catastrophic diarrhea - as well as varying degrees of nausea or vomiting.  Dysphoria could very well be described as a sort of mental pain. To a lesser degree all these other physical symptoms together, by the simple virtue of their deep unpleasantness, could also fit as a form of mental pain as well.</p>
<p>Anyway! Now that that's cleared up, yes one could say we are always in some degree of physical pain.  However it tends to be small enough that it doesn't usually manage to make it all the way into conscious attention.  One aspect of the after-effects of extended opioid use is well known as hyperalgesia, essentially a strong sensitization to pain.  The neural network in charge of processing pain could be said to be starved for input, and even the smallest activation can thus be radically amplified by this network (one reason is that this network strives for some degree of homeostasis - on a vast number of different levels - in our case we are just looking at its output.  It's used to outputting X amount of pain information, when the regular input is suddenly shut off, it attempts to renormalize its output to be commensurate with its now tiny-input.  When the regular input returns, it's now wildly amplified by this network until it can re-calibrate itself to transmit pain data more accurately.)  As a result, the tiny little amounts of pain sent along to this network - a small muscle ache or whatnot - are experienced as far far stronger than they normally should be.</p>
<p>A part of this is this morphine-like substance naturally produced by the body, a class of compounds known as endorphins. Specifically, the ones that are most like morphine in terms of pain are the enkephalins (if I remember correctly.)  These guys are produced to help regulate how much pain we experience - and to a significant degree how much enjoyment we experience.  As in the example above, now that they are no longer being produced, they are unable to block or moderate the small pain signals that are always ongoing in our bodies, leading to hyperalgesia as well as that depression withdrawal produces</p>
<p>Finally, as another poster pointed out, there's a competition between the 'enjoyment' and 'pain' neural systems.  Just to be brief as its covered well there, the enjoyment system has been downregulated and the pain system has been upregulated.  Even if there were an absence of pain signals being passed up into the pain network, there's always a minimal level of activity going on.  This minimal level of activity is, as above, also strongly amplified and leads to the sensation of pain even in the complete absence of 'physical pain' as defined by the production of pain signals in the body.</p>
<p>This is also similar to what happens to certain chronic pain patients in many instances - while the initial injury is long gone, the network (for yet poorly understood reasons) has become hypersensitized and hyperactive leading to a constant subjective experience of severe pain without actual bodily damage.  In effect, the network has become self-sustaining, producing pain signals all the time regardless of the actual degree of pain input from the body</p>
<p>Many other symptoms of withdrawal hinge on highly similar mechanisms - basically a bounce-back in output of a opioid-suppressed system, further enhanced by a lack of the natural endorphins that would have helped limit the extent of this bounce-back.  Sweating, runny nose, and other autonomic problems stem from over-activation of certain sympathetic systems - such as those mediated by the locus coeruleus; the common withdrawal aid medication clonidine inhibits the sympathetic nervous system and prevents these symptoms to a large degree</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body produces endorphins to combat pain. Also other stuff makes it, like exercising. That's why exercise feels so good. And part of why you don't feel pain mid-fight as much, but it 'hits you' after.</p></div>		</li>
