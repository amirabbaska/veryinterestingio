			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but they cannot intersect (since they would collide and stop being rings). Rings can be at any angle, though it would be very unusual for them to not all be on the same plane, since they are disturbed by other planets and moons etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Clearly the atmosphere matches the earth's spin at the ground. </p>

<p>not necessarily. wind happens. at the equator (because orbits always follow a grand circle) winds blow predominantly from east to west, which implies that the atmosphere rotates slightly slower than the planet at that point. thing is tho, if you go up to the altitude of the jet stream, the direction is reversed (which is why clouds rotate faster than the planet itself) because that's how fluid dynamics work. orbital mechanics (speed to maintain altitude) doesn't come in to it because the air at the top of the atmosphere is held up by the pressure of the air underneath it rather than angular momentum.</p>
<p>your first guess is accurate.</p></div>		</li>
