			<div class="markdown"><p>More recently, we have another tool to discover supernovae - one without extinction: neutrinos. SN 1987A was a supernova <em>outside</em> the Milky Way, but still powerful enough to be picked up by detectors in 1987. With 30 years of detector improvements and the smaller distance, a new supernova in our galaxy will be immediately obvious to neutrino detectors - we didn't have any in the last 30 years.</p>
<p>Even better: neutrinos are emitted directly when the core collapses, visible light is emitted once the shock front reaches the surface, which typically takes a a few hours. The neutrinos fly at nearly the speed of light, so they arrive here earlier than the light. If the neutrino detectors pick up a supernova signal, they automatically send a message to various telescopes (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova_Early_Warning_System" target="_blank">SNEWS</a>), so we can watch that spot for the upcoming supernova.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty far - exactly how far no one knows.</p>
<p>The neutrinos from supernova 1987 traveled 160,000 light years, yet their arrival times were consistent with traveling at light speed with a sensitivity of 2 parts per billion.</p>
<p>We know that neutrinos have mass and thus can't travel at the speed of light. But since we haven't been able to measure the mass yet, we don't know how much of a deviation that makes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere at the very outer edge of the observable universe (and even then only because the neutrinos would slow down with the expansion of the universe), but no stars existed back then. No, does not happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a planet -- most likely Venus. Source: ESO description of photo ( <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso0932a/" target="_blank">http://www.eso.org/public/images/eso0932a/</a> ) mentions planets are visible in this montage. The brightest star in the sky, Sirius, can be seen close to Orion's Belt and is nowhere near as bright as this object. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How can a mountain range not be discovered in California until the 1970's?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They knew the mountains existed (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wilson_Observatory" target="_blank">the world's largest optical telescope for 1917-1949 is atop one</a>, but they were rarely visible from only a mile or two away due to smog, as late as the '90s.</p>
<p>In 1990, it was common to be able to discern a bluish haze diminishing the clarity of even the other side of a city street!</p></div>		</li>
