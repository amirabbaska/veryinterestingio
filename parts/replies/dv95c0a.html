			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm about to sleep but I can give a more complete answer tomorrow. In general, STM produces images by probing an array (typically around 1000 by 1000 points or less) of points on the sample surface and measuring the electronic density of states at a certain voltage (via a tunneling current) at each point.<br />
An SEM is similar in that it also rasters across many points on the sample but works by focusing an electron beam onto the sample instead of tunneling via a conductive tip. The electrons can be focused down to approximately a nanometer and excite electrons in the sample and cause them to be emitted. The emitted electrons are measured by a detector which constructs a topographic map of the sample. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to chime in before you're awake, but this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>probing an array (typically around 1000 by 1000 points or less) of points on the sample surface</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is quite vague, and conceals how cool the tech is.  What actually happens is that you make a very fine conductive tip (usually out of tungsten) -- so fine that you get a single atom, or string of atoms, right at the end.</p>
<p>Then you bring this tip very close to the surface you'd like to image.  When it's close enough, then electrons quite literally appear on the other side of the gap due to the uncertainty in their state functions.  The current generated by these &quot;tunnelling&quot; electrons is further used as a feedback mechanism to maintain the distance between the tip and the sample, and the current changes are used to produce the image by scanning across, row by row, column by column.  The resolution of the microscope is a function of noise correction, amplification, and the potential across the gap, which affects the tunnelling frequency (and thereby the current).</p>
<p>The STM is quite simply a quantum mechanics-powered microscope.  It's finicky AF - you can spend days as an undergrad trying to get a single good image, but when you do, man, that's one hell of a nerdjaculation.</p>
<p>Edit: The reason you use tungsten, iirc, is because it's conductive, but cleaves in a way that produces very sharp tips.  It's quite brittle and has an amenable mineral structure.  Most other readily-accessible conductive elements don't have this property.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Here's an (poor, but acceptable) animation:
<a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/4hnmBfe9iGVa0/giphy.gif" target="_blank">https://media.giphy.com/media/4hnmBfe9iGVa0/giphy.gif</a></p>
<p>The key problem with it is that it shows electrons in the gap, while, in reality, they don't actually ever exist there; they just resume their existence on the other side.</p>
<p>Edit 3 (while I'm at it):  So, how do you turn the relatively large-scale motions of a positioning mechanism into atomic-level images?  Glad you asked.  Basically, tunnelling happens at relatively large distances if the potential is high enough (not actually all that high, in fact) -- the actual signal itself is made orders of magnitude larger with a liberal application of amps.</p>
<p>So, while the distance (and current) are kept constant, the motions required to achieve this are only <em>proportional</em> to the contour of the sample, and not at the original scale.  In this way, the STM really is a true microscope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, it puts a very sharp needle close enough to the surface that a current is detected in the tip due to quantum tunneling of the electrons from the surface to the tip. The probability of quantum tunneling occurring is very dependent on distance, so the current generated is also. Therefore, they can effectively use the detected current to map the contours of the surface at a high resolution. </p></div>		</li>
