<p>I've read that historian believe there is a link between this tolerance and the rise of agriculture/urban lifestyle in middle east (You can drink milk so you wouldr rather milk the cow than kill it, you cannot move that fast with your milk making animal etc…)  Is it a serious theory ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The immune system is a great example to bring up, because it seems to evolve at an unusually fast rate. Antibody development  isn’t  actually the focus of  the strong selective pressure because they are completely randomly generated, by recombination of genetic segments combined with a few random nucleotides thrown in there by the enzyme Tdt. However, a huge amount of diversity occurs in the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules, which are used by cells in your body to help present molecules to the immune system that may originate from a pathogen such as a virus. Viruses and other pathogens can evolve to become invisible or otherwise evade specific HLA types. As a result, there is a selective pressure to have an HLA type that few other people have, a phenomenon known as frequency dependent selection. This selective pressure resulted in a development of a huge diversity of HLA molecules, even within the last 50,000 years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Language likely predates the arbitrary 50k BP date by well over over a million years, closer to 2 million.  <em>Homo erectus</em> is the first hominid considered to be &quot;human&quot;.  Despite having a slightly smaller brain than modern humans (which date back to 300k-100k years ago) <em>H. erectus</em> had fire, boats, a specific tool culture, and likely clothes based on where they moved into.  This strongly suggests that they had language, and a relatively advanced one.</p>
<p>The primary physical differences between <em>H. sapiens</em> and <em>H. erectus</em> are <del>below</del> above the neck, but the brain size between the species overlaps quite a bit.  <em>H. erectus</em> is, in terms of the length of time the species survived, the most successful of the hominid lineage by a ridiculous degree.  They were also the ones to colonize a large portion of the world.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Writing is an interesting issue.  Taking the example of Australian Aborigines there was a long-standing artistic culture with recurring iconography that held specific meaning.  It's obviously not <em>writing</em>, but where <em>exactly</em> do you draw that line... it's like the old saying about the difference between art and pornography, you know it when you see it.</p>
<p>My own view is that, as you said, writing is not as specialized a skill as we like to imagine it is.  It takes a culture-wide acceptance of a paradigm shift in utilizing a culture-wide, agreed upon abstract system for physically representing a set of ideas and concepts, which are also abstract, which is a <em>big</em> deal, but it doesn't really represent anything fundamentally different than spoken language or art or other forms of transferable material culture.  That indicates that the major difference is cultural, not conceptual.  Who knows how often writing had been invented in the past but never spread beyond a couple of people.</p>
<p>Pretty much every single thing we have held up to distinguish ourselves from other animals or other hominids has been demonstrated to not be distinctive or unique, yet we keep trying.  No, or at least none that we have found yet, individual traits distinguish us in a meaningful way, but our <em>combination</em> of various traits might.  Probably not from <em>H. erectus</em>, <em>H. neanderthalensis</em>, <em>H. Altai</em> (Denisovans), and maybe not even significantly from <em>H. floresiensis</em>, but probably from the rest of the animal kingdom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but their brains seem to have been organized slightly differently (based on brain casing casts from ancient skulls).  What that means in a practical sense is unknown and there is still a lot of debate about what the extra space was used for, if anything.</p>
<p>Currently Inuit people have, on average, the largest brains of present day humans. This drove early anthropologists into a frenzy because the anthropology of the late 1800s was largely about proving the <em>superiority</em> of Europeans and brain cavity size was thought to be an indicator of relative intelligence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading something about the hypoglossal canal being used to date the origins of spoken language. Here's what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglossal_canal" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> has on it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The hypoglossal canal has recently been used to try to determine the antiquity of human speech. Researchers have found that hominids who lived as long as 2 million years ago had the same size canal as that of modern-day chimpanzees; some scientists thus assume they were incapable of speech. However, archaic H. sapiens 400,000 years ago had the same size canal as that of modern humans, meaning they could have been capable of speech. Some Neanderthals also had the same size hypoglossal canal as archaic H. sapiens. However recent studies involving several primate species have failed to find conclusive evidence of a relationship between its size and speech.</p>

<p>I realize this link hasn't been fully established, but if it was, would this mean that there couldn't have been spoken language in humans as far back as 2 million years ago?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I woke up this morning I was thinking more about this issue and instead of editing my previous post I'll add a new one.</p>
<p>The hypoglossal canal may well be an indication that language is <em>really</em> old, long pre-dating that physical structure.</p>
<p>Novel physical structures in biology don't just appears out of the blue.  They evolve from one structure into another and for that to happen there needs to be some sort of selective pressure. If the hypoglossal canal makes it easier to have a spoken language it's very presence may be a strong indicator of language existing long before the modern hypoglossal canal existed and providing selective pressure for the structure to evolve.</p></div>		</li>

Take it away, <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-dawn-farming-changed-our-mouths-worst-180954167/" target="_blank">Smithsonian magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>up until about 12,000 years ago, humans had what one of the study’s lead authors called “an almost ‘perfect harmony’ between their lower jaws and teeth.” </p>
<p>The big change, scientists say, came from civilization’s transition from hunter-gatherers to farmers. The study, published this week in PLOS One, analyzed “the lower jaws and teeth crown dimensions of 292 archaeological skeletons from the Levant, Anatolia and Europe, from between 28,000-6,000 years ago,” reports University College Dublin, where the study’s lead author, Ron Pinhasi,  is an associate professor of archaeology.</p>

<p>EDIT: Hit post too soon. Adding a summary.</p>
<p>It appears that before farming, hunter gatherers had larger lower jaws into which all our teeth, including wisdom teeth, fit perfectly. With the advent of farming, jaw size decreased taking us to the modern day with massively expensive orthodontics and braces during those awkward teenage years. The hypothesis is that the modern diets (here meaning largely grains cooked until soft, i.e. those of the first farmers til today) don't give the jaw a good workout, so it doesn't grow as much or as strong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense--bone growth and remodeling depends largely on repetitive stresses placed on the bones. This is why in the microgravity of space, astronauts lose bone mass so quickly. The body is constantly breaking down bone and putting down new layers. If there is no stress and tension placed on the bones, the body does not regenerate them as strongly. </p>
<p>The system responds to both hormonal (influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors) and environmental factors, in that the major lines of stress see heavier bone growth. The typical example is in the femur, the walls of the long diaphysis of the femur see increased density based on how much load they're forced to bear.</p>
<p>Thus it makes sense that if we're not chewing for hours a day on tough meat or foraged grains and leaves, the size and strength of our mandible will decrease. And that's not even accounting for the change in selective genetic pressure for a big, strong jaw.</p></div>		</li>
