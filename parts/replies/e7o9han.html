			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm choosing to reply to your post in particular because you're the only current poster with flair indicating a background....</p>
<p>If the other posters saying that there would be an impact are in fact true, then how much of an orbital impact did the planetary alignment of 5/5/2000 have on earth? When (iirc) mercury, Venus, mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the moon, and the sun were all in perfect alignment on one side of the earth?</p>
<p>I seem to recall scientists at the time (responding to the minor amount of media hysteria) saying that it was something minuscule, like 0.00000001% (I pulled that number out of my ass, but you can see what I'm saying).</p>
<p>Could you add anything to this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But from Earth's point of view, is it more probable that the gas giants will be in the same general direction as the sun vs an opposite one?</p>
<p>It doesn't matter where they are relative to the sun and earths position from it, but relative to Earth and the sun's position from it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Shouldn't Earth speed up considerably or move away from the Sun to conserve it?</p></div>		</li>
