			<div class="markdown"><p>I drank either 750ml or a liter in a day for a month straight so that puts a guess into the question that it would take more liquor or less time consuming to deadly intoxication. sucking down the last drop, of a liter, at two hours sounds like death though. Then again, shoenice chugged an entire fifth of ever clear and lived </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not so sure. Â½ liters perhaps. Also it happens regularly that people chug bottles of booze and die from it. Note that the level of poisoning is reduced if the alcohol is consumed over time.</p></div>		</li>
