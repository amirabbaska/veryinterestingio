			<div class="markdown"><p>Do blackhole mergers run into the same growth limit as conventional blackhole accretion? I know that one of the options that is theorized when we run into the Andromeda galaxy is the supermassive blackholes in each respective galaxy are going to merge.</p>
<p>It would make sense in the early universe if there is a higher density of available gasses, with a higher formation of stars large enough to form black holes. That blackhole mergers would be a much more common event. So the supermassive blackholes would just be the winners in that local area in the merger game. So you should be able to get a pretty rapid growth rate of blackhole mass if each star generation; especially if hypergiants and supergiants formation is much more common at that time. With lots of stars only living a few million years, that seems like it would be plenty to leave enough smaller blackholes around to merge into the supermassive variety.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There are periods, in numerical simulations, in which a black hole can exceed its &quot;theoretical limit&quot; for growth. This is because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddington_luminosity" target="_blank">this limit</a> applies only in the long term. In other words, it can be exceeded briefly, but on the average the accretion rate of a black hole will be below it. </p>

<p>Rapid coalescence of ~100 solar mass black holes formed from massive Pop III stars is indeed one of the proposed mechanisms. But, as you point out, it would require a lot of mergers plus accretion to get to the supermassive black holes we see so early on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wiki articles brushes on the size difference pointing to substantively different formation processes; would it be safe to assume that SMBH did not form via the same processes as normal black holes?  If an early universe (&lt;1b years old) is much hotter and denser, could there been regions of the universe dense enough and filled with enough matter that it simply coalesced into a SMBH, with or without massive early stars or other intermediary forms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think in overly simplified terms what a black hole really is. It's concentrated mass so large that the acceleration due to gravity is greater than the speed of light. So a black hole can be formed outside of the normal method as long as you end up with dense mass with a strong enough gravitational field. </p>
<p>The universe is theorised as coming into being from a singularity and so the first billion years it would have been very dense and enough matter would exist to create some very big objects including supermassive stars. These stars wouldn't live long and could have given birth to these black holes, or the universe was so dense, the black hole could have just formed from has... though that's unlikely unless there is some unknown stage of hydrogen whereby the temperature and pressure is too high for fusion to occur. It's just much more plausible given what we know that the universe has the conditions create super massive stars that became supermassive black holes as only through fusion could the heavier elements have been created to form the dense matter required to make one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, hydrogen gas in a high enough density and quantity to at some point become a black hole will first begin undergoing fusion long before it collapses, which basically guarantees there will be a star long before there is a black hole (unless there were clouds of heavy elements, which as you pointed out, is basically impossible for the early universe).</p>
<p>What would these supermassive protostars have looked like?  At the mass required to give birth to a supermassive black hole, there's no way they're not already collapsing from the moment they're formed- are we looking at massive dense hydrogen gas clouds with millions or billions of protostars in close proximity, with multitudes of regions of fusion taking place, even as they begin to collapse in on themselves?</p>
<p>And related to the hypothetical: Does the math allow for that unknown stage of hydrogen?  Could gravitational pressure overwhelm the outward pressure of the fusion (along with electron/neutron degeneracy and everything else) and collapse into a singularity before the formation of heavier elements?  Or would formation of heavy elements in these short-lived early supermassive stars have massively accelerated the creation of heavy elements?</p>
<p>Thanks for the response!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is more or less exactly <a href="https://astrobites.org/2014/11/24/gas-to-black-holes-direct-formation-of-a-supermassive-black-hole-in-galaxy-mergers/" target="_blank">one of the proposed mechanisms for how you can get a 10^4 - 10^5 solar mass black hole</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the significant clarification of things. If I'm understanding the mechanism for such early black holes, it's considered possible for a black hole to 'direct collapse' without temperature increase. May I ask, is this widely considered plausible and could you recommend a resource to learn more (EDIT: beyond the simulation you linked to at astrobytes)?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The temperature definitely increases; physics is not violated. The key is whether the gas is able to contract evenly enough (without fragmenting) for the temperature of the &quot;core&quot; to get hot enough for the dominant mechanism of energy release to go from photon emission to neutrino emission. Once that happens, the neutrinos escape easily (as they do), and the radiation pressure no longer supports the structure. The core then collapses into a black hole.</p>
<p>We think that the reason why we don't see this in the local universe is that there is too much fragmentation of gas from angular momentum and emission line cooling (which causes localized cooling and thus fragmentation). The angular momentum of much of the gas in the early universe was near zero and the metallicity was primordial (i.e., just hydrogen and helium), so a much larger cloud of gas (around a million solar masses) could maintain its structure and continue to contract, possibly forming a direct-collapse black hole.</p>
<p>The exact physics of the direct collapse scenario has become a bit of a cottage industry, and it is an active field of theoretical research. I'm not sure what kind of resource you're looking for. Most of what I know of are the actual papers. If you're looking for a layman's explanation, I'm afraid I don't know of a good one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got that the temperature increase from contraction would have to be radiated away in some form :) Wound up reading about an isothermal process for black hole formation in the early universe last night but it wasn't very specific about the initial conditions required. Would this be the same process you're outlining, presumably with heating until neutrino emissions make up the bulk of radiative transfer, followed by an accelerating isothermal collapse into a singularity?  </p>
<p>If there are papers you think that a layperson might be able to follow (with a background in maths and stats but not in physics beyond the Feynman lectures) would be indebted. Thanks either way.</p></div>		</li>
