			<div class="markdown"><p>Was going to bring this up, glad to see it's already high up there. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSg408i-eKw" target="_blank">Here's the video of a talk he gave on the topic.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>He goes on to describe two hypothetical games to show extreme version of combining skill and luck. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, in case anyone missed it, his argument is that skill and luck are orthogonal. You can have games that require a great deal of skill and also a great deal of luck, or vice versa (Tic Tac Toe is an easy case of the latter). Games with more luck do cause the more skilled player to lose more often than you would otherwise, but this doesn't actually reduce the amount of skill involved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In many games the skill is in how you respond to poorer odds or even a biased game. You don't have to win the game to show that you're more skilled at it. </p>
<p>Obviously as games tend further to having random chance being the highest weighting on the outcome it diminishes the ability to apply any kind of tactics. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The important point to grasp is that this isn't entirely accurate. Lots of luck diminishes the impact of skill on your chance of winning, but his argument is that it does not at all diminish the skill you can apply. You can still outplay someone, it just may not improve your odds by much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is to make the outcome of a game more unpredictable. If it was 100% skill, then the better player would win 100% of the time = boring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about this same idea recently. In Texas hold 'em, the more talented players get upset when they get a &quot;bad beat,&quot; but if the cards always played out exactly like the probabilities predicted, then nobody would be playing it. It wouldn't be fun. </p>
<p>It really applies to most games. Catan, while there is definitely quite a bit of strategy in placing your initial settlements and roads, a few random die rolls of 11s and 12s instead of 7s or 8s can immediately swing the advantage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the skill in poker is largely knowing the probabilities and reading/manipulating your opponents.  In other words, it's at least partially just knowing the chance.  Without the betting game, the card game is ridiculously boring because it's got too much chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going first alone <em>likely</em> causes a sort of ripple effect.</p>
<p>I would argue that chess is much less &quot;lucked&quot; based than any other game I can think of.</p>
<p>Either way I think the bigger point to this is that in almost all &quot;good&quot; competitive games (I get it super subjective) skill will decide who wins. I guess you could call small little moments during game play &quot;luck&quot;, for example if your opponent makes a mistake, but that to me seems like stretching the definition of luck vs. skill.</p>
<p>From what I understand most game designers like to add luck into a game to make it interesting, but more abstract and skill oriented games like chess have a minimal amount of luck involved.</p>
<p>Then again what do I know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TF2 went quite far with that idea by introducing 'critical hits', where semi-randomly an attack would deal massive extra damage which would make combat unpredictable.</p>
<p>the logic went that it would occasionally allow less skilled players to beat high skilled players and it would keep high skilled players on their toes and force them to keep backup plans to otherwise predictable encounters.</p>
<p>Its also important to remember that adapting to unforseen circumstances requires a lot of skill, adding luck to the mix of a game can weirdly increase the skill cap if the game is well designed, i'd point at Dota2 for a great example of that, a lot of smaller instances of virtual dice rolls that mean that no strategy can ever be completely planned out, even in the highest skill games strategies have to be constantly adjusted on the fly.</p></div>		</li>
