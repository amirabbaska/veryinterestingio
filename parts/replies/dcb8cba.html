			<div class="markdown"><p>Good for you for leaving!</p>
<p>I went through such a similar thing. To the point where I was so frustrated one night he &quot;caught me doing something bad&quot; when we were out with friends. It was a normal, innocuous thing, but he had made me feel like it was some terrible transgression. I was starting to see what was really going on, so I left where we were at and went home by myself- looking like I had stormed out on him for no reason- so I looked like the crazy one. I was a mess, I was irrational, I second-guessed literally everything I did. Most nights he would pick at me so bad I'd cry myself to sleep- I felt like I had no validation and no out. I attempted suicide which he made sure I knew that it affected him more than it affected me- and how he needed me to pick up more slack to care for him. </p>
<p>Luckily that night I stormed out was the night HIS friends caught on to what was going on and they helped me leave him. They had suspected some kind of verbal/emotional abuse for a while, but didn't know how to step in.</p>
<p>We were together for almost 3 years. It's about a year after and I'm still not the confident, enthusiastic, friendly person I was before I met him. But I'm getting there, which is good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was in a similar situation, it was truly traumatic experience, I lost all sense of self. It's those little things that chipped my self esteem to nothing. Like I find my stuff in the trash, and he denies he put it there. Says he loves dogs (I love dogs) and we're gonna get one, then later saying he doesn't and never said that; I'll make the effort to cook him things he said he likes (pancakes, hard to mess up) then say he actually hates them. Badmouths our friends to me, but says the opposite to other friends. Watches shows saying it's his favorite, so at a later time I suggest we watch that, then asks why, I hate that, let's do something else. Makes a show of being the sweet perfect boyfriend but when in private, just compares me to all his exes... Gave me his facebook password willingly like I cared for it, just so I can see a chat with his ex with him saying how I'm naive but will do for a 'trophy'. Then when confronted  blames me for wanting his password (i did not) to snoop....  it goes on and on, seemingly inconsequential but was stressing me out so much... at least now I know what to call it when I see it, and thus avoid it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are all extremely good examples of real life gaslighting.  I was in a relationship with a guy who tried some similar things, so I recognize what you went through.  </p>
<p>I think he just thought he was right, and was so determined to cling on to that hint of rightness that it didn't matter at all what anyone else said or thought.  It was like he was running a narrative through his head that absolutely had to be adhered to, facts and actual events be damned. I think it stems from deep insecurity, because he was so desperate to see himself as the hero of his story that anything that shook that view had to be denied or rejected or ignored.  Luckily, I never actually felt unsure of myself because I honestly had more respect for myself than for him, but looking back I recognize that he had these abusive tendencies without ever intending to abuse.</p></div>		</li>
