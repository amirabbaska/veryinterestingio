			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean if you really want to break it down far enough any coffee machine is really just a hot water dispenser with a filter and room for coffee grounds. </p>
<p>Plenty of people in college use them for making soup/ramen, hot chocolate, etc. </p>
<p>But I think it's fair to still call it a coffee or espresso machine. The hot water is just a convenient addition. That said I seriously doubt they're putting soup packets in the filter. They're likely just dispensing the water into a soup container.</p></div>		</li>
