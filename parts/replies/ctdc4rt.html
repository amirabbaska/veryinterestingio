			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that while fingerprints may be functionally unique, identification and matching of fingerprints, especially in forensic environments with imperfect samples, <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/19/7733.full" target="_blank">can still lead to incorrect results</a>.</p>
<p>One such example of incorrect matching involves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandon_Mayfield#Arrest_and_detention" target="_blank">Brandon Mayfield</a> who, along with 20 other individuals, were considered suspects in the 2004 Madrid train bombings because of possible fingerprint matches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Experienced latent print examiners have a false positive of about 1/1000 <a href="http://phys.org/news/2011-04-false-positives-rare-fingerprint.html" target="_blank">Source</a>.  For computers, &quot;The best system was accurate 98.6 percent of the time on single-finger tests, 99.6 percent of the time on two-finger tests, and 99.9 percent of the time for tests involving four or more fingers. These accuracies were obtained for a false positive rate of 0.01 percent.&quot; <a href="http://phys.org/news/2004-07-computerized-fingerprint-accurate-percent.html" target="_blank">Oldish Source</a></p>
<p>That's why law enforcement officials can't simply run a dragnet search against a huge database of fingerprints without additional weeding out. They will almost certainly get false positives. If the number of people matching the rough description and age range of a suspect is 5% of the population, a city/neighborhood/borough with a population of 20,000 will average one false positive (assumed to be ~1/1000).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is nice to know. I had been considering doing the TSA Pre check application but the idea of having my finger prints in a database made me anxious. I end up with paranoid thoughts about someone framing me for something because my prints are in there. It's good to know that there's already so much error built in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't the Brandon Mayfield debacle the result of the FBI being over zealous? Didn't it come out that the FBI realized the finger print match was skeptical at best, but they basically lied saying it was a match? The Spanish authorities were very reluctant to believe Mayfield was a possible suspect. From the wikipedia article, </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The FBI described the fingerprint match as &quot;100% verified&quot;. According to the court documents in judge Ann Aiken's decision, this information was largely &quot;fabricated and concocted by the FBI and DOJ&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds like the issue wasn't the finger print matching being inaccurate, but that it was just fabricated from the get go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that is particularly accurate. If you see the crime print that was allegedly Mayfield's... it's pretty shitty quality at best.     </p>
<p>One of the issues in Mayfield is that the prints were verified by other examiners unblinded. They already knew that the initial examiner had concluded the prints were a 'match'. Also, at the time, there was extreme reluctance of the forensic community to admit that context bias occurs and that mistakes occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But wouldnt non-proportional scaling affect the pattern. Like two points can match up but if the infant grows up and gets really fat or really skinny and long fingers then the amount of lines and general shape will be the same but two relative points might be farther apart. Couldnt that skew results? </p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Mrvexdragon" target="_blank">Mrvexdragon</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Essentially the finger print will just scale with the grown finger. The only way to &quot;alter&quot; your finger print is to either burn them off with acid, or file your finger print down to where nothing is left. Neither which is a good idea since that makes your knew finger print easier to trace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand. If you burn your fingerprints off with acid, you should have smooth skin made up by scar tissue, right? Don't know if that's exactly what would happen, but the end result is smooth skin. How would no prints make your fingerprints easier to trace?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You know those disk sanders? Don't try to sand thin pieces of wood on the wrong side of the disk.</p>
<p>I should say, my finger print on that finger isn't gone, it appears to be scrambled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The unique identifying structure of the print remains the same, it is just scaled up as the child grows - this does not equate to a <em>different</em> fingerprint, just a physically larger one.</p>
<p>If you have two deflated balloons and write a random 5-digit number on each to identify them and then blow up both balloons, the number on the balloons doesn't change - the physical size does.</p>
<p>edit: restructured analogy.</p></div>		</li>
