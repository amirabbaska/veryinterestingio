			<p>Is it possible that the spinal cord doesn't repair itself once it gets damaged because something like muscular dystrophy happens with it? It's no longer being used so the body doesn't think it's important anymore?</p>		</li>

			<p>Muscular Dystrophy wouldn't be the correct term, MD is a genetic-progressive nueromuscular disease. Whereas the loss of muscle mass, or atrophy, associated with a spinal cord injury occurs because the muscle isn't being loaded/unloaded like you said, not because the body doesn't think it's not important-- it simply cannot bridge the gap from the CNS to the muscle it needs to move.<br><br>For some time students were taught that nerves do not repair themselves at all beyond a certain timeframe. (read: 1 month being the golden period of recovery, 3 months being the end of any functional gains(edit: in the CNS)) Only recently, they have found that nueroplasticity can be observed in even long term SCI or CVA cases-- so we don't really know yet what can be done or how much in how long of a time frame, <strong><em>yet.</em></strong> What I do remember being discussed was that if a nerve is completely severed, it grows something like 3 nano meters a day(edit: in the PNS)-- IIRC. Though complete patching of the missing section doesn't gaurantee complete return to function, due to the new pathways not being an exact replica of what was there before. <br><br>Interestingly enough, the PNS was pretty much always known to be able to regenerate should the axon be severed and the nueral body remain intact. However, only recently has neuroplasticity been observed in the CNS.<br><br>PS: Sorry for the memory dump. I just wanted to be thorough enough. </p>		</li>

			<p>Oh it's fine, I don't know much about the subject and muscular dystrophy eas the first thing that came to mind that seemed similar to what I wanted to ask. I do appreciate the response and explanation!</p>		</li>

			<p>This seems the most logical explanation to me, the spinal cord may be able to repair itself more than we think and this positive feedback gives the patients a reason to continue pushing until they regain control and reverse the dystrophy. It will be interesting to see how this effects current rehab methods or if it will lead to more successful techniques.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's a Dr Jerry Silver at Cleveland Clinic who postulates that the spinal cord could heal itself, if not for scar tissue.<br><br>Another researcher doesn't think it exists.<br><br>Still a field in infancy.<br><br>I wonder why in evolution we can heal skin, broken bones and replace failing organs but brain or spinal injuries?

			<p>Do the nerves actually have to regenerate in this situation?<br><br>Or just recover from shock/be exercised out of atrophy?</p>		</li>

			<p>Interesting, 15 years ago I read about similar methods (replace VR with imagination) in an alt-medicine book. Thought it was baloney.</p>		</li>
