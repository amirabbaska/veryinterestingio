			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to give some perspective. Hunter gatherers often hunted rabbits and deer like this. Run at prey, prey runs away. Track prey, run at prey, prey runs away. Do this for half an hour to an hour and eventually the deer will be too tired to run any more.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite true. Horses for example have enough stamina to do that. Pretty much any animal that can outrun a human over a long distance has been domesticated though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, something I'm not seeing addressed is the question of running for the purposes of defense.  As for that--</p>
<p>Humans are tribal creatures, and incomparable tool makers / tool users.  We are far more dangerous to almost every lifeform around us than they to us.  A group of armed humans is pretty much a death sentence to just about any other creature, hence we have much less need to escape compared to other animals.</p>
<p>In terms of isolated individuals it's a different story, but then again, part of that's down to the huge advantage of living in tribes, which tend to have a transformative effect on the surrounding area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also comparatively we don't use much energy changing gait. Read in an earlier version of this question that that was a key factor in the early hunting techniques.</p>
<p>On the speed note I read that we aren't actually that bad. Something about outrunning a horse at 10 meters maybe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that another important thing is that our breathing cycle is not tied to our gait. Animals running puts pressure on their lungs, so they have to breathe in the same rhythm they run, whereas humans can breathe independently from how they run which is more efficient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean we can outrun a horse (at 35km) if the horse is bad enough at that distance and carries somebody on top.</p>
<p>The fastest horse did the 35km track in 1:20, humans can't compete at that pace. The fastest EPO Kenyans can barely run a mile at that pace let alone 35 km.</p></div>		</li>
