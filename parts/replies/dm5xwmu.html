			<div class="markdown"><p>Others have commented on how linguistic development plays a big part, and I completely agree! Or at least it's true in my case- I spoke English with one of my family members at home but not others, growing up English was learnt predominantly in the academic sphere so I know how to, for example, explain biology in English in a flow but can't in Chinese, it's not until when I moved country that I learnt socialising in English hence develop my emotional part for the language. </p>
<p>But then I noticed lyrics in Chinese love songs vs love English songs- how Chinese lyrics convey a lot more and paint a much fuller picture with fewer words, which led me to found a similar difference in actual literature (the classic novels), and I wonder if in this case the actual linguistic difference would play a part, or if it's just because of my exposure I have a better emotional connection to the Chinese language! </p></div>		</li>
