			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always fascinating for me how scientists come up with some ideas.</p>
<p>In this case: what motivated them to put a thermometer past the red part - especially since they apparently didn't know about infrared (or did i misinterpret &quot;which is how that type of light was discovered&quot;?)
And even more interesting: What <em>other</em> things did they try, which didn't work out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was an accidental discovery. </p>
<p>In 1800 William Herschel was testing the temperature of the different parts of the visible spectrum.</p>
<p>He placed thermometers in each color band and a control thermometer just past the red band.  When he checked his temps the control had the highest reading, ergo there was an invisible type of light that imparted heat.</p>
<p>Cosmos had a whole segment on that discovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe Neil deGrasse Tyson discussed this in The Cosmos. The way it was described on the program (or the way I interpreted it) was that the thermometers were actually just being put outside of the light as a control basically. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, as there was some inferring that I did for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's mostly the idea. Sunlight was directed through a prism which they could see creating the visible spectrum. They placed thermometers throughout the spectrum and then a control in what they thought was outside the spectrum (for simplicity's sake, let's say that there were 7 evenly spaced thermometers at each &quot;color&quot; and then the control):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>&quot;Control&quot;</th>
<th>R</th>
<th>O</th>
<th>Y</th>
<th>G</th>
<th>B</th>
<th>I</th>
<th>V</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>and they found that the control thermometer was not actually reporting room temperature, but much higher temperatures. This was the first evidence that there was energy that we couldn't see because it was &quot;below&quot; red on the visible spectrum!</p>
<p>The new Cosmos series was very well-done and I hope that more shows like it get wider broadcasting now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember from the respective &quot;Cosmos&quot; episode that the thermometer was actually meant as a control measurement which turned out to be the warmest, hinting Herschel that there must be some invisible radiation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because the <strong>frequency of infrared light corresponds to the frequency at which bonded atoms oscillate</strong>. Two carbons bonded together oscillate around a given length, like this :</p>
<p>C--C becomes this C---C     =&gt;    C--C    =&gt;    C-C   =&gt;   C--C</p>
<p>The frequency of this oscillation is roughly the same as light in infrared, which means that the photons are absorbed and add energy to the system. Visible light, on the contrary, is mostly reflected, so it doesn't add that much energy.</p>
<p>Most single bounded atoms oscillate in IR frequency, UV correspond to transition between electronic states. Visible light is usually absorbed when there's an electron that wanders along between two bounds (a phenomenon called resonance).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooooooh - you know, it's funny, because I've learned this in organic chemistry, but we only learn it in the context of absorbing IR for spectroscopy purposes. Of course it normally would emit IR as well in the course of having temperature. Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting.  So taking a step back, it's simply that, because of the reason you mentioned, a lot more of incoming infrared light is absorbed than visible light.  And that this effect is of greater magnitude than the disparity of the overall incoming levels of sunlight (with visible light having more total energy).  Interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because every temperature is associated with radiation peaking at a specific wavelength. One can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law" target="_blank">Wien's displacement law</a> to find the relationship! The law states that a body's peak wavelength of radiation is <em>b/T</em>, where <em>T</em> is the temperature in Kelvin and <em>b</em> is a constant equal to about 2.8977729·10^-3 m K (that m is for metres and not milli). This gives the answer in metres. Anyway, if you insert a temperature of 300 K, which is about &quot;room temperature&quot; and skin temperature for most mammals, you'll find that the resulting wavelength is around 10000 nm, which happens to be in the far infrared! If you insert the sun's temperature you will — unsurprisingly — find that it emits radiation peaking in the visible spectrum. This relationship between temperature and wavelength is also why we can calculate the temperature of a flame or a star based on its colour, and why objects eventually start to glow (emitting visible light) when they are heated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I had no idea about this, thank you! You're really clearing this up for me. To make sure I understand this conceptually, when energy is released, I can always understand it as a pairing of heat and light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All light carries energy. Things colder than 3000 K,  which is the majority of hot things we deal with, just emit significantly more infrared than any other part of the spectrum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having trouble with this. In basic physics and chemistry you learn that energy is primarily transferred as heat and light. Are you saying that things that are hot happen also to emit light in the infrared spectrum (as opposed to heat being carried by infrared light)? If so, why is this?</p></div>		</li>
