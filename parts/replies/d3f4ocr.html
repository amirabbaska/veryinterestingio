			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so fascinating. From the age of the flute, to the fact that it was made from the femur of a cave bear which went extinct ~24,000 years ago during the last glacial maximum. </p>
<p>Makes you really consider how complex/intelligent humans where so long ago, and all the lost culture and experiences over the deep time we've been on this planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my archaeological anthropology class a few years ago, I found out that we can pretty safely predict that homo sapiens back to about 200,000 years ago or so had roughly equivalent brain power to us. The only thing that separates us is 200 millenia of cultural development, not a growth in &quot;brain power&quot;. I found that fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did you find that out? It seems to me that during the last interglacial no humans figured out agriculture, while ten thousand years ago it was developed several times independently, which speaks towards behavioral change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't recall the title, a recent SciFi story about an archeologist working a cave site in Euro-area.  Works with a particular assistant over the course of several different digs.  Finds a sub-cave sealed off with radically different paintings - different colors, style, content.  Finds a bone flute - eerily similar to his assistants flute ... turns out his assistant is 24,000 years old.  Made the painting and flute.  Tired of being alone - wanted someone else to know about his alt painting and life.</p>
<p>Maybe the person who lost that flute is still looking for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just got done reading the story after I read your comment. Thank you for that. It was very fascinating. I was surprised that Boyd didn't ask Luis about any biblical events, being that he predates the Bible. I would have had a million questions for that guy if he gave me just 30min. Man, that'd be crazy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, right?</p>
<p>I wouldn't personally bring up bible stories if I were time limited.  I would probably ask about some key Torah (Old Testament) stories: the flood for instance.  That would have either been complete confabulation or some global event.  But, stories of individuals would be very unlikely to be known by him:  Being alive doesn't guarantee any sort of proximity to the events.   Third hand news of the time, though, would surely count for more than 4x or 2x thousand years phone-tag translations.</p>
<p>As for the Christian Bible, I feel the current story of Israeli General going rogue after the King formally cedes control to invading Rome, and then leading a campaign of rebel skirmishes/terrorism against the occupying state more than adequately summarizes where THAT mythos came from.</p>
<p>I'd be really interested in hearing about how the Asiatic people's migrated to N.America.  He might have done it several times!!</p>
<p>I think it's the sociological history rather than the archeological relevance he would have.   Imagine being able to explain the social dynamics of, say, Incans circa Manchu Pichu.  Or the expansion culture of the people spreading from Asia into N. America.</p>
<p>I agree though -- it's a fascinating read.  It got me to thinking of genetics.  People have genetic abnormalities of REALLY bizarre nature (google bleeding eye chick, or Indian old man teen).  So, how unlikely could it be SOMEONE get's a birth defect of cell:  senescence is turned off.</p>
<p>How would you know of such a person?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to answer your first question, the Brahmins Chants from India are &quot;songs&quot; that have been passed down by an oral tradition--and it's estimated by experts that these chants are <em>tens of thousands of years old</em> and predate human speech, because the auditory patterns have no modern parallels in human song or language--the nearest analogue comes from bird song. You can hear/learn more about it from the PBS documentary,
