<p>Great book.  Primitive society living in conditions where relativity is relevant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I must re-read it sometime. When I last read it I hadn't even heard of eigenvectors, but now armed with university-level physics education I may have a different perspective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you liked that, I'd also recommend &quot;Dragon's Egg&quot; by Robert L. Forward.  It is another one where gravity and general relativity is a &quot;main character&quot;.</p>
<p>He imagines how life might look on the surface of a neutron star, and what interacting with a culture might be like due to the extreme time dilation introduced, as well as what those tidal forces might look like.  The main conceit here is interaction with an (initially primitive) society of beings who have human intelligence, who subjectively live humanish life spans, but to an observer in orbit 15 minutes is an entire lifetime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I feel like the basis of the book is actually the opposite of this.  The characters in the book start off with a very small amount of empirical data, the variations in the strength and direction of gravity throughout the asteroid and the vague notion that the values were different in the past, and derive a significant chunk of modern physics from that.  </p>
<p>Einstein himself didn't just come up with the equations out of thin air.  He was attempting to understand the implications of previous observations that showed that light always moved at a fixed speed relative to the observer, regardless of how fast the source or observer were moving.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a long time since I read it, so you may well be right.</p>
<p>I should probably read it again soon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is all empirical in the end... just with layers of theory sometimes abstracting away previous empirical observations.</p>
<p>Using 16th or 17th century technology, relativistic effects are mostly invisible.  In a way this made Newton's job easier.  He couldn't see relativistic effects, so he never had a reason to guess they were there.</p>
<p>Maxwell's equations did imply that the speed of light is the same for all observers, but this was tested empirically (and accidentally) by the Michelsonâ€“Morley experiments less than 50 years before Einstein.  Prior to that (and for some time after), people thought that there was an implied frame of reference (the &quot;ether&quot;) hidden in Maxwell's equations.</p>
<p>Einstein's initial insight came out of the struggle to reconcile the apparent contradiction between the notion of Galilean relativity, and the constant speed of light.  He had to throw out our whole notion of time and just accept both as true.  Then he made predictions and we verified his ideas empirically. </p>
<p>Interestingly, it was another set of clashes between electromagnetics and classical physics that got us quantum physics (black body radiation and the &quot; ultraviolet catastrophe&quot;).  Quantum and relativity actually contradict each other though... that is probably where our next physics revolution comes from.</p>
<p>Really, you need both.  Empirical observations, and some set of ideas to explain them.  Discoveries come when contradictions emerge.</p>
<p>The question Greg Egan's book asks is: &quot;What if Newton's job had been a lot harder?&quot;.  What if the theory of relativity came from the same direct observations that led to the theory of gravity, rather than from an initial development of classical physics leading to an apparent contradiction with electromagnetics?  It really does lead to a more intuitive development, though, because you get to watch the theory emerge using observations of everyday objects with primitive tools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like a great book! I'll have to check it out. </p>
<p>There's a cool short story that has the opposite premise. Relativistic space travel was possible before special relativity was understood. </p>
