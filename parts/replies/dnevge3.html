			<div class="markdown"><p>And &quot;rendering&quot; is just heating fat (the tissue) to release the liquid fat (grease, fat, oil, tallow -- different names depending on what's being rendered and the  nature of the end product).</p>
<p>You render pork fat to grease every time you cook bacon</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a technically correct but very broad use of the word render. In commercial applications, rendering is, ahem, a little more unsavory - not only are different parts of the animal heated, they're also exposed to a number of different chemical solvents, solutions and enzymes to specifically denature/destroy/cut different cellular structures that inhibit the extraction process.</p>
<p>I live within 40 minutes of two rather large rendering facilities, one of which was a customer for a previous job. The tour was... interesting. The industrial application of chemistry was fascinating, but watching it take place was less than pleasant. Just don't give your children dog food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you render duck fat at a facility, the best analogy I can think of would be...  imagine bubble wrap where the bubbles are full of oil. You pop all of those bubbles, and you end up with a puddle of oil.   A living duck will have a body temperature high enough to keep the fat liquid.  I'm guessing that the adipocyte cell membranes don't break down significantly faster than any other cells... so if you have a duck roadkill, its just going to slowly turn into a carrion soup-  if it is warm outside, the fat will be liquid.  If it is cold, the fat will be solid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they die, most cells burst and then get cleaned up by your immune system. When a &quot;whole&quot; duck dies, they no longer have an immune system to do this (as it is no longer receiving necessary nutrients from flowing blood), the cells kinda just chill there- dead. They'll deteriorate or be eaten by other organisms overtime but without an outside force internally, these fat cells still will remain until then. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to note that body temperature =/= outside temperature for birds and mammals. They thermoregulate (regulate their body temperature). Body temp for duck is actually around 102 to 107 farenheit regardless of the outside wheather.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what youâ€™re saying is... the fat inside the duck is technically melted, but being held in place by a lot of other structures?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Your blood is a fluid at 57 degrees as well, but no one is surprised that we're not melted puddles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like almost everything in your own body is in a liquid state (except bones, collagen etc) but is held in place inside cells which are connected via an extracellular matrix. If you think about it, there is no reason to have &quot;solid&quot; pieces of matter inside your body, unless they are for structural use, because nearly all reactions occur in the liquid phase!</p></div>		</li>
