			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the adverse effects to &quot;tricking&quot; your body if there are any? Can producing more electrolytes than the body can support result in magnified effects of dehydration later due to the lack of sufficient nutrients? From what I understand, this production of electrolytes in anticipation of replenishment lasts a short while until the body understands that replenishment is not coming. Can your body become &quot;immune&quot; to this and not respond in anticipation the same way your metabolism slows and doesn't speed back up as soon as you get food after prolonged hunger? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an analogy, think of a thermostat. If the thermostat lowers the temperature when it should have raised the temperature, as a result of being &quot;tricked&quot;, then it has to work harder later to raise the temperature when it &quot;figures out&quot; what happened. Related to the body and, it has to do more unneeded endocrine work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a short term discomfort and a long term danger. In the short term trying to digest and get the gastric juices going to process foods could cause something as mild as indigestion. But severely dehydrated or long term dehydration is dangerous mixed with food because proteins take a ton of water for your body to process. So for instance if you are stuck on an island with no source of fresh water dont go chowing down on fish because you will quickly burn through more water processing the proteins and cause a greater nutrition/hydration imbalance and die quicker. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think /u/LaNoktaTempesto is actually asking about something called refeeding syndrome. When someone has been malnourished or has been fasting and then they start eating again, their body ramps up production of insulin, which has been suppressed in the fasting state. This draws from the body's serum concentrations of potassium, magnesium and phosphorus, which are already going to be low due to the lack of nutrient intake. Those can then fall to dangerous levels, and this can cause a whole host of cardiac and metabolic disturbances and can and does kill people, especially people in recovery from eating disorders. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because of the risk of &quot;water intoxication&quot;. Severe dehydration leads to osmotic changes in blood and ECF(extra cellular fluid). If a large volume of water is consumed (because the dehydrated person is thirsty and will try to replace the water loss), it'll change the osmotic potential of the body (a simple way to say it electrolyte imbalance). Leading to symptoms of alcoholic poisoning.

<p>If we were talking about some other sort of living thing, such as a dog or a plant, this analysis would probably be seen as a deliberate step leading to other deliberate steps, potentially (depending on the audience) with conscious motive attached to it. &quot;The tree analyzes the amount of ground water available and adjusts the stomata on its leaves accordingly&quot; or whatever.  &quot;Wow, how does the tree know how to do that?!&quot;  But it's just the same as how our bodies know to pump out electrolytes when we swish Gatorade in our mouths.</p>
<p>And the converse, just because a tree has some sort of automatic reaction doesn't mean that is the focus of what it does.  It's just something that happens and has no bearing on whether a tree has any sort of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/science/plants-consciousness-anesthesia.html" target="_blank">consciousness</a>.</p>
<p>I know this is a little off-topic, but I'm fascinated by ways in which we are similar to/different from other living beings.</p></div>		</li>
