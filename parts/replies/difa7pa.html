			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the biggest contributor. There are not predators that will take on an entire group of humans. There aren't. We're very loud and we stink and with our bare hands, most any predator around would have us for dinner. But that's <em>alone</em>. Humans are social animals; we get loads of mental stress if we aren't regularly around other humans. We're constantly surrounded by other humans. We're also the best throwers in the animal kingdom, so anything that even thinks about getting close is liable to get speared without ever getting a bite in. Now add to the equation that we've domesticated dogs, another formidable group hunter and you've got a war party that hangs out 24/7 because they like each other. With that kind of protection, humans are okay to make extra noise and smell a lot and be useless for a lot longer than any other animal after birth. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Eggs typically do not give away their position with frequent loud noises.</p></div>		</li>
