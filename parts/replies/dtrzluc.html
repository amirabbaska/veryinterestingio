			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some pods of orcas that hunt this way exclusively, so it's an inevitable danger for them. Not sure how frequently but it happens. I'd say that's the most frequent and obvious case of whales beaching themselves </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So kinda like what cats or dogs do when they know they're on their last leg and don't want their owner to feel hurt so they seclude themselves (something like that). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly they don't seclude themselves to make their owner feel better.  They seclude themselves because they are hurt or sick and in the wild, they would become easy prey if they were wandering around hurt or sick.  They seclude themselves in the hopes that they can hide the condition and get better.</p>
<p>And before people chime in about animal feelings, yes they have emotions, but their prime motivator is not to make us feel better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an easy one to explain as humans do the exact same thing. If you're feeling sick, you stay home and curl up in bed. It's warm and cozy and you don't have to put your mind and body through stress of interacting with the world. No different with cats and dogs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's why I think that is wrong: I have read that at least dolphins are voluntary breathers, meaning that do not breathe while asleep which further means that only half their brain sleeps at a time. Seems like suicide by choosing not to breathe would be easy for them while humans can't do this. Furthermore, what a lousy way for a whale to die, beached. Has to be very uncomfortable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they could possibly kill them selves by slipping into a deep sleep and drowning themselves, but like people could you be so sick you can’t sleep? </p>
<p>Sorry I’m maybe splitting hairs, but as I said I think the suicide theory will probably stay a theory, be hard to prove I imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know -- I just think committing suicide by beaching oneself would be extremely uncomfortable. Probably like being slowly crushed under weights for a human. Also, the whale is dealing with sun and small creatures like crabs attacking their skin.</p></div>		</li>
