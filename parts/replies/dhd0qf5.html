			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the accused isn't afforded all the constitutional rights and other protections they would be in a trial as a GJ is separate from the traditional Court. They have no right to a lawyer and pretty much all evidence is admissible (hearsay, etc.).</p>
<p>Not all states have GJs, some just do a preliminary hearing instead.  A GJ hearing is guaranteed by the Constitution for federal crimes that are felonies. The US is one of the only countries left that still uses GJs.</p></div>		</li>
