			<div class="markdown"><p>I had something a lot like this but I couldn't pinpoint how I got injured, just woke up with a really stiff neck. Lasted 10 months and I still get pain on and off when I lift at the gym. I was told by a physiotherapist that it was a ligament injury and had great success with acupuncture. Never liked the idea of poking needles in my neck but it really did work. </p></div>		</li>
