<p>Someone whispering to someone in the next seat in courtroom &quot;I had salad for dinner&quot; would be criminal if they actually had something else. It would be fairly absurd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings up another question that I've had for a while. Let's say I was involved in a heinous crime. I'm on the stand during the trial, and the lawyer is grilling me. I answer truthfully so far, but then he turns something I said on me and basically asks me if I committed this crime. I take the 5th. Obviously I can't be convicted solely based on the fact that I took the fifth, but wouldn't this action give the accusing party the upper hand because I basically said I did it without saying &quot;I did it&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general if you are planning on taking the fifth you would not take the stand in the first place. But if you did use the right mid interrogation it may look incriminating, but the jury is not allowed to use that fact in their deliberation. If they use it in their discussion there is ground for a mistrial. So they will be instructed to ignore the events and that question by the judge. </p></div>		</li>
