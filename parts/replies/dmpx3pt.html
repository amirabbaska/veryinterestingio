			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't so much thinking of car crashes. I've heard it more in the cases of major falls or fights (ie not being tensed up when someone punches you in the face or something). It could be a myth entirely, I just heard it from what I felt to be credible sources. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mechanically speaking, your goal is to reduce the force applied to your brain, your internal organs, your bones, and your muscles in that order. Depending on where you're hit the &quot;correct&quot; response will vary. In every case you're going to be sacrificing potential damage to muscles and sometimes damage to bones to protect something higher on the list. That list happens to be both the order of their importance in keeping you alive and your body's ability to repair them.</p>
<p>Hit in the head? Neither completely tense nor limp works. Your ideal situation is to be resisting enough that your head accelerates as slowly as possible and decelerates as slowly as possible moving back once you reach nearly the end of your neck's range of motion. If you're too loose your head accelerates too fast and your brain hits the skull. If you don't tense somewhat during the aftermath of the hit your neck reaches its maximum rotation on one axis or another and stops dead. Head stops almost instantly, brain doesn't. If you're too tense you end up absorbing the entire weight of a punch, which will, regardless of how strong you think you are, still result in your head moving but in this case it will change direction very quickly twice in a very short time. Your brain won't impact the skull as fast but it'll still hit.</p>
<p>When you're hit square in the center of the gut the equation changes because what you're protecting changes. Here you're trying to protect internal organs. Tense your abs but not your legs. You tense your abs because they'll take more damage from the blow but reduce the amount of pressure applied to internal organs compared to allowing the punch to push in and shove some intestines around without without resistance. You leave your legs loose so the blow pushes your entire body back, reducing the force applied. You sacrifice muscle to protect organs.</p>
<p>When you're hit in the shoulder you want to relax. Because the blow will push your shoulder out of the way, rotating your body instead of transferring force into the stuff inside your body. Loosen your abs so the blow pushes you to lean back and rotates your body. Your torso has the mass relative to a punch to stop you effectively on its own unlike your head.</p>
<p>If you're hit in the center of the chest you're primarily protecting bones (or cartilage). Here you have little muscle covering it so your best bet is to just relax your abs and increase the time over which the force is applied to reduce the pressure on the bones.</p>
<p>All of this assumes there is a single blow coming and can't avoid or deflect it. You may have other priorities in a real fight that mean you would take additional risk of injury because the safest response would open you up to additional blows but these are the <em>safest</em> methods of <em>absorbing a blow</em>. In almost all cases you ideally want to prep for a blow by turning so that the blow strikes as far from your center of mass as possible to reduce the amount of energy transferred or avoid it entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of fighting, ragdolling is almost always a bad choice to make when receiving a strike. The closest thing would be if someone is throwing a hook punch to the jaw. If you had no intention of dodging or countering and you just wanted to take the hit with minimum damage, your best best is to move your head in the direction their fist is traveling just before impact. Even in that situation though your jaw and neck should be tense, but it might appear to someone watching as somewhat of a rag doll move. When you receive an impact, if you tense up the impact area then your muscles absorb much of the impact. If you don't, the less resilient parts of you (bones, joints, etc.) absorb the impact and that can be bad. The important thing is to spread/redirect the force as much as possible. This is why in martial arts people are taught to hit the ground with their forearms when falling down. The force of the fall is spread through the forearms as well as other parts of impact so the effect of impact is lessened on each individual part. At certain velocities you are also factoring in the impact of your organs against the rest of your body. There is an element of looseness that is useful in falls but not in a rag doll way. People who are really good at parkour fall from fairly tall heights and when they land, they try to roll as much of the impact force as they can away. If they just tensed their muscles as hard as possible they would sustain a lot more damage, just as they would if they fell flat on the ground ragdolling. The muscles are tense enough to perform the maneuvers quickly and with violence of action, but not so tense as to significantly inhibit mobility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just spread out the impact, spread out the time you are being impacted. Same force no matter what, but spreading it out over a longer period of time means a lower impulse, meaning less damage. It's why if you land on your feet you want to bend your knees with the landing, not just land still. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that the important take away here is that what is interpreted as &quot;ragdoll&quot; is actually a very specific type of trained looseness.</p>
<p>I trained in Systema throughout college, which puts a huge focus on absorbing punches instead of blocking them.  One of the first things is that punches have a fairly small range of effectiveness, maybe about a foot going in a straight line.  Redirect the punch even a tiny bit, and the power behind it disappears.</p>
<p>If we were getting punched in the face, we were told to &quot;pull the energy downwards in a wave.&quot;  The way this practically played out is that your head and upper body would stay solid, protecting your neck, while your hips, which can take much more torque, would twist with the force of the punch.  A little dip while your face and the other guy's fist are connected would move his fist out of its effective range.  </p>
<p>Since we were also taught to keep our arms loose to use the swing to hit your opponent, it looks really ragdoll-like.  It's not really, though.</p>
<p>Parkour rolls are the same thing, you're using the crumple to absorb as much energy as possible, then redirect what's left outwards, where it's much less effective.  Cars are designed to crumple for the exact same reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a scientist, and I'm not an expert in the study of this stuff, but I have decades of experience falling down: skateboarding, skiing/snowboarding, rock climbing and general stupidity.  (AKA &quot;as a mother...&quot;)</p>
<p>You can absolutely develop the skill of reducing/avoiding injury by actively controlling your body during a fall.  In almost all cases, you have some pre-warning that a fall/hit is coming, so you can assess what's ahead of/below you and start managing where your body is relative to obstacles, other people, equipment, etc.  Then while you are falling you can manage what part(s) of your body are going to hit first and where to some degree.  Protecting your head is almost always the overriding issue.  From there, you're usually trying to avoid straight-on impacts, instead trying to slide, glance or roll off/along obstacles and the ground to reduce the forces on your bones/joints/soft tissues.  The trade off is often abrasion, which can be painful as hell but beats broken bones or torn ligaments.</p>
<p>I'm spelling this out in detail, but obviously most falls happen so quickly that the skills/movements you need to develop are pretty close to &quot;reflexes.&quot;  </p>
<p>From the many, many thousands of falls I've taken, I have a hard time imagining any situation in which passively &quot;going limp&quot; would be better than actively setting yourself up for a less bad fall, then while it's happening &quot;managing&quot; your body to reduce the harm from the fall/impact(s).  So my sense is, no, ragdolling is not better.  But then, neither is simply rigidly freezing up and slamming into stuff rigidly but passively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are snowboarding and go off a really big jump and you don't know what you're doing, the natural reaction is to lean back and put your hands out to brace the fall. That can lead to a broken wrist. It's better to make a fist, and let that hit the ground first. I may or may not know this from first-hand experience.</p></div>		</li>

<li>They are less likely to succumb after serious injury</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It comes from a commonly repeated stat (which I don't know is true) that drunk drivers in accidents tend to talk away with minor injuries after killing passengers or other drivers.</p>
<p>Then it was attributed to how &quot;loose&quot; they were while being drunk, while in reality, its just how drunk drivers cause accidents.</p>
<p>For example, the drunk guy who blows through a red light and t-bones another car at high speed is going to have a frontal collision with an airbag, while the victim is going to have a door crushed on them.</p></div>		</li>
