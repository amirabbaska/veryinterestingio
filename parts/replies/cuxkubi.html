			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue with that is it's extremely difficult to create a self sustaining ecosystem from scratch, which would be required in your scenario.  Getting the proper ratios and types of organisms on earth for a truly self contained environment and still be able to support humans had yet to be done for extended periods. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. People forget about soil microbes, etc. as well as the ecological balance as a whole. Not an easy thing to just calculate from a computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Biosphere II was a flop because they didn't anticipate how the soil microbes would produce so much carbon dioxide. It's really difficult to account for and control those variables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some &quot;dirty&quot; shortcuts.  Instead of specifically designing the soil bring in various samples from around the world and innoculate the substrates. Over time balances will be attained. However... One will risk bringing in agricultural pests, diseases etc with that method and attaining the balance takes time... Maybe after decades of tweakin there would be a functional system in place. Which leads to other problems... Are the structures designed to last decades and are supplies and supply runs sufficient etc.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True enough. But I want to belive that with the support of regular resupply missions from earth, this could eventually be acheived.</p>
<p>Arguably, it would be very costly to launch Marsbound rockets so often, but not so much for Earth orbit. So if a space station like ISS acted as an intermediate depot for supplies going to Mars, we would only need a few shuttles to go back and forth.</p>
<p>Once these cyclers get into a nice vector where they intercept Earth and Mars' orbits every couple years, they would need only modest amounts of propellant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cost per ton of lifting materials organic and inorganic out of Earths gravity well is the major factor why that wont work. Mining asteroids and sending the material &quot;downhill&quot; to Mars could work but that is far beyond our capabilities at this time. Organics may still need to come from Earth but that is lightweight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is as wrong as can be. Most of the cost is getting up the gravity well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I think terraforming mars is too difficult right now, and would destroy a fair amount of mars that we still want to explore in its current state.  </p>
<p>However, a fairly robust colony could be established with regular supply missions from Earth.  </p>
<p>Send robots and a nuclear reactor first.  Have them set up some expandable domes, excavate material, concentrate an atmosphere, and create oxygen and water.  Then the first colonists are going to be miners and scientists--geologists and the like.  They'll expand the base by building with cut rocks from the martian landscape.  Stone buildings can be lined with airtight membranes and made habitable with very little material from earth.    The first farms are likely to be hydroponic.   Hopefully soil can be manufactured.  The major goals of the initial colony is going to research into the geology and resources of Mars and developing a plan for the first martian smelters/ foundries.  Major productions will be steel and glass.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe not even steel for external structures. Magnesium is strong, and can support far more there than it can here due to the reduced gravity. The corrosion/flammability risk is negated by the negligible atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, would be valuable, but will be enough cheap to get it to Earth ?
In any case, I agree with you, that a Moon colony must be before Mars colony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems to me that the moon would be a pretty great test platform for any sort of long-term manned Mars program. Though if Mars is within our technological reach and confidence is high enough, I'd think we'd shoot for that.</p>
