			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay:</p>
<p>Would terminal velocity be different at different elevations? The air is thinner the higher you go (generally) so would terminal velocity change as you fall?</p>
<p>If so, if it does have to do with air density, would it also have to do with air pressure? Would terminal velocity on a bright and sunny day with an air pressure of 1020 millibars be slower than in a hurricane where air pressure is, what, 950 mBars because thereâ€™s more air in the way? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In space, with no air, the terminal velocity is nearly endless (you may still impact some space dust)</p></div>		</li>
