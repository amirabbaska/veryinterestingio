			<div class="markdown"><p>In Scott Kelly's book, Endurance, he mentions the &quot;segers&quot; several times. Those are what scrub the CO2 out of the air. Apparently there's 2 of them, usually only 1 runs and the other is a backup. According to him, having 4 people on the ISS is fine, but having 15 causes too much CO2 that the one seger cant keep up and it caused him to have bad headaches. He also mentioned his request to run both segers simultaneously while there's that many people aboard the ISS, was denied several times by NASA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the CO2 scrubbers are failure-prone and take consumable parts. This is for both the US and Russian variants. I know there's a handful of subsystems on the ISS that continually cause issues, and they're always looking for solutions for them. </p></div>		</li>
