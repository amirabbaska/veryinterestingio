			<div class="markdown"><p>So the connection was below road level and not the house. If the house or at least the sewage line is below the sewer main is it like a sump pump system that is used to pump the sewage out through the lines?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct. It will be collected in a cistern then lifted with a pump until it's high enough to get a fall to the main drain. The drains running in my street are around 15 feet below the road so no problem here and that's normally the case. Some houses are built in a dip in the land occasionally but it's not common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I see. I was just wondering because I have been researching digging out the basement of a house to get more clearance and such.  Just wanted to know if the sewage line would be a big issue but 2-3' may not be a big deal.</p></div>		</li>
