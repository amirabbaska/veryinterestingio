			<div class="markdown"><p>There's the aptly titled <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=wCHZmExLQ1wC" target="_blank">Native American Mathematics</a>, a decent general introduction, even if it is becoming a bit dated. It doesn't directly address Newark though. Hively and Horn's <a href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1982JHAS...13....1H&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=0&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES" target="_blank">Geometry and Astronomy in Prehistoric Ohio</a> gets the ball rolling on detailed research into Newark back in 1982. More recent papers on the topic by them include <a href="http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/mca.2006.013" target="_blank">A Statistical Study of Lunar Alignments at the Newark Earthworks</a> (2006) and <a href="http://www.maneyonline.com/doi/abs/10.1179/mca.2013.002" target="_blank">A New and Extended Case for Lunar (and Solar) Astronomy at the Newark Earthworks</a> (2013). <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=7DNLDlbQXaYC" target="_blank">The Scioto Hopewell and their Neighbors</a> and <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=TU1cq_ErRTwC" target="_blank">Gathering Hopwell</a> are the go-to books on Ohio Hopewell society in general.</p></div>		</li>
