<p>I think this might actually be the more important part, though. Once the cells are damaged, they still have the machinery around to clean up the initial mess (latent period), but once this machinery is used up or breaks down, there is no longer the genetics available to regenerate these proteins (machinery and structure). This would explain why you get symptoms and then latency and then worsening symptoms in cells that do not reproduce quickly or at all like bone cells or neurons. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you begin throwing up immediately after the exposure, you're going to die within a day or two. Delayed vomiting = systemic damage, but immediate damage = 20Gy+ of radiation, extensive brain damage, and imminent death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure that with an air burst detonation if you were close enough to ground zero to get a fatal dose, you will have most likely been killed in the explosion or have severe thermal burns that will kill you faster than the radiation damage. </p>
<p>EDIT: See below, if you are killed by an airburst nuclear bomb it will certainly be from the physical effects, radiation (initial and fallout) is negligible in an airburst detonation. </p></div>		</li>

<p>See that's what seems the most horrible to me...</p>
<p>It's inevitable that these people were going to die.... and die an excruciatingly painful death at that.  Euthanasia would have been the kindest thing they could have done for them.  It's mind boggling to me that any doctor would attempt to prolong someone's life and not find a way to facilitate a quick and painless death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You stop having symptoms because at that point in time, no more damage is occurring and you're cleaning things up. It's like, you had an engine break down so you turn it off, take out the broken pieces and clean the oil off the floor. But then, you turn it on without realizing you had a huge hole in it somewhere and those little piece were important. Without good DNA, you couldn't replace those pieces and now the engine just rips itself apart. </p>
<p>It's not that you are replicating mutated cells, you literally can't function properly without good DNA. Maybe it's replications that's broken, or making new proteins to fix the old ones, or just maintaining its normal environment. Radiation just messes stuff up.</p></div>		</li>
