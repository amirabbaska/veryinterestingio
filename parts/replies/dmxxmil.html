<p>If you'll browse through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BostonDynamics" target="_blank">videos</a> you'll see how much difficulty each one has with their respective tasks <del>and need all their processing power staying upright.</del></p>
<p>They are getting better and better though. :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder how big a CPU a robot would need to carry out all the things our brains do constantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly... The gen 1 Atlas has 3 networked computers on board, and had plenty of spare processing power. The problem is mainly that controls, either static or the more difficult dynamic, aren't easily parallelizable. And to make it worse, they need to run at a pretty fast rate - an absolute minimum of 50Hz, but 100 or 200 would be even better.</p>
<p>So you end up constrained by clock speed because the controls are your limiting factor, and those are making a couple core. So you were half right, but there is still plenty of spare processing power for other tasks like perception and obstacle detection.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an experiment by Google to design an AI to teach itself (a computer generated human figure) how to move from point A to B in the most efficient way. Essentially it taught itself how to walk through numerous attempts. It started off on four limbs and escalated to bipedal movement (although a deranged looking bipedal movement).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not unlike how it's kind of miraculous that goats are quadpedal. Walking on 4 hooves on uneven terrain and up seemingly flat walls is pretty impressive too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hooves are a good thing as well.  Small, hard pads that can support nearly the entire weight of the animal on just a sliver of the hoof print.  Like a good climber (in a good climbing shoe) they can edge along a fingernail sized ledge with only a part of their hoof on it.</p>
