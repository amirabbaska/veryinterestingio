			<div class="markdown"><p>Have there been any studies that investigate a correlation between blood type and the frequency that an individual gets ill with common diseases like the cold, influenza, bacterial infections? A good hypothesis might be that blood type A's might become ill more often because their blood is more 'ancient' and these diseases have had a better chance to evolve recognizing them better..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is certainly the case for malaria! The malaria parasite invades red blood cells by binding to proteins on the cell surface, including the sugars related to blood types. </p>
<p>There are actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Blood_antigen_systems" target="_blank">multiple systems</a> of &quot;blood types,&quot; defined by different families of proteins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There really isn't a best or worst. They only differ (at least in the AB0 System) in one sugar on the cell surface, which doesn't make a difference in cell function.</p>
<p>In emergencies a doctor (at least in Germany) can transfuse you group 0 without prior testing of compatibility (because no additional sugar the other groups don't have = no immune reaction = good for you), other than that there are no real benefits.</p>
<p>However there are other bloodgroups in other systems which still can be important, since some combination of you and your partners Rh group might lead to birth complications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm O negative. I only know this from donating blood through the Red Cross. Now they call me at least once a month to try to get me to donate. I don't mind. It makes me feel important. Like I'm in high demand or something. </p></div>		</li>
