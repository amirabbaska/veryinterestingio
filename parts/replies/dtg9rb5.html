			<div class="markdown"><p>So when either the egg or sperm are being produced, there’s a chance that this chromosome splitting fails for one reason or another, which will leave that egg/sperm with an extra sex chromosome. If that sperm/egg ultimately is involved in fertilization, it’ll bring its extra chromosome with it. The other reproductive cell brings it’s usual 1 chromosome, giving the embryo a total 3 chromosomes of that type. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I met a kid that has more than two sex chromosomes. Xxxy he was physically male but he was intellectually impaired and non- verbal.
I so looked up <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXXY_syndrome" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/XXXY_syndrome</a> </p>
<p>And read about  this and some of the other kinds of sex chromosome &quot;errors&quot; that can occur in viable humans. </p>
<p>Fascinating stuff. Don't forget to shuffle through the actual source material, it can be great rabbit hole fun! </p></div>		</li>
