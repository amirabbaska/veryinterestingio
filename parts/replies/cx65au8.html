<p>So you're saying a good portion of the extra 40hrs we're doing is going to that by way of taxes etc?  That makes me sick to my stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to confirm this, but yes, a good portion of those extra 40hrs goes towards settling foreign debt. </p>
<p>Some of it you pay through taxes, and since the higher incomes pay comparatively little tax in the US, most of the tax burden is on low to medium wages. Wars are not free and someone must pay. Someone is you.</p>
<p>However, not everything is visible on the tax receipt. You also pay pay through lower wages; the finance sector (essentially the people that owns and trades stock in the companies that do the actual work) drains off so much of the revenue generated that there is less left for salaries. These guys pay little tax for two reasons: (i) because that is the way you have let the US legislation become, and (ii) because often the owners are not US citizens themselves.</p>
<p>As for (ii) yes, this is why so many Europeans snicker when they see the US blustering on the stage of world politics these days; it is well known that half the country is owned by China, but the US still pretends like nobody knows it is not the main economic superpower any more. The crippling foreign debt is part of the complex reasons why China essentially owns the US by now. </p>
<p>As for (i), while so many Americans complain about paying taxes, few address why wages are low and what taxes could be used for. In the Scandinavian countries people pay much <strong>less</strong> in tax than what an American average taxpayer forks out in tax+insurance. And yet they have free universal healthcare. Accident? Disease? Old age? Not an economical problem, you are covered. Why do they get so much more for less money? Because since the tax money go directly to non-profit-driven state-owned hospitals ALL the money goes towards actual health care, instead of being siphoned off by insurance brokers and as profit for the insurance industry and the owners of the profit-driven health care companies. </p>
<p>And why is the legislation the way it is? Because unions in the US is synonymous with semi-criminal nominally-socialist gangs and not the only way the employees can keep a balance of power with the employers. And when there is a power imbalance, as in the US, this will be exploited, that is human nature. And the US worker is being exploited. </p></div>		</li>
