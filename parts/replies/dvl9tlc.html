<p>The Nature study asserts that neurogenesus is rare or absent in adult hippocampus, which is a specific brain region with a specific developmental trajectory. This does not eliminate or even directly address the possibility that adult neurogenesis may occur in other brain regions</p>

<p>This is true, but to be clear, it is already widely accepted that adult neurogenesis does not occur in most of the brain. My understanding (prior to this article) is that in adults, neurogenesis occurs only in a few select areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and olfactory bulb.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Humans don't really have an olfactory bulb in the same way that other species do (in the same way that mice don't really have a nucleus basalis). This paper looked at radiocarbon dating to track dynamics of neurogenesis over time and found none in the cortex but ample neurogenesis in the hippocampus (of humans).</p></div>		</li>
