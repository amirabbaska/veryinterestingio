			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a power company, and we are struggling with the fact that per capita usage is effectively stagnant right now.  Customers are being added, but they are being cancelled out by increasingly efficient power usage and appliances by everyone else.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does your company's rate model work? When I worked for a large investor-owned utility, this wouldn't cause the company to struggle, but instead would be handled in the rate case presented to the public utility commission.</p>
<p>Short, <em>very</em> simplified version: if the number of customers went up (and thus the expense of providing energy to all of them), but the total amount of energy consumed remained constant or decreased, the retail price per kilowatt-hour would be increased to compensate.</p>

<p>EDIT: Yes, we were under a revenue decoupling scheme. TBH, I thought more utilities were doing the same thing, but it looks like many are still directly tied to consumer consumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in 1982, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2009/10/the-california-experiment/307666/" target="_blank">California decoupled utility profits from total power sales</a>.  The idea was to create an environment where they utilities didn't have an incentive to discourage efficiency.  Basically: if people get more efficient, the allowed price of power goes up, so that utility profits remain stable, and people are encouraged to be even more efficient.</p>
<p>The outcome has been <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/almanac/electricity_data/us_per_capita_electricity.html" target="_blank">sharply lower per-capita electric consumption in California than the rest of the US</a>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1990 was almost 30 years ago. Back then there were 70 million fewer people in the US. 70 million. Imagine a developed country of 70 million people with an energy usage of zero. It's remarkable that we added so many people and yet didn't increase overall consumption, by consistently reducing per capita consumption.</p>
<p>How many personal electronic devices did the average person have in 1990? There are far more desktops, laptops, smartphones, and tablets today. As well there are far far more servers, routers, switches, etc. than there were in 1990. Google as a company did not exist in 1990. Think about how many data centers crammed full of equipment we've added in the last 27 years. Google, Facebook, AWS, Azure, rackspace, digital ocean, etc, etc. All of that uses power. And yet despite adding all of that, we've still gone down on per person usage, because everything else has gotten that much more efficient. Cars get much better gas mileage, home appliances are more efficient, home heating and cooling is more efficient (partly due to better insulation), home lighting is more efficient, lots of power hungry processes in industry have been reworked to do the same with less.</p></div>		</li>
