			<div class="markdown"><p>Just finished up studying special relativity in college. This is the first answer that struck me as correct: there already <em>was</em> empirical evidence for special relativity. All the experiments you listed made predictions using Galilean Relativity--and their experiments' outcomes all suggested that Galileo was <em>wrong</em>. </p>
<p>Which seemed impossible at the time, because models based on the work of Galileo and Newton had been working fine for a very long time.</p>
<p>The implications of the experiments you listed were that either Newtonian physics was broken, or the speed of light was <em>not</em> constant--even though data suggested it was. </p>
<p>While other physicists were pushing the limits of human ingenuity to show that these dilemmas were attributable to experimental error, Einstein simply said, &quot;Hold on: let's start with assumptions that make these dilemmas less disturbing, and work backward from there to see what our Newtonian models look like then.&quot;</p>
<p>So, Einstein started his work by saying:</p>
<p>1) Let's assume Newton's Laws of physics are <em>not</em> broken
2) Let's assume the speed of light <em>is</em> constant
3) Let's assume the data from these experiments isn't wrong</p>
<p>As he tried to retrace the basis of Newtonian Physics--measuring length, time, handling acceleration, etc--he noticed that his third assumption above only seemed wrong when the stuff being measured was moving very, very fast. For example, subatomic particles moving in electromagnetic fields.</p>
<p>That was his hint that led him to his famous thought experiments and a simple algebraic insight that linked the work of Lorentz to the work of particle physicists. It wasn't so much that Einstein discovered gamma; it was that he used the Pythagorean Theorem to show gamma is simply relative velocity modified by some super simple operations. </p>
<p>There is one part of special relativity that is not gracefully understood by humanity yet, however. And that is the assumption that two observers in different reference frames agree on their relative velocity. ( vis. If observers A and B can't agree on observations of distance and time, why do they agree on the distance-over-time observation made while observing each other? While special relativity relies on simple, middle-school geometry, most proofs of this observable fact rely on advanced mathematical gymnastics and often aren't satisfyingly convincing. ) But, now I'm getting lazy and using jargon like it's going out of style.</p>
<p>The last important thing about all this, I think, is the question--why didn't humanity notice special relativity sooner?</p>
<p>I think it's because, until the Victorian Era, not many things in our experience moved fast enough for relativity to matter, to <em>be</em> observable. Not until that era did humanity start observing subatomic particles moving in fields at sufficient detail to have data that <em>didn't</em> follow Galilean Relativity well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's known as the reciprocity principle. Unfortunately, most of the papers on it use graduate-level math. And none of the ones I've seen are widely cited as adequately satisfying proofs. ( On the other hand, actual data from human-made satellites <em>has</em> shown us that observers in different reference frames <em>do</em> agree on their relative velocities. We just can't say why gracefully using math, yet. )</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't understand the problem here. You can make a simple argument by symmetry that they must agree on the relative velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>op provides poor reasons why they shouldn't be able to agree and concludes it is not understood. </p>
<p>i wouldn't take that statement too seriously.  you can measure doppler shift between two frames giving you indication about the relative velocity (if you agree a wavelength beforehand).  and that's what's done in practice in astronomy / cosmology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.</p>
<p>Without looking into it much, I'd argue that people have developed natural abilities to perceive &quot;absolute&quot; velocity despite constantly observing relative velocity. Same with almost literally everything we perceive. Hardly difficult to imagine humans could use imagination to arrive at similar models despite relative velocities, but maybe that's just because I've never traveled at relativistic speeds compared to someone I was observing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't the Newtonian/Galilean models work if you assume an infinite speed of light? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They work if you assume throwing a photon from a moving train follows the same rules as throwing a football from a moving train. </p>
<p>If a train is moving 100 mph in America, and you throw a football at 10 mph off the back of the train, a stationary observer on the ground would observe the football going 90 mph. The velocities are additive; this kind of thing is called Galilean Relativity. Newton's models use Galilean Relativity and work well using it when modeling slow-moving objects. </p>
<p>If a train is moving 100 mph in America, and you throw a photon off the back of the train--you have no choice but to throw it at 300,000,000 meters per second. Also, a stationary observer on the ground would observe the photon going 300,000,000 meters per second. Not 300,000,000 meters per second minus 100 mph. Furthermore, an observer moving at a constant velocity on the ground in the same direction as the photon <em>still</em> sees the photon moving at 300,000,000 meters per second. The velocity of a photon is not additive; it's totally mind bending the first time you see it. This is called Special Relativity. Newtonian physics still works for fast-moving objects <em>if</em> you use Special Relativity instead of Galilean Relativity. </p>
<p>Of course, all of the above is questionable at best, because everyone knows trains in America can't go 100 mph and American footballs are rightfully called &quot;hand eggs&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Fix it, congress!&quot; :p</p>
<p>But, anyway...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes.  assuming c is very large compared to common velocities and removing terms that are negligible therefore gives you newtonian physics. </p>
<p>a similar process gives you newtonian gravity from general relativity </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What Einstein did that was so incredible was not special relativity, which was brilliant in its own right, it was that he produced the theory of special relativity, explained Brownian motion, and explained the photoelectric effect. In a single year. As an amateur physicist. </p>
<p>It should be noted that he won the Nobel Prize for his theory on the photoelectric effect and not his more famous works, which were controversial for years after their publication, to the point that the last major implication of Relativity was only proven in the past year (gravity waves). </p>
<p>Edit: He was an amateur in the sense that he was not engaged as a physicist as a profession. He did his work as a passionate hobby while otherwise employed as a patent clerk. While he did have a PhD and was definitely an expert in his field, he operated completely outside of the halls of academia. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To be clear, he already had his PhD and was working in the patent office while waiting for a professorship. While he was a very young researcher, he was still an expert.</p></div>		</li>

<p>that's a misjudgement.  gravitational wave detection in ligo is a further confirmation. but it hasn't changed anything about the status of general relativity. besides the emission of gravitational waves had been observed in a bipulsar system some 25 years ago already, although ligo made a more difficult measurement of course. </p>
<p>general relativity hasn't been controversial since 1920. that the technically challenging ligo experiment took 100 years to be realized has nothing to do with it. </p>
<p>then to say it was &quot;the last major implication &quot; is nonsense.  there's is no last. </p>
<p>also he wasn't an amateur. he just wasn't employed as a researcher. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not taught, that is the social view on science or on Einstein. It is just a buzz word for science, if you will. In physics classes or advanced physics in high-school (it might differ in countries) you learn special relativity and only go to E=mc^2 in early introductory quantum mechanics or modern physics course. </p></div>		</li>
