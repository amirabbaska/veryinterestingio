			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the warhead caring fire really that big of a concern? I mean fire doesn’t split atoms and that’s were the destruction comes from. So just catching on fire would only result in an explosion at worst, but not actual nuclear fallout, I could be totally off base though since I don’t have degrees in advanced chemistry or physics.  I’ve also never had any hands on time with uranium-235.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the HE could ignite, causing a dirty bomb effect.  Or the casing could rupture, causing radiation exposure.  And the warhead is usually attached to some sort of delivery mechanism, like an ICBM or other missile/rocket, which may contain highly volatile fuels and oxidizers.</p>
<p>Here's a summary of the Damascus event chronicled in the book, in which a <strong>technician dropping a wrench</strong> led to a massive explosion that killed one man and injured dozens of others.  The explosion was powerful enough to toss a <strong>740 ton</strong> door into the air, followed by the warhead.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The warhead catching fire is a concern, but not like you might think.  These warheads contain both radioactive material, and high explosives. If the HE cooks off, you suddenly have a massive dirty bomb--it won't go nuclear, but it <em>will</em> spread radioactive material into the surrounding environment.</p></div>		</li>
