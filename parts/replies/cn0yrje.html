			<p>Even though I'm fucking still about 30k in debt, WITHOUT A DEGREE MIND YOU, I refuse to go back to school. It's a fucking scam, full stop. I am learning how to program on my own now, using MOOCs and videos and countless tutorials. I don't need some asshat telling me what to do on outdated languages and software, I can teach my self for free. <br><br>And the whole degree thing. My god do I agree with that. That is such a load of shit. </p>		</li>
