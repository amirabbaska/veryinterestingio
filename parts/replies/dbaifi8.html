			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's astounding. So they could theoretically advance a lot this way in regards to leveling the intellectual playing field with us? Because I feel like if you taught Gen 1 the basics, it'd take X amount of time, but because Gen 2 would learn quick through the early development time it could be x/2 the amount of time, and from there you teach Gen 2 more advanced sign language and they would teach Gen 3, etc etc. And from there, once you have an established, complex method of communicate with these very intelligent apes, you could teach tool building and such and they'd work from there! Sorry it's just such a cool though! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't go that far. Apes have a robust social system, and have culture (which is defined as knowledge and skills that is passed down generations NOT through genetics, and is the crux of your question)</p>
<p>Culture is a feature of a bunch of intelligent species-- several birds included. But the gap between humans and apes isn't just one of igborance-- humans have better facuties than your average ape when it comes to how we meaure intelligence. Many are maybe equivilent to a 4 year old at their prime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad that someone brought up the idea of chimpanzee culture to this conversation. Because it's not just about language â€“ particular populations of chimpanzees are known to &quot;specialize&quot; in certain behaviors that are not seen in other populations, such as tool use. Some chimp groups use flat rocks to scrape bark a certain way; others use sticks to fish for termites (and out of those, the next generation might refine the skill further by bending the end of the stick into a hook, etc.).  These are all learned behaviors, not innate or species-wide. There have even been observations of chimpanzees possibly performing &quot;<a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep22219" target="_blank">ritual stone-throwing</a>&quot; or <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4469965/" target="_blank">making music by drumming</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, is the 4 year old thing an estimate? I feel like most 4 year olds are well past the ape intelligence level. I could see apes being more leveled with 2 year olds. As in, they understand communication, have object permanence, have some idea of cause and effect, primitive ability to estimate quantity etc. But not really comprehension of how time passes, how hypotheticals work, true ability to count and understand what numbers signify. Some 4 year olds even read.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roger Fouts was one of the founding people for proving that chimps can pass on sign language to their young. Also later became a leading force in having apes recognized as non-human persons  which allowed many new protections to them. </p>
<p>Next of Kin, is an amazing book he wrote about his experiences. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would quickly run into the limits of Chimpanzee intelligence. Our adoption of language was both an inter-generational passing of skills <em>and</em> a genetic change over evolutionary time. Our brain has specialized systems for processing language that are not present at nearly the same level in Chimps.</p></div>		</li>
