			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, over time he'd reduce his overall holdings... but given the size of his stake, it wouldn't really affect his overall influence/control. Selling 0.1% of his shares each year would still be millions of dollars in cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>80 million shares at about $1000 per share.</p>
<p>If he wanted to buy a $2mil house in cash, you sell 2000 shares, leaving you with 79,998,000 shares. </p>
<p>If the value of Amazon stock goes up by 3 cents after he bought the house, his total stock value would be back above where he started. Going up 3 cents on a $1000 stock is only 0.3%. </p>
<p>He is so wealthy that even tiny gains are enough to cover his cost of living. It would be like if you had enough money in your savings account that the little 1-2% savings interest covered all your bills.</p></div>		</li>
