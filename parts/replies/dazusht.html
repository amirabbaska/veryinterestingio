			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree that the &quot;post&quot; refers to the majority in Parliament. I mean, it could, but the more relevant use of &quot;post&quot; is at the riding level. Most talk of electoral reform is focused on fixing <em>that</em> post. You could have a proportional system and you're still going to have to have a &quot;post&quot; in Parliament.</p>
<p>The main issue is that in each riding, anyone who didn't vote for the winning candidate effectively has their vote thrown out, because it isn't used for anything other than determining who wins that single constituency.</p>
<p>To reduce it simply and absurdly: there could be an election between two parties (for simplicity) where party A wins 326 constituencies with 50%+1 of the vote, and lose every other seat 99-1, and win a majority.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Monster Raving Loony Party</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As I'm sure someone will ask, I'll sum up - the MRLP are a political party formed of a loose affiliation of buffoons and satirists. They jokingly run political campaigns with ridiculous, &quot;loony&quot; policies to lampoon politics.</p>
<p>They have never been elected to a single seat.</p>
<p>However, it <em>has</em> been suggested that the MRLP intersperse their ridiculous policies with ideas that are sensible, but only <em>seem</em> ridiculous at first glance. The juxtaposition pushes these issues into the fore and gets them noticed.</p>
<p>The example usually cited is that they were the first to quote that we should have &quot;passports for pets&quot;... And years later, we actually have them!</p></div>		</li>
