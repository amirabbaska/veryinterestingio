			<div class="markdown"><p>It was.... The ticking of a clock.
NASA TV broadcasters tried their best but it still ultimately came out as, &quot;we have some people in a room.  They have some little flags... They're going to wave them.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit - Reading out all the twitter stuff looked like it killed the anchor inside a little bit.  And the countdown guy - talking over the event;  &quot;This is about america&quot;.... Ugh.  No it fucking isn't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... you have to keep in mind that a lot of the people who are talking about the event on NASA TV are fairly high up in NASA's organizational structure, or are in the communication division. Part of their job is playing up the US government's role in this mission. But I think if you pay attention to what the actual scientists and mission personnel are saying, you'll probably hear more about how this was a great accomplishment for science and technology, and a bit less of the &quot;WOOOOO 'MURICA&quot; stuff.</p></div>		</li>
