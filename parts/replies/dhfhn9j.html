			<div class="markdown"><p>And then, when it comes to the Bible, there is the additional question of which manuscripts are most authentic or accurate. </p>
<p>Does the translation include what we have learned from archaeological digs and re-examination of ancient sources? Or does it rely on the most common texts? </p>
<p>Does it note when there is uncertainty? Or does it simply make the decision for you? </p>
<p>Does it try to cram everything into as few oages as possible? Or does it make use of whitespace to affect readability? (e.g., a poem can be typeset with short lines and spaces to mark verses, or it can be left looking like prose. Paragraphs can be unmarked, or indicated with pilcrows (¶), or they can be offset with blank lines as we are used to.</p>
<p>Not to mention that most headings in most Bibles are not originally part of the text, but instead added by the editors for the readers’ convenience, but they can significantly affect how the text is understood by a reader!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. I could be wrong but isn't there something about the [insert ancient language the bible was written in] word to describe Mary, being debateable. The word means something along the lines of maiden/unmarried woman. Which especially in those days, basically meant she was or at least should be a virgin. So when it was translated, they picked the word virgin...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are partly correct, except you missed a ring. There is a Hebrew word &quot;Alma&quot; that is used in the &quot;prophesy&quot; &quot;Behold a virgin shall be with child&quot; (paraphrase). Alma doesn't mean virgin, all it means is young woman. </p>
<p>In fact, if memory serves the prophesy (the reason I had it quoted in the first place) isn't really pertaining to the Messiah, but rather the prophesy was made to determine an outcome of a war. However, the Bible translators mistranslated (or translated misleadingly) Alma to mean virgin, and then its most likely that the person who wrote the gospel (who didn't understand Hebrew, if he did he would have caught the error) saw the mistranslation and worked the gospel off of that.</p>
<p>Edit: Here is a link to a Judaism site that elaborate more in depth. I'm not an authority on matter at all:

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard it argued that it's less of a mistranslation and more of a euphemism issue, where the word was used at the time of the Greek translation to imply virgin without saying it.</p>
<p>Now, it is possible (if you do not believe the Bible is literally true) that they saw the virgin translation and retconned Jesus's backstory to fit that. This is another common belief. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were about a 500 religions practiced under the realm of the Roman Empire. Most of their gods were born of a virgin. This is not at all a novel idea of the Christian religion. Wanna guess how Zoroaster was born?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Usually the best translation will be a mix of the two - you want to keep some accuracy, obviously, but a translation that literally only takes each word into account with no care as to the context is little better than Google Translate. That is also why many dubs and subs of foreign-language media sometimes sound so wrong - they're translations too focused on grammatical accuracy to properly render the entire meaning and subtle cues of the original text.</p>
<p>These choices in translation, as well as the relatively linearity between versions and the systematic approach of the Christian authorities to translate in every language, is what makes the Bible such a treasure trove and such a massive reference for linguistics as a whole.</p></div>		</li>
