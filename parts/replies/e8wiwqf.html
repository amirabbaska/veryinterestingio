			<div class="markdown"><p>Midazolam isn’t and analgesic or anesthetic. It’s purpose is to reduce anxiety, not pain. Midazolam is used in conscious sedation because it makes patients calm and cooperative. In these situations it’s almost always paired with morphine or fentanyl to provide pain relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I finally woke up and re read your comment. You are right, it is neither an analgesic or anesthetic. It's used as a sedative/anti anxiety as you said, with the benefit of being  good at causing antero grade amnesia. What I was mixing up was anesthesia and anesthetic which are 2 completely different things. Thanks for the catch!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it is used in the anesthesia process, it’s quite a stretch to call it an anesthetic. Calling midazolam an anesthetic is misleading, especially to the lay person. Even in the reference you posted it is not referred to as an anesthetic. The drug class is benzodiazepine or anti-anxiolytic.</p></div>		</li>
