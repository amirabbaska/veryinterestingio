<p>Have you tried different kinds of SSRIs/ADs? I was also out of luck with my first attempts so I cycled through them until I found one that was working for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently can't be on medication anymore (am pregnant), but once the little one is out I probably will see if there would be other medications that would work, though I was already recommended EMT multiple times and I had little progress with my PTSD :( my psychologist told me with my severity it will take 10years of medications and  therapy to make a difference, so I will stick with my service dog until I feel like 10 years of medication is a better option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am really sorry to hear that, good luck! For me SSRI medication was the only thing that managed to get me out of a severe panic disorder. It took me roughly 3 months to start noticing a difference ( the meds made me feel much worse at first). I was lucky enough to have a suppportive boyfriend at that time.
I have been on the meds for more than 7 years, and they're just part of my everyday life, like brushing my teeth or drinking water:I barely think about them anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome that you do physical therapy to help deal with this. I teach a type of yoga that deals with postural therapy and it does wonders for people whose bodies are stuck in the fight, flight, freeze mode. Training your body to release in places where you have been holding trauma is huge and I wish more people knew about this and made the connection when trying to get well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is really cool. I was taught a mini set of relaxing kungfu practice that was supposed to help as it involves counting. I know a friend who is a martial art couch who has psychologist redirect certain clients to, apparently also helps too. I dont think enough people know how &quot;physical&quot; mental illnesses actually is. It is not just a thought or personality, but a full-body fuck-up. </p>
<p>I was beaten in the head on a specific spot by my dad frequently in childhood and being touched or bumped onto around the spot can literally make my mind go blank and before I know it I was having terrible anxiety attacks. Took me abit but lately I was able to have my husband stroke my scalp and actually feel relaxed as long as it wasnt unexpected :) it was a really satisfying first step forward for me :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's amazing. What I do is called yogalign. It is centered around correct breathing which naturally corrects the posture, along with a series of movements to realign the body and bring strength to the places we don't use, mostly the back due to lots of chair sitting. During the teacher training there was an understanding that while doing these exercises people might experience big waves of emotion and that we should just let it happen and not try to assign a story to it. Also working with the physical aspects of emotional trauma or physical trauma with the yogalign method allow for the reprogramming of the neurons and neural pathways in our bodies, thereby turning off old habits of flight, freeze, or atrophy and programming in new healthier and stronger programs. I know physical therapy can have the same effects. If you happen to have the chance to take a yogalign class in your area I would recommend it.</p></div>		</li>
