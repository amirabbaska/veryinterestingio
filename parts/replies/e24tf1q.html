			<div class="markdown"><p>I take the significance to be that Koko was using language for very different things than a human would. One of the first things human children do when they learn language is to ask a bunch of questions (thinking hanging out with a toddler and getting asked &quot;buy why?&quot;). The fact that Koko didn't do this suggests that Koko's language was either more different than we thought or that she had such different cognitive abilities than us that she used her language in different ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be interested in Kanzi the Bonobo compared to Koko. What I have learned in language classes about these primates who have been taught sign language and symbols is that there’s varying levels of complexity used by each case study. Kanzi is an amazing example of more advanced language skills and seems to exhibit the most of Charles Hockett’s design features of language + what we know of Kanzi is less anecdotal and more procedural/empirical compared to Koko.</p>
<p>The likes of Chomsky and Tomasello have been wrestling with the idea of what makes language a language and what makes human language so special/how did it develop. </p>
<p>I haven’t really answered your question unfortunately but mostly my goal was to give you some specific avenues of exploration. As a student myself I don’t have a good answer but it is all very interesting. </p></div>		</li>
