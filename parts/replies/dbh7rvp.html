			<div class="markdown"><p>The process of an atom absorbing or emitting radiation is already P invariant (unless it's circularly polarized radiation, in which case P violation would split the two circular polarizations, which is not observed). It is not T invariant, but T transforms an absorption into an emission, and we observe that the frequencies are always the same.</p>
<p>So, for hydrogen we observe just one spectral line no matter whether it's emission or absorption, and no matter whether it's left-handed circularly polarized light or right-handed. That means the frequency already seems invariant under PT symmetry. If it were different for antimatter it would violate C, but it would also violate CPT.</p>
<p>CPT takes, for example, a hydrogen atom emitting left-handed light, into an anti-hydrogen atom absorbing right-handed light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any Lorentz invariant quantum field theory must not violate the combined CPT symmetry. So C symmetry implies the combined PT symmetry. I believe this is why they say that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont think this is actually true. The lorentz violating terms in the minimal standard model extension arent sensitive to the transition studied in this experiment. Also, you can have CPT but still have lorentz symmetry violation. The experiment needs to do more before it can claim to be sensitive enough to test CPT to a higher precision than we already have. That said, it is still a major advancement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As i said, constraining CPT violation is not the same as constraining lorentz symmetry. The lorentz violating coefficients are numerous and occur in every sector of the standard model. Some are constrained, some are not. So simply constraining coefficients in one sector doesnt point toward perfect symmetry. It is believed that these coefficients emerge from some unknown underlying unified theory of nature including both quantum mechanics and general relativity. Because we dont know this theory, we dont know which coefficients are nonzero. Also some coefficients preserve CPT, but not lorentz symmetry, so simply having perfect CPT symmetry doesnt close the door on physics beyond the standard model.</p>
<p>That said, i focus on the gravity sector and cant really speak to which experiment currently gives the best bound on these coefficients. The data tables are available. The main researcher is Kostelecky (indiana university) if youre interested.</p></div>		</li>
