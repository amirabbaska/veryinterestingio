			<div class="markdown"><p>I took Effexor in my early 20s for depression for a few years and came off it relatively easily. I'm back on it at age 32 at a high dose. I am curious if my experience coming off it (which definitely won't be for quite awhile) will be the same or very different! If it's awful I will look into the Prozac crossover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to scare anyone off, it took me a long time to admit that I needed some sort of chemical help to get through my day, and the potential difficulties tend to get more attention that the potential gains... I spent too many years in hell because I was too proud, too embarrassed, and/or too misinformed. And though it took a decade of ramping up and down on a few dozen different drugs, we finally did find the one that fixes the neurotransmitter deficiency in my head without side-effects. Every person's head is different though, so one person's experience only maps so far to someone else's experience.</p>
<p>But I do feel like it is better to face everything with full knowledge, or however close to that you can get.</p>
<p>From personal experience and from talking to many people over the years, I've seen that those who had an easy time coming off of something once usually have a comparable time coming off it again, even at a higher dose. But the sense of dysphoria that comes from being 'on the slope' - for me it always feels like trying to stay upright on an icy lake during an earthquake - can not only be difficult, it can also change how you perceive what you are going through. It's hard to stay on top of what is happening when the thing you are using to evaluate your condition is the thing that is malfunctioning.</p>
<p>If/when you ramp down the effexor: ask people close to you to keep an eye on you, ask your doctor for a longer ramp or additional help if it gets too difficult, and be kind to yourself. For me it was always really easy to underestimate the dysphoria, to mistake that grimness for logic and clarity.</p>
<p>And if you don't ramp down the effexor: there are worse ways to live. If it helps you, accept the help.</p>
<p>I wish you the best of luck.</p></div>		</li>
