			<div class="markdown"><p>could we add more channels by separating channels by a smaller margin that current standards? For example, each channel on the CB band is 0.01MHz higher or lower than it's adjacent channels. With better technology, if we don't already have it, could we go with say 0.001MHz? I assume there is some sort of limitation on how much gap is needed in analog transmission in order to have an acceptable audio frequency range. What if we go a digital route, wouldnt each channel then only need a range of 2 Hz? I'd imagine you'd need hella fast processors to encode and decode on the fly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Discriminating the narrower channels isn't the issue. The lower bandwidth (literally and figuratively) is. Those CB channels are 10 KHz apart to carry the sound of the human voice, plus a little margin.  At only 1KHz separation, you can only hear the low frequencies in speech, and they have the least information value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be possible to compress the voice data into the low frequencies for transmission then move them back up into a higher range? Obviously you'd lose some of the voice due to the compression but could it still be made understandable (if likely odd-sounding)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is technically, yes, assuming you had the technology to differentiate between 1KHz of a carrier wave. It's such a small difference it might be unreliable, though audio equipment differentiates those frequencies quite easily. Audio gear takes alot more processing power than a radio though. (hell radios are 99% analogue)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual data is in the sidebands though. You can't just move frequencies arbitrarily close together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is: theoretically yes. </p>
<p>The longer answer starts with correcting the misconception that analog and digital signals are different when propagated wirelessley (sp??). In telecommunications, 'analog' mostly refers to the actual electromagnetic representation of a signal as it travels through the air - its physical form, invisible to our eyes, but still affecting and being affected by the environment around it. The term 'digital' largely refers the equipment processing, sending, or receiving said signal. </p>
<p>Sending a signal is easy enough, the real trick is in getting someone else to be able to receive it. When a signal is sent, a computer instructs the proper equipment to oscillate electricity through an antenna (or antennae) to give off electromagnetic 1s &amp; 0s. When receiving, however, the equipment has to digitize the physical waveform in real time (or very near it). This is accomplished with what we call today Nyquist Theory (formally Nyquist-Shannon Theorem). More colloquially known as 'sampling'. </p>
<p>All signals (at least, for right now), no matter how complex or simple, are utterly useless if the receiving machine cannot sample your sent signal correctly. </p>
<p>So, yes, theoretically - as long as the receiving computer can sample the waveform and produce the proper information - we can make channels as small as we want. The hard part making equipment sensitive enough to detect and differentiate signals that fine and minute, while also sending them loud enough to be heard above the noise floor to begin with. </p></div>		</li>
