			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may, small anecdote. I am in the field of bioinformatics today but as a college student my job was driving university buses.</p>
<p>No matter how long the route, if you drive the same route multiple times a day for years, then this default network usually kicks in. Other people here might relate when they think of work commute etc.</p>
<p>What I found mesmerizing is that I could drive multiple rounds and back on campus Id have a break and suddenly have some sort of clarity moment, where I asked myself how the bus made it around town for the last two hours.</p>
<p>At first this sounds scary, but the reality is that you are always alert and responsive. The brain seems to instantly switch to fully active mode the femtosecond something unusual, out of normal pattern happens. Might be as little as a dog running across the street. </p>
<p>In this mode, driving is harder because you suddenly have to take care of multiple things which arent automated by your brain and humans are very bad at multi-tasking no matter what folks will personally tell you. </p>
<p>So I am really fascinated how we can &quot;automate&quot; things by repetition and your brain only seems to put real attention to what's novel. Probably also a factor when learning instruments etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What I find interesting is this even works with typing. I had an account for a game for years, but hadn't played it in a year or so. I knew the password was a random 13 digit random number letter combination but had no clue what. I looked away from the keyboard and let my hands do what they had done to get into the account probably every day for years. They got it right. Had to actually watch me type it to remember parts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even without the keyboard if I just close my eyes and twitch my fingers a little I can 'translate' the movements into pi, it just takes a bit longer than recalling from memory would. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be able to do this in my Arabic class in college. I'd sort of turn my brain off when I forgot a word and I'd either type it or say it out loud before I could even think about it. I don't know if that makes sense, but it was always amazing how many words my active brain seemed to forget but my more passive brain could remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a musician, what you're describing does definitely happen semi-regularly while I'm playing. I'll be playing and thinking and suddenly I'm 16 bars ahead with no memory of what I played during that time, but everyone's still going and I'm still playing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a vivid memory of playing in a very important concert (for nationals or something) where I realized I'd been staring at a stage light for some amount of time trying to figure out how the wiring must be set up. I noticed I was doing that, looked back to my sheet music, and realized <em>I'd been playing perfectly the whole time</em>, because of course I had because I'd played this song a thousand times. But it freaked me out so bad in that moment to see my hands just going about their business while I'd been thinking of something totally unrelated that I immediately snapped into manual control, whereupon I of course fucked up. This borked the harmony in a critical part, which fucked my whole bass section's bowing since I was lead, and by cascade effect the violins ended up off-tempo.</p>
<p>Ended up having to explain to the concertmaster that I'd got spooked by the fact that I can play bass, which rendered me temporarily unable to play bass. He was not amused. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That commercial comes to mind advertising some car that stops itself. It's on constantly, yet I don't recall the company, but I digress. The woman's singing to some song imagining she's on some reality singing competition and that distracts her from stopping. But it seems so inaccurate.</p>
<p>Like you noted, I totally go somewhere else mentally sometimes when I'm driving and wonder how the fuck I got somewhere. Doesn't even have to be a super familiar route; just a long patch of highway or a destination that doesn't require GPS. I may have been fully daydreaming and envisioning a situation - often times something relatively thought-intensive such as something work-related and/or creative in nature - though I never felt unsafe or not alert enough. And as a narcoleptic, I can certainly differentiate the two.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Think of this like when you want to think something over and &quot;sleep on it&quot; and wake up with new insights</p>

<p>Something interesting I read a while back was talking about how you can fail and fail and fail at something, then walk away and come back later, say after a night's sleep and nail it on the first try.</p>
<p>Said it was because you're brain had &quot;forgotten&quot; all the things that didn't work and only kept the things that did.  Not sure how accurate that actually is, but I thought it was interesting.</p>
<p>The first time I recall an instance of this was when I was trying to beat the canyon run training mission on <em>Star Wars: Rebel Assault</em>, many many years ago.  Played for hours and couldn't get through it.  Rage quit, the next day I got it on the first try.</p></div>		</li>
