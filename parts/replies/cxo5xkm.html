			<div class="markdown"><p>As a molecular biologist this explanation is top notch and spot on!  I would add that environmental factors can include diet (bacteria in your gut), slight differences in chemical absorption and positioning of the fetus in the womb could be a rationale for the differences seen in identical twins, be mindful that identical twins are not 100% identical at the genome level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As another microbiologist I agree and I would like to emphasize your statement about gut flora. </p>
<p>The study of gut flora is still in its infancy but evidence is mounting that the role in development and later life is huge and has been immensely under valued. Many scientists claim that the gut flora are basically another organ on their own, albeit one that can be permanently altered by diet, antibiotics, infections and other influences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there anywhere to find up-to-date yet hyperbole and hysteria-free information on gut flora research?  Most of what's easily accessible online is crap telling me to give my kids some special proprietary probiotic or else they'll get crippling depression or autism.</p>
<p>How strong is the current link between gut flora and personality traits?  Are all probiotics equal?  Are fermented foods important?  And a question that has been particularly hard for me to find an answer to -- do you need to eat yogurt/probiotics/saurkraut/etc constantly, or can a course of those foods effectively colonize your gut with the preferred bacteria and then you're set until something upsets the balance?  E.g. Antibiotics</p>
<p>From my perspective, there's some limited research but a mountain of bullshit has been thrown on top by charlatans or people with just enough knowledge to be dangerous, and its really hard to figure out what the best practices are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but it's worth noting that &quot;gut flora&quot; is a flavor of the month right now, meaning that it's being greatly hyped.  Almost certainly the influence of gut flora will turn out to be significant, but nowhere near as significant as many of the claims for it today.  (Reading the scientific literature for the past 30 years gives some perspective to new claims.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious but don't people who live in the same household have very similar microbiomes? Due to same diet and stuff? This would change maybe if one went on antibiotics but then usually doesn't it tend to level off and eventually become similar to what it was before? So I guess my question is how much does the microbiome differ between identical twins in the same house usually?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunologist here (I study the MHC and autoimmunity): great explanation, and I wanted to add something further about a potential difference between identical twins. There have been cases of autoimmunity in one twin when the delivery was not the same for both. There's recent evidence that cesarean births may contribute to an autoimmune phenotype, as their early micro biome is not formed the way it is for a vaginal birth. I don't know what causes autism, but if it were found to be autoimmune that could possibly contribute. I'm curious if the twins both had a vaginal birth, or if they were different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a neat detail I did not know. Could an autoimmune phenotype appear when the parent has a genetic malformation them self? (An example, can a parent who is PKU positive result in an autoimmune phenotype development in the child?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetic changes happen constantly in all cells...though most are fixed and they rarely have any visible effect.  So basically, from the point the DNA in the egg is copies to form two descendant cells, it's possible for an error in the copying of the DNA to leave a change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>even after assuming these two embryos started out genetically identical, it would be hard to suggest that the next few generations of fission won't introduce any transcription errors, etc etc.  </p>
<p>then there's epigenetic factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, but keep in mind that epigenomics plays a huge role, the dna is not just the sequence of nucleotides</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. I'm a scientist studying the genetics of autism. I wanted to add that there are also genetic mutations that can occur after birth and during development (somatic mutations). So this could cause genetic differences between twins. We are currently studying whether this could cause autism in some cases. </p></div>		</li>
