<p>Check out some of the other answers (Becca and I are doing this at the same time so we're jumping around a bit!) for more detail, but long and short of it: </p>
<p>We currently believe that the most likely hypothesis is intentional disposal of bodies is most likely due to inaccessibility of the cave, as well as lack of other animal remains. Animals (including hominids) could sometimes get lost in caves, if they were seeking refuge or water, but this is quite a long way to go and hard to access. It doesn't seem as likely, to us, that multiple hominins/ groups would have all happened to get lost in the same remote, inaccessible chamber over and over again. And if it was someplace that they might have ended up, why didn't other animals also make their way into the chamber? Those are the questions we've asked ourselves and that now we're asking the world! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking the world, here is a theory that may happen to fit the facts: they may have been under siege. Hunted by some group of larger hominids either for food or competition for habitat or both, they may have retreated into the cave for safety. The bigger hominids can't fit in there to follow, and eventually some percentage of the trapped people died of thirst. Typically the very young and the very old would die first in that kind of situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, this is Hannah!</p>
<p>A possible scenario. But again, I think it goes back to what's most likely - that multiple groups facing attack found themselves seeking refuge in this one particular spot, over and over again? If it was one group that all died together, I might agree with you. However, because these remains were deposited over time, that means that multiple groups over time would have to have been attacked and somehow managed to end up in this one spot in the cave. Not saying it's impossible, just seems less probable to me. </p></div>		</li>
