			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes a &quot;mathematical constant&quot; is pretty subjective. Generally, it's a number that appears in some natural context that mathematicians find interesting. Generally, these <em>are</em> irrational, because they come up by examining some object in some natural context, rather than just giving names to things. But, there are cases when these <em>are</em> rational, or even integers. For instance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legendre%27s_constant" target="_blank">Legendre's Constant</a>, is a number which pops up in the context of primes. It was originally not thought to be special or anything, but it turns out that this number is actually just 1.  In this case, we have a <em>reason</em> for it to be rational, related to how nicely the primes are distributed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a convenient way of denoting integers, and also rational numbers as fractions. Irrational numbers by definition don't have such convenient notations and so we often have to give them other symbols.</p>
<p>Notice that the square root of two is just written with a surd, but the golden ratio gets a specific symbol because it's more awkward to write, even though it's still a simply-written algebraic number.</p></div>		</li>
