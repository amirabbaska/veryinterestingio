<p>If you poke it, do they move?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria are specialized and there are tons of different kinds of environments of which they can grow on, depending on the amount of resources in the environment (abundance) they can grow under each other and cause that sort of layering effect.   </p>
<p>Probably wont move, generally they really adhere to surfaces they colonize in what is called a biofilm.  </p></div>		</li>
