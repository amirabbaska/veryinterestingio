			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! You get tired, stay awake to finish what you were doing or start something new and then you don't feel sleepy anymore. Useful when that happens at 2pm. Annoying when you were barely keeping your eyes open, got ready for bed, and now you're wide awake. It can be easy to think of it as forgetting to be tired anymore or that the activity woke you up but you've probably experienced it. It can also be less noticeable if you're always tired, going from falling asleep to exhausted isn't all that noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about long car trips. There are times when you literally cannot stay awake despite your best efforts. A couple hours later you could feel totally normal and not even think about sleeping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I'm really tired I get the feeling of waves of sleepiness with perhaps 5-10 second intervals. It's like its pulsating. Usually I fall asleep or nod off soon after. </p></div>		</li>
