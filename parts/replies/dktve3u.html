<p>Did the whole panel find out in voir dire or in conversation that you were a lawyer? To me this sounds sort of like the conversation of a jury who suspects that there's a narc in the room. </p></div>		</li>

<p>After the trial concludes, the judge will tell the jurors that they may be contacted by lawyers and that they are free to speak to us or not speak to us.  Most jurors are happy to stay in court for a few minutes and discuss things with the attorneys.  (Usually one or two will just walk away.)</p>
<p>We attorneys ask about what testimony was persuasive, what they thought of various expert witnesses (so we will know whether we should consider hiring the expert again), what arguments/ analogies they thought were effective, etc.  Even stuff like did it bother you that Witness X was a video instead of live testimony?</p>
<p>Also, the jurors usually have lots of questions, too.  They've often sat for weeks listening to evidence with very limited opportunities to ask clarifying questions.  So they are dying to know things, often things that have been excluded.  Why didn't we hear from Witness Q, who was there.  (Because s/he is in jail or something.)  You also get some great feedback like &quot;Why didn't you ask X about this or that.&quot;  Usually it's irrelevant but sometimes it is a brilliant question that didn't occur to any of the attorneys. </p>
<p>Jurors are human and they are often deeply affected by trials.  I've had jurors apologize to my clients, explaining that they liked them and so forth but that they had to vote against them because of the law.  I've had jurors become friends with clients.  Some jurors will become friends and stay in touch after a trial.</p>
<p>If there is some suspected misconduct, we will contact jurors after trial for formal interviews  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He/she isn't wrong, depending on where they practice. Lawyers interviewing jurors post-trial is permitted in some jurisdictions, and absolutely forbidden in others. Where it is allowed, the judge will make it clear that it is entirely voluntary on the part of the jurors. </p></div>		</li>
