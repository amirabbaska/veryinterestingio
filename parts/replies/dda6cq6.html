			<div class="markdown"><p>So my brain has decided that alarms are unimportant and can and will sleep through then for hours.  Even if I switch it up with different alarms.  How do I get brain to care about them more? </p>
<p>I've found myself ealing up to a vibrating phone call and picking it up and start talking before I register that my alarm is a foot away and blaring. It'll have been going off for over an hour and I literally cannot hear it while asleep. The fact that I've woken up and had a lag time between waking up and finally hearing the alarm is amazing (and horrifying for my work schedule). I didn't realize until recently that &quot;selective hearing&quot; could actually cause you to ignore something so much you dont even register it's there.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Find the app &quot;I Can't Wake Up&quot; of you have android. You can set it to make the most annoying noise possible, and then set it to make you solve simple math problems (4x2)+(3x5) before it will quit. Then a minute later, it plays a gentle tune and has a slider on the screen that you have to confirm you're up, or else the blaring alarm with the math problems comes back.</p>
<p>I also have a fit bit charge HR that I sleep in, and it has a silent alarm set on it to go off at the same time as my phone alarm. So, my arm starts vibrating at the same time as the alarm starts.</p>
<p>You can also get an alarm for hearing impaired people that has a vibrating disk that goes in between your mattress and box springs, so your bed vibrates when it's time to wake up. Amazon has those for $50 or less.</p>
<p>Also, don't use snooze. You are training your brain to not give a shit about alarms. When it goes off, get up. You're not getting any more valuable sleep 5 minutes at a time anyway. Just set your alarm for the time you actually intend to get out of bed, and just do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second not using snooze. My husband sets six different alarms 30 minutes apart. He used to wake up to every one and get up at the last one. It got to the point where he wouldn't wake up to any of them. I will set ONE alarm, on vibrate, and wake up every time. Then I have to wake my husband up for work. -.-</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that exact frustration. Two things that have worked phenomenally are: </p>
<p>adding light to my alarm
Spoken word alarms</p>
<p>Why these things are helpful I do not know, but they have made waking up much easier. For the light you could buy a fancy schmancy lamp alarm, or (like me) purchase a desk lamp and an programmable outlet timer. </p>
<p>For the alarm, try the Rock Clock. You can wake up to the sound of Dwayne Johnson whisper-cursing at you. </p>
<p>So for less than $20 (or possibly using things you already own) you can now offer substantially more stimuli for your brain to overreact to when you need to get out of bed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually had a light alarm for a year or two.  Made it with full spectrum light bulbs and a timer.  Then I decided to grow plants with it do it went away. </p>
<p>I honestly didn't notice it working though.  </p>
<p>I'm trying &quot;Sleep with android&quot; right now,  it worked the first two days but already adapted to it... woke up 2.5 hours late today &gt;.&lt;;; I think it talked too bit can't remember. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was like this in high school I used one of those extremely loud bell alarms, like the <a href="http://imgur.com/lwGGBOI" target="_blank">old fashioned clock with two bells on top</a>, with no snooze and put it out of reach. It would scare the ever living shit out of me and my adrenaline would keep me awake, it got to the point that my anxiety of not wanting to hear it would cause me to wake a few minutes before it would go off. 15 years later and I can still get up easily to almost any alarm and stay awake. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You seem to know what you're talking about so I will share my experience with you to see if you have some input on this odd scenario that I have experienced several times. </p>
<p>I used to fall asleep regularly to the TV.  On several occasions I have fallen asleep on the couch when staying at family member's homes only to be woken up by the  sound of them talking and making general kitchen noises but was not ready to wake up... so I lay there with my eyes closed in attempts to fall back asleep. This is where the weird part comes in.</p>
<p>After maybe 10-20 minutes of laying there with my eyes closed and listening to their conversations and smelling what <del>the rock</del> they were cooking, I would finally give up and decide to wake up for the day.  Upon opening my eyes I would then realize the TV was still on but could not hear it.  A second or two later the  audio from the TV would slowly fizzle into existence and the volume would slowly get louder and over the course of maybe 4-6 seconds it would get to the volume it was set at.  A few times the volume was really loud yet I still didn't hear it until my eyes registered that it was on.  I could hear the dog walking in the next room over when my eyes were still shut, it's paw pads and claws lightly scraping  the tiles.</p>
<p>This has happened with radios being on and even when I've fallen asleep with one headphone in while listening to podcasts. I laid there thinking the earbud came out in my sleep as it often does, but when I open my eyes and see the ipad to check the time I will finally feel the bud in my ear and the audio will fizzle in.  My brain seems to filter out sounds that are coming from a source that isn't organic but I can hear all these other things going on around me.  </p>
<p>Is that related to what this post is about or is it a completely different thing?  I've never met  anyone that has experienced this other than myself nor have I read about anyone else experiencing anything like it.  I've posted this a few times on reddit but have never gotten a response.  </p>
<p>Anyone have any ideas or know what this phenomenon is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I upvoted your comment hop in someone can give a really educated answer. This fascinates me. The fact that our brains can completely remove something from our awareness makes me wonder what else our brains may be hiding from us. There are some studies showing that certain tribes who have no word for a certain color are unable to even see that color when they are presented with it. Bizarre. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have similar experiences except there is a about a 2-3 second delay before the sound has fully faded back. I've always assumed it was your body's way of helping you asleep. </p></div>		</li>
