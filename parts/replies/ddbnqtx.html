			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in bankruptcy 2006-2009..  The Bankruptcy Machine had everyone and their mommas in College Park, Atlanta, Ga. Filing exactly what u just said. Especially the beauty consultant who left an impression on me by making 15,000 a month &quot; Never proof of her claims on money&quot; and got a 350,000 home within 2 years of the real house note coming for her Money, she was in our office filing and trying to save her Jaguar and home, and neither she could ever afford.. It was the worst job to have, because everybody got problems if they came in our door and seriously taught me all I needed to know about Idiots and Government allowing idiots to get what they cant Afford ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing isn't predatory lending and predatory lending was a very very small portion of the housing crash (and an even smaller portion of the financial crisis).  The people took on those loans because they were using the exact same assumptions that many bankers and investors were using, that housing prices go up indefinitely.</p>
<p>People willingly and gleefully entered into interest-only loans and balloon loans because they, like most people, thought that prices would rise, increasing the equity in the house similar to an amortizing loan.  Allowing either wealth accumulation or the ability to move up the real estate chain without investing non-housing wealth.</p>
<p>People were making very risky but seemingly rational decisions that created rapid wealth accumulation among those that got in before them.  No deception, no coercion, no predation.  Just a bubble fueled by a lack of understanding across all parties involved and misguided social norms.</p>
<p>The real losers of the housing bubble weren't consumers and bankers that (both) were making extremely risky bets.  It was that the people who stayed out of the bullshit and made conservative housing decisions reaped tremendous negative externalities from those who did engage in extreme risk.</p></div>		</li>
