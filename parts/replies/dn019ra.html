			<div class="markdown"><p>I like restoring old tube radios, and you run into this issue often. It's called a &quot;hot chassis.&quot; Old AC plugs were not polarized, so you had a 50/50 shot that the chassis was at line potential even when off.  That's why you always unplug before opening anything up. I always install a modern plug or modify the old one so it's polarized correctly. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If you plugged it in “backward”, the appliance will still turn off but all of the internals will still be live at 120v which could pose a hazard.</p>

<p>I've never understood why this mattered until today. Thank you for explaining this where every other source has failed me. It's like how the hot wire in a light should run through the switch first, so you don't electrocute yourself while changing the bulb. Thank you for explaining this.</p></div>		</li>
