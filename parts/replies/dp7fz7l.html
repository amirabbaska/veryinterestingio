			<div class="markdown"><p>A contact lens isn't exactly stuck to the eye.  It is &quot;floating&quot; in a layer of tears.  So, although the curvature of the lens and the curvature of the cornea hold the lens on the cornea, it is free to rotate about its axis.  Toric lenses are weighted so they rotate to the heavy-side-down orientation.  This aligns the optical qualities of the lens to correct the patients astigmatism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>when you have astigmatism, your cornea is either thicker or thinner along a certain axis than the rest of itself.  imagine the basketball has deflated a bit, and all the air squished into the middle so that only the sides are a bit flattened.</p>
<p>this means the contact also has a corresponding thickness/thinness so that the result is a perfect sphere for the light rays to travel through.</p>
<p>toric lenses, shaped this way, either fit or don't fit, based on how close the parameters can be brought to you actual cornea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe a basketball isn't the best analogy as the eye isn't a perfect sphere. The fact that the curvature of the cornea differs from the curvature of the rest of the eye makes that the lens stays in place. Maybe you could compare it to an american football? </p></div>		</li>
