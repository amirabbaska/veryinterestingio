			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an important point, and relevant to OP's question.</p>
<p>Mature car markets, like the U.S. or Europe, tend to have a relatively small number of manufacturers; over the years, companies go bust when they are unable to hold their own against bigger competitors, or the brands are bought up by larger companies and then cancelled when they prove to be unprofitable. Hummer, Mercury, Oldsmobile, Packard, Plymouth, Pontiac, Rambler, Saturn, and Studebaker are just a few examples of marques that used to be sold on the U.S. market but are now defunct.</p>
<p>In new markets like China, there are still lots of brands that are competing against one another to get a toe hold: BYD, Dongfeng, FAW, SAIC, Lifan, Chana, Geely, Chery, Hafei, JAC, Great Wall, Roewe, and a dozen others, alongside all the major international carmakers. Presumably at some point there will be a consolidation process on the Chinese market as well.</p></div>		</li>
