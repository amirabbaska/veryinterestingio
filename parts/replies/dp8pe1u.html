			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to add that contrary to popular belief, unless you have high blood pressure, salt is not bad for you at all. None. All the low sodium stuff is a gimmick for a normal person. In fact, one of the things recommended for a person with low blood pressure is to increase their salt intake before trying to rely on medications.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just two days ago me and my mum were talking about salt, so out of interest I weighed out 6g of salt, which is the gda in the U.K.  it looked like really a lot of salt, way more than I would expect the body to want. It has made me considerably more relaxed about salting foods properly </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cafeteria at my old job used practically no salt to make it &quot;healthy&quot;. I talked to one of the chefs and he said people still complained on a daily basis that the food was too salty. Always the same few people. Everything was so bland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt may not be bad for somebody with normal blood pressure, but hypertension and pre-hypertension are two of the some of the common health issues in the world. According to the CDC 32% of americans (that's about 75 million) have hypertension. Another 33% have pre-hypertension. A lot of people have it any don't even know it.</p>
<p>That's pretty much 66% of Americans having blood pressure issues. More and more studies are showing people under 30 having hypertension or pre-hypertension. Furthermore, studies are indicating pre-hypertension by 30 is becoming an indicator for future heart disease and stroke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing people often don't realize about regular table salt (sodium) is that it is meant to be in balance woth potassium and magnesium.  </p>
<p>If you have lots of sodium and low potassium or magnesium (and vice versa) you will have all sorts of issues with blood pressure, cramps, heart palpatations, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Younger people with hypertension is more a sign of inactivity. Fewer people do daily exercise in their jobs than before. 20 years ago the labor force was doing active things, now most jobs involve sitting at a desk, and inactivity causes high blood pressure.</p>
<p>Salt-sensitivity, aka, people who may find their blood pressure being elevated due to large sodium intake, is something seen in just <strong>15%</strong> of the population (and in 30% of people with documented hypertension). Therefore nearly 9 out of 10 people don't have to worry about salt. However if you have documented hypertension, then there's a 30% chance you're one of the unlucky 1 in 10 that has to watch their salt (and doctors will test for this).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>A couple years ago, I adopted a low carb/keto diet and cut most common processed foods out of my diet.  (highly recommend it).</p>
<p>But without all that stuff (bread, pasta, junk food etc.) I need to add salts to my diet.  I put sodium and potassium salts on most of my food, including in my coffee.  It makes things taste great.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably worth noting that some canned/preserved foods have other sodium compounds added â€“ like sodium nitrite: it prevents botulism and rancidity and can help add taste and color to some canned foods. It's not table salt, but it's sodium.</p></div>		</li>
