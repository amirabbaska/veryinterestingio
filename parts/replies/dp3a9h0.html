			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, but you would need an extremely high temperature to achieve that. So high that I'm not sure if the silicon would be solid in the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When carbon based compounds burn completely they make CO2 but the combustion is not always perfect because carbon can form relatively stable bounds with itself. Silicon on the other hand is very reactive especially with oxygen at high heat and will make predominantly silicon oxide aka glass. There probably be some silicon left over but more likely glass.</p></div>		</li>

Absorb is passage of particles in the intestine through intestinal wall into blood.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that's not solid carbon. Is only partially burned, so you now have a bunch of new compounds that weren't in the original food and aren't present in properly cooked foods either. At least, not in significant quantities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been a while since Ive taken a chem class, so let me know if I miss something. Generally, combustion formulae follow the pattern: Hydrocarbon + O2 ==&gt; CO2 + H2O. The products (water and carbon dioxide) are typically in a gaseous state, so the remaining blackened material is usually a mix of non-combusted hyrdocarbons, impurities from the original reactants (not actually a reactant but was mixed in with then), as well as normal carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The by-products actually depend on the amount of O2 present in the reaction. If the reaction occurs in a high oxygen environment, the by-products are CO2 and H20; if the reaction occurs in a moderately oxygenated environment, the by-products are CO and H20; and if the reaction occurs in a low oxygen environment you just get C and H20, and the reaction is barely exothermic (and will eventually go out).</p>
<p>Of course in reality (outside of bomb calorimeters), such molar ratios are never met exactly, so a combination of all three occurs.</p></div>		</li>
