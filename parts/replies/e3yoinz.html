<p>melanoma</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a name <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma" target="_blank">for skin cancer</a>, for those unaware. </p>
<p>Please take the exposure to sun seriously, particularly those who prefer active lifestyles, such as cyclists and runners. Those tan lines mark the history of your body fighting against potential cancer. Read up on it and book a visit to a dermatologist if you have any concerns. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the primary source for Vitamin D is sunlight on the skin.  There is emerging evidence that chronic Vitamin D deficiency contributes to a number of long-term chronic health problems, including potentially breast and prostate cancers (which kill far more people than melanoma).  So while melanoma is scary, people in general suffer more health issues from a lack of sun on the skin than by too much.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3hZ9P8GmLs" target="_blank">See this video with Ivor Cummins for more details</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note also that there is increasing evidence that sun exposure to the eyes prevents nearsightedness. both <a href="https://iovs.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2466239" target="_blank">observational studies on humans</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5233810/" target="_blank">experimental studies on animal models</a> find that exposure to sunlight during childhood development, specifically violet light, lowers the incidence and severity of myopia. in rhesus monkeys, <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127863" target="_blank">it was found</a> that about 3 hours of sunlight a day was sufficient to affect eye growth to a significant degree over spending all day under artificial light. </p>
<p>if you have children in your life, make sure that they get to spend several hours outside in the sun each day. Doesn't have to be direct sunlight, sitting in partial shade should be okay, but they need time outside. Have them wear a mild sunscreen if you're worried about them getting a sunburn (use the lowest SPF you can find), and introduce them to the sun gradually so that their skin has enough time to adapt and increase melanin production to compensate. If they have a lot homework, allow them a break after school to be outside more, and have them do their homework outside if it's warm. Petition your school board to increase the length of recess and outdoor phys-ed classes, and use evidence to back up your points. Developing children need exposure to sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A healthy balance proves to be the best option once again, it seems.</p>
<p>I personally have a dog in this, since I am a cyclist and it worries me that cycling culture considers &quot;sharp tan lines&quot; as a mark of certain pride. I've spent about 350 hours last year riding under a scorching sun and I am not anywhere close to a real enthusiast of the sport to begin with. This kind of exposure is way beyond what a normal people experience, even with tanning at the beaches, I should think. </p>
<p>I think there is a serious lack of education about those things. Too often I get made fun of when I bring this topic up when talking to farmer and cyclist lobster-like friends. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also take vitamin D supplements. In northern hemispheres where there is virtually no sunlight for 4-6 months of the year, they are vital. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot; The burden of occupationally-related cutaneous malignant melanoma in Britain due to solar radiation&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; Assuming a causal link, we estimate that 2% of all CMM [cutaneous malignant melanoma] in Britain can be attributed to occupational exposure to solar radiation, giving ∼1 death and 5 new cancers per week. The construction industry has the largest burden (44% of the deaths and 42% of the registrations), followed by agriculture, public administration/defence, and land transport. These results add to the concern arising from our previous estimate for NMSC of the adverse health effects of occupational solar radiation (AF=2.4%, 12 attributable deaths and 1541 attributable registrations; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2016437#ref17" target="_blank">Young et al, 2012</a>). Our estimation by age has highlighted the issue of many similar long latency occupational cancers occurring many years after leaving work. &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Second this. I’ve had two spots removed (about 40 stitches total) due to them being pre-melanoma. I rarely go outside for any real length of time, and I’m super pale. My dermatologist said that those spots could have been caused at any time, like a day at the beach as a baby. He also told me when looking at spots, ugly duckling test. If you have a spot that looks different than others (I have freckles) than have it looked at. I’ve had three spots biopsied, and two were removed before they became cancerous. </p></div>		</li>
