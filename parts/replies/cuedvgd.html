			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a very interesting thought. And while I am definitely not the best person for this question, my initial thought on the idea of using a satellite or object orbiting another, I have a feeling to harness the energy It has, you would then cancel out its ability to orbit and it would simply collide with what it was orbiting due to gravity pulling on the object with no velocity. I'll check out some research and let you know on that if I find anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically yes but no one has the slightest idea how to access the energy of the system and it's very possible the entire planet combined wouldnt have the resources to do engineering on that scale.  It's far-scifi.</p>
<p>However that said, tidal power is extracting energy from the moon... just very inefficiently when you consider how much water the moon is dragging around the earth all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about a giant ring made of a conductor that wrapped around the equator of both the moon and the earth? Wouldn't that make the earth the coil in turbine generator? It's still far-fetched sci-fi, but it would just require a very large large amount of conductive material and assembly in pieces like the ISS.</p>
<p>If that's presently outlandish,  I call dibs on writing the scifi novel about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. You could theoretically harvest the energy of earths orbit around the sun. This loss of energy would cause a tighter orbit.</p>
<p>The tides on earth actually transfer energy to the moon! The moon gets slightly further away as its orbit gets bigger and the earths rotation slows down proportionally. When we harvest tidal energy, were actually &quot;stealing&quot; that potential energy from the moon and its orbit doesn't expand as much as it would have had we not harvested the energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if we figured out how to harness tidal energy efficiently, would that potentially slow the moon's orbit; and slippery slope into the moon losing its velocity and crashing into the earth? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While friction and other factors make it impractical, it is possible lift an object and realize more energy than it took to lift it there. There are tiny changes in gravity caused by the moon, so you can exploit that by lifting and lowering weights depending on where it is in orbit relative to your position.</p>

<p>Same can be done with the sun with even more minuscule changes in gravity / potential energy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For all practical purposes and actually gaining usable energy in the process this is completely void of usefulness. Although technically you are correct. I figure it would also be extremely difficult to get timing right with these drops that depend on gravitational pull outside of the atmosphere. I may be wrong on that though.</p></div>		</li>
