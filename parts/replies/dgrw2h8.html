			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are misunderstanding his question.  I think he is trying to say that the two bodies of different radius are in a closed system and initially at the same Temperature T.</p>
<p>Stefan-Boltzman says the power emitted by radiation is proportional to A*T^4 .</p>
<p>I believe his confusion results from assuming all the radiative heat emitted from body 1 must go into body 2 and vice versa. This is not true. The large body has a larger surface area, but also a larger view factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this thought experiment breaks down since any energy reradiated from the non-fixed blackbody would be refocused the the emitting black body which (in the case of non-fixed temperature) would heat up from the additional energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That line of reasoning is not productive, since by picking a small body (earth) with a low heat capacity and the large body with a high heat capacity, we can still get the small body to become hotter than the large body.</p>
<p>The proper answer is that it is not possible to focus the power from the sun onto a smaller area than the sun itself with mirrors of any shape.</p></div>		</li>
