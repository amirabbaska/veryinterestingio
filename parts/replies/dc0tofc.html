<p>Since the two legs on the LED that supply the power are connected to the microcontroller and not the LED elements a current limit resistor is not required.</p>

<p>This doesn't make sense to me. Surely there would be very little resistance between the VCC pin, GND pin and the LED so a large current would try to flow and fry the microcontroller, unless the microcontroller has some built in protection? (maybe a large resistor internally connected to the GND pin, but that would effect the brightness of the LED and could easily be too high of a resistance to brightly light an LED)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microcontrollers just don't source very much current. If you hooked up a heavy load you could probably fry it but a single LED is pretty low load so it just sips whatever current it can get (<a href="http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/ArduinoPinCurrentLimitations" target="_blank">~30 mA on an Arduino.</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When an output says it can source 30mA that means that is all you can safely take from it. Unless the output has an internal current limiting resistor then giving it a heavy load (i.e. a low resistance) will mean you pull more current from it and then you <em>will</em> fry it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Including formatting, it took about 30 seconds.</p>
<p>For what it's worth, I knew how they worked before I posted. I just didn't want to type it up. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>White LEDs are interesting too. They aren't white.</p>
<p>The LED is actually either blue or UV, with a yellow or orange phosphor covering it. The blue/UV light from the LED is absorbed by the phosphor which then fluoresces and emits a yellow/orange light. The combination of the blue-ish and orange-ish lights makes a light that looks white to the human eye. By carefully mixing the ratios you can choose the colour temperature of the 'white' light, making it a cool or warm white.</p></div>		</li>
