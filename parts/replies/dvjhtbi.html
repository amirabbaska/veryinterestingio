			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually very interesting math that interprets what a point is. This subtopic of math is called differential geometry and also in the field of topology. I have yet study them but there is a whole set of explanations on how to interpret the real space minus one point on the graph.</p>
<p>You are right, &quot;physical&quot; realizable things in the universe all have nonzero dimension. However it makes you wonder (if you do physics) why are we allowed to think of point particles especially forces that are stronger the closer you go to the center. While not physically realizeable, it explains the very well. I want to get into Gauss' Law and the divergence theorem but maybe someone else can chip in better (I'm too iffy in differential geometry).</p></div>		</li>
