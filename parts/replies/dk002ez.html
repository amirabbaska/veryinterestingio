			<div class="markdown"><p>There was an Ars Technica article a year or two ago that highlighted a guy whose research suggested that allergenic substances are actually harmful when not combated - there was a study in rats comparing presence or absence of allergy-causing antibodies, and the rats with no allergies were much worse off. Any thoughts on this?</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>It was harder to see how natural selection could have produced allergies. Reacting to harmless things with a huge immune response probably wouldnâ€™t have aided the survival of our ancestors. Allergies are also strangely selective. Only some people have allergies, and only some substances are allergens. Sometimes people develop allergies relatively late in life; sometimes childhood allergies disappear. And for decades, nobody could even figure out what IgE was for. It showed no ability to stop any virus or bacteria. It was as if we evolved one special kind of antibody just to make us miserable.</p>
<p>One early clue came in 1964. A parasitologist named Bridget Ogilvie was investigating how the immune system repelled parasitic worms, and she noticed that rats infected with worms produced large amounts of what would later be called IgE. Subsequent studies revealed that the antibodies signaled the immune system to unleash a damaging assault on the worms.</p>

<p>this article is fitting for the current discussion.  I recommend <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2015/04/why-do-we-have-allergies/" target="_blank">reading the rest</a> if you are inclined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Allergic reactions do have a survival advantage; the problem is when they either A) react to non-harmful stimulii (such as pollen) or B) overreact to harmful stimulii (like a bee sting).</p>
<p>Septic shock is much the same thing - the underlying system is actually important, but septic shock is bad, when the system overreacts and kills the person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, and I'm glad someone made it, but that's only true for some developed countries.
On that note, I think the research into allergy therapy where they infect someone with severe allergies with worms so their IgE fights off that instead of an allergen is pretty neat. I'm not sure where the research is on that, but I think it's really interesting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here hoping to see an IgE/immunology answer at the top. Instead, I see some very general answer about how pollen allergies wont prevent sexual reproduction and wont be removed from the gene pool. You're answer is far better and more in depth than the top voted comment. Thank you. </p></div>		</li>
