			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but whatever the limit is it is quite high.  The amount of energy focused by a x-laser <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-05-world-powerful-x-ray-laser-molecular.html" target="_blank">is hard to overstate</a>.  The one the US military was planning as part of ballistic missile defense <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_pumped_laser" target="_blank">uses a nuclear explosion to &quot;pump&quot; the beam</a>. </p>
<p>So the limit is very high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can choose other reference frames to increase energy and power - without limit. There are engineering limits, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We generally talk about the power of a laser, not its energy. This has to do with intensity. Intensity, or brightness in our experience, represents how dense a light is. You can take a normal green/red light that we use in our pointers and start burning thru wood with the same colors at higher intensities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't the frequency make a difference for which materials it would interact with? Say for a cutting laser or something? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it does, since materials' optical properties (e.g. dielectric function, refractive index..) change with the frequency. That's why we can use Drude model or Lorentz model to estimate these values.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, would it be possible to use it as a sort of cutting laser, that would, for example, not cut human flesh, but <em>would</em> cut through bone? </p>
<p>Idk why youd want that particular example, but could it be used that way?</p></div>		</li>
