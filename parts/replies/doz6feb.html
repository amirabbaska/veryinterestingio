			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically all of normal orbital mechanics doesn't work within 3X of the schwarzschild radius of the black hole.  An Elliptical orbit that went lower than the Photon Sphere would not keep gaining speed relative to its orbit, it would be losing velocity. </p>
<p>The Potential/Kinetic energy relationship is broken within 3X of the schwarzschild radius, circular orbits are not stable. Instead of gaining velocity as you get closer to the well, you loose velocity.  This means any very small change (which happen to all things constantly) will cause you to fall in or escape.</p>
<p>Within the Photon Sphere this is much more severe.  You cannot have a velocity that is above light speed in the first place, so there is no apoapsis at all.  That would require you to be at a higher velocity than the current circular orbital speed, as the current circular orbital speed doesn't exist you cannot escape without expending work to move away from the black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't that phrase a little redundant? The black hole's radius is the same as its schawzchild radius, because it's a black hole. Couldn't you just say 'radius of the black hole'? I admit I don't know much about these things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Ah, I can answer this: the Schwarzschild metric only works for a non-rotating black hole, but it's still approximately true for slowly rotating black holes.</p>
<p>When a black hole rotates very quickly, it becomes more and more necessary to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric" target="_blank">Kerr metric</a>, where a lot of the details change pretty dramatically. I don't know exactly how they change though, which is what I wanted to know about.</p>
<p>(there's more metrics for when the black hole is strongly charged, too)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The odds of a black hole forming without significant rotation is vanishingly low, but non-rotating non-charged (Schwarzschild) black holes are very simple to calculate compared to rotating and charged (Kerr-Newman) black holes. </p>
<p>(There's also charged non-rotating and non-charged rotating)</p>
<p>But for understanding MOST things about a black hole, Schwarzschild black holes are perfectly sufficient. But, when you're talking about dipping parts of an object into the atmosphere of a Kerr black hole, Newman or not, there's some weird shit you can pull, like the Penrose Process, which incidentally, was sort of what was portrayed in Interstellar when they did a slingshot around the black hole. </p>
<p>So, simply put, normally whether or not a black hole is rotating or not doesn't matter unless you're trying to extract rotational energy from the ergosphere.</p></div>		</li>
