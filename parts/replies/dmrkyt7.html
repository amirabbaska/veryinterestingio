			<div class="markdown"><p>I am trying to explain this from information for a college biology class I took almost 20 years ago so if I get a portion wrong feel free to correct me.  Especially since I have nothing sourced.  Capsaicin can be good for you or bad depending on amount.   Peppers have wonderful health properties, but for people with Ulcers most GI doctors warn to stay away from eating spicy food.  They have linked lower risks of some cancers to spicy peppers.  That said capsaicin is reactive causing a heat sensation to the skin, eyes, stomach, and certain receptors to the tongue.  There are sensors on the tongue that not much can get to.  A micro thin layer of tongue protects it. That thin layer works as a bouncer for almost every thing, only letting small amounts of the flavor parts past at a time, basically preventing over stimulation of your tastes.  Think of capsaicin as the VIP of the tongue.  They don't wait in line.  The bouncer doesn't even try to slow their entrance.  It gets onto those very sensitive sensors with absolutely no interference.  So think of something too bitter or too sweet.  It gives a sensation on your tongue of a slight burning.  That is those sensors becoming too stimulated too fast.  Because there is a limit to the protective layer.  Well now imagine a pepper with tons of capsaicin that basically puts the thin layer out of commission.  It also helps sneak in the bitter and sweet, and salt in.  So not only does it react to skin with a heat sensation, but it enhances the flavor profile of every thing along for the ride.  Suddenly your tongue tastes sensors is being trampled on.  Now think to when you lose a few too many layers of skin from a rug burn or something.  Your brains natural response to a nerve being touch that is over stimulated to be painful.  That is why even touching your skinned knee with a finger tap results in a painful sensation.  That same reason is why your tongue is so reactive to heat and the pepper taste.  So its not that its necessarily had for you that causes you pain in the mouth.  It is that it has no interference from the layer of your body that dampens information to the nerves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Slowly and with patience, but the butthole does respond well to training.</p></div>		</li>
