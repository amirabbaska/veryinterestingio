			<div class="markdown"><p>Mosquitos have decided they like me for a number of reasons, and I got tired of smelling like bug spray so I sought out to rid them if my back patio so I can smoke in peace. There's a number of plants that they don't like, and I chose marigolds and some grass that repels them and have thay growing around my patio. In addition, I have an essential oil diffuser on my patio that I either use lemongrass or citronella, both that mosquitoes hate. That coupled with a mosquito candle/torch from Wal-Mart basically rid them from my patio. The second I step into the garden, they're all over me, but at least now I can take the woofer out or smoke and relax without them assaulting me. Fuck mosquitos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If this is helpful in your day-to-day, there's a fly spray for horses that is made with marigolds. It's made for horses but is safe and useful for peoples, babies, doggos, whomever. It smells nice, too! Strongly recommend. </p>

<p>Many developed countries have eradicated Malaria through genetically modified mosquito programs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, there are plenty of papers out that that suggest releasing enough sterile male mosquitos could eradicate them.  I dont know if its ever been put into practice though.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are programmed to become sterile after a certain number of generations I believe, we won't se the effects until a couple of years IIRC</p>
<p>The idea is to genetically modify a dominant sterility gene into the genome of the mosquitos and then wait for most of the mosquitos to have the gene that makes their dicks not work anymo</p>
<p>IMO it's scary as fuck. Think of what the next Genocide will do with this technology.</p></div>		</li>
