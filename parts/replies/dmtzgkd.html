<blockquote>
<p>Mars has icy polar caps which can be very useful for obtaining water on a new colony. The Moon has no ice.</p>

<p>The moon does contain water ice. <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/ice/ice_moon.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mars may have once had a magnetic field similar to Earth and if we can find a cause for why it stopped, we may in the distant future be able to &quot;fix it&quot;. The moon has no metal core.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moon does contain metal at it's core. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_structure_of_the_Moon" target="_blank">Source</a> . </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mars has an atmosphere and, as thin as it may be, it still protects against radiation from space. The moon's atmosphere barely exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Martian atmosphere has no bearing on protecting angainst solar radiation. The moon lies within Earth's magnetic field. You will receive more radiation on Mars. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>As missions progress outside of low Earth orbit and away from the protection of Earth's magnetic shielding, the radiation exposures that astronauts face change to include higher exposure to the full galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectrum and solar particle events (SPE). <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2010SW000572/full" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If astronauts do receive any protection it will come from the Martian magnetic field which doesn't exist. <a href="http://www.space.dtu.dk/english/Research/Universe_and_Solar_System/magnetic_field" target="_blank">Source</a>. So astronauts are exposed to more radiation on Mars than the Moon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine you're probably correct, but I don't know enough about what's wrong with reddit in general to be sure if you're right. It really is uncertainty all the way down. </p>
<p>Still, the best way to find the right answer on the internet is usually to post the wrong one. If you dig through the comments a bit, someone has usually corrected any errors that may be in the top comments. Combine that with a little research of your own, using the comments as a starting point, and I think you can usually get to a pretty accurate picture of whatever the topic may be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the risk of getting tagged for the iamverysmart subreddit: This is why, as a career scientist (yes, with PhD after my name) I tend to opt out of threads that are close to my specialty.</p>
<p>There's a lot of outright wrong stuff that gets upvoted. There's also stuff that isn't necessarily wrong, but it's only accurate in so far as the broad generalizations on a topic you get as a first or second year undergrad.</p>
<p>As an expert you end up with &quot;well, sort of, but it really works like this&quot; explanations that then seem to anger the reddit hivemind because you actually do need to write a bit of a wall of text to explain why the simplistic answer isn't really the correct one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure that's only the case part of the time.</p>
<p>The moon orbits between 225k miles and 252k miles away from earth. <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/" target="_blank">https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/moon-distance/en/</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea of an airship type city or research station on Venus is interesting, but carries with it a very high risk of catastrophic failure, and there are no local materials you can use in construction.  There isn't really any true colonization potential for Venus.</p>
<p>Mars has resources on the ground that can be used for construction.  The risk of catastrophic failure is far less and there is the potential to fix things if they go wrong (you're not going to be able to do that with an airship falling into caustic clouds hot enough to melt lead).</p>
<p>Mars is also a gateway to the outer Solar System, Venus is only a gateway to Mercury and the sun.</p>
<p>Mars also has two moons that could be useful in a number of ways (the smaller one could be moved and used as the anchor point for a space elevator at some point in the future), especially as way-points and sources of raw materials.</p>
<p>Mars also has the potential to tell us about the origins of life, if it existed there.  If life ever existed on Venus all records of it would likely have been destroyed and would be inaccessible anyway down on the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TBH, it might actually be easier to build a colony on Mercury than Venus. There's places around the poles which never get direct sunlight, which would allow you to build there in the shade, and then set up solar panels up above. From a practical standpoint, Mercury is incredibly metallic, which means lots of good ore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way we can use the planets Mercury and Venus to benefit mankind is by using their gravity wells to orbit and manipulate satellites and telescopes to observe our solar system in (light speed delayed) real-time from the opposite side of the sun.</p>
<p>This might help us catalogue and identify potential Earth-striking asteroids or dead comets.</p>
<p>Arthur C. Clarke also suggested using Mercury to map every object in the solar system in his novel, Hammer of God.  TLDR plant a giant nuclear microwave bomb on Mercury, wait till it's on the other side of the sun, trigger it and map the returning energy from every object in the solar system down to 1m.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury is a bitch to reach, though.</p>
<p>From LEO, landing on the moon takes ~6000 m/s Δv.</p>
<p>Landing on Mars takes <em>less</em>, somewhere between 4500 and 5500, because you can use its atmosphere to brake and land. Since Venus is closer and has more atmosphere, it's easier still, about 4000 m/s are enough.</p>
<p>Mercury is a total nightmare: It's very far away <em>and</em> has no atmosphere, so you need about <em>16000</em> m/s Δv to land. It's easier to land on <strong>Titan</strong> (~12000 m/s, yay atmosphere!) than it is to land on Mercury!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Same in LEO, but we've &quot;colonized&quot; that.  Early Mars settlements aren't going to have any more infrastructure than anywhere else in space.  We are going to be sending prebuilt modules anywhere; we ain't going to be building a concrete plant in phase 1.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're using &quot;colonized&quot; in an extremely loose manner.</p>
<p>You don't need concrete, on Mars you can dig in, or at least pile material up to protect prefab modules.</p>
<p>Realistically buried or partially covered structure will be the way to go on Mars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>What I don't understand is the complete disinterest in colonising Venus. If you get up about 100km above the ground it's one of the most Earth-like environments we've ever found outside our planet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because Venus sucks.</p>
<p>First off, building a floating colony is terrible because you don't have dirt. That's just... bad. You might as well just build a space station at that point - zero gravity would be much more useful for manufacturing, and you'd have the same amount of resources. No resources = no reason to build a colony + great inconvenience.</p>
<p>Secondly, at high altitudes, Venus has tornado-force winds all the time. Building a structure on land which can survive tornado force winds is bad enough.</p>
<p>Thirdly, 50C is deathly hot. Dumping heat is harder than warming up from cold. This is a huge power drain, as everything has to be air conditioned, and you can't have failures because if you do, people will succumb pretty fast.</p>
<p>Fourth, Venus is dry. The water in its atmosphere was mostly lost to the sun. Water is a very important resource.</p>
<p>Fifth, power. If you float around the dark side of Venus (the atmosphere goes around the planet in about four days at that altitude) you have no solar power for two days straight, and then are stuck in the sun for two days straight. Either you have to constantly be pushing back against tornado-force winds to stay on the sunny side of the planet, or be okay with having no sun (and thus, no solar power) for days at a time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Phoenix AZ checked in, can confirm.</p>
<p>Recommend colonizing Venus first with blue-green algae.</p></div>		</li>
