			<div class="markdown"><p>Also would like to point out that many Americans feel we had to bail France out of WWI, WWII, and Vietnam while our media played many videos of French people bashing Americans during the 2000's. Now I think we just don't really care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there seems to be a stigma in the US that the French think they're better than us, leading us to not be as friendly towards them. I would expect my government to defend France if attacked, but I'd be lying if I didnt say their government definitely rubbed me the wrong way sometimes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean we did bail out France in WW2 and Vietnam. </p>
<p>WW2 either Germany or the Soviet Union would have been in control.</p>
<p>Vietnam we took over the war.</p>
<p>WW1 is different we definitely tipped the scales towards Germany losing. Seeing your enemy suddenly get 1 million troops on your border makes things pretty rough if not impossible while already being depleted.</p></div>		</li>
