			<div class="markdown"><p>The sad thing is a lot of employers incentivize people too through matching contributions. Most employers at minimum will match 3% of what you pay in. So if you contribute 10%, its actually 13% (free money) with the company match. And yet people still don't invest. I used to audit retirement plans at a Big 4 firm and I can't tell you how many 50 and 60 somethings have literally $0 in their 401K. And the younger crowd isn't doing much better. Obviously they have more time to change this, but a lot of young people opt to not invest in their plans too in return for a higher paycheck. That's how you have no retirement savings and end up in a crappy assisted living home when you retire. So kids, please invest. The recommended annual savings rate is 10-15% of your paycheck to your 401K alone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: 10-15% minimum of your paycheck to <em>retirement</em>, not specifically to your 401k (and in fact most people would be better off dropping only as much of that into the 401k to get the full employer match, and then putting the rest into a personal IRA for better fund choices before finally coming back if you still have $ left over). Dropping that full amount into your 401k is certainly way better than nothing, but for most people there's some easy things you can invest in first after matching that will return better in the long run.</p>
<p>Sorry, r/personalfinance goer here and your statement was bugging me slightly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries. I've always heard 10-15% in the 401K (max $18.5K annually), maximum into the IRA ($5.5K annually), 3-6 months savings in cash (I do closer to 12), then play around with a brokerage, and anything after that just have fun with and travel. That's what I do. Should I be reallocating lol? </p></div>		</li>
