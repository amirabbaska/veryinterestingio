			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious, maybe you know. Obviously they come from the ground, but have never seen a dirty shell. How are they cleaned? Can't picture washing them in water and even then, would expect some dirt left behind once in awhile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shells are made with molded plant fiber (usually soy) in a factory next to the peanut processing plant. The peanuts, which grow on trees, are placed into the shell halves before sealing. Most popular are the two- and three-peanut products, but at my plant we throw in some ones and fours for variety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are the other uses for peanut shells? I could see some scrap/re-use ways of getting rid of the shells, but it almost sounds like the shells are the primary resource and the peanuts are the scrap from your comment...</p></div>		</li>
