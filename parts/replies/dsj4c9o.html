			<div class="markdown"><p>All someone needs is an antenna and a program designed to capture mobile data to capture it.  It's easy-peasy to capture a signal and rebroadcast it, or to even make a device that pretends to be a mobile signal and gets you to talk to it instead of a real network (so it ca sit in the middle and look at and modify anything you send or receive)</p>
<p>What keeps things secure is that the signals used for mobile data are encoded in a way that it's not super easy to decode it without the correct key, and most programs that work over mobile data should also encrypt their data(for instance, HTTPS websites as opposed to HTTP websites), which adds another layer of protection.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For some reason this reminded me of a really old spongebob episode where squidward gets in the middle of spongebob and patrick's bubble conversation. I thought the comparison was fitting as an ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you could technically just pick up data signals, you would need the data bits of the receiving sim card to accept it. Mobile phones do not operate like FM radio. Your phone does not have a specific frequency it operates at. Instead, your phone receives hundreds of signals but denies all but what it is coded to receive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not so hard to intercept the data. To my knowledge it is also easier to do it for 3G than it is for 4G. The point is that you are using secured protocols to send the data such as HTTPS so even if the attacker gains acces to your data he/she can not read it. So I think problem is not mobile data it self but poor judgement of secure and legitimate services. But if you have bluetooth or some another connections they can be exploited aswell and are probably more convenient way to gain acces to your mobile device.</p>
<p>Sorry for probably bad English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree. I would argue that 4G is easier since it contains more &quot;data&quot; thus traveling over the internet more. Unless someone is going to plug directly  into the Node B (Cell Tower) or  to the Radio Network Controller (RNC also called a BSC in 2G networks) it is very hard to &quot;hack&quot; a 3G  signal. No one would since 99% of the back end is barely encrypted. Bonus credit for the most part the following is true:</p>
<p>2G = GSM and EDGE
3G = UMTS, HSPA, AND CDMA
4G = HSPA+ and LTE. (Which I could argue both are really like a 3.8G but eh).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><h2>Analog Systems</h2>
<p>For analog systems (think AM or FM radio or old school television), the frequencies licensed to radio stations by the FCC are separated by an amount so that two adjacent (on the spectrum) stations won't interfere with each other. Also, harmonics of used frequencies aren't usually used. (A harmonic is another broadcast frequency which is a multiple or even divisor of the frequency you're broadcasting at. If you're broadcasting at 10mhz, then 20mhz and 5mhz are harmonics.)</p>
<p>If there is wavelength interference, it'll degrade the signal you're trying to watch (it'll look/sound like static). For the most part, it's no big deal. Analog systems don't care about signal noise too much.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> (for analog): they avoid the issue rather than dealing with it.</p>
<h2>Digital Systems</h2>
<p>For digital systems (like wifi, GSM, or LTE), what they say is &quot;2.4ghz&quot; is actually hundreds of separate frequencies ranges centered around 2.4ghz. Each device will negotiate with the base station when to broadcast and on which frequency. If there's interference, the digital protocol will detect it with parity checking, and data checksum systems. For 2-way digital communication, if a particular set of data (a packet) is damaged, the device or base station will request a retransmit of that packet. Since this takes time, this effectively slows the throughput of the datastream. Essentially, the more interference, the slower your connection. Because of the data integrity checks, the data is always 100% correct even if there's interference.</p>
<p>For broadcast digital, there is no upstream to the base station so there's not retransmit requests from the device... so there's no error checking. If there's interference, the whole picture and/or sound scrambles until the interference allows data through again or the device indicates it has no signal.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> (for digital): they design around interference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was a great video about this on YouTube that went into the user input from a human all the way down through the OS -&gt; software -&gt; hardware (logic gates etc), over the wire and back up. Presented it in an interesting way too, wish I could remember it!</p>

<p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly sure harmonics are only integer multiples of the fundamental, so they can never be lower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any signal can be decomposed into a sum of sine waves of different frequencies using what's called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform" target="_blank">Fourier Transform</a>. </p>
<p>This is a very powerful tool, that allowed us to understand that it is possible to filter out the sine waves we don't want, and we only end up with the desired signal.</p>
<p>The &quot;overall&quot; signal in the environment is a mess of wifi, radio, cell phones, etc. But we can always filter the frequency we want. </p>
<p>Also, antennas themselves act as a filter. The rule of thumb is that the length must be 1/2 or 1/4 of the wavelength of the signal (around 8cm for a half wavelength 2.4GHz wifi antenna).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually depends. The wavelengths for TV and cellular are, for instance, separated into different frequency bands. </p>
<p>Within each band, things can be done different. For instance, TV and radio are divided into channels that sit on different frequencies. This is FDMA -- frequency division multiple access. </p>
<p>On the other hand, some (old) cellular networks use TDMA: time division multiple access. In that tech, each transmitter is allotted a particular 'time slot' and so don't interfere with each other. This is like using a walkie-talkie, everyone gets a turn but you can't speak while someone else is talking.  </p>
<p>Yet other solutions are CDMA (used in 3G cell networks), which uses sets of non-overlapping codes so that even though the radio waves are interfering, you can discard the noise. This is where the analogies fail me, since it's not really like anything. </p>
<p>Yet other solutions are OFDMA, which is kind of like a combination of FDMA and CDMA, and used for the uplink part of 4G/LTE networks. </p></div>		</li>
