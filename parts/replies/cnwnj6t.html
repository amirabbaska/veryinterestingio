<p>The regulation should be that all cables end with a USB so that you don't have to buy new bricks/car adapters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's actually the point.  The idea was that it creates a great deal of electronic waste for people to throw away their old phone chargers whenever they upgrade, mostly from the AC brick itself.  But that was back in the mid '00s.  In the intervening years, the industry kind of gravitated towards the current modular system we use now (separate AC adapter and cable), which more or less eliminated the issue.  People just upgrade their cables, and keep the USB power brick.</p>
<p>This law has a couple of issues.  Like that it specifically calls for a USB standard that's going to be obsolete soon.  And that it ignores the modular nature of modern phone chargers.  I think their heart was in the right place though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, that sucks.  I think part of the problem is that the USB 1.1/2.0 specs just don't carry enough power to adequately supply some modern devices.  Theoretically USB 3 and 3.1 are fixing that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember <a href="http://www.electronichealing.co.uk/resources/Image/Minigorilla_kit.jpg" target="_blank">these</a>? The reason most phones have micro USB today is because of the EU laws. Not the other way around. The reason I chose a Nokia for my first phone was partly because you could always find a charger, everyone had one. It used to be a part of the competition between companies, but then EU was like, that's a waste, and made USB the standard. Only apple didn't follow suit.
In the end, the point is also interchangeability and reusability. It doesn't matter much if apple has its own connector, because its such a juggernaut of a seller that finding a charger isn't hard, there are hundreds third party charger sellers. In the EU though apple is going to run into some twists with the laws.
Bottom line, the law is old, was meant for the hundreds  of thousands of tiny plastic adaptors that were NEVER used. But it lead to there being pretty much only two standards today, lightning (technically just USB2, for now), and micro USB, which is also about to receive a revison.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure. Now. Since the initiative passed (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_external_power_supply" target="_blank">2009</a>). Most phone manufactures didn't sit there and say &quot;oh, we'll just wait until the last moment, consumers be damned&quot; (aside from apple).</p>
<p>At the time this law was being debated there were a million types of plugs for phones. I have a draw full of them.</p></div>		</li>
