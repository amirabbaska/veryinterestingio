			<div class="markdown"><p>Most stainless steels actually have very little carbon (0.03-0.08wt% depending on the application). Any higher and chromium carbides form at grain boundaries in the metal and start preferentially corroding. 316 steel (one of the more common stainless steels) has ~0.08 wt%, while 316L which is used for more biomedical applications is at 0.03wt%</p></div>		</li>
