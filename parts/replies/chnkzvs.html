			<div class="markdown"><p>While I think its important to keep in mind that Jurassic Park was a movie, it did raise the valid scientific point that evolution is pretty powerful.  However, it is important to understand that our work is a little different.  Our unnatural base pair is comprised of unnatural components - far from anything ever seen in nature.  Evolution works by co-opting an existing function that is related to a new desired function (the process is called exaptation).  nature contains nothing of the sort of multiple strep complex machinery that would be required to develop the ability to make X and Y within a cell.  It would be like expecting that a car was right around the corner after a cave man had invented the wheel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To speak nothing about the silly notion of this bacteria escaping into the wild, I still wanted to add that the theme of Jurassic Park (the novel by Michael Chricton) wasn't that evolution is powerful, but that complex systems are often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory" target="_blank">chaotic</a>, and that efforts to control said complex systems often resulted in unintended consequences. You'll see that this is a recurring theme in Chrichton's many works, almost all of which explore the unintended consequences of technological advancement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Length of generation would also be a factor. Let's say there are 800 generations between us and cavemen. If the generation length was only a couple of hours or minutes, we would not have cars after 13 hours - 33 days.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unfortunately for your team and your great work, most people do not understand evolution and you do not need to spend much time on the net to discover all kinds of sites making use of this fact to promote all kinds of nonsense.  </p>
<p>I think this work is incredibly barrier breaking - this is Nobel Prize stuff. I am in awe!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Science always happens against the grain of society, though. Just a couple hundred years ago, suggesting the universe wasn't geocentric could result in banishment or even death. The masses will always be afraid of new advancements at the start.</p>
<p>But yeah, it would be a serious shock if this team didn't get the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for it. I can't even fathom the amount of work that was put into this endeavor...</p></div>		</li>
