			<p>If the X and Y materials are not available to the single-cell embryo, then I think it would just replicate and make daughter cells with only natural DNA. During DNA replication, the X/Y nucleotides would be cut out because there was no way to complement them with the available materials.<br><br>In a multicellular organism, though, it would be <em>really</em> interesting. Would the X and Y materials be necessary for cell replication? If they weren't, then suddenly removing the X and Y would cause the somatic daughter cells to have different DNA than the parent cell. </p>		</li>

			<p>It is a big assumption to think that just because bacterial replication machinery can recognise these synthetic nucleotides, that eucaryotic replication machinery could too. <br><br>The cells of multicellular organisms are far more complex than bacterial, and the amino acid sequence of the replication proteins is very different. <br><br>There are a huge number of hurdles before this could progress to a multicellular stage.</p>		</li>

			<p>Probably the same thing as for single-celled organisms - the X and Y data would be lost. The body's cells would need to synthesize the nucleotides in order to replicate their complete DNA. In vivo, synthesis of nucleotides is extremely well regulated and the reactions are carried out by enzymes that catalyze only that reaction.<br><br>Basically, the zygote would lack the cellular machinery necessary to make the X and Y nucleotides.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's so hypothetical, it would be insanely complicated by all the additional tumour suppressors and apoptotic proteins that are made to sense DNA damage, or mutations in the nucleus.<br>They've just about managed it with bacteria (even then, it's still reliant on the artificial addition of synthetic DNA). So, imagine it would be a challenge to even begin to imagine that possibility (not trying to peak for them, just chipping in my bit haha),</p>		</li>

			<p>DNA is replicated discontinuously into Okizaki fragments which are later joined together.  I am making an educated guess that either RNA primer will just sit there, or the resultant Okizaki fragment will be shorter by one nucleotide.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_88d9GufML0" target="_blank">Watch this and it will make sense</a></p>		</li>

			<p>DNA polymerase tends to dump in an adenine if it encounters an abasic site (position on the DNA template that, for whatever reason, has lost its nitrogenous base); this phenomenon is known as the A-rule. I highly suspect that when DNAP encounters one of these unnatural nucleotides it will simply adhere to the A-rule.</p>		</li>

			<p>While I think its important to keep in mind that Jurassic Park was a movie, it did raise the valid scientific point that evolution is pretty powerful.  However, it is important to understand that our work is a little different.  Our unnatural base pair is comprised of unnatural components - far from anything ever seen in nature.  Evolution works by co-opting an existing function that is related to a new desired function (the process is called exaptation).  nature contains nothing of the sort of multiple strep complex machinery that would be required to develop the ability to make X and Y within a cell.  It would be like expecting that a car was right around the corner after a cave man had invented the wheel.</p>		</li>

			<p>To speak nothing about the silly notion of this bacteria escaping into the wild, I still wanted to add that the theme of Jurassic Park (the novel by Michael Chricton) wasn't that evolution is powerful, but that complex systems are often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory" target="_blank">chaotic</a>, and that efforts to control said complex systems often resulted in unintended consequences. You'll see that this is a recurring theme in Chrichton's many works, almost all of which explore the unintended consequences of technological advancement.</p>		</li>

			<p>Length of generation would also be a factor. Let's say there are 800 generations between us and cavemen. If the generation length was only a couple of hours or minutes, we would not have cars after 13 hours - 33 days.</p>		</li>

			<p>Naturally when examined closely the metaphor would break down. But if we are to still use it to compare in a meaningful way to genetic mutation, then looking at generation count is the way to go. DNA doesn't change depending on how old you are, it only changes when there is a generation.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why did you decide to use Sulfur for the H-bonding?  And from my quick glance, it appears that only a single H-bond will form between the two new nucleotides, or am I mistaken?  Will that affect the stability of the X-Y sequences?</p>		</li>

			<p>Interesting observation, Saggy,<br><br>In fact, we don't use hydrogen bonds at all for our unnatural base pair.  Our nucleotides rely on hydrophobic (oil mixes with oil) and packing forces to mediate selective interaction in the DNA.  As far as specific chemical structures are concerned, current versions of X and Y were selected from over 10 000 combinations of different chemical scaffolds.  Sulfur appears to be very this magic bullet at the interface of two nucleobases that make them work together as a pair.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Remember, Saggy, Hydrogen bonds can only occur with Hydrogens bonded to N, O, or F (S is not electronegative enough due to the shielding effect of the additional orbitals). I'm not sure to what extent the sulfur can act as a &quot;scaffold&quot; for the hydrogen concerning the H-bonding, considering it IS still in fact electronegative, and thus contribute to the overall stability of the base pairs, but probably not very much, I'm sure. </p>		</li>
