			<div class="markdown"><p>There wouldn't be that cancelling effect that we see inside of something like a conductor? I could be remembering wrong but I seem to remember there being no electric field at all inside conductors. </p>
<p>I know it's not e&amp;m but I'm curious if something similar would happen,I believe it would. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no electric field in conductors, because electrons move to the surface of the conductor to cancel out whatever field was there before.</p>
<p>Here, no mass is moving, so gravity is not cancelled out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm so say there's just a uniform negative charge on a conductor right, that would basically be our mass. If the mass is uniformly distributed wouldn't that be the same thing? Cancelling everywhere inside?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity never cancels out, the gravity field is still present everywhere theatrically. In fact the center of the torus would be unstable in the plane of the torus but stable along the perpendicular axis because even the top of the gravity hill would be inside the gravity well of the torus. This is also true if Lagrange points. They are in the well of the system so an object in the system just fall into one of its bodies.</p>
<p>What would cancel out is the FORCE of gravity. An object at the exact center would be pulled in every direction at once resulting in equilibrium and zero net force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is what I meant for both examples. Don't the forces cancel for any electric field inside a conductor? So the force wouldn't be zero anywhere but the center for the gravity example? How can I prove this?</p></div>		</li>
