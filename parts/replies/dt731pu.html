			<div class="markdown"><p>Etymology exists because the study of language can give insight into cultures and how those cultures developed. Think of it more like a form of archaeology than the study of the right word to use for a given situation.</p>
<p>This is actually an interesting example. The word &quot;jungle&quot; is borrowed from the geographic area around India and Pakistan. That word is the Hindi जंगल (jangal), meaning... you guessed it... &quot;forest&quot;. For Brits way back in the time of the East Indian Trading Company, though, though, Indian &quot;forests&quot; were different from English forests. This is the main reason why English speakers commonly interpret the word &quot;jungle&quot; to mean specifically the kind of forest made up of exotic and foreign plants.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, जंगल, &quot;jungle&quot;, and &quot;forest&quot; mean the same thing. At the same time, though, western perspectives permeate our understanding of other regions even today. The words might mean the same thing in the etymological sense, but English history and culture add color. The fun consequence of this is that you can use the word &quot;jungle&quot; to mean &quot;forest&quot;, or you can use it to describe an exotic and strange forest. You won't confuse anyone either way.</p></div>		</li>
