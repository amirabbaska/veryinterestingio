			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to your answer (which is good btw!):</p>
<p>The Z boson of the weak force could be produced by a neutrino anti-neutrino interaction, but the &quot;cross section&quot; of the interaction would be tiny. Partly because neutrinos have a tiny mass compared to the Z- roughly 11 orders of magnitude different I think? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand equation 2 in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1536" target="_blank">this paper</a> correctly, thermal 10 MeV neutrinos have a velocity-averaged 5*10^(-46) m^2 scattering cross-section. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0370269387911713" target="_blank">This paper</a> calculates a neutrino density of 3*10^(33)/m^3 in a sphere of 10 km radius. If that sphere of neutrinos would stay constant, a passing neutrino would have an interaction probability of the order of 3*10^(-7). Give or take a factor of 10. Not that bad.</p>
<p>The two papers also show the two possible ways to see neutrino-interactions: through their bulk effects in the very early universe or in supernovae.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass is not the relevant energy scale. You want the Lorentz invariant centre of mass energy often denoted sqrt(s). Typically the cross section will scale as
s/M_Z^4 where M_Z is the mass of the Z boson </p>
<p>EDIT: Removed reference to G fermi's constant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment isn't very clear... where are you using G? </p>
<p>If the cross section is inversely proportional to the Z mass to the power of 4, then the neutrinos would have to have a lot of energy to make the cross section favourable, right? So we wouldn't expect to see many of these neutrinos interactions.</p>
<p>Edit: this was originally responding to another comment. Hence the seemingly random first line etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Roughly speaking, physics works like this: you look at the world, and see that stuff has some regular behavior. You make some piece of mathematical machinery that reproduces the behavior of said stuff. That piece of mathematical machinery, in order to give you the predictions you built it for, will require the whole world to behave a certain way (and will help you calculate it in some cases). Then, you ask the machinery what happens in some situation you haven't looked at yet, and see if the world does behave like that or not. If it does, you continue doing it. If it doesn't, you start again and use your newfound experience to build a better piece of machinery.</p>
<p>It's not obvious that this should work. Why is it that by looking at some part of the world, I can get some understanding of some other part of the world I haven't looked at yet? I don't know. But as far as we can tell it does seem to be a good way to go about it. It's not even weird, we humans do it all the time at a very superficial level. When you drop an apple you expect it to fall to the floor, even though you've never dropped that particular apple yet (and even if you have, you haven't dropped it in that particular set of circumstances before). But you have some rough model of gravity that says &quot;things fall to the floor when I drop them&quot; and so far it's been working pretty good. Physics is basically the centuries-long highly-precise version of that.</p>
<p>So yeah long story short, the machinery we developed to understand the weak force for tells us that neutrinos should interact with each other, but that given our circumstances this interaction should be very infrequent. We don't strictly know that this is how the world works, but so far it's been going pretty good.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To the layman, imagine the &quot;cross section&quot; as the probability of an interaction happening. Just wait and watch! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the neutrinos we see are from the sun, right?  And if they're coming from an approximate point source, they wouldn't cross each other's paths, I guess, making interaction even less likely.</p>
<p>Wouldn't even a tiny probability of interaction mean that they interact routinely <em>within</em> the sun, since the density must be very high?  But I guess we can't detect that interaction from here.</p>
<p>I've heard that 60 billion neutrinos will pass through an area the size of your thumbnail every second.  Which, if I'm not mistaken, means something like 20 billion per second per area <em>the size of a proton</em> at the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's just a matter of orders of magnitude. If the cross section is small enough, it's easy to imagine that interaction rates in the sun would still be negligible and the density of the sun would barely even be relevant. Also, I don't see where you're getting that 20 billion number from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's the question, how small a probability are we talking about?</p>
<p>A thumbnail is ~10^-17 the cross-sectional area of the Earth, and the Earth receives ~10^-9 of the sun's output, so the power at the sun should be around 10^26 higher, or 10^36/s for the same area.  A couple of cm^2 to a radius of 0.85 fm is a factor of 10^26 , for 10^10 per proton-area.  I dumped the numbers into google and it gave me 20 billion, close enough.</p>
<p>That puts the total flux for the sun surface on the order of 10^60 /s, the rate of chances for interaction must be... really huge.</p></div>		</li>
