Trumps plan also favours majority Muslim nations like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Lebanon to name a few. These nations or its people all have directly been involved with terrorist attacks, including 9/11. Yet for some reason are not on this list, many argue the point that Trump has commercial interests in these nations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no law expert, but I believe that the President does have the authority to block entry into the US according to 8 U.S. Code ยง 1182:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(f)  Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by President  </p>
<p>Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. Whenever the Attorney General finds that a commercial airline has failed to comply with regulations of the Attorney General relating to requirements of airlines for the detection of fraudulent documents used by passengers traveling to the United States (including the training of personnel in such detection), the Attorney General may suspend the entry of some or all aliens transported to the United States by such airline.</p>

<p>You say his order targets certain religious minorities. Do you have the part of his executive order that singles out any religious minority? From what I've read, it simply bans immigration from several unstable nations from which refugees are seeking asylum. What am I missing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The president has all kinds of things he can do... Many of which could be either good for the country or misapplied or misused to is detriment.</p>
<p>In limiting the number of refugees the order states that priority in applications be given to religious persecution provided the religion is a minority in the country in question.  </p>
<p>He can say it's not a Muslim ban because that's not what it says on the label. But that, in practice is what it is.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are your thoughts on his statements today? He blatantly said today that it had nothing to do with religion. He even went so far to say, &quot;Muslim ban&quot; is a false name and doesn't reflect the actual legislation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that response is entirely consistent with his rhetoric so far: to blatantly say or do one thing while calling it another or denying it entirely in the face of all evidence. </p></div>		</li>
