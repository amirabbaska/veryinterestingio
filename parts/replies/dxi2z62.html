<p>Also while the finished coffin may have less wood, you still have diagonal cuts in the top and bottom and there has to be a decent amount of waste. I would be interested to see how much usable wood could be saved.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.northwoodscasket.com/build-your-own-coffin/" target="_blank">I found this site</a> that supplies plans and kits for coffins and caskets. According to their plans, a coffin is 3 sq feet less (60 vs 63) -or- one 3.5' 10&quot; board -or- one 6' 6&quot; board. That is, if the waste was one solid piece which it's not. It's broken up into 8 - 12 pieces.  </p>
<p>The coffin kit is also an additional $200 even though it's less material. If time is of the essence (during a time of war) coffins would take longer to build. </p></div>		</li>

<p>When it was your heat source, the body of majoirty of your weapons, buildings, fences, tools, arrows, furniture, storage containers, ships, wagons, and more the less wood you used on anything that saved time/materials was worth it.  You also don't need as big a hole in the box is more narrow.  </p>
<p>Not to mention back then you couldn't fire up the chain saw to get a tree that was (hopefully) big enough.  EVERYTHING was by hand, so the size difference could mean saving a couple of hours easily.  During war that's the difference between coffins for everyone in weeks rather than months.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Wood&quot; wasn't generally scarce or particularly expensive, but <em>lumber</em> was. When you don't have an industrial process for producing lumber, it's incredibly labor- and time-intensive</p></div>		</li>
