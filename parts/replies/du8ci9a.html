			<div class="markdown"><p>Turn off any surround sound options, and that should make it a bit better. With a surround sound system, sound effects and music come out of the left and right channels, and dialogue comes out of the center channel. Since your ttc had no center channel, out gets dropped, and you only get bleedthrough sound from left and right for dialog. Due to the way some stations handle sound, that won't help, as they're stripping out the center channel before it even gets to you, but it will help a LOT for dvds/blu-rays.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: only use surround sound options if you have a surround sound hooked up, or your problem happens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct in some cases. The surround virtualization actually takes the left and right and creates a virtual center channel, so its not just bleed through, but it also makes virtual surround channels which get down mixed back to the two channel system and thus you have a full left channel, full surroud left channel and half of a center channel coming from the left, and the same thing happening on the right, so its there, but just getting drowned out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a necessary evil for flat tvs. They're designed to be thin, which is the opposite of what real speakers need. Basically, if you want good audio, get a sound bar to go with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A sound bar is great, but I’ve run into the problem of the audio not syncing with the video. There is an option on my tv to adjust this, but I can only delay the audio by increments of 10. </p>
<p>So when set to 10, the audio is behind, and when set to 20, the video is behind. 15 would be perfect but for some reason that’s just not allowed. </p></div>		</li>
