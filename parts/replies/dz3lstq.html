			<div class="markdown"><p>They trace the noun &quot;dick&quot; in the &quot;detective&quot; sense to the 19th century (around 1864) criminal underworld slang verb &quot;to dick,&quot; meaning &quot;to watch.&quot; This &quot;dick&quot; came in turn from the Romany (the language of the Gypsies) word &quot;dik,&quot; meaning &quot;to look, to see.&quot; This is significant because the Gypsies, originally from northern India, played a prominent role in the British underworld in the 18th and 19th centuries, and several Romany words (including &quot;posh&quot;) percolated into general English usage during that period. One can easily imagine &quot;dick&quot; meaning &quot;to watch&quot; being transformed into a noun that means &quot;one who watches, a police detective, etc.&quot; It is even possible that the popularity of Dick Donovan tales at the time contributed to the spread of the term &quot;dick&quot; among the law-abiding (and mystery-reading) public.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just made another connection, the Roma are from the north of India and the Hindi work for &quot;watch&quot; is &quot;dekh&quot; which probably led to the Roma &quot;dik&quot; !</p></div>		</li>
