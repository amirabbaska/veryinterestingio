<p>What exactly is &quot;Back to Sleep?&quot; Back to sleep is the practice of placing your baby to sleep on their back each time they go to sleep, whether it's just for a quick nap or for the night. The &quot;Back to Sleep&quot; public education campaign began in 1994 and is now known as the &quot;Safe to Sleep&quot; campaign, which has lowered the SIDS rate by 50%.</p>
<p>&quot;What about co-sleeping?&quot;</p>
<pre><code>Research studies between 2004 and 2014 have shown that co-sleeping/bed-sharing carries an increased risk of SUID. The 2014 study, "Sleep Environment Risks for Younger and Older Infants" which was published in Pediatrics claims that the 69 percent of infants who died from SIDS were bed-sharing at the time of their death.

Researchers from the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths in the US reviewed 8,207 unexplained deaths across 24 states, grouping the data in two categories: deaths in those younger than four months old and deaths in infants older than four months old. They found that 74 percent of the younger infants were bed-sharing at the time of their death.

Even among moms who are breastfeeding and do not drink or smoke, co-sleeping quintuples the risk of SIDS, a 2013 study found.</code></pre>
<p>Despite all of the recent research and studies that show an increased risks of asphyxiation when bed-sharing, more than a million babies born each year are already bed-sharing and that number shows no signs of declining. The foremost authority and advocate for co-sleeping, James McKenna states, &quot;When they are armed with all the appropriate information they can make the decision that is best for their family. Because, he writes, sometimes “sleep happens” and no formal decision ever gets made on the best sleeping arrangements.&quot;</p>
<p>Here are some ways you can co-sleep safely:</p>
<pre><code>Bed surface should be firm. Babies should not be put down on waterbeds, beanbags, pillows or sheepskins.
No cracks or crevices between the headboard, footboard or sides of the bed where the baby could get wedged in.
No smoking near the baby. Second-hand smoke increases the risk of SIDS. The mother should never smoke and co-sleep, even away from the baby.
No extra bodies in the bed—including other children or pets.
Babies should not be placed on couches, recliners or anywhere they can roll and get trapped in a crevice.
Bedding should be tight-fitted to the mattress.
If either parent is overly tired, or has consumed alcohol, or taken drugs of an kind (including sedatives), they should not bed-share with the baby.
Babies should always be placed on their back to sleep.
Both parents have to be in agreement that the bed is the best place for the baby.</code></pre>
<p>How does breastfeeding reduce the risk of SIDS?</p>
<p>Researchers identified 288 studies on SIDS and breastfeeding from 1966 to 2009 and narrowed their analysis to 18 studies that met basic research quality criteria. The results showed that for infants who received any breastmilk for any duration, the likelihood of SIDS was 60% lower.</p>
<pre><code>For infants who were breastfed at 2 months of age and older, the risk was 62% lower.

Exclusive breastfeeding without any use of formula for any duration appeared to provide the biggest benefits. The risk of SIDS among exclusively breastfed infants was 73% lower.</code></pre>
<p>Although these findings are based on observational studies and cannot prove a direct cause and effect relationship between breastfeeding and SIDS prevention, researchers say there are several plausible biological reasons. For example, breastfed infants may be more easily aroused from sleep than formula-fed infants at 2-3 months of age, which is within the 2-4 months peak age of SIDS cases. In addition, breastfeeding delivers antibodies known as immunoglobulins that may help protect infants from infection during the period they are most at risk for SIDS. Source</p>
<p>&quot;Why does SIDS happen?&quot;</p>
<pre><code>In the past decade, researchers identified how low oxygen levels, combined with an underlying brain defect, can cause SIDS. Scientists believe a triple-risk model explains many SIDS cases: A baby has a defect in an area of the brain that controls breathing and arousal; the baby is at an age when those brain areas are still immature; and the baby is exposed to an external stress that compromises his breathing or oxygen levels, or that causes overheating.

“To have a SIDS death, you have to have at least one of those [factors], and you have a higher risk if you have two or three of those happening at the same time,” says Fern Hauck, a professor of family medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville.

Sleeping face-down on a soft surface or with soft bedding that can press up against the face can decrease a baby’s oxygen flow too much. When this happens, a normal baby will auto-resuscitate by gasping, crying, turning his head or moving. “It’s thought that SIDS infants have a defective arousal mechanism, which means they stay in that position and gradually suffocate,” Dr. Fern Hauck, a professor of family medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville says. "Overheating is thought to lead to SIDS in a similar way, by suppressing an infant’s arousal response."

The connection between brain defects and SIDS was raised definitively in 2010, when researchers at Children’s Hospital Boston discovered that SIDS babies were deficient in the brain-signaling chemical serotonin in the brain stem. In fact, according to some research, 50 to 75 percent of infants who die of SIDS have a serotonin defect.

Other researchers have found that about 10 to 15 percent of SIDS deaths can be traced to babies with a genetic predisposition for a heart rhythm disorder that can go undetected and lead to cardiac arrest, says Marta Cohen, a pediatric pathologist at Sheffield Children’s Hospital in England.

<p>Facts About SIDS:</p>
<pre><code>More than 2,000 babies died of SIDS in 2010, the last year for which such statistics are available. 1
Most SIDS deaths occur in babies between 1 month and 4 months of age, and 90% of SIDS deaths occur before a baby reaches 6 months of age.
More male babies die from SIDS than girls.
In most cases, no sign of distress is identifiable. The baby typically feeds normally prior to going to sleep.
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may be initiated at the scene, but evidence shows a lack of beneficial effect from CPR.</code></pre>
