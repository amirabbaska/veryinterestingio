			<div class="markdown"><p>During the Industrial Revolution, part of the speculation was that because of all this automation, people will have so much free time on their hands that a new renaissance will emerge.  People will only have to work 20 hours a week to get things done, and the average person can spend their free time on art and literature and what not.</p>
<p>Well the paradigm changed, and now if someone &quot;is only working 20 hours a week&quot; they are a &quot;worthless drain on society&quot; - because the goal posts shifted.  All that freetime and profit from efficiency was gobbled up by the top of the top.  So now, instead of respecting the human being who is making your pizza, or driving your taxi, they are less than human somehow and don't deserve a living wage.</p>
<p>THAT is what has to change, the basic tenants of human decency and respect.  If whole swaths of people are able to survive on a fully automated systems with little work - isn't that the utopia promised by &quot;Tommorow Land&quot; and The Jetsons from the 1950s?</p>
<p>NOPE!  Its that you are all lazy and should find more work to do!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure how you'd go about arguing this. In 1900, ~50% of the US labor force was employed in agriculture. By 1930, it was less than half that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with this. I work with a cutting edge material and processing for the automotive industry. 5 years ago, the processing was very manual, within the next 5 years, we are on pace to automate over 90% of our operations. The long term cost of labor and the related scrap, requires automation if we are to remain competitive. The automation will create the demand for higher end techs and engineers to operate and maintain, however it will be a fraction of the manual labor that we would require otherwise. As a son of parents who worked in paper mills, it's hard to know that I'm not helping create jobs for the regular hourly worker. I am helping create jobs nonetheless. From my vantage point I don't see how we can avoid a standard living wage in my lifetime, because automation is outpacing the need for the average worker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are creating jobs for the regular hourly worker -- you just don't see them.  When paper gets cheaper, the money that the paper mill saves goes somewhere.  They spend less on labor, and prices may also decrease.  So the some of the money that used to be spent on paper is now spent on something else.  It's impossible to know what the other thing or things are, but the money goes into the economy and likely creates additional jobs somewhere else.</p>
<p>The disconnect is between the job losses which are seen and the jobs created somewhere else that are never attributed to those job losses.  None of these newly-hired people raise their hand and say that their good fortune was the result of the innovation that occurred somewhere else.  But that doesn't make it any less real.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;standard living wage&quot; in the rest of the animal kingdom. If people can't adapt to the changing world they will simply die off from hunger, disease, exposure, or more likely violence resulting from civil unrest/war.  I'd like to think that utopia could happen but I feel childish for doing so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah 25% of the work force in 30 years was dramatic. Currently 35%-60% of jobs can be automated cost effectively. And it's expected to happen in less time.</p>
