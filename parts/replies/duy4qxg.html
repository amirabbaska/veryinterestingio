			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer, they have evolved over countless years to be the “laziest” animals around and have thrived in doing so because they habitats they live in permit them to do so. Go sloths. They figured it out the right way. Minimum effort </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Giant sloths are one of my favourite animals, not only were they one of <a href="http://www.factzoo.com/sites/all/img/blog/sloth/giant-sloth-size-relative-man.jpg" target="_blank">the largest land-living animals ever</a>, they also only went extinct 10k years ago. Furthermore they burrowed <strong>very</strong> <a href="https://hsto.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c71/488/727/c71488727c89d0872e643fca1af1c54f.jpg" target="_blank">large tunnels</a>. Alas they were killed of in the <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/281/1787/20133254.full.pdf" target="_blank">quaternal megafauna extinction event</a>, which everyone <em>should</em> know about since it was most likely caused by humans, but most don't. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/Extinctions_Africa_Austrailia_NAmerica_Madagascar.gif" target="_blank">This is a really depressing graph that shows the extent of this.</a> Pretty sure large is defined as adults &gt; 44 kg.</p>
<p>As to how fast they were, well I can't find any really good source on this (it could be that noone ever actually tried to estimate their speed), but most sources speculate they were also slow like their cousins, because of their build which was very heavy towards in the back. <a href="http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/m/megatherium.html" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few small sea animals that don't &quot;swim&quot; by their own propulsion but rather just drift with the currents. There are also small insects who specialize in water repulsion as they don't have the strength to break surface tension - if they were to actually be submerged in water rather than dryly walking on top of the surface, they would not be able to &quot;swim&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving slowly is also a form of camouflage,  and the moss etc that grows on them is also camouflage. </p>
<p>In regards to swimming,  pretty much all mammals can swim, including kangaroos,  bats,  and elephants. </p></div>		</li>
