			<div class="markdown"><p>But even before the electric current producing the magnetic field that interracts with the fluid motion to create a secondary magnetic field it says this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In this dynamo mechanism, fluid motion in the Earth's outer core moves conducting material (liquid iron) across an already existing, weak magnetic field and generates an electric current.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the already existing field from how I read that creates the current that you speak of.</p>
<p>Here is the full quote that the original comment already had that has the part you quoted included in it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In this dynamo mechanism, fluid motion in the Earth's outer core moves conducting material (liquid iron) across an <strong>already existing, weak magnetic field and generates an electric current</strong>. <strong>The electric current, in turn, produces a magnetic field that also interacts with the fluid motion to create a secondary magnetic field.&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the current you speak of is produced by the field and doesnt produce it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you see anything about if the two magnetic fields have the same “flow” as each other or were different? </p>
<p>It seems to me that a convection current starting at the very center and moving outward(in all directions?) would produce a different pattern that that of a spinning globe of metal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the Real question..</p>
<p>The article talks about a self sustaining dynamo with a backfeed generation of magnetic fields</p>
<p>So it suffice to have a random starting weak magnetic field due to general orientation of surrounding metals?</p>
<p>Am I understanding this correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's self sustaining because the magnetic field causes the motion.  Here's a pretty good (simple) explanation:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flows in a conducting fluid (such as many molten metals) will produce magnetic fields (and those magnetic fields in turn influence the flows in a complicated dance). All you really need to kickstart the dynamo action is something to create either the fluid flows or the magnetic fields. So you can jumpstart it just by stirring it up with a rod in the right way in principle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the explanation of the earths magnetic field. Magnets we have made ourselves work a little different. </p>
<p>To simplify the way our magnets work you can say that each atom in the iron has a direction of it’s magnetic field. In a regular piece of iron the direction of the magnetic field is different for every atom, hence the different magnetic fields will cancel out each other and the iron will not be magnetic. However if you bring a magnet close to the iron it’s atoms will turn the same way as the magnetic field and become magnetic. </p>
<p>To make a permanent magnet of iron, you heat up the iron while it is affected by a magnetic field from another magnet. You keep the magnet in this magnetic field while it cools down. This will make all the atoms of the iron to point its magnetic field in the same direction permanently, hence creating a permanent magnet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be a little more detailed: ferromagnetism (the kind of magnetism in ordinary permament magnets) ultimately comes from the magnetic fields of the electrons in the metal. Electrons have an innate magnetic field due to &quot;spin&quot; (a QM property that has effects a bit like if each electron were actually a tiny spinning charged sphere, hence the name). Normally, electrons bound to atoms tend to &quot;pair up&quot; so that their spins cancel, and any unpaired electrons have randomly-oriented spin, so there's no bulk magnetism.</p>
<p>Materials like iron have two things: they have some unpaired electrons in their shells, and they have long-range delocalized bonds that cause the bond electrons to line up in the same direction as each other (instead of antiparallel). Unmagnetized iron actually has a large number of microscopic, fully-magnetized &quot;domains&quot;, but they're randomly oriented. In magnetized iron they're somewhat aligned. And the domains, being (much) larger than a single electron, are more stable against getting re-randomized by thermal perturbations. Unless you get them hot enough — which brings us back to the thread title.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A static magnet, such as you are describing, is basically what happened to Mars.  The field becomes much weaker because you don't have the huge current generated by the flowing outer core sustaining the field.  </p></div>		</li>
