			<div class="markdown"><p>Norwegian is fantastic. Don't go for any of the extras: checked bag, seat selection, a meal... who needs it! Buy a big carry-on and you're good. I've flown twice to Europe round-trip for around 500 bucks. </p>
<p>This is what I didn't understand, though. I was going to fly back from London and the one-way was 100 dollars more than the one-way back from Barcelona (which flew to London and connected to the same flight back from London). So in other words, I saved $100 and got an extra flight by leaving from Barcelona instead of London. Like, why is it cheaper to use more gas and resources? I'll never get airline pricing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Essentially, the seat for both Barcelona and London was empty and by you paying for them both, in the end it may have ended up making more money for them because that empty seat on Barcelona perhaps cost more than if you had just paid more for London.</p>
<p>In addition, different flights have different incentive levels from passengers for money making. You might forego purchasing a meal on a 2 hour flight. You'll consider paying for one on at 12 hour flight.</p>
<p>Does that make sense? It might be confusing, so consider this:</p>
<p>The Barcelona flight maybe costs $100/seat to break even. There was an empty seat no one wanted. The London flight might cost $50/seat to break even because it's a more efficient flight (like people are more likely to pay bags on an international flight when you don't get free checked bags). London has higher demand too, so you were paying $250 for London. </p>
<p>So sure, they might have walked away with $200 in profit from you buying a ticket with London only. But then they lose $100 in Barcelona because an empty seat stays empty. Instead, they entice you with saving $100 to fly through Barcelona, breaking even with both, and now potentially having two flights they can sell meals, checked bags, etc. for. And now the Barcelona flight is at least breaking even, and is cause for it to stay in operation as well.</p>
<p>Long story short, there's a lot more than just ticket prices being factored in. Route utilization, extra incentives, etc. all factor in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is because the customers and the competitors are different in different airports. Tourists that go with British Airways from Barcelona to New York through London have different budgets than business travellers that go directly from London to New York, thus they will have very different prices even though the London-NY segment is shared. Also, there may be a budget airline that fly directly Barcelona-NY, then BA has to lower the price for that point of origin.</p>
<p>It might be something similar why round-trip tickets from Europe to US are mush cheaper than the other way around. $500 is almost on the expensive side. I usually pay around $400 Europe-San Francisco with KLM which is a full service airline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they're selling otherwise empty seats, at that point it's still making sense to put a butt in that seat. And it's also too late to go cancel all the other for too low a flight. Frontier will run limited &quot;den deal&quot; runs for $15 too. When I went to Minneapolis, that's what I paid per ticket.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything costs extra. You need a checked bag? That's $20. You misspelled your name and need to change it to make sure you get through immigration? That's $500 (seriously, Frontier charges about $500 for a name change, accidentally corrected the name for my ticket to include my middle name when checking in, backed out of that screen quick enough :P). </p>
<p>They also fly out of small airports where they can negotiate lower prices than they could at a major airport. This saves them tons of money per flight, allowing them to offer low prices. </p>
<p>I've flown with RyanAir and Frontier, I'm never doing that again unless it's an emergency. I'll pay the cost of comfort and arriving at the airport closest to where I want to be. For example I'm going to London in a few months, my hotel is 5 min from Heathrow, 1 hour from Gatwick (where the semi-cheap option for me flies to) and about the same from Stanstead (where RyanAir flies to). It costs me maybe £50-70 more to fly to Heathrow over Gatwick and maybe £100 more over Stanstead, but being able to take the free local bus from Heathrow to the hotel instead of a bus/train from Gatwick/Stanstead that costs ~£30-40 each way makes the more expensive plane ticket more than worth it for me. In this case I'm travelling to an event held at that hotel, normally if I went to London I'd stay in London, making the travel time from airport to hotel much more equal, in which case I'd probably fly to Gatwick instead. </p></div>		</li>

<p>My friend had a similar issue (with another airline though) - cause he accidentally used his wife's maiden name when booking the ticket... Thankfully, they never invalidated her old passport after the name change, so she'll just use her old passport :D</p></div>		</li>

<p>What? Even the Gatwick express isn't THAT expensive. The one-way online price is only 17.80 GBP. I understand the general concept here and Heathrow is a very nice airport (especially for its size), but it's nowhere near 40 quid. </p>
<p>I mean, unless you have to do a ton of transfers on different lines, in which case you'll quickly hit the daily limit which is like 10 pounds and allows you to travel locally anyway.</p>
<p>Sorry, I know this isn't really the point, but I was pleasantly surprised when I visited how cheap it was to get around and how not-bad it ended up being flying into Gatwick (Heathrow was like 100 GBP more). Then again, for us it was more like 1-hour from Stanstead/Gatwick and 40 minutes from Heathrow (we were staying near Covent Garden). </p></div>		</li>
