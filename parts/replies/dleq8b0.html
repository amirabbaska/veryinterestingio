			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to that the fact that toddlers are power-hungry, yearning for control of anything, and yet simultaneously not even fully aware of their own emotions or how to handle them... being a kid is difficult. </p>
<p>Also: don't ever say &quot;S/he must not like [insert food here]&quot; because they'll think you accept it and they'll agree that they don't like said food. Say something more like &quot;That's a different texture, huh?!&quot; or talk about the other characteristics of the food - ESPECIALLY in complementary comparison to foods they do really like!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got a question for yah, (not criticizing your parenting) but is sushi ok for them? I'm not entirely sure when the immune system is strong enough to handle raw fish, or any illness that could come from eating it like adults can, but 4 just sounds too young. I have no real idea, and could totally be wrong, but it was my initial thought </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all sushi is raw fish. Sushi can have raw fish, cooked fish, shrimp, chicken, beef, tofu, or whatever else you want in it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking about sushi made with smoked salmon, but 4 isn't too young for raw fish as long as you take caution to eat at a reputable restaurant. And maybe not let them eat their weight in raw fish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My cousin is a cook and he knows his stuff. He is a founder of a, now well established, catering company and often delivers food to day cares. I bet children's immune system is stronger than we think. They eat their boogers, do how weak can it be?</p>
<p>Just a little anecdote. First time I met my cousin's son (my cousin and I are not that close. We see each other like every fifth year or so) he was like:</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, PrincePew, look at this... Son, what do you want for dinner? Raw salmon or sausages?&quot;
Instantly his son lit up and yelled &quot;FISH! FISH!&quot;</p>
<p>The fish was delicious by the way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as it's not bitter, spicy foods can be quite popular with children. It seems to take a few years for a baby to develop a distaste for spicy and only if they weren't exposed to it.</p>
<p>Although everyone's got one or two things they want nothing to do with, and it's entirely possible a child runs into that thing early. Never thought I'd have to deal with someone not liking Ketchup(and a decade later still never has), that's for sure!</p></div>		</li>
