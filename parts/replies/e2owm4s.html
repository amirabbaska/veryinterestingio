			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this related to that odd feeling of pressure or numbness in my (male) diddly bits when I sit in one spot (usually near my tailbone) on a chair for too long? It's the oddest sensation. Rarely happens - just when I'm forced to sit in one spot for a very long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe! The nerve that supplies your genitalia is known as the pudendal nerve, and it can become compressed, though I couldn’t say for sure if that’s what you’re dealing with. If it gets worse (rare), you can look up ‘pudendal nerve entrapment’ or ‘pudendal neuralgia’ (more likely).</p>
<p>But really the only reason I’m answering this is to say that the name for the nerve is derived from the Latin ‘pudendum,’ meaning ‘parts to be ashamed of.’ Shaaaaaaaame! Anyway, sorry to hear about your junk, try to take breaks from sitting if possible. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When did you guys lose interest in actually knowing the answer? Mine was when they started labeling parts of the shoulder (Disclaimer: this is not a hate on the question or answer, it's meant as a joke in that you see some questions you wouldn't mind knowing the answer to, but then the answer is way more complicated than you thought and realise you don't want to know the answer that much anymore)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trick is ignoring all the unneccesary things. The part about labelling shoulder can just be summarized as &quot;It's not primarily your arm not getting blood&quot; or &quot;It's not caused by cutting off blood circulation completely&quot; without needing much thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to pinpoint. When there's so much more information that's so much more clinically relevant you have to pick your battles. </p>
<p>But at the same time I think a strong sense of curiosity is what drew me to the field. When I read the question &amp; think, &quot;that's a good one - I've got an idea but let me find out more&quot; ect. So now when I have a patient ask this (&amp; one will, eventually) I'll already know</p></div>		</li>
