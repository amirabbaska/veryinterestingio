			<div class="markdown"><p>My lab tried to make prosthetics that directly interfaces with the nervous system through nano-array channels and other technologies. The nerves are just way too fragile and prone to forming neuromas that cause way too much noise to read a proper signal.</p>
<p>Optogenetic technologies is probably the best bet we have at the moment for communicating TO the nerve. I recently co-authored a manuscript on the major roadblocks we're facing in that direction due to immunological factors potentially causing intense loss of expression. Not sure if there's anything new for reading FROM the nerve though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I work with stimulating neurons using optogenetics and reading out from them in brains, not nerves. Question, if the plan here is to use optogenetics for prosthetic interfaces, how are you going to infect human nerves with channelrhodopsins? That feels like a giant FDA no-no that would take a literal lifetime of work and approval even to get something basic going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are very reasonable questions and concerns. The background for the immunogenicity paper was that it took the lead author nearly two years to get any sort of transdermal functional expression <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28157088/" target="_blank">(which was published here)</a>. Even after getting expression in the rats, he was noticing a loss of expression in every animal several weeks post viral transfection. Curious about this, we enumerated all possible factors that could be <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-32075-0/tables/1" target="_blank">causing this (table 1).</a> </p>
<p>When we realized an immune response was a likely factor, we became very concerned about groups and companies that were rushing human experimentation for optogenetics in the periphery. Initially the paper had a different, much more cautionary tone but the editor asked us to tone down commentary on ongoing clinical trials.</p>
<p>So yes, I agree that true bi-directional feedback with sense restoration is decades away - it may even be impossible. Ed and Hugh consider peripheral human enhancement through opto to be a moonshot project to say the least. There is agreement among my research circle that extreme caution should be exercised with optogenetics. If it takes decades to do this <strong>safely</strong>, I would be glad it was done <strong>safely.</strong></p>
<p>That being said, the exploratory groundwork needs to be done by someone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So we don't have robotic prosthetics that wire in to the nervous system <em>yet</em> but there are people researching and trying to invent them?

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this specific technology that we're talking about here uses these little things called channelrhodopsins, which are like light-activated gates that we genetically modify cells to produce, so that you can shoot some individual neurons with light and make them fire. Like you can say &quot;those neurons right there that make this function happen, make them fire&quot;. The idea is that you could have a prosthetic sending signals to nerves with light like this. The question I asked is that while this is cool, it involves genetically modifying human neurons to express an entirely different gate than they normally do, the health effects of which are relatively unknown, even in mice in which this technique is frequently used (This is where I use them, in mice and in neurons cultured in petri dishes). This is sort of okay, like we can do studies to characterize this, I was just asking how difficult this problem would be to overcome.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your last paragraph is actually why the answer is a rather confident yes. OP included neural pathways as a potential control method, and the brain can do some amazing things.</p>
<p>In this case specifically, there's been a study done where (in layman's terms) they trained an AI to mimic the movements of a monkey's arm based on the monkeys EEG signals (brain electrodes). Once they had it trained, they let it just be controlled by the monkey's brain rather than telling it to mimic the arm. They then put it in a room with a button where the monkey could see it, and the monkey figured out first that the robotic arm followed its actual arm and second that the button released a treat into its cage. Over time, the monkey managed to move the robotic arm without moving its own arm, meaning it had comoletely retrained its brain to control three arms individually.</p>
<p>So it's not that much of a leap to say a human born with one arm can probably control two arms with their brain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's been done with a paralyzed human volunteer!</p>
<p>The reason I'm not confident is that this is a technology that might take a lifetime to implement - brain surgery has to be less risky than missing limbs.</p></div>		</li>
