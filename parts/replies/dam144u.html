Fiscal conservatives want lower taxes and less government involvement in day to day lives.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In Canada and other places with socialized medical care, the government pays for the Healthcare of its citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The US government already spends almost as much per person on health care as Canada spends <em>total</em> per person on health care. The US Government accounts for 46% of all health care expenses in the US. Canada spends 46.5% per person what the US spends... so literally a gap of 0.5%.</p>
<p>We'd save $1.8 trillion per year if we could match Canada's efficiency, or about $5,700 per person per year. </p></div>		</li>
