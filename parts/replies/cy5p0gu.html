			<p>Nope, not even theoretically could we EVER prove it. One explanation of the big bang was that it was the formation of our universe sized black hole. By this extension, our black holes conceivablely could contain universes of their own. <br><br>I'm not convinced by this hypothesis but I'm unsure how widely accepted it is</p>		</li>

			<p>if a blackhole is &quot;eating&quot; more than it's &quot;spitting&quot;, it will increase in mass and therefore it's radius of the event horizon, so there's a possibility that we're in a growing blackhole</p>		</li>

			<p>But then wouldn't we see new matter being introduced from the &quot;edges&quot; (event horizon of the universe/black hole)? And wouldn't things still be traveling inward toward the center?</p>		</li>

			<p>Well we don't know how things act inside a black hole, so we aren't for sure that an item will travel to &quot;the centre&quot;. So given the nature that we don't know the nature, we don't know if how matters behaving around us is matter behaving in a black hole (so it could behave like our current world, if I can call it a world).  <br>And yes, matter will be introduced into the black hole. But we won't immediate be able to observe it, light takes time to travel too, and from somewhere (don't remember source), gravity also travels at the speed of light. So if the sun disappeared, earth would still be in orbit for 8 more minutes. The same principle applies - the effect of the new matter would not take effect on us for quite a while, given the size of the universe. Of course, we can observe things closer to the &quot;edge&quot; of the universe, which should be affected earlier than us, but that would still take a long, long time. </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm confused by this too, our observable universe has us at its center, what suggests that, if we're inside a black hole, we would be at its center?<br>&gt;The object's observable universe shrinks to that boundary.<br><br>Does not that imply that, unless that object it at the center of the black hole, its observable universe wouldn't be circular?

			<p>When we say &quot;our observable universe&quot;, we mean &quot;everything that emitted light that has had time to reach us since the creation of the universe&quot;. We are at its center by definition, because light coming from all direction travels at the same speed.

			<p>Except &quot;our observable universe&quot; and &quot;our universe&quot; are different, because we have observed everything to be traveling away from a specific point, the actual center of the universe, which we are not at.<br><br>So if we were to talk about our universe in terms of whether or not it is a black hole, we shouldn't be talking about our observable universe because it is clear we aren't the center of whatever this thing we are inside, be it a black hole or not.<br><br>Edit: Just read up on it, never mind.</p>		</li>

			<p>You would be right if we could define some point as being the center of &quot;our universe&quot;. Unfortunately, we can't. As far as we know, everything expand with respect to everything else, and the &quot;universe&quot; itself is infinite, every point in space is just limited to its observable universe. That's why it only makes sense to talk about observable universes when talking about this sort of things<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah that is what I gathered when I read up on it.<br><br>As time passes, the borders of the observable universe expands as light from objects far enough away finally reach us. Which is separate from the expansion of the universe.<br><br>But the real conundrum here is that if we assume the big-bang theory to be fact, that the universe expanded from a single point, then that single point should have a location within our post-big-bang universe, which would be the true center of the universe. So where is that center? Why isn't matter traveling away from the center, just as space originally traveled away from the center?<br><br>A comparison was made between the expansion of the universe and the expansion of the 2D surface of a balloon as it is inflated. All points on the surface of the balloon are moving away from each other, just as in the Universe. But that is really where the comparison stops, because the 3D area of the balloon doesn't have any correspondence to the Universe's area. And the comparison falls apart when discussing the big-bang, as a balloon does not expand from a single point of it's existence, but rather the single point contained within it, with it already existing at multiple points.<br><br>Crazy stuff.<br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>The universe is X number of years old. We can use telescopes to see X number of lightyears. Any further than that is impossible because light has not had enough time to travel far enough to reach us. This doesen't mean the universe is circular but our vision is and we are at the center.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not necessarily.  One of the things about the physics inside black holes (which we know very little about), is that physics may behave completely strangely inside a black hole.  In fact, there could be entirely different laws of physics inside the black hole.  Which would man that new matter entering isn't like you throwing a tennis ball into the pool, and someone at the bottom of the pool can see it enter the water.  It would be more like you throw the tennis ball into the water, and it instantly <em>turns into</em> water and you just notice the water level rise a little bit.  <br></p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/conanap" target="_blank">conanap</a>
			<p>That's actually a good point. From this point on my answers are not based on sources but more of personal deduction (so it might be wrong)  <br>I think one could argue we do not observe spaghetti thing because every thing in our vicinity is being spaghettified - as such, it looks normal. That's just my guess though </p>		</li>
						<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NellucEcon" target="_blank">NellucEcon</a>
			<p>I believe that Spaghettification only happens on the event horizon of smaller black holes.  Because gravity follows an inverse-squared law, changes in gravity as you move closer to the black hole will be larger the closer to the black hole you already are.  With a large black hole the event horizon is much further away, and so the change in gravity is smaller. </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shieldvexor" target="_blank">shieldvexor</a>
			<p>This is correct. You would not be spaghettified by a supermassive black hole like the one in the center of our galaxy before entering the event horizon. Rather, you would be destroyed by the objects inside in decaying orbits just below the speed of light, referred to as a firewall (assuming of course you lived that long from all the X-rays outside the black hole).<br><br>It is the smaller black holes, known as stellar mass, that give the dramatic spaghetification because they have a much faster ramp up of gravitational force so there is sufficient difference between the innermost side of your body and the outermost side of your body to spaghetify you. </p>		</li>

			<p>Black holes don't &quot;eat&quot; so to speak. If something gets sucked into their event horizon it doesn't make the black hole bigger. In order for the black hole to get bigger it would need to increase its gravitational pull, which is virtually maxed out at the time of it's creation and all of its density collapses into a single point in space.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/shieldvexor" target="_blank">shieldvexor</a>
			<p>That is completely wrong. There is a reason that you would die differently falling into a stellar mass black hole than into a supermassive black hole. The size of a black hole is the event horizon which is proportional to the mass within the blackhole. Any increase or decrease in mass will increase or decrease the radius of it's event horizon. </p>		</li>

			<p>supposedly, accelerating expansion is linked to the Hawking radiation of the parent black hole, which also accelerates as the hole gets smaller.</p>		</li>

			<p>The schwarzschild radius of the observable universe is smaller than the observable universe, though only slightly. What this means is that the observable universe doesn't have sufficient mass/energy relative to its volume to become a black hole. So no we don't live inside a black hole per se. That said as you pointed out according to the big bang theory the universe burst forth from a singularity. Aside from containing many orders of magnitude more energy than the black holes within our universe, this singularity would be indistinguishable from the singularities they contain. (IE infinitely small and infinitely dense). All of our current physics break down when dealing with these infinities, so we can't say for sure what happens in a singularity, perhaps it explodes outwards through new dimensions that don't intersect with those our universe experiences, a big bang in its own right. This is a possible explanation for the origin of our universe. However, Hawking radiation, (highly probable phenomenon but has not been observed to a satisfactory degree to treat it as a certainty) degrades black holes over time via annihilation, eventually erasing the black hole and returning its energy to our universe. This would seem to be a hurdle to the idea that a black hole is the furnace of creation, but there is so much we don't know when it comes to this part of physics that it is impossible to say for sure. Perhaps a singularity is just a catalyst that allows unimaginably great amounts of energy to leak out of another universe or the m-theory postulated hyper plane into a new universe.<br><br>TL:DR: No we don't live inside a black hole, but within the bounds of our current understanding of physics one may speculate that our universe may have been forged from a singularity in another universe without breaking any known laws.. </p>		</li>

			<p>according to one theory: when a black hole forms, spacetime is &quot;pinched off&quot; from the parent universe.  the matter inside recoils via torsion into a separate space-time resulting in inflation.  torsion has yet to be observed: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Cartan_theory" target="_blank">Einstein–Cartan</a>, but it may be possible?  also, if our parent black hole is rotating, supposedly, there will be a net when rotation of all galaxies is averaged.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is such a ridiculous notion. Of course we are not in a black hole. The region contained in a black hole's event horizon has an enormous gravitational field. That is certainly not the case for the space of our universe.</p>		</li>

			<p>I've had the same thought. However I think that after this supermassive black there could be some kind of explosion. We don't know that much really. We mostly take educated guesses on what we know. I just feel like all that matter in one place is just TOO much. BOOM! Universe restart? <br>   Day 1.....</p>		</li>
