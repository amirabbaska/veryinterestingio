			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, not even theoretically could we EVER prove it. One explanation of the big bang was that it was the formation of our universe sized black hole. By this extension, our black holes conceivablely could contain universes of their own. </p>
<p>I'm not convinced by this hypothesis but I'm unsure how widely accepted it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The schwarzschild radius of the observable universe is smaller than the observable universe, though only slightly. What this means is that the observable universe doesn't have sufficient mass/energy relative to its volume to become a black hole. So no we don't live inside a black hole per se. That said as you pointed out according to the big bang theory the universe burst forth from a singularity. Aside from containing many orders of magnitude more energy than the black holes within our universe, this singularity would be indistinguishable from the singularities they contain. (IE infinitely small and infinitely dense). All of our current physics break down when dealing with these infinities, so we can't say for sure what happens in a singularity, perhaps it explodes outwards through new dimensions that don't intersect with those our universe experiences, a big bang in its own right. This is a possible explanation for the origin of our universe. However, Hawking radiation, (highly probable phenomenon but has not been observed to a satisfactory degree to treat it as a certainty) degrades black holes over time via annihilation, eventually erasing the black hole and returning its energy to our universe. This would seem to be a hurdle to the idea that a black hole is the furnace of creation, but there is so much we don't know when it comes to this part of physics that it is impossible to say for sure. Perhaps a singularity is just a catalyst that allows unimaginably great amounts of energy to leak out of another universe or the m-theory postulated hyper plane into a new universe.</p>
<p>TL:DR: No we don't live inside a black hole, but within the bounds of our current understanding of physics one may speculate that our universe may have been forged from a singularity in another universe without breaking any known laws.. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>according to one theory: when a black hole forms, spacetime is &quot;pinched off&quot; from the parent universe.  the matter inside recoils via torsion into a separate space-time resulting in inflation.  torsion has yet to be observed: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Cartan_theory" target="_blank">Einsteinâ€“Cartan</a>, but it may be possible?  also, if our parent black hole is rotating, supposedly, there will be a net when rotation of all galaxies is averaged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a ridiculous notion. Of course we are not in a black hole. The region contained in a black hole's event horizon has an enormous gravitational field. That is certainly not the case for the space of our universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had the same thought. However I think that after this supermassive black there could be some kind of explosion. We don't know that much really. We mostly take educated guesses on what we know. I just feel like all that matter in one place is just TOO much. BOOM! Universe restart?
