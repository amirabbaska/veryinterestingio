What does that mean - he hasn't had to study anything in basic medicine (except for his specialty) since he graduated in 1986. I just finished our biochem block 2 months ago and have forgotten most of it already - Dr. Oz surely has forgotten it also.</p>
<p>I feel ya, though. The next time I have to tell my mother why Dr. Oz's bullshit won't work and she replies with &quot;But he's a doctor, you're just a med student,&quot; I will cut someone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What is supremely frustrating is that he IS a doctor and he SHOULD know better.</p>

<p>He's a cardiac surgeon.  This is an old memory, but I remember talking with another doctor about this topic, and his reply was essentially that surgeons are most driven by their own skill, rather than research and the scientific method.</p>
<p>There is literally an ego issue of &quot;I can solve this better with my hands than your new technique!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
