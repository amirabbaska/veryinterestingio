			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the beautiful things about paleontology is it's so interdisciplinary. Really, anything your daughter is interested in the natural world has paleontological applications. Once we get to university, most paleontologists study geology, zoology, or a little of both. Folks who want to study human and primate evolution tend to get anthropology degrees. But there are plenty of engineers, geneticists, physicists, and mathematicians who also do paleontology research. - Matt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for speeding up fossilization: there are a lot of ways to preserve organic materials in the fossil record. The loose working definition of a fossil is any biological evidence that is over 10,000 years old. So unfortunately we need to wait a while to get a true fossil from today. But if she's curious about speeding up the replacement of organic materials with inorganic materials to get a rock-like bone, adding heat, pressure, and water infused with minerals gets you along the way. There are researchers actively trying to replicate fossilization processes in labs with big pressure blocks and pumps to learn more about how fossils happen. It's an active area of research, and maybe one she can explore when she joins our ranks! - Matt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Please tell your daughter that she's awesome and she should keep rockin' at science! The more support and encouragement she needs, the better. A few months ago I heard about a young girl who was teased at school for liking dinosaurs, so a bunch of paleontologists wrote her letters to tell her what we do, and remind her that she's super cool for liking dinosaurs. It's amazing how much we can get boxed in, even at a young age. </p>
<p>I would say natural history museums have the ability to really keep kids (and adults, who am I kidding?) interested in natural history. They often have great kids' programs, so definitely check them out if you have a museum near you. Local universities often do outreach events, so keep an eye on those too! </p>
<p>One thing that's worth looking into as well would be computer coding. It's definitely not what you think about when you think paleontology, but the reality is that it's almost always a big part of our jobs. If she has any interest in that, definitely foster it! Same goes for math! It's hard to keep kids into it, but it is a huge help if you're interested in science! Plus once you get into it, it's like solving puzzles, so it's more fun than it seems at first. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I'd had more encouragement, too. It wouldn't have taken a lot. I had a teacher in middle school tell my mother I'd never be good at math, so she should keep her expectations low. I had straight As in math until I met that teacher, but from then on, I felt like I was struggling. It took a long time to realize I actually was good at math and science. I mean, if I wasn't <em>good</em>, I at least loved it enough to keep learning. Now I basically do statistics for a living. It still bothers me that that happened, but as a young kid I definitely trusted my teachers completely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many paleontological dig sites and museums that welcome volunteers. Examples: <a href="http://www.arlingtonarchosaursite.com/" target="_blank">Arlington Archosaur Site</a> and [Dinosaur Journey / Mygatt Moore Quarry]( <a href="https://museumofwesternco.com/dinosaur-journey/" target="_blank">https://museumofwesternco.com/dinosaur-journey/</a>). Some have age limits (usually high school), but others allow younger people to dig or work. See if something like this is available in your area, come out, and give it a try. This can also give you an opportunity to talk to paleontologists one-on-one and get their career path stories.</p>
<p>On the school side of things, all of us need to know a good mix of geology and biology. The specifics can vary, depending on your interests. “Biology” can funnel you through college majors in anatomy &amp; physiology, ecology &amp; evolutionary biology, etc. Once you get into college, or even high school if you have a university nearby, make sure to look into research opportunities. This is a great way to get involved in the field and see if you really like it.</p></div>		</li>
