<p>No.  Much less time has passed for you, so you only need the necessary supplies for your subjective time.</p>
</li>
<li>Time for math!  The time that's passed for you can be calculated by Tyou = Tothers x sqrt(1 - v^2 / c^2 ).</li>
</ol>
<p>Tothers= 8 lightyears / 0.999 lightyears/year = 8.</p>
<p>Tyou = 8 x sqrt (1 - 0.999^2 ) = 8 x 0.0447 = 0.358 years = a bit over 4 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to ask questions about relativity, you need to phrase your question from a relative position. When you say the trip takes a little over 8 years, from whose perspective are you observing? I assume you mean an observer on Earth, seeing Alpha Centauri 4 light-years away, watches as you fly at this high speed to the neighbor star and back. The observer sitting on Earth has spent a little over 8 years watching your trip. </p>
<p>Now, what about from your perspective on the spaceship? Travelling at 99.9% of the speed of light, the factor of change is about 22.4. This means that for every year you spend on your ship at that speed, 22.4 years pass on Earth. So, we know that on Earth, your trip took 8 years. With some basic algebra, we invert the factor of change, and find how long the trip took from your perspective. 8 divided by 22.4 and voila, your trip took approximately .36 years, or about 4 months. To answer your questions then, you would need about 4 months of supplies and you would have aged only 4 months compared to the now 8-years-older Earth observer.</p>
<p>This effect can be exaggerated even further by going even faster. The factor of change increases exponentially as you approach the speed of light, so whereas 99.9% had a factor of change of 22.4, 99.999% has a factor of change of 223.6, meaning you could do your round trip in about 13 days. On Earth, it would be slightly faster, just barely 8 years, but for you the change is pretty extreme.</p>
<p>Even faster and the trip is a stroll down the road. At about 99.999999999999% the speed of light, you'd finish your trip in just about a minute. For the observer, the difference would be barely noticeable. Still just over 8 years.</p>
<p>You might ask then, if Alpha Centauri is 4 light years away, and I can't go faster than the speed of light, how can I get there and back in one minute? I must be going faster than light! Nope. There's another crucial thing that happens to you and your spaceship when travelling so fast. Not only is time dilated, but space itself contracts along the direction you are traveling (by the same factor). Since it would take you 30 seconds to get to Alpha Centauri in that final scenario, space would also seem to shrink in that direction so that Alpha Centauri was only about 30 light-seconds away, or about 19 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon. Therefore, it would seem perfectly natural for you, travelling at 99.999999999999% the speed of light, to reach the star in 30 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So just to be clear:</p>
<p>I am in a spaceship that is going roundtrip to Alpha Centauri and back at 99.999% the speed of light. Because of the Lorentz Factor, my perception of time during my journey is only 13 days.</p>
<p>I have a twin brother that is an astronomer working with mission control on Earth. Using a special telescope, he tracks my entire journey. From my twin's Earth-based perception of time, it took 4 years for my craft to get to Alpha Centauri and 4 years back.</p>
<p>When we reunite, I've only aged 13 days while my twin has aged 8 years.</p>
<p><strong>I've got two other questions:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question #1</strong></p>
<p>Let's say I have two spaceships. </p>
<p>Ship A has a special chemical rocket that can accelerate the craft to 99.999% the speed of light.</p>
<p>Ship B is a perfect sphere. A special drive creates a bubble around the craft that bends space around it (the ship and the astronauts are not actually moving, but space is being moved around them).</p>
<p>Now, if both ships take that same journey to Alpha Centauri at 99.999% the speed of light, do both sets of astronauts age only 13 days? Or do the astronauts in Ship B age 8 years?</p>
<p><strong>Question #2</strong></p>
<p>I have a spaceship that can get to 99.999% the speed of light.</p>
<p>How long would it take to gradually accelerate the ship to 99.999% the speed of light in order to prevent the astronauts getting crushed by g-forces? (For the parameters: the ship cannot exert more than two Gs of force on the astronauts as it accelerates.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's imagine that I travel toward Alpha Centurai at a large enough fraction of c that I get there in just .00001 seconds from my reference frame.</p>
<p>If I'm understanding you correctly, it would then also seem to me that Alpha Centurai was only .00001 light seconds away from Earth, or about 3 km. Would I then also witness Earth being burnt to a crisp, ripped apart, and swallowed up by the foreign star?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting question. Earth would be fine. The confusion comes (as it always does with relativity) from a mixing up of reference frames. In the Earth reference frame, a planet sitting 3km from a star would be fried to a crisp, naturally. But this is not true for your spaceship's reference frame which is travelling near the speed of light. In that frame, in which the 4 light-years to Alpha Centauri appear as no more than .00001 light-seconds, the distance at which heat falls off and loses intensity is equally scaled. In fact, all things that involve distance along the direction you are travelling will be scaled appropriately. So being 3km away from the star ain't such a big deal for Earth because in your frame of reference, the heat from Alpha Centauri is negligible after only 3km.</p>
<p>Weird as it may be, when you start scaling time and distance, you have to scale <em>everything</em> that is dependent on them as well. This might even mean that for the near-light traveller, this contraction of space would not be observable, since everything that would suggest it was happening would be scaled along the same direction. As I understand it, there is a casual philosophical debate among physicists about whether this contraction actually occurs as we think of it, or if it some other incomprehensible phenomenon which is most easily understood by our idea of a &quot;contraction&quot;. Ultimately, it may not make a practical difference for us.</p></div>		</li>
