			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a sphere is also most logical if we assume a big bang and then some form of limited expansion in all direction - in 4 spatial dimensions with our visible universe being the 3-dimensional surface of that sphere.</p>
<p>There are also theories where the universe looks more like a saddle, but with an extra dimension, which is easier to bring in line with increased rates of expansion.</p>
<p>Both ideas mean that if we could leave the boundaries of our space, we might be able to find short cuts to far away places - ftl travel.</p>
<p>Current observation makes the universe seem extremely close to flat - if not completely flat. Which I personally have a little problem with because of a few issues - like an infinitely heavy big-bang which should immediately collapse into a black hole, or no known direction for curved space-time.</p>
<p>All more or less scientific estimates for the size of the total universe I'm aware of are somewhere around 46 billion light years, while the age we can look back into and which constitutes the visible universe is a radius of 13 billion light years if we have a steady expansion at the speed of light, a diameter of 26 billion years without inflation, and a circumference of 78 billion light years - which is why we have an event horizon beyond which we cannot see, and where we will never be able to travel to.</p>
<p>Inflation is what accounts for the difference in observed/known flatness/evenness (to put it simply) compared to what we would expect without it, increasing the size of the universe (beyond our observable bubble) significantly. Bets are anywhere from a humble increase to infinite expansion at the big bang.</p>
<p>Funny thing is that mathematically, the universe could be both a sphere and a saddle depending on the number of dimensions we look at. Imagine a ball consisting of pieces of paper radiating from the middle and getting more and more 'curvy' - or many saddles superimposed over each other at different angles and/or sizes to add a dimension. This way, we could get a flat impression for short and medium distances, but the further away we look, the more the flatness resembles a fata morgana in the desert.</p>
<p>Depending how 'folded' the universe is, other ideas also come into play - holographic universe, strange topographies (like the torus mentioned elsewhere), and many more. The 2-dimensional holographic universe idea (and anything less) does not seem to work, however.</p>
<p>The other extreme, which is even more mind-bending, is a more 'abstract' make-up of the universe. Kind of like a binary tree or a fractal, getting more and more complex, with space an illusion from us being inside of this 'simulation-like' universe. This universe would literally have no outside - similar to how it makes no sense to talk about an outside for more and more elaborate mathematical concepts being developed from simple arithmetics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then what's outside should be no different from what's in middle of the doughnut, since that is also just space beyond the boundaries of the doughnut shape. I think the perception problem has to do with our tendancy to visualize the shape of it externally in 3D space (which includes negative space and some sort of environment in which it resides), but if it is a model for everything, it can only be viewed from inside of itself, and if we try to imagine viewing it from beyond its boundaries then we are ripe for all kinds of thought conundrums (like the ones mentioned above). </p></div>		</li>
