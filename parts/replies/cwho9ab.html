<p>Citroëns were known for having absolutely fantastic suspensions... when they worked, which wasn't often since their hydraulic suspension system was absolutely byzantine to your average American mechanic that was used to leaf springs.</p>

<p>To clarify, it wasn't so much that Citroën's suspensions (or other equipment) were inherently unreliable (they weren't), just that they were effectively unserviceable in the US, for exactly the reason you mention. Corner gas station mechanics most familiar with the RWD live axles and pushrod V8s of Detroit iron found it hard to fathom the kind of unconventional advanced engineering coming out of European marques, so when pressed to service them, their make-do half-guesswork best efforts often just weren't good enough.</p>
<p>This adversely affected the reputations of other European marques as well, such as Saab -- the 99 and O.G. 900 ran a Triumph-derived slant-4 turned <em>backwards</em> with the accessories in back and flywheel in front, chain-driving a FWD transaxle mounted underneath the block -- and Fiat with their advanced SOHC and DOHC engines and transverse FWD powertrains. The Euro marques that did best here, such as Mercedes and BMW, stuck with relatively conventional (albeit highly refined and well built) powertrain and suspension technology backed up by superlative dealer maintenance support; the latter helped VW-Audi as well, even though their engineering was more adventurous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Literally every other time I get in that car it says &quot;Alert! Take To Workshop! Air Suspension Failure!&quot;</p>
<p>He should've bought a Miata like I recommended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Japan actually found the perfect balance of reliability versus complexity, not Germany as the previous commenter said.  The Miata is a great little car, but I'm more partial to the S2000 if you want a fun convertible.  RX-7 is amazing, but the rotary engine's apex seals were a nightmare.  Still one of the best looking cars ever produced, the Spirit-R model especially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Germany, there exists a very complex system for getting car repair shops the necessary education for fixing all types of cars. Some 40% of our repair shops are dealership workshops that only service the brand they're selling. The rest repairs all brands of cars. The latter receive information end equipment from specialized companies. Does this system exist in the US?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, of course not. American mechanics learn all of their knowledge from a single worn-out Model T schematic that gets passed from garage to garage as it slowly makes its way around the country. We actually don't have the concept of certification or licensing in the states at all. Anyone can be a doctor or a plumber or a mechanic if they're brave enough. </p>
<p>It works for mechanics though because American cars haven't changed in hundreds of years. They're all exclusively using foot power and giant rock wheels like you see in the Flintstones. There are no parallels between US cars and other countries' cars, and they don't often share platforms or parts. There's just too big of a technological divide. So give our poor old mechanics the benefit of the doubt when you take your fancy European spaceship to Earl's Corner Garage, because you're just so far ahead of us technologically that it's considered a divine miracle merely gazing upon such superior craftsmanship.</p></div>		</li>
