<p>The small quantities of pollen that get into honey are from flowers; hay fever is mostly due to an allergic reaction to tree and grass pollen (airborne pollens, not insect-borne).</p>
<p>Please stop propagating nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard research on honey and its role in building tolerance against allergens is spotty... In most instances, the pollen that irritates our sinuses comes from weeds and trees, but bees gather pollen from wildflowers or clover, no? So while their honey may contain some small bits and pieces of what is causing allergic symptoms, I'm not quite convinced that it can impact your immune system by any major degree. That said, I'm all about upping my local honey consumption, haha.
Sounds like a really interesting paper, I'd be pretty interested in reading it! Bees are truly amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fur pure honey it's a combination of hydrogen peroxides, low pH, high osmolarity and also other substances.</p>
<p>For diluted honey it's almost only hydrogen peroxide, which is released in higher amounts if water is added by conversion of glucose by glucose oxidase. But even if that's not present honey is still antimicrobal.</p>
