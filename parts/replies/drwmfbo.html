			<div class="markdown"><p>Some other preservatives mirror the water absorption effects of salt/sugar</p>
<p>There's 3 main additional types</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Antimicrobial: These are preservatives that will block the normal functioning of bacteria in food either stopping or slowing down their growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antioxidants: These will stop or slow down the oxidation process of fats and lipids that cause meat, etc to go rancid</p>
</li>
<li>Anti-enzymatic: These stop or slow down the enzymes in fruit, etc that cause them to ripen.    </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad had a PhD in chemistry. I learned to pronounce those fun chemicals like TBHQ, BHA, BHT, and EDTA (which are all group 2). Tertiary Butylated Hydroxyquinone, Butylatedhydroxyanisole, Butylatedhydroxytoluene, prevent fats from spoiling (antioxidant behavior). EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetracetate) is a chelating agent. This is actually prescribed to help resolve toxic metal poisoning like lead or mercury. The &quot;tetra&quot; means there are four binding sites that latch onto the metal and take it out of solution in the blood so it can be excreted through the kidneys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your knowledge is solid, I would add a few more definitions just for anyone curious about the chemistry here.  &quot;Chelate&quot; is a term originating from claws that basically refers to wrapping around something and clamping it from both sides, so the &quot;tetra&quot; part that you described is the key to chelation (hehe... sorry).  The more binding sites, or higher &quot;denticity&quot; (more teeth) of the chelator, typically means better latching/clamping ability (up to a point--there are other factors too, but that's more advanced inorganic chemistry).</p>
<p>TBHQ, BHA, and BHT are all benzene rings with a hydroxyl group and a (tert)butyl group attached with some other varied functional group, and behave quite similarly.  BHT is commonly used as an antioxidant in organic solvents like ethers, which can become explosive if they oxidize.  So it preserves not only food, but also the integrity/safety of laboratory chemicals as well!</p>
<p>Edit: clarified a thing</p>
<p>Edit 2: not sure why you're PMing me weird/aggressive messages mrhippo, I was only trying to provide additional information for curious redditors.  I'm sorry if I somehow offended you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, both salt and sugar act to preserve things, but they are never listed specifically as &quot;preservatives&quot; on packaging. When people talk about preservatives, they typically mean things that are added in much smaller amounts. A quick summary of what the FDA defines as preservatives is given <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/FoodAdditivesIngredients/ucm094211.htm#types" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>Many of these have chemical names we probably are not familiar with, but at their core they are pretty similar to other things (like salt, sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, etc) that we are used to, /u/fullylegitaccount gave a good summary of how they work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is largely dependent on context. When people talk about canning or pickling, they might mention salt or sugar specifically <em>as</em> preservatives.</p>
<p>EDIT: salt and sugar are listed on your link!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, there are six things that micro organisms need to survive. In Public Health, we refer to this as FAT TOM. Food, Acidity, Time, Temperature, Oxygen, and Moisture. You limit one or several of these and the organism cannot survive. Some examples are vacuum sealing or canning. You're limiting the organisms access to food (F) and oxygen (O). However, there are always exceptions. Some bacteria don't need oxygen and are anaerobic. So other means are put into place like adding preservatives that change the pH to make it more acidic (A) or limiting the amount of free water (M). (T)ime and (T)emperature should be self explanatory.  </p>
<p>Follow the recommended cooking instructions. Learn the minimum temp/time of different meats. Also, how the meat was prepared will change the cooking temp/time. A ground beef burger will have a higher temperature requirement than a beef steak. </p>
<p>Don't eat anything that's been sitting out for more than four hours that needed safety measures prior to being cooked and isn't being temperature controlled, temp held at &gt;135F or &lt;41F; the temperature between these two is referred to the <a href="https://eteknix-eteknixltd.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/sterlingarcher.jpg" target="_blank">danger zone</a>. This includes a lot of fruit and vegetables that have been cut. Like your skin, the outer layer acts as a barrier. Once the insides have been exposed it's vulnerable to infection. </p>
<p>I also get a lot of questions about expiration and best by dates. Expiration means it is no longer advised to eat after that day due to relative risk to safety, like drinking milk past expiration. You might get by with a few days passed, but it's a gamble. Best by means the quality of that food item is going to go down after that day. Think stale chips. They won't make you sick but they won't taste very well either. </p>
<p>I'll step off my soapbox now, but in my experience not enough people understand the importance of FAT TOM. </p></div>		</li>
