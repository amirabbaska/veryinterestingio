			<div class="markdown"><p>A big part of the difficulty in getting blue colours is that the human vision is biased. The receptors for blue are the least sensitive of the human eye, so unless the received light is a pretty &quot;clean&quot; blue, it is especially easy for the blue to get lost in the other colours. We can't really detect what the actual peak wavelength of light is, human eyes don't work that way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>today white LEDs use a blue LED plus phosphors to make red and green.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have some RGB LEDs which, as far as I can tell, have three separate LEDs. (And turning them all on produces white, of course.)</p>
<p>Is there any advantage to using a single blue LED + phosphors to generate white? Is it simply a cost thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;white&quot; from RGB is far less desirable of a white than that from a true white LED.  When your mix white from RGB, you get 3 sharp spikes on a color spectrum, and very little in between.  Yes, we more or less see this as white, but when you use it to actually illuminate something, you'll see that many colored objects look very dull.  A (good quality) white light source produces a wide spread of output on that spectrum.  You shine that &quot;real&quot; white light on those same colored objects, and you'll see their full actual color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The RGB LED approach looks good to the eye, but has poor color rendering making it good for mood lighting, but bad for illumination.  The R,G and B LEDs have very little overlap in spectrum meaning a color which falls between two LED colors will appear darker than it really is. </p>
<p>Single blue LED with phosphors are more efficient, and they have a broad spectrum due to the use of phosphors. </p></div>		</li>
