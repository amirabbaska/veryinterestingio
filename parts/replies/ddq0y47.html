			<div class="markdown"><p>Tactype, Linopress or Letraset were a few of the typesetting brands...press on letters. You used a <a href="http://www.forgottenartsupplies.com/_gallery_images/2506260220.jpg" target="_blank">special tool kinda like a solid pen</a> to transfer the letters from a transparency like film. <a href="http://3v6x691yvn532gp2411ezrib.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/story_images/20100917SAWG_fg02a.jpg" target="_blank">You would manually rub the letters off the sheet.</a> The letters would stick, most of the time not uniformly, to the paperboard or surface you were working with. <a href="http://pogledaj.to/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/letraset01.jpg" target="_blank">As you can imagine the whole process took some time.</a></p>
<p>Some used self adhesive letters and some used solid plastic letters with tiny pins in the back so you could quickly rearrange them for the next show.</p>
<p>Logos and special art was normally printed with block type and hot type or lithograph for full color. He already mentioned chroma. Yeah it was really hands on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man, I used so much Letraset for school projects when I was a kid, until my dad's work got a laser printer.  That was back in the 80s when even kids who used a computer to turn in projects would usually have it printed on dot-matrix printers.  So if you wanted it to look good, Letraset was your only option.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nailed it. I used Letraset a lot in my youth and I seem to recall hearing about Linopress as well but 25 years later I am still fairly sure I never was exposed to Tactype. I was in the North East USA those years, Providence RI or Eartern Connecticut. I wonder if it was a regional thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would probably like <a href="https://youtu.be/agS6ZXBrcng#t=05m10s" target="_blank">this old video</a> on the making of the old HBO intro and logo. I linked to the logo part, but I suggest watching the whole thing. I remember how cool I thought this was when I was a little kid. It's so wonderfully dated, now.  </p>
<p>Edit: This is really not remotely like what op asked about, but for some reason it's what popped in my head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a similar vein, the old BBC spinning globe ident is fascinating.</p>
<p>They actually had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noddy_(camera)#The_BBC1_mirrored_globe" target="_blank">real physical globe</a> that they'd actually spin and point the camera at before each news show. It's amazing how labor intensive stuff like that used to be.</p>
<p>Edit- real link <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noddy_(camera" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noddy_(camera</a>) since I can't figure out how to do a markdown link with brackets in it</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here's a post from 9 months ago about it and other &quot;pre-CG&quot; stuff</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in television now, and the terms are identical, even though they're all done via computers nowadays.  You still need a luma or chroma key to add your titles.  We also occasionally use a matte key, which is another pre-computer option:  You cut the letters out and apply them directly to the film.  This wasn't used as often because, obviously, you have to recreate it perfectly for each frame.  Used more often with computers, however, because it's pixel-perfect.</p>
<p>We also now use the &quot;Ani-matte key&quot; which is an animated matte key whereby each frame of the cutout can be a different size, shape, or position.  This is how we do lots of old camera trick effects, such as making everything greyscale except for a red dress, or turning the shape of a person into a glowing light.  It's also used for mundane things, like blurring out the face of someone or greeking out the brand name of a product you don't have the rights to.</p>
<p>One more bit of trivia related to what you said:  I once had to re-create the font from MacGuyver for a different TV show.  Turns out, that's not a real font.  It has a copperplate bold look, but with additional serifs that aren't found in any copperplate library.  I had to add them all by hand using...  you guessed it... a matte key.  The original lettering was apparently hand painted and no logotypes were saved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started video and tv in the late 80s or early 90s and preferred hand drawing my titles and keying them out. I could do much more with a physical title at the time than a computer graphic such as floating the camera around the title. That's even how the Star Wars opening crawls were done and probably where I got the idea to do it that way. </p>
<p>Hell, even today I'll still sometimes hand draw art work and shoot it. I like the more organic feel to the titles. </p></div>		</li>
