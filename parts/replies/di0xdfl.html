<p>This is also equal 1/4 the event horizon area measured in Planck areas. </p>

<p>Wait a second...</p>
<p>Looking at the formula, it <em>pretty much</em> looks like every Planck area is basically one &quot;bit&quot; of entropy (using the information-theoretic definition). </p>
<p>And the (1/2)^2 factor looks pretty arbitrary to the definiton of Planck length.</p>
<p>And after that you guys tell me that Planck length is not the pixel size of the Universe? Because it behaves exactly like a 2-state pixel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) this is in nats, not in bits. But this is a minor point.</p>
<p>2) if it was like a pixel size for the Universe, the maximum entropy, which is the total microscopic information, in a given region of space would be proportional to the number of 3D pixels, which is proportional to the volume. However, this formula clearly tells you the maximum entropy is proportional to the bounding area. So that's a non-starter.</p>
<p>In more precise language, the entropy has a holographic character which implies a quantum-gravitational theory <em>cannot</em> be local. Which means that no sensible &quot;pixely&quot; interpretation for the Planck length exists.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Eli5? I've seen the word &quot;holographic&quot; thrown around a lot on the topic of black holes and entropy / information storage on the event horizon. What does the word mean in this context?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. Let's picture a 2D-theory on the boundary that works with 2D pixels the size of the Planck length, and is dual to some 3D model. Would it work? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Black holes are maximum entropy in a given volume. If more volume is available, then there are states of even more entropy with thermalized &amp; incoherent radiation occupying the available volume. This is why BHs decay through Hawking radiation: the final state of the Hawking radiation has more entropy and occupies a much larger space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That seems to go against usual assertions about black holes.</p>
<p>btw, ive read a few days ago that Black body radiation seems to create its own attracting force, separate from other fundamental forces, and dependent on topology of space around the body.

<p>Hawking radiation does not escape the black hole, rather it's produced by the stretched horizon.</p>

<p>Afaiu this is only relevant for very high temperature bodies such as neutron stars. Black holes are <em>extremely</em> cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as far as i understand Hawking radiation will ultimately evaporate a black hole, although in more time then universe is supposed to last, so it seems as if something from the inside is transfered out however indirect it may be.</p>
<p>Of course i may have misunderstood that whole deal.</p>

<p>They may be but they are hotter then absolute zero.
And they do emit thermal radiation... while distorting the topology of space around them a lot.</p>
<p>Just wandering. Im aware i cant get any definitive answers right now. But it makes one wonder.</p></div>		</li>
