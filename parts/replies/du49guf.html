			<div class="markdown"><p>T1 Diabetic here. I don't really have anything to add that someone hasn't already said, but I learned when doing a research paper that there was a time when Diabetes was referred to as &quot;The Pissing Evil&quot; and I think that's hilarious, because it's so bluntly accurate. Without insulin, T1s will just drink copious amounts of water, pee immediately, and continue until they die. IIRC, Egypt's word for it loosely translated into &quot;honey pee&quot; because of the sugar in the urine attracting ants and such. Diets similar to the keto diet attempted to prolong life (there is a &quot;honeymoon period&quot;), but even then, you can't survive once your pancreas is completely done working. Thank God for Dr. Banting and his team for discovering insulin and it's purpose in the 1920's.</p>
<p>Anyway, the information is there, it's just not widely discussed unless you seek it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a good friend that is a T1 diabetic, but he wasn't diagnosed until he was in his late 20s because he was in such great shape. The doctor didn't even believe it had taken so long to detect it and was amazed he wasn't dead already.</p>
<p>As an asthmatic I guarantee I would have died in my teens if not earlier. After my f**king gym teacher made me run a mile despite my protests that I was having issues and my inhaler wasn't handling them, I &quot;ran&quot; the mile, passed out at the finish line, and woke up in the ER after getting oxygen and an adrenaline shot. Shithead then gave me a D for that run and made it 40% of our overall grade, so it was the worst grade I got in Jr High. When I came back to class he told me I needed to &quot;toughen up&quot; and &quot;build endurance&quot; to succeed in his class. My mom (a nursing instructor) had it out with him after I told her that shit, but he refused to change the grade or his ways. This is why former drill instructors that don't ever see asthmatics because they are rejected in pre-screening should never teach gym class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to point out that your friend didn’t have T1 his whole life. Being in good shape doesn’t delay T1 symptoms.  He came down with it in his 20s. You’d only be able to survive a year or so max with the disease without insulin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your friend may have simply not developed T1 Diabetes until his late 20s. It can develop at almost any age, which is why we recently stopped calling it &quot;juvenile&quot; Diabetes. (Also, because, apparently, that makes some people think you &quot;grow out of it&quot;.)</p>
<p>Oh, man, that story about your gym teacher pisses me off and I wasn't even there. Legally, he couldn't even do that. If your mom really wanted to take it far, she could have gotten a lawyer. A little ridiculous over a gym grade, but, as they say, it's the principle of it. I have a lot of horror stories from my grade school days about teachers not understanding chronic illnesses. </p>
<p>MY middle school gym teacher talked to my school nurse about why every other gym session, I had to sit out. I was having trouble keeping my blood sugar stable (lady problems and hormones do that, I was like 12...) &quot;Doesn't exercise make her blood sugar go <em>down</em>?&quot; he'd ask. Well, yeah, buddy, but not when it's close to 400. Above 250, it's recommended you sit down and get a nice bottle of water, because you don't want your sugar-blood straining your heart and veins and stuff. We're not requiring medical attention for fun. </p>
<p>Very thankful for modern medicine. I'm glad you can breath!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, like many other illnesses, they weren't well documented or they didn't know anything about them at all at the time. I'm sure there are plenty of things going around today that we know nothing about and this exact question will be asked in 500 years from now about those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SIDS is also a real thing as some babies literally forget to breathe. There are risk factors that make certain babies more at risk, premature, parents smoking/drinking, being a boy, low socio-economic status, amongst a few other risk factors.</p>
<p>The reason some of them are risk factors are due to parents bed sharing:</p>
<p>Drinking/drugs - more likely to roll on to baby without noticing and suffocate them</p>
<p>Low socio-economic status - more likely to have a hand me down mattress that has become too soft so a baby might not be properly supported and therefore their airway is not as open. </p>
<p>Premature - lungs have taken longer to develop and therefore their airway may already be slightly compromised. A lower weight also adds to the risk of stopping breathing.</p>
<p>Sometimes it does happen even when all risks have been minimised. A lot of SIDS occurs from parents bed sharing with babies who have a lot of risk factors for SIDS. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He couldn't. Diabetes 1 back then effectively didn't exist as a&quot;medical condition&quot;, you just died very quickly. </p>
<p>They're talking type 2, which was also considerably more rare (in comparison to today). Food is much more carb rich and calorie dense today, in large part due to everything being made of HFCS. </p>
<p>Diabetes 2 back then would be difficult to get, because so much of the &quot;common man's&quot; food was stuff like fruit or meat or bread or rice or whatever. There was no hypersugary soda, not really candy in the same way we have it today.</p>
<p>That being said, there was still sugary food (pies, baked goods) but it didn't make sense for most people to eat it every meal. Rich people could though</p>
<p>Edit: people with type 1 DB could expect to live like 2 months to a year after it &quot;starts&quot;. It is possible for someone to not get type1 until adulthood, but it is rare. Most men get it somewhere from childhood to early 20s, women get it a few years later than that on average.</p>
<p>Double edit: to all of the people telling me about relatively rare conditions where you get type 1 as an adult, that's why I said it was rare lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very doubtful unless he secretly knew about insulin. Type 1 was an awful disease before insulin because there was only one treatment, and it involved forced dieting. Essentially it is a wasting disease exacerbated by metabolism of food, so by not eating much food you could slow it down. Once diagnosed, I believe that even on a total-fast diet the longest you might live was less than 5 years. This disease also typically presents as a child.</p></div>		</li>

There is no way he had it throughout his life.  Type 2 diabetes is typically a disease of the obese or the elderly.  So also not Alexander the Great. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a misconception.  You can get Type 2 as an active, middle-aged person.  It's less common, but possible.</p></div>		</li>
