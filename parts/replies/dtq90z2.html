			<div class="markdown"><p>You're spot on, and you add to this, you have the coarse sodium crystals rubbing on an open wound, tearing and exposing even more flesh and nerves. It's like sandpaper on a piece of meat.</p>
<p>FYI: Please don't rub salt on a wound. Bandaids and antibiotic ointment after a good washing will do fine most of the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I dont know why people still advocate for using salt. It's more painful and less helpful than a dab of Neosporin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't &quot;advocate&quot; for it, but it's cheap and often available when I'd have to go to a store to buy Neosporin. I don't <em>rub</em> salt on wounds though, I apply very salty water to them.  But it might be because I'm an old sailor and I just think salt water cures all problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know why I never made the connection until now that anyone would choose to willingly put salt on a wound yet using saltwater for a sore throat or mouth issues seems totally fine. But fuck that pain I’ll use neosporin lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, same here. I've never heard of anyone putting salt on a wound on purpose, maybe old timey folks? And ocean water, hell no. That shit is filthy. </p>
