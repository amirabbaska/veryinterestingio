<p>All of the sleep stages serve important functions for mental and physical health. Different hormones are released throughout. </p>
<p>Skipping one or elongating the other has negative side effects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But as the ELI5 stated (admittedly with no source) the body automatically lengthens REM as needed. So what's the difference between us doing it and our brain doing it? Just a &quot;our brain knows better than we know,&quot; kinda thing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As replied previously, each cycle serves an important role in sleep as a whole. Skipping steps leads to detriments and other effects that would counter any benefits you get from sleeping as a whole. The brain and human body isn't like a computer where you can simply flick an on/off switch. There is actually a whole &quot;shut down&quot; sequence that you brain performs to signal the start of sleep and a &quot;wake-up&quot; process that signals the end of sleep called the reticular signaling system if I recall correctly. If your brain doesn't perform these steps properly and in the right order, you begin to have sleep related neurological symptoms, like narcolepsy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Guess I'll elaborate further and on sleep deprivation and sleep debt (Great, and here I thought I only had student debt!). Your assumption that sleeping the same 8 hrs (or x hours) every night means you will wake up from the same stage of sleep is mistaken. </p>
<p>As I mentioned before, the sleep stages, especially 1/2, are moderated in length to adjust for the body's needs. When you are injured/exhausted/ill, your body needs more restorative sleep, thus your body alters your cycle, for instance 10-10-10-40-20 cycle, putting emphasis on stage 4 sleep to promote rejuvenation. In other circumstances, that cycle might be 15-15-20-20-20 or any other variation or permutation. Now imagine if you only slept 90 mins, these examples I listed are exactly 90 min cycles, thus if you wake up at the 90 min mark on the spot, you will wake up between the end of the REM cycle and start of Stage 1. However, the sleep cycle is not limited or restricted to a 90 min cycle, like all things in nature, there is a natural deviation of upper and lower limits, really a spectrum of highs and lows; we just understand that the 90 min cycle is an average of time for each cycle and thus use it as the basis.</p>
<p>Now take into account that the cycle is not limited to 90 mins, it can actually vary from 70-120 mins per cycle, depending on which iteration/ number of cycle you are on and what your body's purpose for sleep is. Imagine OP hurt his/her leg, real bad, OP needs time to recover, his/her body understands this. So now we surmise that OP needs Lots of stage 4 sleep, so much so that instead of the standard 90 min cycle, his/her cycle is now 10-10-10-60-30 totaling an impressive 120 mins. What happens now if he/she were to wake up exactly at the 90 min mark? Well, instead of waking up in between the end of REM and start of Stage 1, OP is now waking up between the end of Stage 4 and the start of REM. Thus OP is now waking up exhausted rather than rejuvenated. We took the extreme case here and stipulated that OP had a physical injury. Now replace the leg injury with any other stress factor, such as: bad day at work, working 12 hours instead of 8, broke up with an SO, learned a lot in class that day. Each of these stress factors can moderate the amount of sleep cycle stages your body needs, and it is smart enough to adjust accordingly. It may not be an extreme shift, but even a few mins here or there for each stage of sleep will mean if you wake up exactly at the 90 min mark, you may be waking up at varying stages of your sleep cycle. </p>
<p>So now instead of thinking in terms of 90 mins, we increase the time of sleep you are sleeping per night to 8 hours. You will now go through not just 1 sleep cycle, but multiple cycles in succession. If we take our original 10-10-10-40-20 example and cycle it for 8 hours (480 mins in 8 hours) and wake up exactly at the 480 min mark, we will be waking up (480/90 = 5 cycles + 30 mins into 6th cycle) between Stage 3 and Stage 4 sleep of the 6th sleep cycle, thus probably exhausted and disorientated. But keep in mind, as your body goes through sleep cycles, it prefers to shorted Stage 1/2 and lengthen Stage 4 and REM. So while you may start with a 20-20-20-20-10 cycle, you may end with a 5-5-5-10-65 cycle, thus going back to our calculations (480/90 = 5 cycles +30 mins into 6th cycle) we will be waking up in the midst of REM, waking up refreshed and probably wondering what we were dreaming about just now. If you're still following along, we will now throw in the natural deviation portion of sleep cycles, imagine that first cycle is 70 mins long, 2nd cycle 90 mins long, 3rd 80, etc (I'm being clean and over simplifying here, nature is never so clean cut, just keep in mind those cycles can be 91 mins , 76 mins, 112 mins, etc). Our calculations just got a whole lot messier, and now if we wake up exactly at the 8 hr (480 min) mark, we may wake up in the midst or between any of the sleep cycle stages. We might not even make it to the 6th sleep cycle!</p>
<p>How does sleep deprivation and sleep debt mix in with all this? Well, image you are a college student, learning ALOT (hopefully) which means your brain needs a lot of sleep to consolidate the information and form memories to be recalled later (midterms and finals, also the relation of Sleep to cognitive abilities such as Memory are highly linked and a very deep rabbit hole, but basically more sleep = better memory). So College Student (CS) now requires 12 hours of sleep instead of 8 to be fully rejuvenated and energetic. But we all know 12 hours of sleep for a CS is laughably impossible, studying all night (partying all night) really just means 5 hours of sleep/night. So what happens when CS needs 12 hours but only sleeps 5? well CS takes out a loan with the sleep bank and now owes CS bank of sleep 7 hours of sleep to reach the same level of restfulness as 12 hours. But that doesn't mean CS can just sleep 19 hrs the next night to pay back that debt! Like all debt, there is interest, how much that is, that depends on the terms and conditions you signed with your bank of sleep. Basically you need to pay back more than the 7 hrs you took a loan on. Did I mention that sleep debt compounds and is additive? Imagine that CS is only sleep 5 hrs/night Monday-Friday, that is a butt load of sleep debt CS is incurring! So much so that it really is impossible to completely pay off (and here you thought your student debts seemed staggeringly high) not to mention the debt is now compounded between those 5 nights. </p>
<p>Remember those stress factors we talked about before? Well, OP/CS is now officially Exhausted. He/she now owes a lot of sleep debt and requires a lot of rejuvenating Stage 4. OP's body will adjust accordingly and stretch/lengthen or truncate/shrink sleep stages and cycles to try and make up for the sleep debt, not only to try and pay back the CS Bank of sleep, but also to reach a restored and refreshed state of wellness.</p>
<p>Taking all that I've discussed into account, even if you are sleeping 8 hours a day every day, you will be waking up at varying stages of your sleep cycle almost daily. That is until you are sleeping so regularly that your circadian rhythm is now better adjusted and your body has acclimated to a new sleep requiring homeostatic point. This is why it is critical to keep a consistent pattern of sleep if you wish to wake up refreshed every morning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, I really appreciate the time you put in.  However, I still don't see how your response answers the question.  If a person sleeps from 4-12 instead of 12-8, why should that person feel bad?  In that case, the person would not be taking out a loan.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, yes. Your body doesn't complete start over. It may pass through other stages to get there, but it'll be very quickly. </p>
<p>Where this varies is the circumstances under which you woke up and if any stressors are continuing even after falling asleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a tough thing to do, the best way to make sure you are waking up refreshed is to have enough time allotted for sleep and to try and avoid alarms so that your body wakes up naturally. Another thing is circadian rhythm. Schedule your sleeping times, if you consistently sleep at 9 pm and wake up at 6 am, then your body will naturally adjust your biological clock and you will notice yourself being more energetic. </p>
<p>Notice I said 9-6 for 9 hours of sleep. Depending on your age, your body Needs different volumes of sleep. In your adolescent years, a typical child will need 6-8 hours of sleep, as you age and progress into your teen-20's you will actually need 9-12 hours. This reason being that at this age, you are more likely to be in school/college, which is feeding your brain a Load of information. Information which your brain needs sleep to consolidate and form memories to retain that newly learned information. Proper amounts of sleep will increase your cognitive abilities in the memory and recall department. There are quite a few papers that have been published on sleep-memory, though I'm being lazy and not citing sources (it is ELI5 after all).</p>
<p>If however, you are asking about how to be conscious while in REM sleep, I believe that there are a few guides online to explain how to promote the chances of that; I have not personally tried or attempted such things, but I do have some bouts of conscious dreaming.</p></div>		</li>
