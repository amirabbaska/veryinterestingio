			<div class="markdown"><p>That second one always rang truest to me. Isn't there some special term for that: a trait that may reduce the likelihood of procreation in one gender, but increases it enough in the other gender to make up for it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Going with an assumption genetics are involved: would it be equally possible that homosexuality is only a side effect of some other trait that was selected for/selected out?  For example, similar to the influence selecting for bipedalism had on the female skeleton, human childbirth and therefore childhood brain development? </p>
<p>Here's my understanding, which may be wrong: the branch point to become bidpedal ultimately changed the childbirth game because it required female human hips to narrow to support the upper part of the skeleton. This narrowing decreased the size of the birth canal, which then influenced how developed a human brain could become in the womb. It would need to be small enough to fit through a narrower birth canal of a bidpedal species. This explains why humans are born with unfused skulls, smaller, under-developed brains, and can't do basic tasks like walk on their own for up to a year (whereas other animals can typically accomplish this within days to weeks of birth). This was the trade off made to walk on two feet - babies that required far more parental attention with far longer childhoods. </p>
<p>Now, in that long chain of events - all because we decided to walk on two feet - isn't it possible some other traits/genes were also selected/deselected just as a side effect of the process? I mean traits that may have had no direct role in the changing of the skeleton or childbirth? More like, &quot;in the noise&quot;. Does that make sense? Not sure if I've explained this well...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was having a conversation with a friend one time about this topic. Couldn't sexual orientation be simplified as a type of kink. For example there's not a gene that would make one attracted to feet (same sex or not) and there's no gene that would make someone into having balloons popped on them for sexual pleasure, it's just what they are into. It's something in their brain that turns them on sexually. </p>
<p>Could sexual orientation be something along these lines? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can correlate adult sexual orientation with factors that happen before birth, for instance birth weight and handedness (we observe foetuses have a preferences for sucking one hand versus the other even before they're born).</p>
<p>We don't know exactly how kinks form, but they're believed to start happening later in life. There may be a process of conditioning that form kinks. For instance, in one experiment people were shown pornographic images plus a picture of a triangle. After seeing this several times, seeing a picture of a triangle was enough to arouse them.</p></div>		</li>
