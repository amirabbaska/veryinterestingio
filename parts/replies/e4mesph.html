			<div class="markdown"><p>I can easily imagine the lower case R starting as just a smaller version of the Upper R but over time due to laziness(or translation through time), the the rounding became smaller and smaller. And the leg became closer and closer to the stem until it morphed into wht we know today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course. To make it not so ELI5:</p>
<p>The old Roman cursive, also known as Majuscule or Capitalis cursive was an all Uppercase style of writing. It’s hardly readable and for example B and D look very much alike. New Roman Cursive, also known as Minuscule cursive evolved from it and was an all lowercase style of writing. If you look it up, you’ll notice the letters look pretty close to our current way of writing but not quite the same. Both the ORC and the NRC had their influence of newer styles of writing like Gaelic type and we slowly evolved from there being more and more efficient and probably lazy too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shit </p>
<p>lowercase l and uppercase i are basically written as the same letter. Most people I know don't go out of the way to write an i like 'I' it's usually handwritten as l.</p>
<p>Then again, most people I know are foreigners, so that could just as easily be on them.</p>
<p>Fuck, now I have something to look for in my English teaching.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real source of our current-day printed (i.e. Antiqua) lowercase letterforms is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolingian_minuscule" target="_blank">Carolingian minuscle</a> -- it was designed for legibility, unifying a gazillion of variations used all over Europe. Of course that was based on earlier forms, but the Carolingan minuscle is a focal point.</p>
<p>It's designed to be written by a feather, always pulling, never pushing it, unlike lots of other modern and ancient cursives. Provides for a certain clarity and indeed it's superbly legible.</p>
<p>Our current capital letters are completely identical to the script the Romans used to engrave on stone. Medieval writers were using those more &quot;bold&quot; forms as first letters of paragraphs etc and thus, over time, both types of fonts got combined into one and the current schizophrenic Latin alphabet was born. It's, too my knowledge, the only one that has such a split and humanity came up with a lot of alphabets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's much younger -- I guess it's an influence from Latin. Cyrillic also <em>kind of</em> has lower case letters, but in print it's mostly small caps.</p>
<p>All three are intimately related and i guess I shouldn't have put my foot in my mouth, what I really wanted to say is that e.g. the Japanese or Korean alphabets don't have that distinction. Hebrew and Arabic neither.</p></div>		</li>
