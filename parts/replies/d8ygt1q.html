<p>A detonator is basically a very, very small bomb that's used to set off the actual bomb. Think of it like a little firecracker you stick into the bomb to set off the bomb. They are much easier to set off, so you have to be a lot more careful with detonators than you are with your bombs, but the upside is that a detonator exploding prematurely might give one dude a nasty injury rather than level half of the town like having a half-ton of whatever explosive you're carrying around going off would.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should also be noted that although C4 and plastic explosives can be set off using a detonator cap, airborne bombs are typically even more stable than C4 and actually have a 2-stage detonator where the detonator triggers a booster charge which in turn triggers the main charge.</p>
<p>Until the primary detonator is armed you can pretty much crash the plane without the booster or main charge detonating. This is how you end up with unexploded cluster munitions - the charge is so stable you can literally drop it from 30,000ft and if the primary detonator fails the thing just buries itself on impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because there's always a chance of it going off, and what would you rather complain to the government that you can't hike your favorite trail or that their bomb blew up your family? It's very unlikely, but it's safer for everyone to stay out of the area until cleared.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because although it hasn't exploded, they don't know what condition the bomb or bomblet is in.</p>
<p>The primary detonator might not have <em>failed</em>, it might have only been pushed in 90% of the way to set it off, and as soon as someone comes and kicks it, turns it over with a plough or some toddler picks it up, boom.</p>
<p>Although the main charge is stable it must be assumed to be armed and thus dangerous. The point is though, that until you fully arm the primary detonator, you can play catch with no worries about dropping them. Similarly if a plane crashes with a cargo of unarmed nukes, the bombs won't detonate. There is a risk the isotopes could leak, but no mushroom cloud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Along with the other answers you have received, many of these areas are created by &quot;legacy&quot; issues- ordnance we dropped during WWII wasn't made using the same materials, specifications, and technology as those which we use today. One of the classics is picric acid (PA), which was used as bomb fill for years... up until someone figured out it would react with the bomb casing to form metal picrates, which will explode if you taunt them hard enough.</p>
<p>Plus, once it's sat in mud for several decades, who's to say what's safe and what's not?</p>
<p>The other reason is that many of these areas that are host to landmines (probably the single largest problem with unexploded ordnance) are designed to do just that: area denial weapons made to make a location intrinsically unsafe. Some of these items are relatively crude, and (frankly) a well-made bomb that is designed to be delivered on (say) a B-52 is going to be built to a much higher standard than a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POMZ" target="_blank">POMZ-2</a> anti-personnel mine. Professional soldiers are predictable, but the world is full of dangerous amateurs; ordnance is much the same way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had the chance of playing around with a bit of nitroglycerine and it is not as reactive as people think, on small quantities.. So a drop can fall probably freefall speed and not explode. It needs pressure, basically being between two objects to go off and then it doesn't take a lot. A ruler will do just fine. On large quantities, i'm sure splashing a whole bottle worth may explode but you can pour it in and out, transport it with precautions of course. I think it was fulminates that are insanely explosive, friction-sensitive..feather touch... </p>
<p>Nitroglycerine can still be produced in quite high amounts without worries and moved around, just as long we never give it a sharp shock in pressure. And you can burn it too without detonation, it is not very sensitive to heat either. But just tiny, tiny piece of it of it having a sharp velocity change, quick pressure change it acts as it's own detonator, like sloshing inside a container too violently and then it all goes, very very fast.. Most likely, even if you shake it, is wouldn't go off but no one is willing to try. I will stay the hell away in liquid form as such conditions are hard to ensure.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every explosion needs 2 things energy (usually heat in the form of a fuse, though electricity is becoming more and more common) and pressure. Some things just require a LOT less of both of these in order to explode (i.e. Nitroglycerin). You're definitely not wrong, at least according to what I've been taught, and my entire life literally revolved around explosives for 8 years.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really true.  Depending on the explosive they can be set off without pressure.  Primary explosives particularly.  </p>
<p>Secondary explosives usually require containment in order to actually explode rather than just burn.  </p>
<p>I worked in an explosives lab for a few years.  I've personally set them off with just heat.  Lol.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Dynamite </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which is, essentially, nitroglycerine soaked in something absorbent with some stabilisers splashed in to make it a bit less troublesome.</p>
<p>It's more stable than nitro, but 'more stable than nitro' and 'stable' are very much not the same thing; one shouldn't play fetch with dynamite sticks.</p>
<p>Of course, as the dynamite ages, some of the nitroglycerine will 'sweat' its way free, at which point you're back to playing with straight nitro again, only the label on the box still says that it's dynamite.</p></div>		</li>
