			<div class="markdown"><p>You should be thinking of a photon like you would a number (representing its energy). If I give you the number 5, you can split it in to 2 + 3. Does that mean that the 2 and 3 existed all along? I guess you could say so. But I can just as easily split it into 1 + 4, or 2.5 + 2.5, so it doesn't seem like deciding that 5s are made of 2s and 3s put together makes much sense.</p>
<p>Atoms, on the other hand, are more like a red thing and a blue thing tied together. You can cut the rope and split them, but it's not like you could split it into one ball that is 1/3 red and 2/3 blue, and another that is 1/3 blue and 2/3 red.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If just as easily 2 and 3 existed all along, could not then 5 have existed simultaneously without necessitating simultaneity or exclusivity?  Such concepts seem extraneous to a conceptualization of such.</p>
<p>edit: Upon further review, this seems your point; do me the favor of correcting if I am not</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>short version: No, you add enough energy to the photon that it can (or has to) spawn off a new, separate photon. This can be done ad infinitum, and there are not an infinite number of photons in a single spot to begin with, so each one really is 'new'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really accurate. When the photon interacts with something like a crystal, sometimes two photons are emitted at the end of the interaction instead of one. These photons will have energy equal to or less than the original photon. &quot;Adding energy&quot; to a photon isn't done; they don't experience time so photons are created with a certain energy and will have that energy until they have an interaction. The resultant photon is usually characterized as a new photon. Besides, photons can have arbitrarily large energy and will never spontaneously decay into multiple photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try not to think of a photon as a tangible thing as we do with objects we interact with in our daily lives. Think of a photon as a point in space in the middle of a wave propagating through space time. When a photon is split what you are really doing is creating 2 smaller waves from the larger one. Now that you have 2 waves you have 2 new points you can call a photon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the photon is made of only 1 particle.</p>

<p>Wait, but what about quarks? Isn't protons and neutrons composed of different kinds of quarks? And if they aren't considered particles, what are they then?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>those 2 new photons didn't exist before the split</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So as far as I understand quarks can kinda appear and disappear randomly in the same &quot;system&quot;/particle - <em>as long as the sum of them still make up the right particle</em> e.g proton. So splitting up a proton would be tearing the quarks apart? Does the energy used to splitting the proton, &quot;make up&quot; the new quarks that makes the two new protons &quot;whole&quot;?</p>
<p>*Sorry to all particle/quantum physicists, I definitely don't know all the right terms, and probably misunderstood something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're confusing photons with protons. Protons are in the nucleus of an atom and are made of quarks. Photons are &quot;particles&quot; of light, and are the force-carrier of the electromagnetic force.</p></div>		</li>
