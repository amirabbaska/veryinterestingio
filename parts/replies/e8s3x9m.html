			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, solid state and the acceptance specs for the package are mad in terms of the environmental harshness that it must survive without data loss.</p>
<p>One of the highlights is that the enclosure must cope with prolonged exposure to aircraft chemical toilet fluid. Along with all the other types of fluid that might be present on an aircraft. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you shred a tape you only damage the parts that the cutter tears apart which is a very small part of the overall surface area of the tape. So a shredded tape is just slightly damaged. You just need to tape it back together again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is the reason the flight recorders have fire proof foam as well. Tests have shown that steel beams with fire proof foam lasts longer in burning jet fuel then unprotected steel beams. If only there were an easier way to test this then to find two identical skyscrapers, renovate one of them with fireproofing, hijack two airplanes to crash into them and see which ones stands for longer. I suppose we could find one big building and renovate half of it and crash two airplanes into it. But then you risk the passengers of the hijacked aircraft takes over the controls and crash the aircraft in a field. And you better find someone to blame the hijackings on, you would not want people to suspect the Freemasons. I mean they are an organization of building engineers who keeps their trade secrets from falling into the wrong hands so that only they can construct the biggest cathedrals. Have not anyone read the history of this organization?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick Google search shows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Steel is just the element iron that has been processed to control the amount of carbon. Iron, out of the ground, melts at around 1510 degreesC (2750°F). Steel often melts at around 1370 degrees C (2500°F).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally</p>
<blockquote>
<p>adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature that results from a complete combustion process that occurs without any work, heat transfer or changes in kinetic or potential energy.</p>
<p>&quot;adiabatic flame temperature&quot; of a given <em>fuel and oxidizer pair</em> indicates the temperature at which the gases achieve stable combustion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends what pair your looking at. Here are some examples: </p>
<p>Oxy-acetylene 3,480 °C (6,300 °F)</p>
<p>Oxyhydrogen 2,800 °C (5,100 °F)</p>
<p>Air-acetylene 2,534 °C (4,600 °F)</p>
<p>Blowtorch (air-MAPP gas) 2,200 °C (4,000 °F)</p>
<p>Bunsen burner (air-natural gas) 1,300 to 1,600 °C (2,400 to 2,900 °F)[11]</p>
<p>Candle (air-paraffin) 1,000 °C (1,800 °F)</p>
<p>Smoldering cigarette:</p>
<p>Temperature without drawing: side of the lit portion; 400 °C (750 °F); middle of the lit portion: 585 °C (1,100 °F)</p>
<p>Temperature during drawing: middle of the lit portion: 700 °C (1,300 °F)</p>
<p>Always hotter in the middle</p>
<p>Keep in mind these numbers are in isolated conditions. Also you have to consider the amount of steel vs amount fuel and oxidizer available. </p>
<p>Assuming you mean standard fires, such as an office fire:</p>
<p>Normal building fires and hydrocarbon (e.g., jet fuel) fires generate temperatures up to about 1,100 degrees Celsius (2,000 degrees Fahrenheit). [NIST]</p>
<p>With regards to steel beams used in buildings.</p>
<p>Steel is a non-combustible, fire resistant material and will not feed a fire. Steel is used because it binds well to concrete, has a similar thermal expansion coefficient and is strong and relatively cost-effective. They are also built with extra fire protection through fire proofing insulation.</p>
<p>When exposed to fire, all commonly used structural materials lose some of their mechanical strength. Heavily loaded steel will lose its designed safety margin at temperature around 550°C – regardless of the grade of steel. The bigger volume of steel in the exposed area, the better fire resistance it has. <strong>How quickly the steel structure heats up in a fire can simply be described as the relation between the surface exposed to the fire and the steel volume of the profile.</strong> </p>
<p>This means that the entire beam doesn't heat up at once and at the same rate. Some parts will cooler than others. If you have tungsten coil stove you can see this effect.</p>
<p>For this reason steel buildings are a favorite choice to build with since the main structural components remain practically reusable after a large fire. The worst fires such as the <a href="https://youtu.be/3B1OnhSucP8" target="_blank">Beijing Mandarin Hotel fire</a> did not cause large portions of structural collapse. The fires on WTC 1,2, and 7 were not that large in comparison and did not burn anywhere near as long as the Beijing (6 hours). Here are <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/23/TVCC_Site_2007.jpg" target="_blank">before</a>, <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/02/09/world/09beijing-600.jpg" target="_blank">during</a>, <a href="http://matthewniederhauser.com/research/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/20090211_beijing_cctv_mandarin_oriental_inferno_fire.jpg" target="_blank">after</a> and the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/The_TVCC_building_as_seen_in_July_2011.jpg" target="_blank">rebuilding</a> pics of The Beijing Mandarin Hotel. As you can see, the hotel remains standing perfectly fine since there is no structural damage. Rebuilding had to be started because of interior and exterior fire damage to the facade, walls, furnishings etc. and the steel skeleton shows no structural damage.</p>
<p>These properties and history of building fires has led many to question why melting and evaporation of steel occurred that day and why WTC 1, 2, and 7 collapsed. Hence the popular phrase &quot;jet fuel [fires] can't melt steel beams&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyways. To answer your question, Jet fuel office fire can't melt the steel beam, but can slightly weaken the steel beam in the localized area. </p></div>		</li>
