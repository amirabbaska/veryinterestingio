			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, water has a relatively high specific heat, so it takes a fair amount of heat to increase it's temperature by a degree. Since the rate of heat flow is determined by the difference in the temperatures of the two bodies in contact, water draws heat out of you relatively quickly. This is also why a conductor of a given temperature will feel colder than an insulator at the same temperature (assuming both are below your temperature).  </p>
<p>Two fun related experiments:  </p>
<p>-Fill one bowl with hot, one with room temp, and one with cold water. Put one hand into hot and one into cold. Wait a few secs, then put both into room temp.  </p>
<p>-Touch a metal object and a wooden object that are both at room temp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've conflated specific heat and thermal conductivity to a certain extent in this post. A very thermally conductive material with any substantial amount of thermal mass will feel cold or hot when you touch it depending on its temperature relative to your body. A very good thermal insulator will not feel cold or hot regardless of its specific heat. However, there are examples of configurations of thermally conductive material that don't feel like they're any temperature. Aluminum foil is a good example. You can touch it directly out of an oven because it's thermal conductivity is so high that it almost immediately cools down to air temperature, and even if it didn't, there so little mass that there's not enough heat to burn you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats right. in the end the temperature we feel depends of the conductivity (of the material and of our skin), the temperature difference and also the heat capacity of the material. A simple model for the heat transfer would be the conduction rate equation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then why do we feel wet after taking a hot shower? The whole room, the whole body - it's all hot and wet, seems unlikely that it would take away heat. Yet I do feel wet, whichever way it is. Same with humid climate and environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because you are still losing heat to the atmosphere due to the evaporation of the water on your skin.</p>
<p>If warm water is flowing over you, you feel the physical movement of the water, but not that cold &quot;wet&quot; feeling. The moment you get out of the shower, that changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still, as the Water evaporates it takes up energy in Form of heat from your body, so there is a sensation of cooling, no matter how warm the sorroundings.</p>
<p>To imagine it better you Might not think of water evaporating but of an icecube melting.  The process goes into the same direction and the cube will feel cold, because it takes up energy. </p>
<p>It is the same Mechanism because of which it was evolutionary beneficial to Start to lose water when it gets warm. (Sweating).</p>
<p>Edit: as for humid environment: the humidity as soon as it touches your skin evaporates almost instantaneously. </p>
<p>Maybe you can try to dry your clothes in a cold Place next time.
As you try to check if theyve dried up you Might notice it is hard to say if They're still wet or just cool.</p></div>		</li>
