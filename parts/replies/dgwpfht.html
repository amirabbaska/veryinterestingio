Confidence and approval ratings are usually at their peak. Even people who voted against him are willing to give him a shot before passing judgment. It's the honeymoon period with the country. The idea is if you can't gain ground on your policy goals in that time, when the cards are more in your favor than they are likely to be ever again, then you're not going to be an effective president.</p>
<p>To your point about the third year, it is also often true that midterm elections favor the party not in the white house. The president gets both more praise and blame than is warranted, so if you're unhappy then you'll think less of his party and send the other guy at the two year mark. Obama had this problem and that's why he barely got anything done after the first two years. So often enough they really only have the first year to get what they want done.</p></div>		</li>
