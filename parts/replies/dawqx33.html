			<div class="markdown"><p>When I had appendicitis, I remember being in the ER and they weren't quite sure what it was. To me, it felt like an extremely severe stomach ache/cramping with nausea and vomiting. When the doctor came back to check on me, I remember saying something like, &quot;You might think this is crazy, but the pain has moved down and right.&quot; The doc said this was a classic symptom of appendicitis, and the surgeon was called in.</p></div>		</li>
