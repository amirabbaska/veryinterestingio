			<div class="markdown"><p>the &quot;big government&quot; thing is less about the number of people working for it and more about the amount of influence the government has in our daily lives. Conservatives tend to want government to have as little influence as possible. </p>
<p>Edit: keep reading before you mention abortion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish that were true. From making abortions illegal to deciding how public school money is split up, to trying to squash the pot reform movement, to turning our police forces into para-military organizations. They want to stick their noses wherever. The &quot;small government&quot; thing is just a buzzword that riles up a large base of the country too busy crying about Christianity being oppressed to open their eyes and look around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true for all conservatives.  There are an increasing number of conservatives like Rand Paul and others in congress who really want all the points you mentioned to be decided by the states.  Even Trump has said in the past that the states should decide about marijuana.  And the religious nut jobs on the right are actually driving a growing number of conservatives toward libertarianism.  I think that trend will only grow now that the disgusting alt-right movement is getting attention and latching itself to Republican politics.  The right has been associated with the church for a long time, but now that society is growing more secular those morality enforcement politics are going away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That private company which has to keep getting new customers and compete with other companies for business. Compare that to an unaccountable government who doesn't care about quality, efficiency or customer satisfaction. You can't boycott the government if you don't like how they operate. Don't like Target for their transgender policy? Don't shop there. Don't like Chick-Fil-A for their CEO's stance on gay marriage, don't eat there. Don't like the long waits at the DMV and the shitty attitudes of employees? Tough shit, you have to use them. You can more easily influence the behavior of a company that wants to maintain a good public image and customers than you can a bureaucracy that doesn't give a fuck because they're the only game in town.</p>
<p>This would of course require deregulation of insurance companies and allow them to sell across state lines and actually compete for customers, but again that is a product of government interference with the free market. You don't see Aetna, United HealthCare and Signa advertising for your patronage, but you do see Geico, State Farm, Allstate and Nationwide vying for your business. That's because health insurance is much more regulated and limited than car insurance, and insurance companies in certain areas aren't competing for business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the idea is it would not be 1 private company but many. And if 1 company does not fulfill your needs satisfactorily, you move your business to another creating market pressure. </p>
<p>That is not possible in a single payer system.  You are paying through taxes to 1 'company', whether you are satisfied or not. Sure, you technically have some say in 'your healthcare' but if you think certain changes are necessary, you better hope the right people in power agree with you. Further, legislative changes to a charter do not happen quickly.  </p>
<p>There are also arguments about privacy and whether the government should hold all your medical records. And legitimate concerns about the government being the arbiter on the emergence of a necessary procedure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With that, they're looking out for the life of the unborn fetus as they see it as a human life which aborting it would mean killing it and killing another person is wrong. It really has little to do with what a woman does to her body. A woman could turn her ovaries into a nice set of wind chimes for all they care, they just don't think it's ok to kill a fetus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're never going to win that argument, because you're arguing with people who believe that pregnancy will inevitably result in a human being that has a right to live and deserves the protection of the government. There's no beating that message.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other issue you missed: it puts a higher burden on the rich than the poor as well. The poor can't afford all the medical treatment now, so you couldn't possibly tax them enough to cover it either. Ergo the difference would have to come from higher up. Considering some states have a regressive income tax, it's safe to say that's a sticking issue for some as well.</p>
<p>In the US at least some people ascribe to the beliefs (based on fact or not isn't up for discussion here) that poverty is either a choice or a transient stage of life. So they make choices based on the idea that poor people deserve the downfalls of poverty as consequences of their choice, or that if they are poor they will be rich if not today then later in life.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not trying to say these viewpoints are reasonable or not, just that they are (to the best of my knowledge) a significant foundation behind resistance to universal government healthcare. I feel this discussion will turn into a real political shitfest if we start down that path, so lets save that for /r/politics ok guys?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is a joke, my girlfriend is an NP who works for Heartland Outreach in Chicago, which is funded entirely by the federal government.  She treats 100% homeless (they receive better healthcare for free than my upper middle class retired parents) and the vast vast majority have severe mental health issues, most are schizophrenic. Nobody wants to address mental health in America. For anyone to say being homeless is a choice or a &quot;stage&quot; in their life doesn't know anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Poland the social tax is about 30% of the money you earn. For a shitty healtcare and shtty retirement fund. It puts as much burden on someone who earns 2000$ and and has to pay 700$ of it and on the rich ones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty complicated situation. The biggest issue the US faces is that due to healthcare not being one large provider, each hospital negotiates costs individually. This means they have much smaller bargaining power than country wide health systems, and pay a lot more money per treatment on average.</p>
<p>For a country as huge as the US, the economies of scale to be gained are massive. Poland is small enough that it might not be as helpful.</p></div>		</li>
