<p><strong>Up to</strong> two years, not at least. The <em>maximum</em> term for renegotiations is two years, at which point the UK <strong>must</strong> leave, even if negotiations are ongoing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding (having been researching it myself) is that it depends hugely on what terms are going to be negotiated. </p>
<p>For example, if the UK wants to remain part of the European Economic Area (EEA) in order to access the single market, then it's pretty certain we'll need to accept freedom of movement just the same as if we were part of the EU still. Some people have pointed to Norway as a model on this front - but obviously that would go against a lot of the points the Leave campaign won on, as we would have to make a contribution to the EU, wouldn't be able to place checks on immigration, and would have no say at all over EU laws. I'm pretty sure the ~50% who voted for Brexit would be up in arms about such a deal being struck. It really isn't the greatest scenario, imo, although the freedom of movement would be great for UK citizens wanting to work in the EU. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if we negotiate a deal restricting freedom of movement (which affects both immigration and emigration), we may end up having to jump through all the hoops that people from non-EU countries have to do. Visas, applying for the right to work, etc. EHIC cards would also no longer be a thing - no more free healthcare in other countries! We wouldn't be banned from entering EU countries, but we'd have to go through lengthy application processes, and it would be a <em>lot</em> harder to get the right to actually stay in any EU country permanently. </p>
<p>This is a massive oversimplification of it all, and ofc there are other variations on the options, but so much of it rides on what deal is agreed on. I don't imagine the UK is going to get a particularly kind deal, either. If you want to work in EU countries in the future, then either way I'd make sure to start making your future visa application(s) look very, very appealing to the countries you want to apply to. </p>
<p>A couple of other options that have been thrown around:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're eligible, get an Irish passport. (I'm not, sadly.) </li>
<li>Consider moving to Scotland, especially if they hold a referendum to divorce from the UK and try to rejoin the EU. (Bit of a long shot, but still an option.) </li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Until the UK actually leaves the EU, its membership with the EU, and all the things that come with it, continue as normal. During this time, anyone wishing to work in another EU country will be free to do so, though it remains to be seen whether the EU countries will impose any conditions on those moving in the next two years. They may decide that those who move in the two years will not retain their right to stay.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is not yet known what will happen to both the EU migrants in the UK, of which there are approx 3 million, and the UK migrants in the EU, which number approx. 1.2 million; Each country will decide whether to allow them to stay or to deport them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hope there is going to be some clarity on this soon. It's really not a nice feeling that the place you've called home for years is now debating whether you will retain your right to live there. It's also been a bit disappointing to find out how few Britons actually care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the Vienna convention (France being an exception), even after two years when UK officially exits the EU, the britons residing or working in EU nations before the article 50 was put into play by UK can live in their current country forever and exercise their rights. And same goes for EU nation citizen's residing in UK.  So no need for expats to worry on the either side of EU-UK borders. </p></div>		</li>
