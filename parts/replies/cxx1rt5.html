			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm work in law and I can't stop laughing at the idea of a client calling me asking &quot;So can I say Tom Cruise is gay in my satirical TV show?&quot; &quot;No&quot; &quot;What about showing him doing butt stuff?&quot; Me, going through 6 different defamation law books open on my desk &quot;Nope&quot; &quot;What about.... Him crying in a closet with a bunch of people begging him to come out?&quot; &quot;I guess... that's technically legal?&quot; &quot;Great, thanks!&quot;.</p>
