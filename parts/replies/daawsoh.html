<p>Plus the hassle of teaching flight crews to recognize each device and remember the problematic devices.  In addition, the inevitable fights with customers who <em>insist</em> that <em>their</em> device is <em>not</em> in the problematic category.  Planes would never get off the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember durng the Note 7 fire scandal they were telling people to turn off and stow all Samsung Galaxy phones before boarding.  They made no distinction between the safe Galaxy S7 and the defective fire hazard Note 7, probably because it's not worth the risk if airline staff got them confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not really an issue of what device. You can easily shield electronics from the entire spectrum. The problem is that its more expensive and for smaller aircraft I imagine its actually unreasonable. The bigger issue is that lots of older planes still fly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>However, given the huge number of planes in service, of varying age (so no guarantee the shielding is still intact) multiplied by all the different phones coming out with 3G/4G/H/Bluetooth/Hyperwave it is utterly impractical to test all phones on all planes in all conditions to be sure that it is safe. So, the default option is to tell people to turn devices off. </p>

<p>Here's the real answer, it's all about liability.  They <em>can't</em> know, so they tell you to do it.  That way if a 1 in a million cell signal interferes with a plane in some meaningful way, they can say it's not their fault.  It's just the airline covering their ass on an unknown.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The other point that occurs is that during take off and landing, the high risk times, you are to stow all your luggage, seats upright and so on. There could be an additional worry that a phone held to someone's head can become a projectile in the event of a crash. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well. Yes. But based on a technical understanding. Not a lack of understanding. </p>
<p>It's like being in a chemistry lab. &quot;Don't drink liquids&quot; is a valid rule. Not because &quot;better safe than sorry&quot; but because there's an intimate knowledge of the danger posed by unlabeled or mislabeled liquids in an active lab. </p></div>		</li>
