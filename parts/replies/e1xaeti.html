			<div class="markdown"><p>If water is scarce, you can buy it and have it brought there.  However, you can't do that without charging more for the water.  Many parts of the Middle East desalinate water, but they have lots of oil money.  If you are poor and have no water, you need something, but desalination probably isn't it.  Maybe you need to move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For context, desalination (in coastal areas) would mean about doubling the cost of water. While this wouldn't break the bank for most, it's enough that nobody wants to spend the money to build massive desalination plants if they can avoid it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sana is the capital of war-torn Yemen, the poorest Arab country before civil war broke out. Sana was reaching the point of perhaps being the first modern city running out of water and might have to be reduced or evacuated as the local aquifers cannot support the population. It would be an interesting test case if Yemen didn't become a failed state. </p></div>		</li>
