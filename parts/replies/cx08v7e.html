			<div class="markdown"><p>I know all of these opinions probably add to the problem. But the real problem is that your body releases a lot of cortisol at night, plus the cold temperature makes it that much worse.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised that I had to scroll this far down to see any mention of dehydration. When you wake up in the morning, generally you've had nothing to drink for about 8 hours, and with a cold you may have been breathing through your mouth all night. That spells dehydration, at least to a moderate degree. The rest of the day, hopefully, you are a bit better hydrated.</p></div>		</li>
