			<p>No need to do things that are outright criminal; if you have no sense of ethics or obligation toward the rest of humanity, you can rip off stupid people (rather, the companies that gave them decision-making power) and make money hand over fist.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's what mafia did with Naples on waste disposal business, first they scared off the competition (because the city officials were stupid enough to privatize it in the first place) hiked up the prices and in the end nothing really gets done by a way of removing waste from the streets.</p>		</li>

			<p>Very true; I am a professional wrestling enthusiast (yes I know it's scripted). Not only does the Yakuza run a lot of the Sumo matches they technically own New Japan Pro Wrestling (the Japanese WWE). If they don't like a particular character for whatever reason he's not going to win, where it gets messy is when they have other wrestlers come in from other countries and organizations with the premise they'd win the match, put on a good show, fans love it and go back home. Well if he's not liked by the Yakuza and forced to lose but he just happens to be the champ at another organization and is told you're going lose the belt to our guy even though that wasn't the contract he signed. So now you're being forced to lose a match, give a championship belt that cost around 20k to make to your competitor, go totally off the script, and if you don't agree well tough luck. There's a lot of interviews on YouTube of the insane stories from guys who worked for them. </p>		</li>

			<p>NJPW isn't owned by the yakuza. NOAH was and a lot of the smaller promotions and joshi promotions are. New Japan is owned by a fucking big video game company </p>		</li>

			<p>Was that recent because there's quite a few interviews where the wrestlers specifically say Yakuza members had a large controlling interest, most notably Mike Awesome (rip). </p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah in 05 Inoki sold to the video game company Yukes who in 2012 sold it to Bushiroad. They're too big to have to deal with the gangster bullshit these days. <br><br>The yakuza stuff was during the Inoki dark years when business was bad</p>		</li>

			<p>I'd like to think they still have a few fingers in it no pun intended, rarely does any organized crime family get into a business and then get back out. Once they're in it, they're in it for life. Now I could be totally wrong however it just seems that unless it was more of a headache than the money made them then they would abandon their racketeering with NJPW. Maybe that's why they moved on to Noah?</p>		</li>

			<p>Holy shit, Yuke's owned NJPW?! I'm dumbfounded by this. Every time I hear Yuke's name I find out about some outlandishly ridiculous project they have worked on. I wish there was some kind of documentary on these people.</p>		</li>

			<p>There's definitely some hiveminds in the sub I don't agree with, I don't care about downvotes as much as I care about a civil insightful conversations. Some people say that NJPW isn't ran by the Yakuza as much as we think however if watch some the interviews with guys who've worked in NJPW their definitely a heavy presence. They just don't manipulate one or two matches then are done, once they're in there doing their bidding they're aren't leaving. I'm trying to find an interview with Mike Awesome (rip) about a wild night working in NJPW and things not going how the Yakuza said they should and eventually they circled the entire arena after one of the noses got punched during a near riot. </p>		</li>

			<p>Same as how the Yakuza used to run Pride FC and when the UFC bought the rights they originally planned to run Pride events in Japan themselves but had to abandon that plan due to being blocked from doing so by the Yakuza.</p>		</li>

			<p>The yakuza is responsible for tons of Japan's extremely prolific child porn market, they are responsible for bringing the drugs into Japan, handguns, prostitution, and human trafficking. <br><br>Yakuza are scumbags. Don't be fooled. </p>		</li>

			<p>Every mob organization that reaches a certain level is pretending to be legitimate to the maximum extent that they can.  That's what Al Capone was doing.  That's what they all do.  But you can be sure that they're doing tons of illegal shit under their pretense of being legit.<br><br>Parroting it as though it's true just means they succeeded in fooling you.</p>		</li>
