			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm skeptical that a nagant could be used for this at all. Yes, you can spin the cylinder, but it's not easy and it's certainly not fast enough for one to lose track of the bullet (which you can see from the side of the gun anyway). It also does not swing out for reloading. The cylinder is always either attached to other parts that prevent it from free-spinning, or it is physically removed from the gun.  Kind of a shame, actually, since it's kind of an oddball revolver and holds 7 rounds instead of the more common 6. I'd much rather have the 1/7 chance of dying than 1/6.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Did some additional research, I guess the mouth of the cartridge  enters the barrel as well, creating a gas seal. </p></div>		</li>

WESTERN REVOLVER IS LOOSE LIKE BAD WHORE BUT NAGANT REVOLVER IS TIGHT BECAUSE TWO CHARACTERS OF OPERATION. AS CONSCRIPT HE FALLS TRIGGER, WHEEL OF NAGANT SISTEMA ROLLS NEXT CHAMBER INTO PLACE FOR SHOOT. WHEEL LOCKS FORWARD TO MAKE GOOD TIGHT SEAL OF CHAMBER TO BARREL. REAR OF BARREL ALSO SQUEEZE HARD THE BALLOONING CASE. EXTRA POWER IS HELD TO FART BULLET TOWARD MUZZLE. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a side-effect of the gas seal mechanism.  The cylinder has teeth that lock it securely into place while rotating and line it up properly so that the entire cylinder moves forward when it fires and seals everything. That, or it's just an oversight, or maybe to make it more sturdy. It's a very heavily built gun and mine (which is exactly one hundred years old this year) works exactly as well as it was designed to.  As per usual Russian engineering, that is &quot;good enough&quot;. It's still a neat gun though and I carry mine while fishing in case of snakes.  It's very reliable and I'd have to do something serious to break it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm completely skeptical about Russian Roulette ever happening in reality, but most depictions of it in movies have only two participants who alternate shots.  If it's your gun and you go first, then you're also going to be the third person to participate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay, but with 3, 5, or 7 players, you still end up dead.  You just won't be the first to die.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, you go first.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah right; we're flipping for it.&quot;</p>
