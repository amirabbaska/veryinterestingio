<p>That means that even if you change the efficiency of absorbing water, there is no place to store it, other than the blood vessels.</p>
<p>That's why I can't imagine there is much variation between people regarding &quot;peeing the excess water&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh I was really terrible about staying hydrated..like I would go days without drinking more than a couple sips of water. I thought it was working for me until it REALLY wasn't. I don't have any scientific explanation for you (I really wish I did) but just try to not treat your body like it's invincible. </p></div>		</li>
