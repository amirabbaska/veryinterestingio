			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, this is not right: KATRIN will be measuring single beta decay, and SNO+ won't be measuring double beta decay for a few years. Experiments looking at double beta decay are CUORE, GERDA, EXO-200, and KamLAND-Zen.</p>
<p>But either way, you can't get the neutrino mass by measuring the endpoint of the two-neutrino double-beta decay spectrum, since the process is really, really rare, so no experiments have anywhere near enough events near the endpoint nor the resolution.</p>
<p>KATRIN will attempt to measure the endpoint energy of the spectum with single beta decay, which is very common in some isotopes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that neutrino have a very low probability to interact with ordinary matter, too our understanding of physics the probability for a neutrino to interact with another neutrino is even lower (and lower than the probability of an interaction with cosmic radiations or microwave background) </p>
<p>Here are a few way to detect it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Let say that we have a big neutrino detector, with an identified neutrino source (also known by gamma ray astronomy) and that this source is good enough to have a spectrum. We might then have a sufficient understanding of the source too (with a pretty large statistic) find missing neutrinos due to interaction with CMB and with background neutrino. We'll need multiple <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0411510" target="_blank">Planet sized neutrino detectors</a> + low energy extension</p>
</li>
<li>We can shoot a neutrino beam to a distant location (OPERA experiment), what about trying to collide two neutrino beams, and detect the particle coming out. I believe this is possible but we'll need ultra intense and precise beams and long time to measure any collision between neutrinos. Even if our system is perfectly controlled it's likely that the detector get saturated by accidental detection (beam toward detector, neutrino + Radiation in the detector volume etc…) but it would be a cool experiment provided you give me several billions and a century </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in principle if you can wait long enough, you can always accumulate enough data for very rare events. But I bet with current terrestrial neutrino sources, the waiting time would be longer than the age of the universe so far.  We just don't have anything that produces enough neutrinos. We'd have to harness a neutrino source on the scale of a supernova to have a good shot as seeing neutrino-neutrino interactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general, no, photos do not interact with each other. They act as waves and simply pass through each other completely unimpeded.</p>
<p>In some severe situations, however, they can. See <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_physics" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-photon_physics</a></p></div>		</li>
