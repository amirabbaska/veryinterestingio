<p>Stopped the juice, no more canker sores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is we don’t know. A bunch of factors seem to be involved. SLS and pH have been mentioned, but there is also potentially a viral cause as well. </p>
<p>People aren’t dying from canker sores, so I can’t imagine too much research is being done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sodium laural sulfate (probably not the correct spelling).</p>
<p>It's in almost every kind of toothpaste and a lot of people have reactions to it, after switching to a non-SLS toothpaste I went from several sores per month to just a couple per year.</p>
<p>Sensodyne is the brand I use but read the ingredients because several brands still have SLS in them. It's a bit pricier than regular toothpaste but it made a remarkable difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What the folks above me said. I’ll add that I have a few outbreaks per year and they’re awful, but they aren’t as frequent as other’s here which is why I haven’t switched my toothpaste. I’ll get 4-5 at once and I’m miserable for 2 weeks before they heal. </p></div>		</li>
