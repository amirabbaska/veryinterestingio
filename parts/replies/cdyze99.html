			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very true. Since acoustic noise is usually propagating sound from a large number of sources, changes in the behavior of those sources should be discounted.</p>
<p>On that note, changes in behaviors of animals, people, machines, or even things like the wind should be taken into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do have an effect. I was disappointed that he understated this.  Snowflakes Most noticeably affect the higher frequencies. That's why when it is snowing those big beautiful flakes it sounds like the high end of the sound spectrum is more muffled than the rest. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We generally consider snow as scattering media after 20GHz or so, but it does scatter at lower frequencies (just takes a thicker amount before it becomes noticeable.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be possible to calculate the amount of absorption per cubic meter of snowy air vs. normal air for a given intensity of snowfall.  As a rule of thumb, when you put mass between you and a sound (especially spongy, porous mass), that sound will get absorbed proportionally to the amount of mass, starting with high frequencies and working down to low.  Since snow in the air fits that definition I have to imagine it's doing some (but as OP said maybe not much) work absorbing sound that has a direct path towards you.   </p></div>		</li>
