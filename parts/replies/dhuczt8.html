<p>With zero sources to back me up I wouldn't be surprised if the nature of tournaments influenced the top 3 standard. When you get to the two semifinal games the winners move on to the championship giving us first and second place and then if you do a game for the losers of the semifinal games we get our third place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me personally, as a wrestler, can somewhat confirm this answer. At a tournament I had the top seed (meaning I am the most promising for first place) but ended up getting third. My first round opponent was not supposed to defeat me but I ended up making a horrible mistake during the match that led to me losing. </p></div>		</li>
