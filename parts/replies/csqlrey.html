Did you know that Saturn's Rings are some of the &quot;flattest&quot; structures known to mankind? They are over 300,000km long but only have a &quot;thickness&quot; of around 10meters! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was it ever stated why she was fired?  What if the firing was entirely reasonable.  What if they're not releasing the reason due to labor laws or what happened to the last CEO?  I think the last CEO openly disclosed why a former employee was fired during his AMA and in turn the employees voted him out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, and maybe this is just the DBA / sysadmin in me talking, but when you terminate someone's employment you do so with as little impact to the organization and any downstream processes or deliverables.  Subreddits don't dictate company process, but that transition should have been seamless to the end users and subreddits which relied on her.  Pardon my french, but the technical term we apply to this in the workplace is 'bumblefuck'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a post on /r/technology right before it went dark (so I can't link to it) of someone close to Victoria testifying that corporate had wanted to take AMA's to another level, make video AMA's that would also allow for product placement and other things that would make AMA's lose their reddit authenticity. They were nudging Victoria in this direction and she thought it was a bad idea for the community. so they fired her.</p>
<p>I can't find the post anywhere else anymore though -_- so I don't know if it's more than rumours. but it seems very likely.</p></div>		</li>
