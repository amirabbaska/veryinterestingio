			<div class="markdown"><p>The way stone 'circles' are laid out in Western Europe to match long-term lunar and solar events must have involved accurate tallies of years over centuries.  We don't know how that was done - 'sacred knotted string' maybe? Untouchable posts in calendar holes?  But we do know how the results were documented in wood and stone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Ancient Romans used a calendar that dated from the supposed date of the founding of the city of Rome</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though it should be noted that in Ancient Rome it would be far more common for a regular person to refer to some specific year by using the names of the two consuls for that year (or the regnal year of the current Emperor in the Empire period), while the AUC (ab urbe condita, from the founding of the city) wasn't really used for that many things and was only really used in the later Empire period before being replaced by the World Era calendar which was used in the later Eastern Roman (i.e. Byzantine) Empire.</p></div>		</li>
