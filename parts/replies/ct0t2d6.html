			<div class="markdown"><p>And not really accurate, since services are distinguished by ports, the &quot;www&quot; was never actually required. It was just a convention that came from the existing convention of naming your hosts after the primary services they provided. There was absolutely no technical need for &quot;www.&quot; prefixes. Some domains even used &quot;web.&quot; prefixes at times, but &quot;www.&quot; caught on.</p>
<p>Yahoo.com was originally <a href="http://akebono.standford.edu" target="_blank">http://akebono.standford.edu</a>. No &quot;www.&quot; required. In fact, if you had tried to go to <a href="http://www.akebono.stanford.edu" target="_blank">http://www.akebono.stanford.edu</a>, it would <em>not</em> have worked. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the &quot;http&quot; is more deterministic of service than &quot;www&quot; is. Browsers assume you want http:, since they are web browsers, and even though they can usually do other things (like ftp:), http: is their primary purpose, so they default to it. And unless you state otherwise, they will assume port :80 too (:443 if https:).</p>
<p>In fact, if the question had been &quot;Whatever happened to needing &quot;http&quot; in front of an address&quot;, then OP's answer would have actually been much more accurate. But for &quot;www,&quot; it's incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except it's not quite correct. It implies that it is some sort of technical necessity to have the subdomain &quot;www&quot; point to the webserver, and that this is still the case and omitting it only works because of an implicit redirection.</p>
<p>(I believe it's true that major browsers will prepend &quot;www&quot; if the entered FQDN doesn't respond to the HTTP request, so in that sense it's fair to say that the &quot;www&quot; is implicit.)</p>
<p>But it would be much more appropriate to say that it's a naming convention that's slowly going out of fashion, and that there's never been any technical need for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a pretty low level CS class then, the routing tables allow multiple names per IP address, so &quot;www.reddit.com&quot; and &quot;reddit.com&quot; resolve to the same IP address. The internet doesnt work on names but on IPv4 and IPv6 addesses, the names are converted to addresses via a lookup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of, you can replace the <code>www</code> and the <code>http</code> with <code>ftp</code>, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>ftp://ftp.debian.org/ (access ftp-server via ftp)</li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.debian.org/" target="_blank">http://ftp.debian.org/</a> (access the ftp-server, but this time with http)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">http://www.debian.org/</a> (the regular webpage)</li>
<li>ftp://www.debian.org/ (doesn't work, the www-server doesn't provide ftp)</li>
</ul>
<p>However none of that is required, it's just a convention and one that gets pretty rare these days, as everything switches to just using http/https or ssh for admin tasks. 15 years ago on the other side it was reasonably common that you might upload your webpage via ftp and then users would browse it via http.</p>
<p>Something that is rather common these days are <code>api</code> server. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://api.github.com/" target="_blank">https://api.github.com/</a></li>
<li><a href="http://api.reddit.com/" target="_blank">http://api.reddit.com/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They still work via http, but unlike <code>www</code> they don't return a human readable webpage, but instead machine readable data about the webpage. Your reddit comments for example can be accessed as:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://api.reddit.com/user/PenguinsRAwesome/comments.json" target="_blank">https://api.reddit.com/user/PenguinsRAwesome/comments.json</a></li>
</ul>
<p>But as with the ftp stuff, this is again just a convention and most smaller webpages don't have a api-server, most of the bigger services however have one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The protocol defines what default port to use as well as how to handle the information returned. ftp://www.debian.org/ does, in fact, work just fine, but it establishes a connection to the FTP process on port 21 of the www.debian.org server, which will only return the things that the FTP process is configured to return. If FTP is not running on the www server, then the connection will be refused.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Web browsers have a limit of how many simultaneous file downloads they will do from a single server.  IE, in an odd case of standards compliance that ends up being misguided, used to only download 2 files at a time from any given server!</p>
<p>As websites get more complicated, it means that a web page with lots of images and javascript files will load slowly no matter how good of a connection the client has.</p>
<p>Big sites (bing, hotmail, gmail, amazon.com) that have the budget to optimize loading times down to the millisecond will host javascript and images and CSS files all on multiple different servers to get around the simultaneous loading limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, through the use of ports. Say I have a server that does many things: serves web pages, acts as a VPN, sends and receives e-mail, and the administrator has to ssh into it.  Each of these services has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_TCP_and_UDP_port_numbers" target="_blank">default port number (list here)</a> that is assigned to them. HTTP (web servers) typically use port 80, or port 443 for SSL.</p>
<p>So by default, when you point a web browser to an internet address (like reddit.com), it will try to connect to that address on port 80.  If encryption is required, it will use port 443.</p>
<p>Similarly, an ssh connection to reddit.com will by default use port 22.  A mail client trying to log into reddit.com to check e-mail will use either port 443 or 993 (the latter for encryption).</p>
<p>These default ports are very much like not having to write &quot;NON_FRAGILE&quot; on your packages.</p>
<p>But, lets say reddit decided to be oddballs, and wanted their web server to run on some other port (say, port 40000). In such a case, you WOULD have to do something - like writing &quot;FRAGILE&quot; on the package - to tell your web browser that you want a web page from that server, but not in the usual way.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by typing a colon after the hostname, like <a href="http://tubezninjassillywebsite.com:40000" target="_blank">http://tubezninjassillywebsite.com:40000</a> .</p></div>		</li>

<p>All of the above have to be set up the the admin to provide the services, google was just used in my example.</p></div>		</li>
