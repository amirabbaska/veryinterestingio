<p>I was kind of embarrassed to ask, fearing lots of &quot;Uh, they <em>do</em>&quot; out of new-car owners. My car's a 2002, so I'm a sad 15 years behind in technology. That's cool, though, that your car is a 2003 and it has it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 1996 Jaguar had it... part of the &quot;Canadian Cold Weather Package&quot; which included limited slip differential, heated seats/mirrors and heated washer jets.<br />
It was great, but it means a fight with insurance to replace the windscreen since the cost is over $2,000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd bet front windscreen gets repaired/replaced 50 + times more often than rear window so I guess that is the answer. The front windscreen takes damage so much more often that if car companies put the filaments in the front window it would drive up everyone's insurance by a shitload or people would never choose them as an option due to some $1000 excess on their insurance for windshield replacement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries! I drive a 2015 vehicle, and work at a car dealership seeing 2017 models every day, none of which are equipped with the magical windshields. However, there are heated steering wheels, heated mirrors, and even heated (and cooling) cupholders! But no fancy windshields, not even on &quot;top-of-the-liners&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many features legal on cars in the US are not legal in the UK.</p>
<p>Many D.O.T. laws in the US are pointless and arbitrary. We have plastic lenses on our headlights rather than glass like some parts of Europe. Thus we have to deal with cracked &quot;foggy&quot; lenses after a few years.</p>
<p>I wish we could ban red turn signals on the rear of some cars in the US. Should be mandatory yellow/amber turn signals like the rest of the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A large amount of countries outside the US do not require the amber turn signals. Middle East/GCC Markets, Most of Central and South America, South Korea, among others. Not that I don't think the amber execution is better, but there's probably 40 countries I can think of that do not allow then and there are probably more. A large part of my job is to develop the product strategy for the Ford Mustang and a lot of it is driven by regulation.</p></div>		</li>

The max button definitely gets it pretty quickly.  But then I also have remote start, so I usually fire it up a couple minutes before I head out the door and it's a good way along by the time I get in the car anyway.</p></div>		</li>
