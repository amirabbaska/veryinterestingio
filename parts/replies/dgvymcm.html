			<div class="markdown"><p>If Jimmy Smith, as a private citizen, steals your information, creates new credit card accounts in your name, and uses it to buy stuff, that's identity theft.</p>
<p>If Jimmy Smith, acting as a Wells Fargo banker, happens to create a new plan for your existing Wells Fargo account, using information that you provided to Wells Fargo when you made your existing account, and that account automatically draws money from your bank account that was linked to your existing account, that's just bad recordkeeping. Or so Jimmy Smith will say. Or should I say, Wells Fargo, because he was representing them in that transaction. He's not a criminal simply because he doesn't remember which accounts you have open with the company he represents.</p>
<p>Prosecutors can look into individual wrongdoing, certainly, but what good are they really going to do? In terms of civil responsibility, the company is already responsible and has already paid a lot of money over the incident - you want to target fired sales agents for their pennies? And in terms of criminal responsibility, how are you going to demonstrate that 5,000 individuals acted maliciously and in their own self interests without the company having anything to do with it, beyond any reasonable doubt?</p>
<p>In the end, you're just trying to destroy a lot of people's lives for a reason that isn't good enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I because in order to open an account it takes more than just a bank employee to make it.  Unless of course it's them making it for their own gain.  </p>
<p>Following orders is never a defense.  You do something illegal, you are responsible for it.  Plain and simple.  If it was ordered, guess who is also responsible?  The person giving the order and the business.  All 3 need to be prosecuted.  Only one has been so far.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You want to be careful with that, or you can get to a situation where low level employees get their lives ruined for something they did under duress (it's documented that Wells Fargo put black marks on their employment records if they didn't follow along) while the wealthy and powerful who are actually responsible for the order get off with no real penalty because &quot;obviously it was the employees who actually did wrong here&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can't management be prosecuted severely then?  I would think that everyone that participated should be found guilty for something.  Perhaps the low-level people get community service or deals for aiding prosecution on the cases for higher management.  The company too should be fined.  I think if management was severely punished and low-level people still punished some, there'd be a lot less people trying to do this type of dirty work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wells Fargo, in this case, is the &quot;deep pocket&quot;. When an employee commits a tort while he is on company's business, the company is liable to pay the tort for the injured party. What's the point of going after the individuals, and subsequently got very little money out of the tort , when you can go after the corporation itself to compensate the users and to punish the corporation'a wrong doing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Nuremberg Principles apply specifically to war crimes. Identity theft is not a war crime, nor should it be treated as one.</p>
<p>Nor is it certain that everyone who worked at Wells Fargo and was subsequently fired was acting criminally. Not only am I familiar with the Nuremberg Principles, I'm also familiar with the concept of &quot;innocent until proven guilty&quot;. I'm also familiar with the concepts of civil liability and criminal liability, and the difference between them. I believe that, were a prosecutor to try all 5,000 employees separately for identity theft, a small number of employees, maybe around 20 or so, would be convicted in a criminal trial and would see some sort of jail time. I also believe that the vast, vast majority of those employees would be found not guilty in a criminal trial. The fact of the matter is that the burden of proof is &quot;beyond all reasonable doubt&quot;. I would say the Wells Fargo situation is complicated enough to create reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>Do I believe that those 5,000 individuals could be found guilty in civil court? Most of them, certainly. But when Wells Fargo itself has already admitted civil liability, why go after them?</p>
<p>I'm not saying that &quot;I was just following orders&quot; is a valid excuse in court 100% of the time. But we have different processes for different types of and severities of crime, different rules for each court. The Nuremberg Principles do not apply to torts cases. It's really that simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy cow you do realize you are committing several logic errors? If not, let me explain.</p>
<p>NUREMBERG PRINCIPLES: No, the Nuremberg Principle does NOT apply just to war crimes. It's a MORAL CODE. It's a universal moral principle that can help people put in no-win situations do the right thing. Wells Fargo people were put in no-win situations. The RIGHT thing to do would have been to recognize that they were being asked to commit crimes and call the FBI. The Nuremberg Principles APPLY to moral behavior.</p>
<p>INNOCENT UNLESS PROVEN GUILTY: The OP didn't ask why people who did NOT commit crimes were NOT being prosecuted. Of course people are innocent unless proven guilty. By changing the subject to those who might have been innocent you are perverting the OP's question. INNOCENT PEOPLE MIGHT GET CHARGED, that doesn't mean innocent people will be convicted. No one asked the government to convict Wells Fargo people without a trial. The OP asked why there have been no trials when we have solid evidence that multiple people committed multiple crimes.</p>
<p>NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES COMMITTING CRIMES: You don't know this. Until everyone is interviewed and investigated, only WELLS FARGO MANAGEMENT knows who they pressured. You're just making shit up now.</p>
<p>BURDEN OF PROOF: The burden of proof in an identity theft charge is not BEYOND ALL REASONABLE DOUBT. The purpose of beyond any reasonable doubt is to avoid sentencing someone to an irreversible capital punishment. Everyone else gets a trial. </p>
<p>5,000 INDIVIDUALS: (A) we don't know if it's 5 or 5,000, (B) It makes no difference how many there are. Ideal justice seeks to find the truth about every crime. We live in an incredibly less than ideal world, so expediency might be the issue, but certainly justice is not. In a just world everyone suspected is found innocent or guilty. In an expedient world, we don't bother because it's too much work. </p>
<p>JUST FOLLOWING ORDERS: Just following orders is NEVER an excuse to commit a crime. </p></div>		</li>
