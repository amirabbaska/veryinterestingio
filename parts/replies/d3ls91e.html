			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anything you said is incorrect, but there are two different phenomena at play. One is the degree of specularity and one is the total reflectivity/absorptivity. Whether a photon is diffusely or specularly reflected does not change its contribution to brightness. A photon is a photon. Now you could say, if the sun is in a certain position and I stand in a certain position relative to it, with specular reflection I now will have a higher flux of photons hitting my eyes relative to diffuse reflection, and this would be correct. But, let's say it's a cloudy day like in the picture you link, the incoming light is already diffuse, so orientation is not going to matter. Any increase in brightness is because the total amount of light being reflected vs. absorbed has changed, not just the specularity. It just so happens that specular surfaces tend to be more reflective, which is why polished metal will look brighter than unpolished metal, but it is not a physical requirement for a specular surface to be more reflective than a diffuse surface.</p>
<p>The point is, when discussing how &quot;dark&quot; something looks, the details get pretty murky and specular reflection is not the whole answer. It is true, however, that a specular reflection is the answer for why I can see an image reflected in the stone on a rainy day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even in a diffused situation, there's still going to be a 'tendency' I'll call it, of light coming more from a certain direction. So the photons wouldn't necessarily be coming from random directions. And example would be that you still cast a shadow on a cloudy day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flip side to that is that there will be less reflected light coming from other directions. Once again you're talking about directionality, which is different than total reflection. In fact, following your argument, if you positioned yourself such that a highly absorbing (black) surface was on the opposite side of the stone, you could actually see the rock as even &quot;darker&quot; with specular reflection than diffuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically the light is diffused less by the surface that is wet.  Therefore less photons hitting your eye, therefore a darker observed material?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The light is reflected more precisely by the more reflective surface. Eg, point a laser pointer at a mirror, odds are that you won't be able to see the laser on the surface of the mirror. Point it on a blackboard and you will.</p>
<p>The light will travel more accurately along a &quot;perfect&quot; angle, rather than scattering across a greater range of angles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the light bouncing off of a wet surface travels in a more consistent direction? If you happen to be looking at it from that particular angle it will appear very light, otherwise it will appear very dark?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you had a round stone, dry, light is scattered very broadly from every point so it looks about evenly colored all over. Wet, light is scattered much less, so it looks darker, except where the angle is right to have a bright spot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. On a highly specular surface most of the light is reflected. When you're not looking at the reflection angle you receive less light than you would if the surface were diffuse. By conservation of energy we know the same amount of light is reflected in both cases, this means the reflection is actually much brighter than the diffused light. <a href="https://bensimonds.com/2010/08/27/plausiblematerials/" target="_blank">https://bensimonds.com/2010/08/27/plausiblematerials/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms, for point-like illumination (sun) the surface is going to look darker for any angle where you don't see the direct reflection, and much brighter when you are seeing the reflection. If the illumination was also diffuse (cloudy sky), the brightness would be about the same from any angle (a little less because of incraesed diffusion into the material and scattering, probably).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's darker in general.
You can see sun's reflection on a wet stone, but you can't do so on dry one. So OP just wrong basically, wet stones doesn't always look darker. However, experience tell us it's darker in most cases, which is true and specular vs diffuse explains that alright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection" target="_blank">Total internal reflection</a> is (also) key here.</p>
<p>Looking at <a href="http://vorsam.uni-ulm.de/vs/Versuche/O/Bilder/O_068B51.jpg" target="_blank">this pic</a> we see that some light rays on the right don't get across the surface and don't reach an observers eye. Instead, they will get reflected back to the material, and more light gets absorbed, hence a darker appearance.</p></div>		</li>
