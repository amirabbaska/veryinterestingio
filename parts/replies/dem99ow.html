			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of human history involved consumption of calories when they were available and husbanding energy when possible to make it last. A deadly surplus is relatively novel. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But no selective pressures have served to erase that whole 'conserve your strength' impulse.</p>

<p>You're oversimplifying a bit - it would first need to <em>appear</em> as a random mutation, then be spread to enough of the population, <em>then</em> be selected for until it became species-wide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So whilst your right it requires mutation and selection pressure. Genes for something can already be sitting around in a varied population whose phenotypes are not really helping or hindering at any great pressure.</p>
<p>I think in a population of 7.5billion there are plenty of people walking around who naturally are addicted to exercise already.</p>
<p>I would also be interested to know if there was any research into the idea that a sexual selection pressure towards those naturally enjoying exercise has already begun. </p>
<p>Yes in this age a man can sit around and eat pies all day and live way past child rearing days. But he's going to struggle to get his seed into a woman versus a man with a naturally higher drive for exercise.</p></div>		</li>
