			<div class="markdown"><p>Wireless charging is substantially less efficient than a wire connection and requires additional components to be put in the hardware (a large copper antenna and AT LEAST a voltage rectifier and a filter, probably more). The power supply is also more complicated.</p>
<p>I would argue that we shouldn't use wireless charging at all, unless a specific device really requires it for some niche reasons. It's a waste of energy and engineering for the smallest convenience ever. An electrical plug is easier to build, cheaper, more efficient, can provide better regulated voltage, keeps the phone cooler (keeping your battery healthier) and on most devices it's already there for other purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the technology, anywhere from 30-50% efficiency. Wired chargers can be 65-80%. So you might need twice the power to charge an iPhone wirelessly (meaning you spend twice the $), and that the iPhone and charger get hotter, meaning everything in your iPhone degrades faster (especially the battery and flash memory). In general, wireless charging is a neat gimmick, but until they can wirelessly charge in your pocket and cover 80-90% of most urban areas, a cable is infinitely better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not a huge amount but it definitely is less efficient (the bottom two numbers are for wireless charging that isn't standard yet, so ignore them) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Efficiency often (most times) has to yield when it comes to consumer preference and ease of use.</p>
<p>E.g. my new iPhone X with a wireless charger dock next to my bed is amazing. I no longer need to worry about yanking the cord out when the alarm sets off every morning. I just use it a bit after I go to bed then drop it on the charger plate and done.</p>
<p>In the morning it's just get outta bed, grab phone and go! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main drawback is very low efficiency (and therefore high power consumption). This also means that unnecessary heat would be generated in both the sending and receiving end.</p>
<p>Moreover, you still need to place the phone in a dedicated place, and using it while it's charging becomes quite difficult (something that doesn't happen with a wire).</p></div>		</li>
