			<div class="markdown"><p>Jeans rarely need washed, other items can be worn multiple times before washing.
Most people seem to think that clothing is single-use in between washes. They really aren't. Most people don't get dirty on a regular basis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that you could have fancy stuff that you use often but not a lot of it! Like maybe you have a rolex but that's your only watch or all your clothes cost hundreds of dollars but you only have enough for a week or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I do. </p>
<p>I'm not on the Rolex end of things, but I buy some really good quality designer clothes that don't really go out of fashion and last for years.</p>
<p>Like I bought a pair of black dolce and gabbana jeans for £120 but they lasted 10 years. My £150 Salomon walking boots are pushing 15 years and must have over a thousand miles on them. I've got a Jaeger suit that's 30 years old and still looks OK.</p>
<p>Quality dress shirts are far superior and last way longer than cheap ones.</p>
<p>I'm not spending loads of money but I get to feel good dressing well, which I also need to do for work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it depends on the person doing it and how much they make/spend! If you're able to spend on higher quality/less fast fashion, then why not?</p></div>		</li>
