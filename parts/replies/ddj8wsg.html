<p>Capitalism is &quot;the standard&quot; because it won the Cold War, a conflict where propaganda and trade sanctions ensured a skewed opinion. That's the extreme summary. </p>
<p>People always forget that &quot;Communism&quot; won the space race. The only reason the US aimed for the moon in the first place is because it was essential to the ideological war of capitalism vs communism. </p>
<p>When people say &quot;Communism doesn't work, look at Russia!&quot;, that's like saying &quot;Skyscrapers don't work, look at 911!&quot;. Well, sure, when something is being specifically attacked, <em>those things tend to fail</em>. Communism didn't just fall apart because it's unsustainable, it was very deliberately attacked by the west. </p></div>		</li>
