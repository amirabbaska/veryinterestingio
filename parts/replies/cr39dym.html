			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of bullshit.</p>
<p>The record companies bleep out the words in the radio edits because if they don't, they won't get radio airplay. But sometimes, the radio stations do their own bleeping.</p>
<p>When it comes to weed, you're mostly dealing with the latter kind. </p>
<p>Pop radio stations are under more social scrutiny than oldies stations (i.e. &quot;Cocaine&quot;) because pop stations are more popular among kids, and people don't want kids being exposed to drugs (and don't want to admit that bleeping it doesn't make a difference and in some cases probably makes it worse because the kids suddenly want to know what was bleeped and <em>why</em>).</p>
<p>There's no FCC rule against mentioning drugs in songs, which is why Cocaine is okay.</p>
<p>If a pop station played Cocaine, they'd probably be criticized and lambasted for it --- advertisers would be pressured to cancel their radio ads, hurting the station, because WILL SOMEBODY THINK OF THE CHILDREN. But Cocaine is not a pop song, it's an oldies song, and it is played on oldies stations, which kids don't listen to, so nobody fears kids learning bad things from them.</p>
<p>MTV routinely blocks out weed references, not because of the FCC, but because of the shit they'd take after people start accusing them of turning kids onto drugs. Because MTV is really the only music video service (well was one once), they've gotten artists to make different audio dubs and even versions of their videos with censoring -- Tom Petty's &quot;You Don't Know How It Feels&quot; with it's line <em>&quot;let's get to the point, let's smoke another nnyyyyaaaaoooowwww&quot;,</em> or Moby's &quot;That's When I Reach For My Revolver&quot; which was edited so the chorus would be <em>&quot;that's when I realize it's over.&quot;</em> Because violence and shooting is bad and stuff. Also, MTV didn't just censor drugs and violence in its videos, but even <em>logos for competitors of their sponsors</em> -- case in point, Digital Underground's &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot; -- <em>&quot;I once got busy in a Burger King bathroom&quot;</em> became <em>&quot;I once got busy in a BEEEEPing bathroom,&quot;</em> because McDonalds was a huge MTV advertiser. (And thus thousands of kids who only knew the song from MTV thought it was &quot;a fucking bathroom.&quot;)</p>
<p>It's not just the FCC (government) that radio stations (or MTV) are afraid of; they're also afraid of public outrage from uptight, naive, yet often powerful vocal segments of the community.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think you're exaggerating the &quot;avoid huge public outcry&quot; motivation.  Top 40 stations are geared towards kids and teens, as are the artists and groups that get played on such stations.  Parents wouldn't want or allow their kids to listen to those since those particular words draw attention.  That doesn't mean they'd grab their torches and pitchforks.</p>
<p>If people were actually deeply concerned enough to start a huge public outcry, they'd probably start by listening to the songs' messages, and Nikki Minaj's Anaconda, for example, wouldn't get any airplay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a counterpoint I present to you <em>She bop</em>, an inoffensive pop song about female masturbation. Now those warning labels on US records: they are because the wife of a US Senator didn't like songs about female masturbation and manufactured said &quot;huge public outcry&quot;.</p>
<p>Uptight powerful vocal segment caused censorship: historically true (search for &quot;Tipper Gore&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

<p>We used to have a word for those people...you know, back in the old days. They were called the &quot;Moral Majority&quot; minority.</p>
<p>You do have a good point about the influence of those loonies, though. Even if the average person doesn't give two shits about this sort of thing, these tiny groups push their weight around simply because they are active -- they write/call/email in to stations to harangue them at the slightest provocation, and, because that's who the stations hear from, that's who they are forced to placate. </p>
<p>It's kinda like how newspaper-cartoonists have a certain portion of their audience who will write in EVERY time there is something in a comic that they find &quot;morally objectionable,&quot; according to notes from the cartoonists themselves in some of their collected editions. Such writings often display a complete ignorance of the background of the comic, or even of the joke itself (<em>The Far Side</em> got these more or less daily) -- and, of course, anything these people don't understand is automatically &quot;bad.&quot; This, despite the fact that these &quot;watchdogs&quot; must have been reading the comics page, or at least, perusing it, <em>every damn day</em> in order to find the stuff to take out of context and write in about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Weezer's &quot;We Are All on Drugs&quot; had the chorus changed to <em>&quot;we are all in loooove&quot;</em>, which was pretty amusing since it was followed by the line <em>&quot;give me some of that stuff&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>But maybe the <em>most</em> amusing fact about this bit of trivia is that the song remained just as shitty as it was in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive also noticed lately that they have been speeding up songs. Not sure why but i guess its so they can say they have played a whole song but then have more advertisement time. </p>
<p>Next time your on those pop radio stations and you think the beat of a song is faster than usual bring up a version of a song on your phone and play it with the radio song. The radio one will finish way earlier. </p></div>		</li>

<p>you fucking shouldn't. the radio is marketing - they play what's profitable, they play what they think you'll buy.</p>
