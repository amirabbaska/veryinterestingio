			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what type of motor it is. If it's a corded hand drill, circular (Skill) saw or anything else with a universal motor the frequency is pretty much irrelevant. Universal motors don't have a natural speed limit and can run away much like the starter motor on your car. This is because the stationary windings are in series with the rotating windings.The internal mechanics limits it's max speed when not applied to a load.
A single phase capacitor start motor has it's speed determined by the number of internal poles and applied frequency. If your motor has a rounded off lump on the side of it, it's probably a capacitor start motor. The applied frequency determines the speed of the rotating magnetic field which induces a voltage/current into the rotating portion. This induced voltage/current creates a magnetic field which is opposite in polarity to the magnetic field that created it. Short answer, 50hz slower rotating magnetic field. 60hz faster rotating field. The same theory works on three phase motors.</p></div>		</li>
