			<div class="markdown"><p>Bulletproof glass is not the same as tempered glass.  Windows are made from tempered glass and shatter easily.  Bulletproof glass is made from layers of polycarbonate plastic and the kind of glass in your windshield.  Basically the glass is strong while the plastic is resistant to shattering.  The glass won't shatter regardless of what the bullet is made of.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The windshield will not be there anymore. How intact it is wherever it went off to is barely an academic debate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bullets and tank rounds often have a tungsten carbide, which I suppose is technically a ceramic, as a tip or slug that gives great armor penetration. Tungsten carbide has 9 mohs scale, the same as aluminum oxide which is what is used for spark plugs. So it probably does pretty well against bulletproof glass as compared to regular lead. </p></div>		</li>
