			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, humans are very unusual among primates because of our small canine teeth.  Male primates typically have big canines and use them for fighting.  Humans just use weapons for fighting, and keep our small mouths for efficient talking and eating.  </p>
<p>The basics of a human smile <em>are</em> analagous to the chimp play face (and similar play faces in other mammals), which involve a loosely-hanging mouth and can sometimes show the bottom teeth but never the top.  Humans just tend to be more open about showing a lot of teeth when adapting this expression, because teeth aren't weapons for us.  Not that humans don't give toothy snarls, too, as a separate expression.  </p></div>		</li>
