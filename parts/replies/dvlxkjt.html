			<div class="markdown"><p>The scions are small trees themselves. So they have roots that aren't visible. Those get connected to the outer parts of the original tree where the water and nutritients go through.
If you destroy a large portion of the outer layers, the tree won't get adequate water through the gap, so you can bridge that gap with smaller /younger trees.</p>
<p>here are a few more pictures of this and similar grafting techniques: <a href="https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/hort494/mg/methods.alpha/AprMeth.html" target="_blank">https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/hort494/mg/methods.alpha/AprMeth.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both of these techniques are used to repair damaged trees. They're not really the same as grafting scion varieties to rootstock like most hobbyists are interested in.</p>
<p>I should also point out that they're only useful because animal girdling only removes the cambium and phloem (they're after the sugars in the phloem) without disrupting the xylem very much, so the tree's water transport system is still intact. The scenario OP asked about would disrupt both the cambium and xylem and xylem cannot heal. Grafting is a very different situation than what OP described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could this have been reliably tried in the case where the oldest living tree discovered up to that point was killed by a park ranger when he happened upon a researcher who'd got his boring bit stuck in the tree?</p>
<p>Remember reading that the helpful ranger cut it down to free the bit.</p>
<p>Then it was realized when the rings were examined that it was the oldest known living tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are referring to Prometheus or WPN-114 which was a bristlecone pine. </p>
<p>It could have been attempted had they been a little cautious when retrieving their drill bit. But again all the factors I listed above come into play and many of them are not advantageous in this example. </p>
<p>Age of the tree, super old so the wounds will have a hard time healing. </p>
<p>Tree species, evergreens have a different structure to their vascular tissue than deciduous trees making them more difficult to graft. </p>
<p>Local weather, nearly zero rainfall which helped the tree survive so long by stunting it's growth significantly. </p>
<p>What they could have done was cut a wedge cut into the tree on one side then chiseled out until they had their drill bit. Drilled in a steel rod in the wedge cut to support the weight of the tree. Then attempted to use bridge grafts to heal the wound they created.</p>
<p>I highly doubt it would work. All of the factor are against you here. Usually you want a younger more vigorous growing tree in an area that has had good rainfall the last few weeks. </p>
<p>Also they had no clue how old the tree was until they cut it down and started counting the rings. The difficulty with the bristlecone pines in that area is they are half dead. Only parts of the bark survive the harsh environment. This causes the trees to be extremely stunted some growing as slow as a few millimeters per year. You would never know how old they are just from looking at them.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Ex landscaper and nursery worker here - we always held it that once an evergreen's cambian system was punctured it was as good as dead.  How long that might take varied based on a number of factors but it was basically when not if.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, what about cutting an elm tree in half razor thin and then grinding up each stump with excess elm sap so it's a sticky mixture of a freshly amputated tree. You plug the ends back together and use sap and maybe brackets with screws to hold it together tightly. Would the sap help repair the damage? Maybe bonding will occur? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>theres two different saps(phloem, xylem) so rubbing everthing with sap would probably be worse than just a clean cut but other than that you are basically describing grafting</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That wouldn't work. Trees are reliant on continuity of their transport vessels, phloem and xylem. The most likely outcome in this tree chopped down and balancing scenario is that the top bit dies and falls down whilst the stump sprouts like a coppice stool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way to capitalize on the rootstock of the stump in the logging industry? Like, instead of planting all new trees after clear cut would there be a way to graft a foot tall top onto the stump and have the vascular tissue line up enough? Obviously there's only a little bit of tissue that would line up on the stump but it could be a lot of the top piece, maybe enough to make it work?</p></div>		</li>
