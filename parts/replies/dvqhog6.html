<p>the changes involve increasing the debt, because a company with more debt is... more profitable... </p>

<p>This is not really an accurate description of a leveraged buy out. In an LBO, investors first secure a controlling (50%+) share of a company. They then have the company itself borrow money to buy back the remainder of the outstanding shares, generally at a hefty markup. This leaves the investors owning 100% of the company, and the company with significant debt. Profitability is cut by the interest on that debt, which is what happened with Toys R Us. </p></div>		</li>

Selling the assets and releasing the employees will allow them to be purchased or employed by people who can make economically efficient use of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes generally as far as I know. Toys R Us had 5 billion in debt so interest was one of it's largest expenses as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like are they taking similar risks to start up investors and just putting their fingers in as many jars as possible and hoping/knowing the success will cover their losses? Or are they buying, investing and restructuring them to make sure the investment has a high probably to generate revenue?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Their role varies.<br />
They can act as &quot;fixer uppers&quot; buying derelict businesses to make them profitable and appealing to other buyers or they can make a bet on a start-up.<br />
In other cases they may buy &quot;in bulk&quot; to throw away what they don't need and save what they're truly interested in.  </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that increasing debt short term may give creditors more chances to recoup some money in the long run if the business either becomes profitable again or can be restructured to last a bit longer. </p></div>		</li>
