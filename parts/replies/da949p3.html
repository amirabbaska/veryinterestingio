<p>If you're having a serious side effect like erectile dysfunction,  you should try switching to a different one.</p>
<p>I was on one that made my libido non-existent,  then switched to prozac.... it was like my libido volume knob was at 0 and then jumped to 25.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read about some supplements that were supposed to work &quot;wonders&quot;, yeah no stay with me here because it fucking works! Some dude on <a href="http://imgur.com/r/4chan/D7HWA4t" target="_blank">4chan</a> (yes, i know) tried out several supplements and recorded their effects. I ordered the best 3 just for fun and although I didn't have a problem before it made a very noticeable difference. My gf noticed it right away and can tell if I ate the stuff or not. First is <em>zinc</em> which is supposed to make you more horny, <em>l-arginin</em> which makes the erection noticeably harder for me and third is <em>lecithin</em> which makes the cum thicker and more white. This was supposed to make you cum more :D, which it doesn't for me but I when I take these for a few (three or so) days I am so fired up...</p>
<p>You are supposed to drink a lot and I guess the lecithin is optional. Just get the cheapest generic stuff. Recently I found out that stinging-nettle seed have a similar effect on horniness, may be the more healthy route. I know it sounds stupid but it works and theres no harm in trying. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Twice I read this as &quot;<em>Read</em> to him while he is asleep&quot; then tried to puzzle out what kind of subconscious brainwashing had you reading to her while she was asleep and then you waking up with her riding and climaxing on you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's often assumed that an erection is like a women's lubrication but studies show big differences. </p>
<p>For example, women get wet from fear and/or things unrelated to desire or arousal, and they often don't get wet when they are aroused (physically or psychologically). </p>
<p>It's correct to say that like a man, the lubrication system is different from the discussion of libido, it's just incorrect to classify it as the same kind of difference. </p>
<p>Come As You Are, the book, has great research references on what's known about female wetness. Wish I could point to some great reddit comments I've seen (with studies attached) as well but my search just now didn't turn them up. </p>
<p>Edit: there was a good amount of interest so I did some more searching to find you the real hero comment with lots of research links on female lubrication via u/ShaktiAmarantha. Enjoy!
