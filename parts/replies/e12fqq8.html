			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also Camera assignments for each camera during games. This allows for a producer to call for a replay from a certain angle with the expectation of a better look. For example, during NFL broadcasts there are at least 7 cameras working, 1 camera is your game camera, another camera is paying attention to the line of scrimmage, a third camera is ISOing wide receivers down field, a 4th camera is an alternate view from high end zone. A 5th is a low endzone view. The 6th camera may be the cart camera, which only tracks running plays and QB reactions (as well as goalline situations)  and a 7th camera as a side line handheld moving up and down the side lines. Directors and producers will develop a flow of what cameras they will typically go to for the replays during a game. Overtime, it is second nature.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That company is generally DVSport, Sony Hawkeye, or XOS. Described as above they use live transcoding for instant clipping and play review with multiple angles on one screen with a replay official, “in the box.” Super interesting stuff. Also a lot of large leagues have internal replay review which is impressive, but those are the big 3. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After the game the EVS op will make a package of highlights and pass them and all their angles to someone for storage for later use.  Mundane plays got burned. Granted my experience is working for a team’s jumbotron production, not national broadcast</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually often happens during the games. Depending on the size of the event thee might be operators working entirely on replays and others entirely on highlight packages. Smaller events though will have the replay operator saving clips throughout the game and during downtime they build packages. The way the system works you can instantly flick back to Live in the middle of making a playlist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never done anything as big as an American football match, but EVS gigs I've done often only want all the highlights from the event. If it's a sports game then the highlights between halves/quarters, and the full game highlights. Maybe sometimes some additional things like certain players. </p>
<p>The EVS itself basically has a rolling memory, when it's turned on it starts recording and just keeps going, when it hits the end it just starts recording over itself. The drives are big enough that there is plenty of time so you don't have to worry about going over the last days footage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not usually.  Everything is digital clips on huge servers in the broadcast truck so each camera can have its own footage recorder (iso record), but before hd, there were only a limited number of tape recorders capturing 30 second clips.
Because of huge databases linked to the footage, clips can be flagged for archive and saved for end of season highlight reels or player spotlights.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to hear this. The unsung heroes of live television go unnoticed until there is a fuckup. Every single camera angle change happens in seconds with the goal being to edit live and capture the best parts, its a chaotic atmosphere with heavily trained personnel performing with zero room for error. It’s actually pretty cool</p></div>		</li>

It's fucking terrifying, and the worst thing that happens if I screw up is a couple angry emails from parents. I can't imagine doing what these people do for pro sports. </p></div>		</li>
