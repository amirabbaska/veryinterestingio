<p>So, one way wealthy people money laundering is through 'fake' purchases that don't raise suspicion. Let's say I'm selling you $5m worth of illegal goods. You can't give me that money in cash as a gift, otherwise I'd have the same problem as the trucker earlier. So I sell you something else. Like a stupid fucking painting that's worth nearly nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is exactly how a portion of the High Art world works - there are many of these 'stupid fucking painting's that are used a cash chips to launder money around. </p>
<p>This quote from The Global &amp; Mail - </p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the World Economic Forum in January in Davos, Mr. Roubini, himself an art collector, said: &quot;Whether we like it or not, art is used for tax avoidance and evasion. It can be used for money laundering. You can buy something for half a million, not show a passport, and ship it. Plenty of people are using it for laundering.&quot;</p>
<p>Speaking on the sidelines of the Art Business Conference, Pierre Valentin, head of the art law practice at London law firm Constantine Cannon, said laundering illicit funds through the art market was seductive because purchases at auctions &quot;can be anonymous and it's a moveable asset. You can put the art on a private plane and take it anywhere. Plus there is no registration system for art.&quot;</p>
<p>Once purchased, the art can disappear from view for years, even decades. A lot of the art bought at auctions goes to freeports – ultra-secure warehouses for the collections of millionaires and billionaires, ranging from Picassos and gold to vintage Ferraris and fine wine. The freeports, which exist in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Singapore, offer a variety of tax advantages because the goods stored in them are technically in transit. The Economist magazine reported that the freeport near the Geneva airport alone is thought to hold $100-billion (U.S.) of art. <a href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/international-business/european-business/economists-urge-tighter-regulations-to-curb-money-laundering-in-art-market/article26217852/" target="_blank">source - G&amp;M Sept 2015</a></p>

<p>Say you have a buyer, a wealthy person who wants to purchase $10 million of illicit goods from you. This could be anything.</p>
<p>Now, you're obviously selling the drugs/weapons/people on the down-low and can't just randomly have $10 million in &quot;new&quot; income.</p>
<p>However, say your wife or child is in art school and has started to dabble in large-scale modern art. Coincidentally, your prospective buyer loves what they're painting! And even more coincidentally, they're in the market for a $10 million piece.</p>
<p>Well now they have a painting, and you have $10 million. To the public view, it's a completely legitimate transaction, and who can really say what high-end art is &quot;worth.&quot;</p>
<p>$10 million laundered. And now your buyer has a piece worth that much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did you get the cash in the first place? You most likely withdrew it from a bank account, which makes it easily traceable; or somebody who gave it to you withdrew it from a bank account.</p>
<p>Unless you do everything cash-only (both buying and selling), it's very very easy to find how/where you get money and where/how you used it. But even with cash-only, you can get caught. You can't transport large amounts of cash without declaring it either. Anytime you move through a border customs will ask/check for cash. It's completely legal to move $1m dollars in cash through your luggage in an airplane. However, it would be <strong>extremely</strong> illegal if you didn't tell customs that you have $1m in cash. If they find it, you'll probably be going to jail for a while unless you made an honest mistake.</p>
<p>For example, like 2% of Americans get audited yearly as well. It's often completely random. The IRS auditors come to your house, they know your exact income. If anything seems off, even a slightly-more expensive car, they're gonna ask <em>a lot</em> of questions and look into everything that can be looked into. Even if you handled only in cash, they'll find out. It's literally the whole purpose of their job and existence.</p>
<p>Another example is, let's say you get caught smuggling a few containers of cigarettes in EU. Though usually a minor crime that carries a small fine at worst, you can bet that they're going to look into you as much as possible after that. They want to know <em>how</em> much you actually made doing that. If they found you've been making $50k/yearly for decades, they're gonna fuck you up.</p>
<p>Illegal money is a risk vs. reward kind of thing. Obviously the less illegal stuff going on, and the less money, the more low-profile and the more likely you are of getting away. If you 'illegally' made $300 and paid no taxes on it and spent it at a fucking spa but still drive a fuckin' honda made in 96', obviously nobody is going to give a fuck</p></div>		</li>

<p>I really hope you meant cartons here, not shipping containers. A few 20' shipping containers will probably carry more than a fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part of your comment is the reason why if you  intend to purchase property through a mortgage the company wants to see proof of deposit and origination of funds into a legitimate account. If you were gifted funds, a lot of the time the mortgage company wants a statement of withdrawal from the persons or entity that gifted the funds. Property is fantastic way to launder larger amounts. Vehicles are a second favorite for larger amounts. Then you have petty amounts that would be simply changing funds into a different negotiable item or other form of currency. </p></div>		</li>

Deposit $10k cash in your bank, CTR. Win $10k cash at the casino, CTR. Failure to do so can lead to legal issues. Helps govt try to track/find suspected money launderers. Also illegal to structure cash deposits under $10k to avoid the reporting requirement. Making multiple $9,999 deposits? Look out!!</p></div>		</li>
