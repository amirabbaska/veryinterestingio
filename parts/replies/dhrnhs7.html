			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think that's cool, try the implications: first, the Earth rotates by a degree every 4 minutes, and by 15 degrees an hour.  Second, if you go outside and look at the stars, and you want to see the stars tomorrow night in exactly the same position they're in now, you need to look 4 minutes earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In thinking about this, I just realized something somewhat interesting: there will always be exactly one more sidereal day in a year than there are solar days. I'm pretty sure this is true of elliptical orbits and non-integer year:day ratios. Although it does imply that if there are an integer number of days in a solar year, there will also be an integer number of days in a sidereal year. In fact, I think you can even apply this to reverse rotating planets (relative to their direction of orbit) like Venus.</p>
<p>Can someone confirm this? I'm just working this out in my head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're totally right. It's just a straight &quot;+1&quot; as long as you book keep the number of solar days for a retrograde planet like Venus as a &quot;negative&quot; day.</p>
<p>Venutian years are 1.9 Venutian solar days. (-1.9)
Now we use your formula
Venutian years are (-1.9 + 1=-0.9)  0.9 sidereal days.</p>
<p>Now if we take the absolute value of everything (cuz that's how a Venutian would observe the patterns)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. If the Earth spun the other way around, then there would be one fewer. Follow it to the extreme: if the Earth didn't spin at all in the sidereal frame (i.e. counter-rotation of one day per year in the solar frame), it would still have solar days since it will complete one orbit per year. If the planet didn't spin at all in the solar frame, it will never complete a solar day but have one sidereal day per year due to the orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the orbit time is not a clean (integer) number of solar* days.  </p>
<p>Said another way: the time that Earth takes to come back to where it started takes 365.25 times as long as it takes to spin around.</p>
<p>*As someone else has pointed out above me. The number of sidereal days is always &quot;1+&quot; number of solar days. So really if the orbit time is not an integer number is solar days, it also won't be an integer number of sidereal days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting is that the closeness of both numbers (degrees in a circle and days in a year) is not a coincidence. </p>
<p>5150 years ago the sumerians were the first (that we know of) to count the days of the year (to know when to seed the grains, and using the fact that the shadow of a stone at noon each day repeats after a year). They got the 360±4 days number, which is relatively close to 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 = 360</p>
<ul>
<li>and they already considered the 3 x 4 x 5 = 60 a pretty magic number (roughly how we consider 100 a significant number today) so surely that cannot be a coincidence, it must mean something! </li>
</ul>
<p>So the sumerians picked a 360 days year, and decreed that the remaining 5 days are outside of the year, so why work then if nobody counted interest on loans during those  days (by religious decree), let's spent 5 days partying, drinking, and celebrating the new year! </p>
<p>And this is why we have 360 degrees around the circle - one degree is the distance covered by the Earth around the sun during one day.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's not entirely intuitive considering that daylight changes every day in a given location. It nets out throughout the year but considering that daylight drifts by a few minutes every single day it wouldn't be an easy logical step for a lay-person to figure that a day is exactly 24 hours as your comment seems to suggest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>24 hours.  Take the number of seconds to travel 360^o , divide by 360 to get number of seconds to travel 1^o .  Then divide that by 60, you have number of minutes to travel 1^o , which is about 4.  Add that back to the 360^o time, you get roughly 24 hours (and a little change, hence the need for a leap year).  Alternatively, since you get ~3.989 minutes/degree, multiply that by 361 (to get number of minutes/day), divide by 60 to get 24.0009 hours per solar day.</p></div>		</li>
