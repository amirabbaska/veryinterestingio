			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't entirely true. Not all recessive mutations will have been removed. Not even all the deleterious ones will be selected against. Inbred mouse strains have a plethora of genetic issues. The only ones that matter if you're really committed to making a strain of inbred mice are the ones that are absolutely deleterious...as in they lead to sterility or death before reproductive age. There might be a few other traits like overall fertility (genes related to litter size, etc) that could be strong enough to undergo selection in the lab.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the primary selective force in an inbred lab strain is the scientist putting them into cages. We breed all sorts of unhealthy mice that wouldn't propagate in the wild in labs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basic genetics knowledge here, but wouldn't it also be oversimplifying it as if every trait was just AA / Aa / aa and that's it, when there is also a lot of other effects like epistasis or polygenic traits?</p>
<p>Lethal genes will be eventually removed from the population, but the rest of the problematic genes can/will stay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. There's lots of other types of inheritance patterns we've described. Things like incomplete dominance, codominance, etc. In addition to the ones you've described. Generally, these categories do apply quite well, though, it just depends on what you define the &quot;phenotype&quot; to be. For instance the allele that causes sickle cell can be seen as recessive (generally need two alleles to cause the disease behaviors), dominant (need one allele to be malaria resistant), codominant (both blood cell types can be seen in the blood stream), or incomplete dominance (the general sickle cell shape).</p>
<p>At some point these things do become slightly semantic; however. Even at the molecular level, you can describe things generally using these categories (for instance, enzyme activity). An inheritance pattern that holds true at the molecular/enzymatic scale might not always appear to follow one of these heritable patterns when you're talking about a &quot;larger&quot; effect, like a physiological trait or a disease. We have a concept &quot;penetrance&quot; to describe how frequently the phenotype of a gene is observed when it is present. Not all phenotypes are completely penetrant. Hundreds of pages could be written on <em>why</em> that is, so it's far too much to go into here, in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite indeed. Just recently there was a study where they mixed lab mice with street mice. A significant part of the lab mice plain died, simply because they couldn't deal with the germs. The study concluded that lab mice might not be as good a model for humans as people think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It's so that they have very similar genes.</p>
<p>It should be noted that &quot;inbred&quot; mice definitely have deficits like an &quot;inbred&quot; person would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if that's the case how can we be certain the testing that is being done is accurate based on a majority of genetics not being inbred or recessive? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a biochemist that studies metabolism. I work specifically with mice called C57/BL6. They are a specific inbred strain that we use to model obesity and diabetes because they get obese and diabetic when given a diet that is mostly fat. They are good because we can assume that each mouse is VERY genetically similar to other C57/BL6 mice. This lets us study drugs and things in a way that the genetics don't matter between our study groups. So, the genetics are controlled for. </p>
<p>Now, this gets complicated because there are C57/BL6-N and C57/BL6-J. Without getting into why that matters, one has a mutation that effects mitochondria (the part of a cell most involved in metabolism) in a way that they get LESS obese than the other. It effects a bunch of things we look at, and vendors sometimes don't specify which they sell. </p>
<p>So when we do our studies and look at ones from other labs, we have to pay attention to what mouse strain they used, because you can get different conclusions. Before you think this is a problem, there are new labs that look at how different these mice are and what implications it has for learning about humans. Scientists are largely aware of the issue, but there is no perfect experiment. We get as close as we can, but we can't use perfectly cloned mice, and even if we did, there's a thing called &quot;epigenetics&quot; that means even CLONES may have different DNA regulation. </p>
<p>All of this is a very long way of saying we do our best, but different mouse strains sometimes behave very differently in the same experiment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We aren't. Testing on very similar breeds of mice can yield drastically different results because some small things are different. It's still useful because we can look and see what exactly is happening and see if that would be a risk in humans or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can never be certain. The only thing you can do is try to eliminate sources of error. If you use test animals that are very similar genetically, then you gain more specific information. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also volume. In the wild at least only a fraction of baby mice make it to maturity, then only a fraction still mate. However the ones that mate produce a massive amount of offspring.
Any defective mice, slow witted mice, disabled mice will not pass on their defective genes. Only the healthy breed.</p></div>		</li>
