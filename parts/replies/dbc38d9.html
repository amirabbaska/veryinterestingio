			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question for you - you specified that &quot;normal&quot; human sleep can be broken into predictable patterns. Do people who suffer from insomnia (chronic, not acute) also follow these patterns? My understanding was that some insomniacs, once they got to sleep, would be interrupted mid-cycle and have to start the cycle over. But I could be completely wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about insomnia, but I have Narcolepsy and don't follow the normal pattern.
I jump around sleep phases. Can have a REM sleep patterns, while I'm still actually awake. I don't cycle through the phases in a normal order</p>
<p>My Fit Bit still shows a fairly normal pattern though. Gets sleep and wake times pretty well, but then I tend to only try to go to sleep when I know I will</p></div>		</li>
