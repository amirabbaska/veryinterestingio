			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there was an anomalous precession of Mercury (43 out of about 1500 arc seconds of precession per century couldn't be explained), that Einstein's theory of gravity resolved. I'm just talking about the special theory of relativity though. Einstein did a lot!</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the general relativity, though, not the special. The general relativity is about the deformation of spacetime around gravitational wells (among other things), while the special (sometimes called restricted) assumes no accelerations (inertial frames of reference), that's why it's called special.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>from what i remember, most of the math was already there, though, wasnt it?</p>
<p>thats why its called the &quot;lorentz&quot; factor, and not the &quot;einstein&quot; factor.</p>
<p>did einstein have to do much in terms of math, or was it basically a case of &quot;if the constant c in the lorentz factor is light speed instead of infinity, we end up with the right thing&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Einstein contributed very little mathematically. Lorentz, Minkowski and Poincare did most of the deriving, but it took Einstein's vision to put all the pieces together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Astronomers had precise charts of stars already. Arthur Eddington chose stars which he knew would be very close to the perimeter of the Sun during the eclipse. (It had to be during an eclipse because otherwise the full brightness of the Sun would make it impossible to see stars close enough to the Sun for their light to be affected by its gravity.) Using Einstein's equations, he predicted the difference between where the stars actually were, and where they would <em>appear</em> to be. Eddington went to an observatory and measured with great precision where the stars appeared to be. Sure enough, his prediction was accurate.<br />
