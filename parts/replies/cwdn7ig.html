			<div class="markdown"><p>That is rather funny. My idiot cousin went to the trouble of getting Irish/American dual citizenship, then went to Spain to find a job.  Ended up getting a random woman pregnant and married a completely different person. Still no job, and no idea what he does over there for a living. Smuggling was suggested by another family member, but he isn't saying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We're living in the 'Plastic Age'. It's foreseeable that cars and our whole infrastructure is going to use more electric energy in the next 5 years. The value of oil is in the ability to make plastic and gasoline out of it, but what if I accidentally made plastic from cheap minerals. Would that change anything? I'm not an oil expert and may oversee other addictions of our industry to this resource. </p>
<p>I just know that Plastic and Gasoline are our most important resources in the 21st century. If we can make  plastic economically without oil and green energy replaces gasoline to a quarter in the next 10 years, thanks to electric cars and planes, would that make us independent of oil somehow?</p>
<p>EDIT: I wanted to add that calling our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-age_system#Three-age_system_resumptive_table" target="_blank">'epoch'</a> the <a href="http://rubbermaid.eu/about/plastic/" target="_blank">'plastic age'</a> and not something else like the internet or computer age maybe simplistic, but I don't think it's wrong to name it by the material that had the strongest impact on civilization. <em>The <a href="https://schoolsprehistory.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/timeline-page001.jpeg" target="_blank">three-age system</a> would look better if it wasn't missing a few other materials like glass, copper, plastic etc.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd be surprised. In the middle east the spending is INSANE. An incredible percentage of the people in Suadi Arabia/Oman/Dubai/other OPEC hotshots have multiple imported luxury cars and other massive expenses. This is because a lot of young men grew up basically drenched in oil money that practically falls into their pockets. The expenses by both citizens and the government grew explosively and unsustainably.  </p>
<p>While it's wise to curb spending in the case of a financial crisis, lots of people don't, especially when they have no reference level. If you're 29 and you've been used to getting magic oil money since you were 18 it's going to be hard to dial the expenses back when your only reference level is a constant, effortless cashflow. This kind of spending is common in people who grew up extremely poor (used to spending money as soon as they get it) and suddenly become wealthy. This is the reason why so many professional athletes go bankrupt, but at the national level. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What are the reasons for this, though?</p>
<p>How do so many people get in on this as opposed to just a select few in power etc.?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is rather silly. The amount of money Saudi Royalty spends on luxury goods is nowhere near enough to justify the idea that it is the reason they are going broke. Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund is worth ~$700 billion &amp; the UAE's $1.2 trillion (Oman is not really comparable to these nations). </p>
<p>The reports regarding Saudi Arabia's intentional bankruptcy has to do with the fact that they are depleting their foreign exchange reserves to support an oil industry that has seen massive price decreases. No one has gone bankrupt and Royal family spending is not a potential cause. </p>
<p>Your athlete analogy is also a bit backwards. If Saudi Arabia goes bankrupt, they have a wealth fund worth $700 billion that can back them. They won't go bankrupt, however, because they don't plan on assisting keeping oil prices so low.</p></div>		</li>
