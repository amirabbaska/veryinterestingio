			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all automated systems that are non PRT have a switch that can go from manual to automatic and back.</p>
<p>Now in built up areas, these crossing have sensors in place to detect whether or not a vehicle is past the barriers and some can even detect when people cross the tracks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Vancouver's can be automated because it doesn't have at-grade crossings to worry about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Morgantown PRT is an amazing system, but it is in desperate need of upgrades. Parts are getting harder and harder to find and the computer systems are from the 70s. </p>
<p>Reliability gets worse every year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that system is that it's incredibly unique and old which makes it incredibly expensive to maintain. Many rail systems are unique but share common ground where automation can relatively easily and cheaply implemented as companies (like mine) produce generic software and hardware and then custom tailor it to the rail system. That of course makes some basic assumptions that the majority of the worlds railway systems meet with the exception of the PRT. Even the most basic assumption of &quot;This rides on a rail&quot; is false. The system comes with many many legacy issues that need to be worked around using completely custom solutions.</p>
<p>For example, did you know that the original system was a closed loop and there was no possibility to steer the car from one guide way into the next?
Or how about the fact that the system is incapable of reversing at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was only there briefly in '05, but I remember the PRT being agonizingly slow when going around curves. I don't know if this was an issue with the software or hardware limitations, or if it was purposefully meant to be that slow for safety. For whichever reason, it was frustratingly sluggish. </p>
<p>From what you say it sounds like things have not improved.</p></div>		</li>
