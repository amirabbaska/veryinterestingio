			<div class="markdown"><p>You just highly collimate it one direction. Whether you start with a reactor or a spallation target, neutrons can be moving in any direction. But you make them travel through a long, narrow tube surrounded with shielding. This way, only the neutrons moving within some small angular range make it all the way through, and form the neutron beam for your experiment.</p>
<p>For some applications, you don't care if the neutrons are all moving in different directions. But in cases where you want a beam, you can make one using that method.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense! Is there any worry about loss of speed due to neutrons colliding with the shielding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't work by having the neutrons collide with the shielding and bounce down the tube, it works by having the shielding eliminate all of the neutrons except for the ones travelling in the direction you want. None of the colliding neutrons are used.</p>
<p>There is some work on using what are essentially very fine, very precisely curved glass fibers to aim and focus neutrons, but it's usually easier to generate them going in all directions and just select the ones that are already going the direction you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. The way that neutrons interact with matter is different than you might expect. Since neutrons don't carry any electric charge, they don't interact with atomic electrons. They only significantly interact with matter by scattering or reacting with <strong>nuclei</strong>. And as you probably know, nuclei are much &quot;smaller&quot; than entire atoms.</p>
<p>That's why neutrons are hard to shield and hard to detect; they just don't interact much.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when neutrons <em>do</em> interact with something, they don't just monotonically lose energy like a charged particle would when traveling through matter.</p>
<p>Neutron interactions are &quot;catastrophic&quot;, meaning that an interaction doesn't interact continuously with matter, but when it does, it scatters suddenly and its momentum changes significantly all at once (considering only scattering here, and neglecting reactions for simplicity).</p>
<p>So if you shoot a collimated beam of neutrons into some block of material, the energy of each individual <strong>unscattered</strong> neutron stays the same. Scattered neutrons generally have different energies after they've scattered, but they've most likely been scattered in a direction other than the direction they were moving in.</p>
<p>So when a neutron scatters, it is almost always removed from the beam. The beam consists almost entirely of neutrons which have not scattered at all, and thus have the same energy they had the whole time.</p>
<p>So back to the example of the collimated beam moving through matter, the energy of each particle in the beam stays the same, but the flux of beam particles (neutrons per unit area per unit time) increases exponentially with depth into the material. This is because as you get deeper into the material, more neutrons have had a chance to be scattered out of the beam.</p>
<p>Since the interaction probability is so low, the exponential decay can be very slow. So the neutron beam doesn't drop much in intensity through the material, and the energy of each particle stays essentially constant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrons still have a spin, and they can interact via the strong interaction as well. At very low energies, you can actually guide them with conventional tubes - if they hit the tubes walls under a shallow angle they get deflected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't remember that neutrons have an overall spin. It's been a while since I was in school. Most of my textbooks are from the 70s or 80s. I try to keep up, but, yano, life and stuff.</p></div>		</li>
