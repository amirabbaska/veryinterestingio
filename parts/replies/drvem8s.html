			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe we should call it a moral problem as well. The US sucks in all of the Colorado river, so not a single drop flows south of the border, on its natural course. Go to Palm Springs and be amazed what the modern technology can do to address rich people's needs. We are talking 125 golf courses, beautifully manicured, smack in the middle of a desert. Meanwhile the Colorado delta is white dry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I stand corrected. I think you are talking about the 1944 treaty</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boundary_and_Water_Commission#The_border_and_water_treaties" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boundary_and_Water_Commission#The_border_and_water_treaties</a></p>
<p>By this treaty, the US is to let 1.5 mm acre-feet from the Colorado river flow south of the border. This represents about 10% of the total flow of the river. </p>
<p>The morality of seizing 90% of the flow of the river is still questinable though.</p></div>		</li>
