<p>Although the opinions and views of the Monarch are influential, the Monarchs themselves cannot implement any policy either foreign, domestic or imperial/commonwealth. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>For anybody who lives in a British realm, I thought this is the obvious answer. The monarch presides over parliament and is not a partisan participant. Its the same now, you cant have the monarch taking sides when politicians and parties come and go. The monarch also acts as chief diplomat, and QEII does lots of behind-the-scenes diplomacy because she knows everybody of importance.</p></div>		</li>

I guess it comes down to a basic principle of democracy - elected reps hold power, ultimately. An appointed vice royal (or royal) figure essentially must do as the head of government requests. </p>
<p>What were the three duties of the queen, again? Duty to advise, warn, and something... I think those duties represent her only real role in government. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There is a very interesting exchange between Queen Victoria and one of her prime ministers in her letters -- exactly which PM I unfortunately forget -- where Queen Victoria wants the name of a second priest to in theory potentially contemplate appointing to some higher ecclesiastical position beyond the name the prime minister's office has sent her for assent.  </p>
<p>The PM sends a letter back claiming that this is dangerously close to exercise of the powers of a responsible minister by an irresponsible one (responsible and irresponsible are technical terms here) and then <em>complies</em>, offering a second name (pause and imagine the implications of various courses of action here by the parties involved).  </p>
<p>The Queen then defuses things by writing back that she is &quot;surprised by the tone&quot; of the previous letter and that she merely was asking the PM for the second name as someone she could measure the first guy to for comparison, as assenting to things in an <em>informed</em> way is a vital component of her duties and the guy involved is Joe Q. Whodafuck, and that what she was asking was equivalent to a request for information that anyone might make. And she assents to the first name.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria's letters are really neat. </p></div>		</li>
