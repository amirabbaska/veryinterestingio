			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I don't know much about this specific topic, but I believe that the following could work.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius" target="_blank">equation to determine the Schwarzchild radius of a black hole</a>.  If you set the radius to be a Planck length and find the mass, that may yield sone insight (as another poster said that the radius at which photons orbit a black hole is 1.5 times the Schwarzchild radius).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of what you said here is erroneous. All that matters for this question is the strength of gravity. This is related to mass, but more importantly to the density.</p>
<p>The extreme gravity of a blackhole comes not from it's mass so much (some are only a few times more massive than the Sun), but from the infinite density of the mass. With the mass compressed into an infinitely small area you can get very very close to the center of mass, and since gravity gets exponentially stronger as you get closer, it can increase to a point where gravity is strong enough to bend the path of light into a circle, creating an orbit.</p>
<p>With any other object, say a star, as you add mass you are also adding volume, so while the extra mass is increasing the gravity, you are also necessarily moving further away from the center of mass, decreasing the gravity. Even if you try to get closer by diving inside the star, and could somehow survive the trip, the gravity will actually start to decrease once you get below the surface. This is because now some of that mass is above you and some of it is below you. At the center of a star you would actually experience zero gravity, because the mass on all sides of you is pulling you equally.</p>
<p>And speed has nothing to do with any of it. Light is always traveling an the speed of light relative to you, even if you are traveling very very fast. At 1% <em>c</em>, light approaches you at <em>c</em>. At 99% <em>c</em>, light approaches you at <em>c</em>. It's relativity and it's weird, but light in a vacuum always travels at the speed of light no matter what you're doing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Take a look at the link I posted. Pretty sure this guy knows more about that than you or me.</p>

<p>Right, that's true but when the observer isn't on the planet, guess what? You'll see the light orbiting the planet/object/whatever. That's assuming you can slow down time to get a video, so to speak. </p></div>		</li>

<p><em>&quot;The mass of the Earth is about 5.97Ã—1024 kg, so the radius at which light will orbit works out to be about 13 mm. Obviously this is far less than the radius of the Earth, so there is no orbit for light round the Earth. To get light to orbit an object with the mass of the Earth you would have to compress it to a radius of less than 13 mm. You might think compressing the mass of the Earth this much would form a black hole, and you'd be thinking on the right lines.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Looks like the link you posted says exactly what I said.</p>

<p>I honestly have no idea what you are trying to say here. You would never &quot;see&quot; light orbiting a body from the body because the light is in orbit. You only see it if it hits your eye. To see light in orbit you would have to be passing through the orbit.</p>
<p>And I don't see what that has to do with speed, or why you think speed of the body has anything to do with photons establishing an orbit. </p></div>		</li>
