			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple things for clarity. In mountainous terrain, the usual limits are soils and available nutrients, and moisture for growth, not so much the available light. Competition for light is why trees grow tall, but the other factors control the results. The second point is to agree with the first post that exposure to the elements will limit height more than the gains from towering over the competition. Even perching birds can have a significant impact on tree tops. BC4STree represent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You only have to be a bit taller than your neighbors to win the competition for light. Anything beyond that is just wasted resources and increased risk of lightning strike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. There are cost to growing taller. One the benefits benefits of more light no longer outweigh the cost cost getting taller, selective selective pushes in the other direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that is the correct simplification. Basically, he's saying that most trees end up the same height because of selective pressures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does not explain everything - if a tree has a genetically different metabolism (individual variation), then it will still face the pressures of more wind or less sun if it doesn't conform.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, much of the area you're describing has been clearcut in the past, and there have also been forest fires along some stretches of that corridor. Logging and fire are certainly capable of leading to a consistent structure in the age of a stand. The area of Virginia you are describing is where I began doing my research; we tend to think of forest fire and logging as being a Western phenomenon in the US, but you don't have to go too far back to find a time when the East was extensively logged. That's why Virginia Tech and Duke University both have quite well-established forestry programs!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the person referring to the tree line?  The Altitude at which the trees cannot grow anymore.   </p>
<p>What is the reason for this?   I've always wondered why and just assumed it is because the air is so thin.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres probably many factors, but to name a few: temperature (it gets colder as you go up), exposure to snow (hard to grow from small), and mineral transport (there's not much food for plants up that high, it all erodes down the mountain).</p></div>		</li>
