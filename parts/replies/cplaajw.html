			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There are many factors that can contribute to the development of personality disorders, and we do revisit earlier developmental stages throughout our lives. Additionally, this is just one theory of personality based on Erikson's work, and it's not necessarily applicable across the board.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BPD needs to be more widely discussed among psychiatrists in the modern medical field. Everyone just diagnoses bi-polar and moves on. BPD is one of the saddest mental disorders (whatever you want to call it) that I've ever seen, and doesn't respond to any medication either. It's tough, but it's also highly workable with CBT and the likes. It's also fascinating, sadly. </p></div>		</li>
