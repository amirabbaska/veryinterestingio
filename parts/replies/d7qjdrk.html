			<div class="markdown"><p>Lipsticks are a great example of this. When standing, it's a solid, but once you apply to it to the skin, the shear is enough for the surface to liquefy and spread on the skin. It's not just a matter of melting (melting points of lipstick are usually a bit above 50C and humans don't run that hot). To achieve that, you blend oils and waxes with different melting points together, sometimes with interesting interactions. Castor oil and beeswax, for instance, for an interesting gel matrix, but beeswax feels very draggy on the skin, and has a very dull look, so you add other waxes to improve slip and shine, such as carnauba and candelilla. There are many other ingredients, such as esters and polymers that add their own thing to a lipstick formulation. It's a pretty interesting exercise in rheology, but that's also why a good lipstick base is hard to formulate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For free sources, trade journals like Cosmetics And Toiletries provide a lot of cool content, and somewhat friendly to laypeople at times too. <a href="http://www.cosmeticsandtoiletries.com/research/chemistry/premiumLipsticks-How-They-Have-Changed-and-Where-They-Are-Going--239944541.html" target="_blank">This Article</a> is pretty cool.</p>
<p>For paid sources, Monograph #8 provided by the Society of Cosmetic Chemists is a great, fairly detailed overview ($25). There's also good textbooks, though they run a bit expensive.</p>
<p>Youtube has a bunch of videos, but they are usually focused on the industrial manufacture, not so much the formulation. Still super cool to watch, especially the fully automated production lines. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dlykUSJJWcw" target="_blank">There's also a cool episode of How It's Made about this.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where does glass fall in? I read that glass windows that have been standing for years will be thicker at the bottom then the top, because it never truly solidified (I also read that if the glass was a true solid it wouldn't be clear and see through). Or I'm I just that gullible? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true. What happens is that the technology for making glass panes used to be very different. Today, glass panes are made by floating molten glass on the surface of molten tin, until you have a ribbon of glass of even thickness (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSurxsGQL90" target="_blank">this video</a> for more details). Back in the day, glass was made as circular plates. Glass would be blown into a hollow globe, squished into a bowl shape, and then flattened out into a disk. From this disk, individual glass pieces would be cut according to need. As a result of the process of manufacturing the disk, the thickness in the center is higher than at the edge. The very middle would have a bullseye pattern that was sometimes used as a decorative element. As a result glass was never really flat, and always had one side thicker than the other. Normally, the glass was installed with the thicker side to the bottom because it looks a bit better that way, but if you examine old stained glass windows, you can also find pieces with the thick bit on the top too.</p>
<p>States of matter are a lot more complex than we learn in school. If you're in the mood for being amazed, look up Bose-Einstein Condensates. Cool stuff happens when you cool boson gas to almost absolute zero.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an urban legend.  Turns out old glass was just made imperfectly and we all fell for the story as kids that it is a liquid slowly falling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What MajinAsh said about imperfect glass is true. A sheet of glass would have varying thicknesses. It would be cut into panes and those panes would have a thicker edge and a thinner edge. Glaziers put panes in window frames with the thickest edge down, perhaps for stability, thus giving the impression that the glass itself was flowing downward over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re: your last statement, I remember learning that something that can be both a solid or a liquid depending upon the shear force exerted upon it is defined as a coloid. For example toothpaste or ketchup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally. Some non-Newtonian fluids are shear-thinning (hit them hard, they behave as a liquid, push gently they behave as a solid). These are uncommon, though. Paint is one example: with no shear stress (or very little) as it hangs on the wall, it doesn't run. But if you apply shear stress with the brush, it runs nicely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just shear thickening behavior, there are many other non-newtonian fluids, in addition to shear thickening. They can be shear thinning, yield stress fluid, viscoelastic fluids, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-Newtonian fluids covers all types of behaviour other than plain old 'Newtonian'. Newtonian just means that the viscosity is constant over time (it doesn't get thicker or thinner the longer you stir it), and constant with shear (it doesn't get thicker or thinner the harder you stir it).</p>
<p>Non-Newtonian covers all kinds of other behaviours: shear-thickening, shear-thinning, time-thickening, time-thinning, and other more complex behaviours like where it won't shear at all up to a certain stress level, but then will start to behave like a Newtonian fluid.</p>
<p>So ketchup isn't really a 'reverse' Newtonian fluid, just one of a very diverse range of non-Newtonian fluid types.</p></div>		</li>
