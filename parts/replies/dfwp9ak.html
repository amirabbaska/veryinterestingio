			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Blending and straining out the pulp would be worse. Most smoothies have some whole fruit (good) and some fruit juice (not as good).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about fiber! The fiber slows the absorption of sugar. Like gilded said above- because your body has to digest the fiber it can only gradually absorb the sugar in the apple. The opposite of soda and candy where there isn't any fiber to slow the absorption of the sugar. 2 apples is close to 1 can of coke in terms of sugar content. 4 apples is def more filling than 2 cans of coke. Nutrient dense foods are what's important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In <em>some</em> cases blending of the fruit (or vegetable) makes it more healthy as long as you are leaving the &quot;whole food&quot; in there.  (note: for this I am ignoring enzymatic and oxidation damage)</p>
<p>Blending can make certain foods more bioavailble (IE your body can use it more/easier/better).  </p>
<p>Some more common examples would be spinach or blueberries.  Much of the nutrient content for blueberries is in the skin, but we can't easily extract the nutrients from the skin when intact as its made of things we just don't digest very well.  However when we break the cells open it allows us to extract the nutrition from inside the skin cell itself.  Similar principle with spinach and some other foods.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blending does not destroy fiber. A very good blender might possibly break it down a bit but that actually only makes it easier to digest. That's a myth and frankly kind of a dangerous one if it leads people to eat less fruits and vegetables because they believe it. It simply chops the fiber into smaller pieces, which isn't really an issue when considering the reasons we have to consume fiber in the first place. Blending can actually boost nutrient absorption and ease digestion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I eat something with a lot of fiber at the same time as a candy bar, will the fiber prevent the sugar in the candy from making my blood sugar spike? Or does it not work that way with processed sugars? I'm asking for a friend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. </p>
<p>You get fat from eating more calories than your body can burn daily regardless of macro &amp; micro-nutrients. </p>
<p>But I understand your sentiment! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Take a fruit for example. You're not eating just straight sugar, you're eating a lot of other components with it, like the fibrous material an orange is made out of. Your body digests it all at once</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn't make any sense. I mean I don't know how <em>you</em> eat an apple - apparently you swallow it whole? - but I'm a primate with <em>teeth</em>, which I use to masticate the fruits in my diet, breaking down their fibers and releasing their nutrients mechanically. Later on, in my gut, the fibers are further broken down by a process involving enzymatic degradation, chemical degradation via high pH, and further mechanical degradation via the churning action of the muscular stomach.</p>
<p>By the time the digested bolus enters the lumen, the plant fibers are broken down. They won't have any ability to impede the absorption of sugars in aqueous solution; it would be like trying to hold water in a straw hat. Fiber has nothing to do with your ability to absorb dietary sugar except in extremely simplified model guts that assume you never chew your food. If fiber could prevent us from absorbing <em>any</em> nutrients in foodstuffs we wouldn't have evolved to consume fibrous fruits. As well, the purpose of the <em>fruit</em> is to be nutritive (to encourage consumption by foragers like ourselves who will then spread and distribute the seeds amid a steaming dose of fertilizer.) Being so fibrous that it impedes absorption would defeat that evolutionary strategy.</p></div>		</li>
