			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the same thing as falling asleep. It's like... Only a few minutes and out cold. When well rested, not otherwise sleepy, etc. And when you wake up it isn't like waking up from sleep it's like falling out of bed or waking up from passing out or something. If it is happening to you then yeah you might have ADHD. </p></div>		</li>
