			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably instant deafness.  A rocket launch is meant to produce something like 180dB+ of sound. You'll start noticeably damaging your hearing quickly around 140dB.  Every 20dB of sound is 10x louder, so a rocket launch is 100 times louder than a sound that damages your hearing instantly.  Not sure if you'd sustain other injuries. </p></div>		</li>
