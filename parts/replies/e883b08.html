			<div class="markdown"><p>I researched this stuff a while ago. The reason why it's safe is because every piece of pork and also wild-boar is being tested. </p>
<p>They make it affordable by putting samples from around 100 animals into each test-batch. So the price comes down to a few €. The downside is: if one animal is infested all 100 will get disposed. </p>
<p>Still cheaper because those cases are actually quite rare. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why don't they combine that with binary search? The cost may still be too high to narrow it down to one animal but they may be able to cut it down to 50 or 25.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is largely possible because positive tests are so rare that you read about them in the newspaper if they happen.</p>
<p>I know a guy who is a hunter.  Game meat has to be inspected, too.  The inspection is €6 per boar, so it's really quite affordable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't it be smarter to just re-test individually at that point? Or is the test more expensive than the meat/too slow to do it and still sell the good meat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the test for one animal is too expensive. More then the price of a single animal. It's only cheap because they can test 100 animals with one test by mixing all the probes.</p>
<p>Not sure how. Maybe by letting it grow for a day and then test it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real Mettbrötchen experience is with Mett from your local butcher and bread roll from your local bakery (not from chains or supermarkets, etc).
And don't forget minced onions!</p></div>		</li>
