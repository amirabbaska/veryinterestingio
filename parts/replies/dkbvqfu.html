			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent synopsis of the Common Law system in the US. I'd add that sentencing varies greatly depending on the Court (there are many court systems in the US: municipal, state, federal, military, etc.) and also the particular judicial officer hearing the case. Even the most evenhanded judges are still human beings with their own particular worldview. Unfortunately, this can sometimes mean that two defendants convicted of the exact same crime will receive very different sentences, simply based on the judge's impressions of them. </p></div>		</li>

<p>From what I understand, Judges take a more active role in Civil Law systems for factfinding (calling witnesses, asking questions, presenting evidence) but less in sentencing. In the US Common Law system, the Judges rarely ask questions or present evidence. The lawyers are the ones to present all the evidence, and the Judges are there to make sure the evidence is legit.</p>

<p>This bit isn't <em>quite</em> true: this is a separate distinction between adversarial and inquisitorial systems, which don't entirely line up with civil/common law distinctions. </p></div>		</li>
