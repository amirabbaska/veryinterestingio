			<div class="markdown"><p>Fatigue is a tough one as there is neural drive which comes supraspinal. And there are limiting factors at the muscle itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first energy source for muscles is ATP, this lasts a few seconds. The second source is phosphocreatine. It lasts a few minutes. After that, you have muscle glycogen, and then glucose and things that can be made into glucose. If your muscles are working really hard, they’ll use up the readily available energy sources quickly and begin anaerobic respiration in the absence of sufficient oxygen.</p>
<p>As you exercise more, your blood volume, capillary number, and muscles will improve. You’ll get more glycogen storage capacity, which will reduce the fatigue. </p>
<p>The utter fatigue feeling is caused by depletion of glycogen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually phosphocreatine first which lasts a few seconds and then it switches to mainly ATP. Oxidation of glucose produces ATP (and other things) which provide the muscle with the required energy. Muscle contraction wouldn‘t work without ATP because the myosin wouldn‘t be able to connect-and contract- with the actin filaments. Phosphocreatine does however “reactivate“ ADP into ATP which is why there is more phosphocreatine in cells than ATP</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Thanks for the response. I've been working out a bit and wondered just what was going on in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good for you. Basically your body works better, your organs get better, and even cells and organelles like mitochondria improve. If exercise was a pill, it would be the most highly prescribed drug in the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was that actin&amp; myosin end up overestimated as the ion balance becomes closer to even in tge muscle cells. It might be more regulated at a neural level though</p></div>		</li>
