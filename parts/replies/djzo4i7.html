			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a stupid question, but it has been bothering me for ages and I dont think my physics teacher quite understood what I was asking when I asked her.</p>
<p>If I made an electromagnet out of a coil of copper around an iron core, I can then put a current through the coil which would create an electromagnetic field around it (right? Or just a magnetic field?). Now if I modulate this current using the same frequencies as visible light, why wouldnt the coil produce any light or glow? Would it if I applied more power? Is it a limitation of the material? Does it need in a vacuum? Or am I missing something here? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure if you could modulate the current with the frequencies of visible light, you would produce visible light. No mystery there. But if you are wondering why we don't produce visible light this way, it is because we don't know how to modulate currents with that high of a frequency. The frequency of visible light is extraordinarily high. In the hundreds of trillions of cycles per second. Even the cpu's in your computer don't oscillate any higher than a few billion cycles per second. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I understand correctly, electomagnetism is simply very low frequency light, correct? If that is correct, what is their frequency, and what are radio waves in that context?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Virtual particles do not have a speed. What you might be referring to is the heuristic using the time-energy uncertainty relation to approximate the range of a force given the mass of the mediator. This was famously used by Yukawa to estimate the mass of the pion associated with the nuclear force. </p></div>		</li>
