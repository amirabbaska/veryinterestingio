			<div class="markdown"><p>Stick to your answers. From beginning to end. Even if it seems silly. The interviewer I had got me to &quot;confess&quot; to stealing office equipment when he pressed me on stealing from the workplace before he hooked me up. </p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever stolen money from an employer?&quot;
&quot;No.&quot;
&quot;It's ok if you've taken a pen or a post-it, we're asking about money.&quot;
&quot;Beyond a pen or a post-it, I've never stolen.&quot;
... drops his pen
&quot;This is serious. You didn't mention that on any of your background papers. How many post-its are we talking about?&quot;</p>
<p>Dude grilled me on this for an hour before moving on. I thought it was a joke at first. That's when I realized what he was up to and it's all about sticking to your answers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A friend of mine wound up getting hung up on this exact question, despite being exemplary in all the other metrics. They basically told him &quot;how can we hire somebody we know to be a thief&quot; after he admitted that he had maybe absconded with a pen. We both thought it was absolutely ridiculous and felt like a set up. After reading this thread I'm wondering if there was just something else they didn't like about him so they used this angle to dismiss him?</p>
<p>The whole thing has never sat well with me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a pretty shitty attitude to have. Just because you don't feel you have anything to hide doesn't mean they won't <em>think</em> you're hiding something. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's an intimidation tactic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, this. I worked at a place once where some expensive equipment got stolen. The higher ups had an inkling that it was an inside job, so they asked all the employees with access to that equipment to take a poly. When I did it, they told me that I had been lying on the question about whether or not I'd stolen it. They even showed me the spike when I answered the question. I hadn't stolen it and reiterated as much. Later, when talking to some of the other employees that had taken the polygraph, they all told me that the exact same thing had happened to them. Not most of them. All of them. They were just trying to intimidate someone into confessing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked with loss prevention before, and someones purse was stolen out of the break room. They did the same thing to us, but without a poly. Interviewed us one by one, and gradually went from &quot;Did you do it?&quot; to &quot;We know you did it&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Polygraphs work because they incorporate Wonder Woman's lasso of truth.  They tie it around your chest.</p>
<p>Oh wait, I forgot!!  It isn't the same as the lasso of truth, BUT the same guy invented both of the fictitious items.  Neither a lasso of truth nor a lie detector machine exist or do what they say they do.  They should be outlawed in my opinion, except for novelty items to use at carnivals and palm readers.</p>
<p>Your comment nailed it.</p></div>		</li>
