			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story, my great grandmothers maiden name was Freestone. During the Great Depression, her father sold fruit. Well back then the clingstone peaches were a lot cheaper for him to get than the freestone. Well he had an advantage with his name. He would just sell the clingstone peaches as Freestone and technically be tricking people into thinking they got the more expensive kind. </p></div>		</li>
