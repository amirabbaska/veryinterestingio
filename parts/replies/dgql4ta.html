<p>&quot;you can't try to fix your saggy mattress by rubbing it with springs!!&quot;</p>
<p>Cleaning, exfoliation, daily light massage and a simple light  barrier lotion. There you go. Your granny and her mineral oil or ancient pot of nivea had the right idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And stay out of the sun as much as possible; sunscreens haven't been proven harmless for daily wear every day of your life. Titanium oxide is the most harmless sunscreen, but the old formulations made you look like a ghost.
