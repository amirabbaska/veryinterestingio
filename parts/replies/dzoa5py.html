<p>As an atheist who isn't hung up on such things but still feels it's important not to particpate in civil religion</p>
<p>only God knows</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so when does using a phrase containing &quot;god&quot; amount to participating in civil religion and when doesnt it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume OP means that they don't argue with situations where religion is embedded in our society. Like when someone says &quot;say a prayer for my sick son&quot; you say &quot;Ok, I will&quot; instead of &quot;Fuck your religion, medicine will save your son, not Jesus!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's generally what I mean. I take things in the spirit they are given and do not mind holding hands while someone says grace if I'm at their table. And I also mean that I don't have any deeply felt personal opposition even to swearing on a Bible, so there is part of me that shrugs and says &quot;who cares?&quot; And goes along to get along. But I'm also ideologicallh imposed to the government promoting religion either generally or specifically and so think its important NOT to go along even though I'd rather just get it over with.</p></div>		</li>
