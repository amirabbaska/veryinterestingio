			<div class="markdown"><p>It probably shouldn't. </p>
<p>From the sounds of it, it's caused by your stomach looking for extra food.</p>
<p>Sounds to me like you have a healthier appetite than I do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get hungry when I'm extremely sad, to the point of my family members telling me off in important situations.</p>
<p>When we were in the hospital surrounding my grandma as she slowly slipped away and died, everyone was crying, then my stomach rumbled loudly. My brothers were like: &quot;Really? Even now you're hungry? Come on.&quot;</p>
<p>I can't control it, I'm hungry when I'm sad.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you overweight? Do you eat a lot when your sad because it comforts you and offers an escape from reality by stuffing yourself with delicious food?</p>
<p>Me too. I do it as well. And I drink myself silly until I black out and wake up with a bunch of bruises and cuts.</p>
<p>I ripped my skin because I tried to freak my old supervisor out on FaceTime because I was very drunk and I was playing catch wth a knife and it landdd on my arm and cut me really badly...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least for me, my stomach only rumbles when I haven't eaten in a long time, not just when I'm a bit hungry.</p>
<p>If you're responsible with when you eat, and don't let yourself go hungry for long periods of time like an insane person, you might never hear it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's me. Mine only gets rumbly when I've not eaten in around 15-20 hours. </p>
<p>Apart from the occasional sloshing when I've drank too much tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would you ever go 15-20 hours WITHOUT eating?</p>
<p>EDIT: HOLY HELL PEOPLE. Sorry for saying something on the internet without being highly educated on the matter first. I understand that fasting CAN be healthy... No I am not fat, no I am not anorexic, no I am not a fasting or nutrition expert. I do eat around 3700 calories a day though, so pardon me for having a mild freak out when someone said they go 15-20 hours without eating. Shit I realize I have lied on the Internet which is fucking unforgivable and CLEARLY MAKES ME THE SCUM OF THE EARTH. Holy balls...</p>
<p>EDIT2: For those in disbelief that I am not overweight, I am incredibly active, and my TDEE is about 2900 Calories. Pictures in my post history if you so wish though (NSFW)</p></div>		</li>

<p>My mom and I were really poor in high school and at the end of the month (when we ran out of money and food stamps) I usually only ever bought 50 cent bags of chips for lunch and would eat a cup of ramen when I got home... definitely didn't like going hungry, but it definitely happened for quite a while</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry, I didn't mean it like that :(</p>
<p>I meant it's a little insane to go hungry even though you have plenty of food to eat, just because your too lazy to go get it. I end up doing that a lot.</p></div>		</li>
