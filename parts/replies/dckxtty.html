			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have a question about this, given your answer. You mentioned that those born to Jewish mothers are also considered Jewish, regardless of whether or not they choose to follow the obligations in the religion.</p>
<p>I think some might say that the very fact that the religion follows a matrilineal inheritance is the very reason they might consider it a race as well as a religion. You mentioned that there is no renunciation process for Jewish heritage. So regardless of whether you follow the religious obligations, you would be considered Jewish. </p>
<p>No other religion has this kind of mandate. For instance, if a child was born to a Catholic mother, the child wouldn't be automatically Catholic. I can't think of any religion that has a matrilineal (or patrilineal for that matter) inheritance other than Judaism. Of course, I could be totally off the mark there; please correct me if I am wrong.</p>
<p>Certainly, having parents that follow a certain religion might make it much more likely that the child will follow that religion as well, but as far as I understand it most other religions require some kind of affirmation once you reach a certain age to indicate you would like to become a fully fledged member of the religion. And if you choose not to go through with it, then you are no longer associated with that religion.</p>
<p>Religion is not usually a kind of designation that is given to you at birth and then retained throughout life. That seems more in line with ethnic designations. For example, If a child is born to a Jewish mother but considered him/herself atheist, s/he would still Jewish, correct? Yet if a child was born to Hindu parents but became atheist, the child would not still be considered Hindu. The child might be ethnically Indian, but would not be Hindu. </p>
<p>I believe the analogy you used was that once you are born to the nation, there is no renunciation process. This is a feature unique to Judaism, is it not? Perhaps it is because of the matrilineal inheritance feature that many people feel it is ethnocentric: because while you can have converts (like any other religion), there are a certain group of people who, due to bloodline, retain the status regardless of personal belief. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Islam has the same concept (except it's patrilineal IIRC).  If you have a Muslim father, you are considered a Muslim. If you don't believe in Islam, you are an apostate, not a non-Muslim.</p>
<p>I think ethnicity is a more accurate term than race.  A race is generally a broad group spanning at least a large part of a continent with very distinguishable features from those of other races.  An ethnicity, on the other hand, is narrower and not as visibly distinct.  For example, you might be able to tell if someone's Korean v. Japanese or German v. Polish.  But not as easily as you can tell if they are German v. Korean.  Poles and Germans (and Koreans and Japanese) are different ethnicities in the same race whereas the former group is a different race from the latter (each race consisting of many nations).  Jews, as an ethnic group, are more like Koreans v. Japanese than Asians v. whites.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is true. Though, I don't know about the apostasy thing. I do know that a lot of Muslims believe this, but I'm not sure as to what the actual religious text has to say about it (it is two very different things). </p>
<p>Most of the Islamic scholars I have listened to seem to suggest that it wouldn't be the case. Muslims believe everyone is born a Muslim and is simply guided away from it, that's why converts are called reverts. </p>
<p>So it doesn't make much sense to say that someone born to a Muslim father would be an apostate because they don't believe in it. An apostate would have to be someone who came to believe, took shahada, and then rejected it later. A kafir is someone who &quot;covers the truth&quot;, i.e. knowing the truth, and then covering it to reject it. </p>
<p>So, just thinking logically, I don't really see how that would make much sense. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Considering that there is only one human race, all of the same species and subspecies, ethnicity is a wholly more accurate term.  </p>
<p>There is no real taxonomic difference between one human being or another, beyond shallow similarities in physical appearance (skin color, hair color, eye color) - and those similarities are just another defining characteristic of one's ethnicity.</p>
<p>If we could drive that sameness in to everyone's heads, get people to understand that we are all biologically the same (none of us born biologically inferior or superior to the other), we would be taking a great step in moving past racism to the next most important social enemy, xenophobia.</p>
<p>The biggest thing holding us back from eliminating racism is the idea that we have more than one race in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you're right, but &quot;race&quot; is a loaded term. What you've described more describes a tribe, and I think that applies to the Jewish identity more than modern notions around race (all the colors). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to get controversial here, but do you think anti-semitism isn't racism then? Because hating certain religions seems to be more acceptable than &quot;racism&quot; these days, even if the two are regularly conflated or treated as equally abhorrent by more tolerant people. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If race is defined by genetics, and not culture, that's still not true.  For example, if I claim that every European born to a white mother will henceforth worship the God of Football, that doesn't mean they're racially different.  It's purely a religious, cultural decree.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>It might be helpful, though, to think of the Jewish people as a nation. You can either be born to a nation automatically and have all the obligations incumbent on you automatically by virtue of your birth, or you can join the nation (&quot;naturalize&quot;) by agreeing to follow rules and being accepted by a designated authority.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not an analogy. The original poster presented it strangely. It's literally how all of our writings refer to us. The word עם (nation) is almost always used. The word for religion (דת) does not appear frequently in the Hebrew Bible, and when it does, refers more to &quot;law&quot; than &quot;religion&quot;.</p>
<p>Even in modern Hebrew, Jews are called עם ישראל (the Nation of Israel).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many things people consider the same about all major religious very often doesn't apply to how rabbinic and Orthodox Judaism operates. Most noticeably, Judaism is not concerned with how the rest of the world operates as long as it is a moral place and follows 7 specific laws (have courts of justice, do not eat from a live animal...). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also not very accurate. If your Mother is Jewish, by Mosaic law you are as well--forever. I can give up my U.S. citizenship by becoming one in another nation (note this is specific to U.S. law which prohibits dual-citizenship unless born into it; some countries may let you keep theirs), whereas even if a matriarchal Jew converts to another religion they are still considered a Jew. They don't become a Gentile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIR &quot;Someone with a Jewish father but a Gentile mother is not Jewish (unless s/he converts).&quot; is only true in rabbinical judaism, (which is, arguably, almost universally dominant, other judaic traditions, which had a patrilinear &quot;transmission&quot; of being considered a Jew [e.g. Karaim]* exist today only marginally but were prevalent in the past).</p>
<p>*) Yes, Karaim are not considered Jews by rabbinical Judaism. But that's pretty much a case of &quot;true Scotsman&quot;.</p>
