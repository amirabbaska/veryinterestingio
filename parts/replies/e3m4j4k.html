			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is way too low. Many if not most &quot;name-pros&quot; make more money from sponsors, endorsements and other deals than from actual poker winnings. Online poker promotion is probably the biggest one, but there are tons of other ways to make additional income. Teaching, videos, YouTube, Instagram, hosting, writing books, TV and movie deals. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes and this did not exist until there were huge online casinos for poker.</p>
<p>the argument that &quot;spreading the wealth&quot; by flattening prize payouts is completely wrong -- this benefits the casino by keeping more money in the hands of more people rather than it concentrating in the hands of the most talented. obviously the casino would love if a tournament payout included literally every player minus the casino's cut -- the casino makes the same amount but now there are more players with money to continue to gamble.</p>
<p>whereas a &quot;winner takes all&quot; event would mean one player ends up with like 80 million (at wsop main event) and might never gamble another dollar. i would prefer WTA events where players can make deals among themselves if they want which the casino enforces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention you’re getting bought-in by your sponsor. One of my friends is a pro, and most pros are sponsored. So if you play a bunch of tournaments a year (or cash games and your sponsor buys you in) they buy you in. So you’re never actually risking your own money. </p>
<p>Let’s say your sponsor bought you in $60,000 worth of entry fees/cash-ins up to that point in the year. Let’s say you hit a big tournament and win $300k. You first pay back the $60k, and then you and your backer split the remaining $240k. </p>
<p>(This may be anecdotal to my friend. I’m sure different arrangements exist with different players/sponsors)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sponsorships however only last while you win. think of the names of 10 or 15 years ago -- i can think of only one guy off the top of my head you still hear about (although i may be wrong). Hellmuth seems to be getting exposure but there's a guy of great talent, Huck Seed, I have not heard about in years. Maybe he is still playing, I don't know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but those guys and others were getting sponsorships before 10 years ago as well. Poker exploded and it was on every channel you flipped to. Like anything else, the hype died down. But that doesn’t mean that those guys aren’t good or getting backed any longer.
For a small reference: the top 10 earners of 2018 include: Daniel Negreanu, Phil Hellmuth, Phil Ivey, Antonio Esfandiari, John Juanda, and Erik Seidel. All those names were prominent 10 years ago but haven’t heard much about them since. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it has to do with Full Tilt. A lot of the famous names were part of that site, and when it folded and they couldn't afford to pay all their players, most of the names associated with Full Tilt wanted/were forced to step out of the limelight for a while. (Phil Ivey has always been a private person, regardless of Full Tilt. He hates being on feature tables.) A lot of them are still there, just avoiding attention.</p>
<p>You haven't been hearing of Daniel Negreanu? (I'm not saying anything about you. Just curious about what names you hear about.) He's with Pokerstars so never had that backlash against him. Antonio Esfandiari aka The Magician, also never a part of Full Tilt? Both of them had good showings in some big events at the World Series this year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does that work tax-wise? </p>
<p>If I get my BI sponsored for, say 1000$, do I have to pay taxes on that? </p>
<p>Taxes vary of course by country but probably many countries do something similar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn’t pay taxes on your buy-in, but you would pay taxes on your earnings/winnings depending on what country or state you won it in.  Las Vegas, if I’m correct, doesn’t tax winnings and thus it’s become a Mecca for gambling and professional poker players. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t think this is true and am a tax lawyer. The tax reform bill changed section 165(d) to provide that otherwise deductible non-wagering expenses incurred in connection with a wagering transaction are only deductible up to the amount of winnings. The Tax Court previously held that a professional gambler could deduct travel, lodging, etc. expenses even if they were a loser overall. The change reverses that holding, it doesn’t expand the universe of what is deductible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That helps but i wonder if the skill factor is enough to offset just the house take.</p>
<p>also, the deduction i think is not from previous years, right? just the year in which the income occurs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct. The new tax bill limits the amount of travel, etc to the extent of winnings, so their Sch C is now breakeven at best and can not produce losses.  it’s actually an unfortunate turn of events for the pro poker players. </p>
