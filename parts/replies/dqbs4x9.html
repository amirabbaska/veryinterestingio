			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP is wrong. I believe it is due to the pipe having different resonance* frequencies at different temperatures and when you reach a certain temperature the flow of the water is at the perfect frequency to create vibrations within the pipes to make the sound you hear.   </p>
<p>*resonance is when vibrations and energy is optimally absorbed by an object</p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone who thinks they understand resonance...damn do I wish some phrased it that way for me from the start.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where is the vibration coming from to generate a sound loud enough to be heard? That requires a bit of energy to produce a sound that loud, so there must be energy introduced to the system at some point. I think this is caused by water hammering at an almost closed valve, which is why the vibrations begin. The pipe is generating the sound, only because the valve is producing the vibrations. You're ears are just receiving the vibrations in the air as sound waves, which is likely resonating off of everything it's attached to. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's many other things that can cause a sound like that in pipes, but this is the most common reason why you would hear it when turning it to a certain point only. Yours could be due to blockage or air in the pipe being forced out until it's clear, which would explain why it only happens at first. And if you're noticing air in your pipes, there might be a leak somewhere. </p>
<p>But somehow, vibrations are being created in the pipe to create the sound. It's just determining where and why. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really depends on the year the plumbing was installed as well. </p>
<p>I remember growing up in an old farmhouse where certain faucets continuously hummed, no matter the temp(water or air),pressure or volume. </p>
<p>That was mostly due to back-pressure from reducers with no relief.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. In my house, water heater is in the basement. Turn the shower on 2nd floor on and walk away because it takes a while to warm up. I always know when the hot water had reached the shower by the change in the sound. Over a few seconds time, it shifts to a much higher frequency</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The temp does matter to the sound. Try taking two Empty identical eggs bottles and put one in the freezer and keep the other at room temp. Make them whistle by blowing across the top. You will hear a different tone out of each. The sound created by resonance is affected by many things... flow rate, material density, material mass, flexibility, etc...</p></div>		</li>
