			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes perfect sense, but I hit a deer one night and it caused me to think about why for a bit. I don't believe the deer saw my truck, it saw the lights floating through the air. The deer came out of nowhere, it attempted to cross the road in a panic exactly as my truck was intersecting it's path. I feel it made sense to assume that the deer, even with superior low light vision, saw the illumination of its intended path from my headlights and took the new opportunity to try and cross. Poor bastard just couldn't comprehend that there was 3 tonnes of metal attached to those lights. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive put thought into this as well. I imagine that a road at night appears to be blacker than black. Much like a creek might, or a large hole in ground. A deer might hesitate at crossing unknown darkness. Then comes along a mysterious light and illuminates the path. Deer decides to cross, only to be killed by the source of mysterious light.</p>
<p>Just a theory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A deer's natural predator is a wolf or mountain lion.</p>
<p>If they see two glowing eyes coming towards them, it's already too late to run straight away.  They can outrun their predators in a straight line, but <em>not starting from a stop while the predators are already moving full speed</em>.  Therefore, they are programmed to wait until the last minute and dodge to the side, causing the predator to overshoot, at which point their superior speed and endurance will let them escape.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they're programmed by evolution for mountain lion speed and size, not car speed and size.</p></div>		</li>
