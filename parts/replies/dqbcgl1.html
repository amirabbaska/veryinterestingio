			<div class="markdown"><p>Or if it's been a very, very long time since you had chicken pox! <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/shingles/public/index.html" target="_blank">According to the CDC</a>, you should get vaccinated against shingles if you're over 60. Like other viruses, it continues to evolve and there are many strains. </p>
<p>(My mother had shingles a few years back --- it's extraordinarily painful.)</p>
<p>Edit: Looks like the recommendations were just updated in October, they now say if you're over 50, you should get vaccinated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, dad got shingles, under 60. Somehow the guy that never goes to the doctor realized something was very wrong and went to the ER in the middle of the night and they were able to get it under control before it got really bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had Shingles two weeks ago. 36 years old. Triggered by some fairly extreme work stress (temporary, one-off, not a routine part of my job). Pretty painful, apparently worse if you're older. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shingles is pretty bad and re-emerges from Chicken pox.</p>
<p>It comes out whenever you're immunocompromised and getting old weakens your immune system. So does a lot of things like radiation therapy and stress which would come in common as a person ages. So definitely consider it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in health care on the front line, all these anti-vacc parents are scaring the ever loving shit out of me. Never had chicken pox as a kid and now as an adult, I'm unable to get vacced for it being immuno-compromised (I'm on chemo for life). </p>
<p>It's literally just a ticking bomb for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh damn that’s insanely scary. I’m surprised you can work front line healthcare without immunity to something so life threatening and infectious. </p>
<p>I suppose it’s good that kids with chicken pox go to the GP not the ER. I’d be incredibly afraid of adults though. Especially some of them wander around sick without treatment unless it’s halfway to killing them and I would not want to be in your shoes if and when that happens :( </p>
<p>For what it’s worth, at least shingles spreads via skin contact, and anti-vaxxers have stomach for less efficient but effective measures like pox parties. </p>
<p>Still, a kid having shingles at my brothers primary school ended up causing quite a scare. Probably because kids touch each other and that’s just a balloon of disaster waiting to pop </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to get a exemption from the legalities, as it would fall under the category of discrimination or endangerment of my health forcing me to receive a live vaccine for work purposes. Guess they're just covering their asses, my days are numbered in my occupation I'm fairly sure. The risk is just too great :/</p></div>		</li>
