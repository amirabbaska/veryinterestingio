<p>We have a slight bit of an idea. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5oa6pz/how_are_cosmologists_able_to_estimate_the_size_of/" target="_blank">This was the subject of an /r/askscience question that I asked</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out, because the curvature of the universe is either flat or very close to flat, we know the size of the radius of the entire universe is, at a minimum, 150 times larger than the observable universe, and could be infinite.</p>
<p>Also, since no one has mentioned it so far, the radius of the universe is actually 46.6 billion light years. 93 billion light years would be the diameter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the universe, if we could freeze all expansion and travel billions of light years instantly, we would never find the edge of the actual universe? How is this consistent with the Big Bang Theory where it expands at a finite rate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what that guy's reply said. What he said was that IF the global curvature is as positive as possible given our observations, then the maximum size of the universe is known. Otherwise he didn't give any estimates. He's also made a slightly stronger assumption than he stated, as our local (observable universe) could have a different curvature to the rest of the universe.</p>
<p>Take this all with a pinch of salt, I'm a mathematician, not a physicist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP but to expand on that more. The universe expansion will eventually lead to the &quot;shrinking&quot; of our observable universe. Galaxies will move beyond the edge of our observable universe. I say 'our' because your location in the actual universe defines the center of your observable universe. Someone 10 billion light years away will not observe the same space we observe from here. There will be some overlap like a Venn diagram. But back to the &quot;shrinking&quot;. If anyone is around in the distant future they will see nothing beyond the milky way galaxy. It will appear as though our galaxy is the only thing in the universe. It is somewhere in this long but amazing lecture.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A slight correction no one has mentioned: The 93 billion light-year figure is a diameter, not a radius. So the edge of the Observable Universe is actually 46.5 billion light-years away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words: the light we see coming from the most distant places in the universe was sent 14 billion years ago from 14 billion light-years away, but since the universe is expanding whatever emitted that light <em>back then</em> is <em>now</em> 96 (or so) billion light-years away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The more space there is between you and some distant object, the more quickly new space is added when it expands. If you have two objects that are a million light years apart, doubling the space between them adds a million light years, putting them at two million light years apart. But if they were 100 million light years apart, they would be 200 million light years apart after expansion, 199000000 light years more than the first example! </p>
<p>Eventually there is so much new space being added so quickly that light can't cross the distance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You only have a maximum diameter of 28 billion light years otherwise things would need to travel faster than the speed of light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible. It doesn't contradict anything, since the speed of light is the limit for propagation of matter (energy, information...) through space, not on the properties of space itself. No physical communication can happen faster than C, but the expansion of space isn't communication, it's just a background fact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An easy way to think of it is that the amount of space is increasing, not that the galaxies are moving outward.</p>
<p>Say their original xyz coordinates stay relatively the same, but that xyz now means something else because of added spacetime</p></div>		</li>
