			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like those costs are going down though. Looking at a BMW 3-series, for example, the auto upgrade costs around 1500 euros. Looking at the fuel savings over the life of the car, that isn't much...</p></div>		</li>

<p>EDIT: when I say upgrade I'm saying its a nonstandard option that costs more money and y'all don't know what upgrade means </p>
<p>EDIT2: if you're buying a used car then yes you guys manual is usually cheaper</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not remotely; I bought a Fit brand-new in 2015 and saved like $700 because I went with the manual transmission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are still heavier and have more rotating mass, so there is some loss. The efficiency of modern automatics and the rising rate of 8, 9 and 10 speed transmissions make them pretty much equal or slightly better for economy now. If the transmission is strong and has good tuning, you can even get them to perform better in performance cars like a Corvette (which can be had with an 8 speed auto or 7 speed manual). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Also, the auto box I drive with has 9 gears, allowing the engine to rev in its optimal powerband for much more than what would be possible with, say, 6 gears. Shifting through 9 gears manually would just be impractical and obnoxious...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they cannot physically fit 9 gears in the space available.  an automatic works VERY differently than a manual, it uses combinations of gears (3 or 4 planetary gearsets) to produce 9+ ratios.  </p>
<p>a manual is 1 for 1, so every gear you add means it gets that much bigger.  You could go high/low as semis do, but thats its own trouble.</p>
<p>so yeah, rowing through 9 gears would be a hassle, but even if you were willing to put up with it, it is physically impractical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a big part of it. In the past, I believe manuals were more efficient... and it seems to me the US had very cheap gas and a booming economy, which spurred development of automatics before the oil crisis.  </p>
<p>No hard data to back this up, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was true up until the development of lockup torque converters. Once you're able to get an equal ratio out of the transmission, the automatic became better because it didn't burn through a clutch like manuals often did.</p></div>		</li>
