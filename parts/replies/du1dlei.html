			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Biocides need time to effectively cause pathogen / organism death. I.e. the biocide needs to be in contact with an organism long enough.</p>
<p>To give an example, at the opposite end of the spectrum from clinical hygiene, the biocide in a swimming pool (typically chlorine), is at a very low concentration to ensure that it doesnâ€™t lead to large organism (people) death, but the small pathogens and organisms are in contact with the biocide for such a long time it will cause their death.</p>
<p>Another, probably redundant analogy: dip a human in a biocide such as sodium hypochlorite 14.5% (bleach) and pull it straight back out and it would probably survive, albeit with major irritation to membranes and the skin. Leave a human in a bucket of bleach for an hour...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hand sanitizer (as specified by the OP) kills bacteria and other organisms on contact (instantly) using alcohol. Bacteria do not become resistant to the mechanism that kills them when alcohol is used.</p>
<p>That being said, there are definitely some organisms and spores which alcohol does not kill, which is why soap is good to use as well (soap washes away the living and dead microorganisms).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the question mixes hand sanitizer and antibacterial soap because surgeons use soap and not hand sanitizer. But I also forgot to mention that sanitizer works better than regular soap in some aspects but worse in others.</p></div>		</li>
