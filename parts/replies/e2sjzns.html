			<div class="markdown"><p>The resonance caused by the unity power factor can be described by a simple circuit with a capacitor and inductor in parallel. </p>
<p>When you run an AC current through this LC circuit, the inductor fills up and then discharges into the capacitor, and then the capacitor once filled up discharges back into the inductor. This continues to happen over and over again, and is analogous to a kid on a swing pumping his legs forward and backwards at the right frequency.</p>
<p>The size of the capacitor and the inductor both determine the rise and fall times of the energy charging and discharging in the electric and magnetic fields. If you choose the right values for both, you can tune those rise and fall times such that the circuit resonates at a frequency you designed it for. Otherwise the power gets pumped from one to the other in a non resonant way and destructive interference happens (I hope I'm using the right words here...).</p>
<p>This is exactly how HAM radios work. You take an antenna, hook it up to an amplifier, and the output of that amplifier is an LC circuit that will resonate at the MHz frequency ranges that AM radio radiates in. You can then use a tuning capacitor where you turn the capacitor so its capacitance changes and you change the resonant frequency. </p></div>		</li>
