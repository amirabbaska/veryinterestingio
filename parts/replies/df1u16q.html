<p>The easiest way to explain this is that they sacrificed the future at the alter of their comfort. I cannot think of another generation in history that had as much power so young and the opportunity to actually change the entire world in a meaningful way. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>They did not. When these changes were put in place they had little to no power in government. They were the &quot;millennials&quot; of the day. People complained that they were just lazy hippies that smoked pot and complained all day and didn't work. They were not respected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Think about it - they actually had enough clout to get Congress to amend the Constitution to lower the voting age!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The drive to lower the voting age began in the 1940s before the boomers were even born. The movement was already gaining momentum and some states had already changed their own laws. In 1954 Eisenhower publicly stated his support for it in his State of the Union address. The voting commission formally recommended lowering the age in 1963 (when most boomers were still school age)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, the hippies of the 60s became the coke dealers of the 70s, junk bond dealers of the 80s, internet bubble chiefs of the 90s and finally, reaching the height of their power, destroyed the economy in the 00's</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a completely uneducated comment. You're just telling people what they want to hear. I'm sure some people will believe it, but it's not true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Their parents (the WWII generation) ensured they would live in a prosperous, strong place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another uneducated comment. Their parents and grandparents were the ones who actually were in power during the period of all this turmoil. Do you really think the boomers wanted to send themselves to war during Vietnam? Do you think they were the heads of companies that began offshoring jobs in the 70s? Do you think that they cut their own pensions in the 80s?</p>
<p>Your entire post reeks of absolute cluelessness. It's filled with emotion but little to no actual reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent post.</p>
<p>I get a kick out of Boomers who have told me how easy I had/have it. Yeah, getting my DD214 with hostile fire and imminent danger written on it certainly was a breeze!</p>
<p>Never mind the millions of Gen Y and X who've been patriots and served their nation only to end up being pawns for political agenda and industrial complex profits. Boomers, when are we supposed to see the results from the wars in the middle east? a few hundred years from now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So why don't Millenials vote more? Their turnout is terrible. And listen, I'm not a Baby Boomer (I think I'm...Generation X?). People have to vote these old fucks out if they want change at the policy level. And that means en masse. We can put a forty something year old in the White House but if Congress is run by the ancient, decrepit Mitch Mcconnell's of the world, not much is going to change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure a lot of millennial don't vote is because we are the most apathetic generation yet. Our irritation at older generations in power leads us to feel like we don't have a say so we don't even bother anymore. What's the point in trying when you already know the outcome?</p>
<p>E: which I know is pretty much a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is coming from a person who believes voting is quintessential. </p>
<p>Just taking a look back to the previous primary, it's hard for Millennials to vote for politicians who are almost all of the generation that's telling they're just a bunch of whiny, know-nothing, entitled brats. A clear case of this is Clinton completely disregarding someone who supports Sanders when asked what she's doing to counter claims that she's untrustworthy. There's people in my generation who see these things and get apathetic when they believe that nobody actually cares about their input and assuming they'll get their vote anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely agree with you.  After doing the regular idiot internet arguing during the election, it took too long but I realized my efforts are much better spent getting people who didn't vote out to the polls instead of trying to change the minds of people that aren't open to that.  Which is why I put myself on the volunteer list for the next voter registration drive in my area. </p></div>		</li>
