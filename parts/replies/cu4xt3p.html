			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think most folks here experience thirst very rarely if ever. I remember running laps in the desert heat during PE and then having to stand in line for the drinking fountain. Actual thirst is not at all easy to ignore.</p>
<p>I think the better question would have been why we feel hunger several times per day but very rarely get to the point of real thirst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you hear people who have survived extreme situations where they go with very little or no water for long periods of time, they almost always emphasize that after enough time, water is the only thing you can think about. I think the real answer to OP's question is few people ever experience true dehydration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but at the same time they probably haven't experienced 'true hunger' either. Yet we have cravings for food on the reg but not water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I had acute pancreatitis, I was severely dehydrated and I was ordered not to drink water and wait for the IV to hydrate me. I couldn't listen to the doctors orders because I was so thirsty. I kept drinking water and puking it back up instantly over and over and over even though it was causing my pancreas pain to hurt worse than childbirth. Thirst is no joke when your body absolutely needs some water. I just felt this compulsive need to drink water and no amount of trying to be rational and telling myself that it will only cause more puking and pain could stop me from drinking the water over and over. It sucked and took about two hours before the IV fluids did their job and my body felt hydrated. I just kept a plastic tub on my bed and took sips of water and vomited them into the bucket in between screaming and contorting all over the bed in pain until I no longer felt thirsty :|</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same boat, once when I was seriously dehydrated but also NPO (nothing by mouth), IV fluids were doing nothing to help the feeling that I was totally dried out. </p>
<p>I finally begged the nurse to let me have ice chips, just to melt in my mouth, and then I had to spit the water back out. Better than puking it back up though, which I'd done plenty of. </p>
<p>Real dehydration is illogical and no joke lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's water in your food, plus your body tries to hold onto water as opposed to processing food and pushing it out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is close to the real answer.  Your body is very good at concentrating urine and conserving water when you start to be slightly dehydrated because water is such a critical thing, but you can't ignore real thirst for very long.  </p>
<p>Food is generally a lot harder to get adequate quantities of than water too so your body might be pestering you to go out and do something about the stomach situation more often, a lot of animals graze all day.</p></div>		</li>
