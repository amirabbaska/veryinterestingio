			<div class="markdown"><p>You can actually use it to slosh water in bilges toward a particular pump so it can get better suction. This is not usually done, but I did it once. </p>
<p>You might also want to &quot;squat the stern&quot; when retrieving floating buoys or antennae. It helps ensure the cables from these floating devices doesn't get caught in the prop or prop wash. </p>
<p>When you shoot trash overboard you put a small forward angle on the boat to help the trash compactor shoot trash out the bottom and for various flow dynamic reasons. We also shoot various sonar devices out a tube about 2/3 back and squatting the stern can help avoid the device's wire getting caught in the prop.</p>
<p>Usually, though, it's done to get new control team (Diving Officer of the Watch, Helmsman, Lee Helmsman, and Chief of the Watch) practice in coordinating with each other and to learn how the ship handles. If you put an angle on the hull the ship wants to go up or down. The control team has to work together to trim the ship (move water ballast from one spot to the other), control stern planes, control fair water planes, and provide speed recommendations. It seems pretty easy, but it's actually a pretty complicated balancing act.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had no idea subs shot out their garbage. I wanted to know more so if anyone else does I found this informative:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dry waste is consolidated using a trash compactor and then placed in special cans. These cans are fabricated on board from prepunched galvanized, perforated steel sheets, using a roller tool. The resulting cans are 28.5 inches long and 9 inches in diameter. They have metal tops and bottom caps. Metal weights are added to ensure that the cans will go to the bottom. The cans are ejected from the submarine using a trash disposal unit (TDU), which is a long cylindrical, vertical tube connected to the ocean through a ball valve. Several cans are placed atop one another in the TDU, the top of the TDU is sealed by closing a pressure cap, the ball valve is opened, and the cans ejected through a combination of gravity and air pressure.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surprising to me too. Apparently the Ohio class submarines are 560 feet long, so pretty big. For perspective, the Empire State Building is 1,250 feet tall, so these submarines are nearly half a skyscraper, except underwater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, it was the Henry M. Jackson, but I think everyone tries to get the CO or XO at least once like this. We also had it in for the ENG. The WEPS and NAV never got the up angle, but that might be because neither of them bragged about going to run on the treadmill.</p></div>		</li>
