			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna piggyback here to add a few specifications. Yes the Germans managed to rearm using the above strategies (Except the devaluation of the currency, they didn't do that, but everyone else got off the gold standard. Hitler was afraid that devaluing the currency would lead to hyperinflation again.)</p>
<p>But their rearmament basically drove their economy in the gutter. When they invaded Poland in 1939 they were down to 2-3 months of stockpile for their most important materials. Since the German economy was now import heavy, it could not free enough liquid foreign currency to pay for its imports. The debt was rising in an uncontrollable fashion and a spectacular portion of the economy was slaved to rearmament.</p>
<p>In 1935, 8% of nominal GDP went into the armed forces. The USA today, with the biggest military budget in the world, spends 3.5% of its GDP on its military. </p>
<p>In 1939, at the outbreak of the war, this had reached 23% of GDP for Germany. This is an insane economic burden in peacetime and basically guarantees that you need to make some use of the weapons created.</p>
<p>In short, Hitler managed to free the ressources to rearm, but that came at the expense of the long term potential of the German economy, which was in a state of imminent collapse in 1939.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and IIRC there were some true draconian measures taken at the time to 'encourage' people - death penalty for hoarding, people turning in metal, massive shortages of consumer goods, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>One of the later interesting side effects of this was that occupied Denmark - which provided a outsized amount of staples and consumer goods to Germany - was relatively lightly governed partially to encourage production.  I think I remember reading that it had 1/20th or such of the equivalent occupiers relative to population that France did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also just a nitpick: Germany's economic hardships weren't due to the Treaty of Versailles.  They ended up paying very little of the reparations that were demanded by the treaty, which as war-ending surrenders go wasn't all that harsh anyway.</p>
<p>Germany's economic woes in the '20s had much more to do with the massive amount of debt they took out to pay for WWI.  They figured that they'd pay it back with reparations from Britain and France after they won the war.  When they lost the war, the loans started coming due and crippled their economy.</p>
<p>All that was pretty much fixed by 1926, though.  Germany joined the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot; with the rest of the western world for a few years.  The economic hardship that led to the rise of the Nazis wasn't WWI-related; it was the Great Depression.  The Nazis <em>claimed</em> that it was all because of WWI and Versailles, because its far easier to rally your people with &quot;our country was brutalized by that other country and betrayed by the Jews, get angry!&quot; than &quot;the entire world is in an economic depression, let's all cooperate&quot;.  Unfortunately the Nazi propaganda about Versailles has stuck around.</p>
<p>Edit:  Someone asked /r/askhistorians if what I said was true or not.  /u/kieslowskifan gave a great writeup that you can read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/89u5t9/in_a_prominent_eli5_today_i_read_germanys/dwtusoe/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating! Thank you! </p>
<p>(Scary how it's the Nazi's explanation apparently that I've heard in random books, documentaries, and even the WWI museum I visited!)</p>
<p>Combined with the answer above, this sure explains how Germany managed to do so incredibly much from 1933-45. I guess I've always had this question because its very premise is wrong. Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a really interesting point which I'm hoping you'll expand on.  As an amateur history enthusiast, I always just took &quot;the Versailles treaty was super-harsh&quot; as given - backed up by some primary sources where contemporaries described it as such.</p>
<p>Can you explain what it is that makes you say that it &quot;wasn't all that harsh&quot;?  Is it comparison to similar treaties of the era and, if so, which?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It should also be noted that at the same time, the Nazi's denationalized other industries, to sell them for money. Broadly speaking they privatized more than they nationalized.</p>
<p>Another thing is the tricks they did with money. They didn't just print currency. They created an entire massive fraud where they set up a dummy corporation and used it's debt to pay for things.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc, the early history of the Beetle was a massive fraud. The idea was that people would buy in on certificates for one of the people's cars before WW2 and after they'd collected enough they'd turn them all in and take home a car.  Of course, blitzkrieg were declared and those cars were never built.</p>
<p>I could be remembering some of that wrong, so please correct me.</p></div>		</li>

Despite the name of the party, the Nazis were some of the most radically capitalist fascists ever, especially compared with more anti-capitalist fascists like Mussolini and the Spanish Falange (before Franco de-fascistified it - Franco was a reactionary dictator, but not a fascist).</p></div>		</li>
