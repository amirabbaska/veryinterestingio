			<div class="markdown"><p>It is actually one step more than that. Because a smoker is constantly in withdrawal (starting within minutes of when you last puffed), then everything else is done, there is still a feeling of &quot;something missing&quot; - the drug. So by smoking again you feel fuller, more satisfied, etc., than you would otherwise.
For a non-smoker, you aren't in the constant &quot;missing something&quot; mode, and so feel fuller after sex, eating, etc., without the nicotine.
(Smoker here)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems more accurate. I used to smoke a ton of pot, and if I were to be doing something enjoyable sober, the whole time I'd be feeling bummed out by the thought that &quot;this would feel better if I were high right now&quot;. This is more of a psychological aspect of this than just physical/chemical neurotransmitter physiology. After sex, at least for me, you get a warm fuzzy feeling throughout your body for a good 15 minutes, but it'd feel less enjoyable with the thought that it could be better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure you can, but it isn't as satisfying.  Plus it puts off non-smokers, and generally the food doesn't taste as good because cigarettes have a powerful taste and odor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, that's exactly wrong. I don't want to smoke during sex. Sex is a physical effort and smoking during such activity makes the act AND the smoking less enjoyable.</p>
<p>I want to smoke after because I'm feeling really good and that cigarette will be the cherry on top.</p>
<p>Maybe stick to describing your own experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. One last bit is the mild stimulant is nice right after the food or sex made you a little tired (but comfortably and securely tired). But it's mostly what you said.</p></div>		</li>
