			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, not sure that's 100% correct.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of coloured belts, fairly sure this is post-WW2 introduction for Western students primarily.</p>
<p>I believe the ranking system originally came from Judo, created in 1882. Not as old as you think! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, coloured belts are largely marketing to ensure kids (and their parents who are paying) see progress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah colored belts is a post-WW2 introduction but how about black/white belts? Are they also that recent? I imagine it would be practical for ancient martial artists to use belts to distinguish between students and teachers or maybe between new and senior students. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just combat sports. There's a line in the old West Country song <a href="http://wiki.changeringing.co.uk/The_Bellringing" target="_blank">The Bell Ringing</a> (also known as &quot;The Men of North Lew&quot; and a couple of other names), which is about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_ringing" target="_blank">Change Ringing</a> competition, that goes &quot;<strong>They rang for a belt</strong> and a hat laced with gold&quot;. The song and lyrics were collected from at least two different Devon singers in the late 19th century.</p>
<p>The Yetis did a really excellent version of the song in the 1960s or so that not only sounded excellent but really evoked the bells as well; sadly, I can't find it on the net, or I'd link it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gfxh49WAFvc" target="_blank">This solo <em>a cappella</em> version</a> is a little dragging, but probably the best I managed to find. Needs an instrument behind it, though.</p>
<p>I wonder whether it started out as a low-tech thing, a poor man's trophy - get the local artisans to knock up a fancy belt with brass fittings and the like (akin to horse brasses, say) as a token prize to be competed over. Good craftsmen would be able to make something that would look pretty special, without it having to cost an arm and a leg.</p></div>		</li>
