			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noteing that heat and IR are not the same thing. Something can absorb IR get hot then emit, albeit less, IR because it's hot. This would be different than simply reflecting IR although metal generally reflects more IR than it absorbs</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth mentioning you don't feel heat. You feel the heat transfer, this is why the metal part of a desk feels colder than the wood or plastic parts even though they're at an equilibrium temperature with the room. Shiny things (such as the steel slide on the playground) are likely going to conduct that heat more readily than the rest of the wooden playground equipment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed this is the main reason why shiny objects are hot -they are of metal, which is very good at conducting heat!</p>
<p>Metals are actually good IR reflectors too, althogh not 100%</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s important to note that the metal in this example is emitting IR because it’s hot, but less than the amount of IR that’s shining on it. It’s not emitting less IR when hot than it would when cold.</p>
<p>Getting hotter generally causes an object to emit more on all wavelengths. This is more or less required by the second law of thermodynamics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since black body radiation is a statistical process, it of course also follows the 2nd law. Though the actual reason is the quantization of EM radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reflector is <a href="https://www.rp-photonics.com/dichroic_mirrors.html" target="_blank">dichroic</a>, so it actually does reflect visible light and transmit IR out the back of the instrument. If you're ever on a lighting catwalk, they get <em>hot</em>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about heat at the stage. It's about prolonging the life of gobos (stencils) and gels (color filters) installed into the instrument (for those not in the know, what everyone else calls a &quot;light&quot;, we theater techies call &quot;instruments&quot;) which are considered consumables and can represent a sizable portion of a show's lighting budget. Or at least used to.</p>
<p>Only certain high end instruments have these systems. They're called cold mirrors, and they're not cheap. The mirror or reflector reflects everything but IR.</p>
<p>They've largely been made pointless by HID/LED light sources and the industry switching to robotics. One robotic instrument can take the place of dozens of fixed instruments, and LED sources in particular require far less power and withstand much more physical abuse. Halogen theater lamps are fragile and have a quite short lifespan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The greenhouse effect is based on the same principle. Heat comes in as visible light, tries to go out as infrared. The glass of a greenhouse, or your car windshield, or the CO2 in the atmosphere, is transparent to visible light but not to infrared. So the heat stays in.</p></div>		</li>
