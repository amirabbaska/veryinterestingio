I’ve never been a fan of cheese, because the idea of rotten milk has always disgusted me, but I will eat the fuck out of some mozzarella and Brie. The other night at work we’ve made some brie and cranberry tartlets and I am still dreaming about those motherfuckers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here’s a few suggested cheeses to branch out which you should be able to find without any trouble. These are all crowd pleasers that are relatively common. Nothing too fancy or pricey. I would consider these “essentials”. </p>
<p>Consider trying cheeses you already like with honey, herbs, preserves of fruits (especially figs!) and such. There’s no wrong way to enjoy a good cheese, but oh so many right ways :). </p>
<ul>
<li>Morbier: French, cow’s milk, needs no explanation, a king among cheeses. The layer of ash adds something inexplicably good. </li>
<li>Emmental: Swiss, cow’s milk, you won’t ever eat “swiss cheese” again. Melt it on a slice of dark break to reach nirvana. See also: Gruyère, Comte, which are similar but all unique in their own way. </li>
<li>Humboldt Fog: American (CA), goat’s milk, one of the best “new” cheeses. A delicious goat cheese with a runny layer and a dense core. As you let it ripen on the counter the outer layer expands and the flavor changes.</li>
<li>Gouda: Dutch, cow’s milk, while common there are infinite variations of Gouda, and aging changes the flavor drastically. A real Gouda is nothing like the lunch slices. Uniekaas makes a great aged gouda (Reserve) which is widely available in the US. </li>
<li>Pyrénées: French, sheep’s milk. Most comparable to manchego or pecorino, but far less salty and less overpowering flavor wise. This one is fantastic with fruit and dry red wine. </li>
<li>Robiola: Italian, cow/goat/sheep milk mix. This is a very fresh cheese, soft ripened, <a href="https://theblindmonk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/robiola.jpg" target="_blank">usually found in the form of a small square</a>. Cut it in half, drizzle it with honey or fruit preserves, and just take a big bite out. </li>
</ul>
<p>A tip: if you have a Trader Joe’s near you, they have a very good cheese selection and great prices. You won’t find anything quite as good as you would at a dedicated cheesemonger, but their options are head and shoulders above any other national* grocery. Whole Foods has good selection but their prices are exorbitant, often for something you can find elsewhere for a fraction of the price.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if you want to really get into cheese, you want to find a cheesemonger you trust who knows your tastes and can put in orders for you. Think of them as your cheese-dealer. </p>
<p>Even with cheeses you’ve had and enjoyed, discovering the “real deal” version (usually imported and raw milk) is often a revelation. For example: there is absolutely no comparison between American supermarket Brie and French countryside Brie. The former is merely good, the latter, a culinary work of art. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I had 2 cups of brine, I should expect to have less than 2 cups after brining to ensure that the meat has more moisture than it started with, right? Otherwise, the only gain would be flavoring?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The salt ions cause the meat to actually become more penetrable by liquids, so once the salt soaks in it starts to moisturize that delicious flesh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At first. But then the salted water is drawn back into the meat. I may be wrong, but this is how i understood it. That is why you don't brine for 10 kinutes, but you do it for 1+ hours</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, a preservative has to act on any number of things that make food go bad. These things include microbial growth, oxidation of the food, moisture loss or gain, etc.</p>
<p>Salt and sugar act by discouraging microbial growth just as you’ve said, but there are other forms of preservatives that do different things.</p>
<p>For example, sulfates, nitrates, citric acid, and other chemicals are added to food and drinks to prevent microbial growth, but these compounds also react with available oxygen to prevent the compounds in the product itself from being broken down by the oxygen. These are a very common form of preservatives in most food that lists “preservatives” on the ingredient label.</p>
<p>If we consider that things other than chemicals can be preservatives, the packaging of a material is really the most effective and easily implemented preservative for food and drink. The plastic packaging often used for food that spoils easily is almost always a multi-layered multi-functional film that blocks oxygen from getting through to the food, blocks moisture from entering or leaving, and prevents microbes from reaching the food. Furthermore, vacuum packaging or flushing the package with nitrogen, heating the food prior to or after packaging (retort, pasteurization, HPP, etc.), and adding oxygen scavengers to the plastic itself (also sulfites usually) will improve shelf life. The exact type of film created is determined by what the application is, and is different for each kind of product.</p>
