			<div class="markdown"><p>Say you start with a normal number, every possible combination of digits is somewhere within it. Then you take all the '1's in the number and change them to '2's. Now the number is not normal, however it is still irrational, because it will go on forever without ever reaching an end or a repeating pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you take the normal number 100 and replace the 1 with 2 you just get 200....? And 200 is not normal and irrational?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Start with <em>x</em>, a number normal (in base 10). Then replace all the 1's in the expansion with 2's to get the new number <em>y</em>. Then <em>y</em> is clearly not normal because its expansion contains no 1's.</p>
<p>But <em>y</em> is also irrational. Why? A number is rational if and only if its expansion in all bases either terminates or repeats. If that were the case with <em>y</em>, then it would not be possible for <em>x</em> to have been normal. This is obvious if <em>y</em> has a terminating expansion. If <em>y</em> instead has a repeating expansion with period <em>p</em> (i.e., the length of the string that gets repeated is <em>p</em>), then strings of length <em>p</em>+1 cannot be uniformly distributed in <em>x</em>, contradicting normality.</p>
<p>This solves the problem of /u/starbounder333's question of how a number could have a non-repeating expansion with no discernible pattern yet not be normal. All that is left is to prove the existence of <em>some</em> normal number <em>x</em>. (That's not easy if you want <em>x</em> to be normal in all bases, but if you just want <em>x</em> to be normal in base 10, then <em>x</em> = 123456789101112... (i.e., the concatenation of all natural numbers) will do the job.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of an infinite set of numbers. 1,  2, 3, 4..... Now remove the number 4. Anytime the number 4 shows up, skip it. This new set of numbers is also infinitely long. You will never count to the end of it. It is as long as the first set, but it does not contain a single 4 </p>
<p>Or think of the set of all even integers (whole numbers). It is infinite even though it only contains half of the possible integers. </p></div>		</li>
