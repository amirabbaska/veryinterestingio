			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, perception of colour, which is what cones do. You might have noticed that it's hard or impossible to tell what colour things are when they're in your peripheral vision.</p>
<p>Peripheral vision is better for detecting light and movement, which is useful for spotting predators. The colour of a predator is less important than the fact that it's there and is moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cones are also used for seeing detail and high resolution because they are mapped 1:1 to bipolar cells whereas rods are mapped ~50:1and are given significantly more cortical critical magnification. In better terms, the area of the brain that processes information from cones is a lot larger than the area for rods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Much, <em>much</em> more resolution, as is easy to observe yourself. The area of sharp central vision is only a few degrees wide and beyond that it quickly gets blurry. The reason there's no room for rods in the fovea is that it's so packed with cones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why it feels like we are looking in a particular direction, or is there something more going on to define the 'center'? For example, if the center had reduced resolution and the resolution at the right hand side was increased in one spot, would we feel like we were looking in that new direction? Would we be able to read out of the side of the eye or is the brain hardwired to 'look' at the center? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colour perception relies on the cone cells in the center of the retina. There are three types of cone cells with different pigments, and they respond to different wavelengths of light. They are also more densely packed, and have a better response time than rods allowing for more precise vision in well lit conditions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correction to this:</p>
<p>The rods are mostly absent from the fovea (center of the retina). The highest concentration of rods is a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Distribution_of_Cones_and_Rods_on_Human_Retina.png" target="_blank">few degrees off your focal point</a>, then the density falls gradually to the edge of your vision.  </p>
<p>Fun fact #2, the blue sensitive cones only make up 2% of the cones in the retina. So if you look at a pure blue or violet sign at night it will look fuzzy due to the lower spatial sampling of that wavelength.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting. My understanding was that the fuzzy blue was due to the lense not focusing them correctly, being more adjusted to reddish light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hadn't considered chromatic aberration of the lens. That could also be a factor. I expect that in a blue light only situation, like at night, the focus mechanisms in the eye would be driven by the blue light and be able to adjust it into optimal focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of this is also how photoreceptors attach to cells later in the visual processing pathway, and how this information reaches your brain</p>
<p>Centrally, it's more like 1 to 1. This means that 1 specific photoreceptor sends a single signal.   Your brain understands that a specific photoreceptor was activated, which provides a high level of detail </p>
<p>Peripherally, it's more like 30 to 1. This means that 30 photoreceptors work together to send a single signal. Although this is less detailed because your brain is unsure which specific photoreceptor was activated, this set up is more sensitive because with all these photoreceptors working together it takes less light to send a single signal. This allows for better perception in low light environments</p>
<p>Overall, this contributes to the trade off between either high detail or high light sensitivity, and not both.</p>
<p>edit - changed 3 to 30</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh it's more than 3. In the outer periphery, a retinal ganglion cell gets inputs to its receptive field center from over 30 cones. </p></div>		</li>
