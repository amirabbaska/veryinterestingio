			<div class="markdown"><p>Disagree. As you have any type of viral infection, your body has a large immune response with things such as cyotokines and antibodies. Cytokines and Antibodies then are directed to the area where the virus is replicating in order to try to stop this replication. They do this by causing all sorts of chemical reactions and direct attack of the virus. This causes you to have areas of swelling and irritation in say the throat (pharyngitis), nose (nasal congestion), larynx (laryngitis), and lower airways (bronchitis). Those chemical reactions require much more water and electrolytes to occur. The antibodies and proteins are also causing swelling (edema) because they are made of protein. As protein leaks out of the blood vessels into the localized areas (throat, nose, airways, etc) water follows it causing the swelling (edema). Your body is also making more and more antibodies and cytokines to replenish its depleted stores which again requires more water and electrolytes. On top of all of this, if you have a fever, that causes increased metabolism again requiring more water and electrolytes. As you can see, it can be easy for someone with any type of acute illness to become easily dehydrated.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe once you get out in clinicals you’ll understand a lot of what you learn for step 1 boards doesn’t correlate very well or help that much in the actual practice of medicine.  Copious mucous production, as many have alluded to, uses water. Having a fever, even if you aren’t sweating, dehydrates the body. Hydration is essential for symptom improvement (mucous, cough, headache) and the fact that when people are sick they tend to not drink or eat as much, so reminding them is important.  </p>
<p>Clinical tip: warm salt water gargle is the best home tx for sore throat due to mucous or post nasal drip. Probably won’t find that in any books. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>re: reminding them to eat more: I could be well of the mark here as it was some time ago, but I recall an immunology professor explaining that in animal studies at least, fasting behaviours in response to pathogen infection shouldn't be suppressed - that viruses require fresh glucose to replicate while our bodies can survive far longer than the infection off our existing energy stores.  When they force fed rats who had lost appetite due to infection, their mortality rate went up i.e. loss of appetite / fasting is an adaptive sickness behaviour. </p>
<p>Interested in any clarification.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was poorly worded in my statement, I really was speaking more to reminding them to drink because they are going to be behind on fluids already even if they are consuming a normal amount.
As far as fasting helping in healing I do know as an overall statement it can be beneficial depending on the pathogen, however a large part of getting well is feeling well so while I don’t tell people to force themselves to eat I do encourage them to eat small meals if they feel hungry. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you.</p>
<p>And from a physiological perspective, people do not think much about the fact the immune system has a critical role as trashmen. Immune cells clear debris from dead cells as cells grow and die in every tissue. This function is more critical during active infection. Mucus serves a role in the immune response by serving as a physical barrier (with included automated bacteria killing proteins, such as defensins) and waste removal system. Aiding that helps the immune system in my opinion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could make an argument that if you have a fever dehydration would be a concern that fluids would help. But other than GI or nausea, yep you're right physiologically the top response makes zero sense, you don't need any extra nutrients for your immune system to work.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would your system not be running harder to combat the illness causing a greater drain on reserves, i.e increased nutrients provides more fuel to fight the illness? Also increased fluids to offset any sweating from elevated temperature?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose reserve drain depends on how you look at it, but no you don't really need to 'fuel up' when you have a cold as long as you maintain a normal consumption of food/water.</p>
<p>There are two things to consider, you as a functioning organism versus the individual cells that comprise you. The &quot;system&quot; in question fighting the infection is your immune system which is predominately immune cells. At the molecular level, your body is almost never short on resources. Even under severe dehydration or electrolyte imbalance your organs will shut down long before cells are no longer able to function due to limited resources. So no, resource drain isn't really an issue except unless you want to continue to function as a living organism. </p>
<p>Physiologically speaking, the only reason you'd NEED to consume more fluids is in that above scenarios where you are losing a large amount of fluid. So diarrhea and vomiting definitely and maybe even if you have a fever depending on how much water you're losing through an increased body temp. Maybe some others that I'm. It thinking about at the moment too.</p>
<p>That said, most people do feel better by consuming soup/fluids when they have a cold, an I am one of them, but most of that is related to side effects of the cold like sore throat, congestion etc. so by all means do it, it isn't going to hurt anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAD or a med student, but I would think that having excess nutrients is not beneficial as long as your are getting proper nutrition. Taking 1000% of your daily vitamin C does nothing more than taking 100% except you might poop more.</p>
<p>I might wonder if having excess nutrients might not even be bad because maybe it provides fuel for the problem/issue rather than the cure (pure speculation).</p></div>		</li>

Quick question; what are the most common techniques you use in your research/what are the most common in the field <em>in your experience</em>? </p>
<p>I would love to get an answer from someone currently in the field to add to answers from profs who worked in the field 5-10 years ago. I mean they keep up to date on the academia but that doesn't always reflect current trends in reality. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>
