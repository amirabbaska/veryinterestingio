			<div class="markdown"><p>We also dont have any Mountains so our traditions about ski sports is mostly to travel somewhere and get drunk :)</p>
<p>I am born in 78, and I think I remember like 5 really cold winters, but mostly they lasted a month or so.</p>
<p>We have weather much more similar to GB</p>
<p>EDIT: my most upvoted comment is now a post about danish weather, I am very pleased with that :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact about danes:
weather is our number one topic, its something we take very serious :) it used to hold true back in the days, that the weather forcast was the most watched program of the day  </p>
<p>Also we complain about it a lot, if its warm, its to warm, if its cold it to cold, and it its in between (witch is like 85% of the time) we complain about it not being either hot or cold! </p>
<p>but we are one of the most happy people in the world, so I guess weather is not everything :-)</p></div>		</li>
