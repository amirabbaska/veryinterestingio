Instead I just found out that in 1998 The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell in a Cell and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table for the second time in this thread.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nah. Nobody uses that and reading that makes no sense. 1k98 could be any of what, 10 different distinct years?</p>
<p>2k is used because we're currently seeing the first of the 2000s. So when we get to 2300, saying 2k01 won't make sense. </p>
<p>Linguist my ass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He also forgot there's essentially 3 ways to say 2016 (unless I missed some) </p>
<p>Twenty-sixteen</p>
<p>Two thousand sixteen</p>
<p>Two K sixteen</p>
<p>Writing it as 2k16 seems to push the reader to read it a specific way, maybe they want it to roll off the tongue better or push everyone to say it the same way when discussing it with friends (in reference to games)? </p></div>		</li>
