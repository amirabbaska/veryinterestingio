			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in biomedical engineering lab where we actually have to purify viruses. <a href="http://imgur.com/USoiDcZ" target="_blank">Here is what the viruses looks like after I run them through a centrifuge</a>.</p>
<p>The brown stuff is the supernatant and the white stuff is the virus. Its not quite pure just yet. I still need a few more rounds of centrifugation and resuspension and then I run them on an ultra centrifuge to get the final pure virus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the supernatant (the brown stuff) contains a lot of harmful chemicals. I would imagine you would die if you drank that, or at the very least develop significant damage to your body. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does being a virus researcher pay well? I assume that the discipline required in order to be practicing in such a field is in the extremes. I would appreciate it if you would answer at your convenience, here or in my personal message box. Thanks for your interesting answer! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It completely depends on a ton of variables and what their actual position is. A &quot;researcher&quot; can be anything from an unpaid undergraduate to a tenured professor.</p>
<p>Paid techs at my university rarely made more than $13 per hour. Grad student could make a similar amount in some situations. Post doctoral and research associates I've seen make 50k a year or a bit more. Tenured profs 100-200k with all sorts of other opportunities. Contract and private firms pay better but run the risk of going bust quick since operating costs can be astronomical. For virus research specifically a job with the cdc pays well but is very difficult to obtain without renown or connections. There is a huge range of private and university study in viruses, ranging from simple bactireophages to gene therapy, and finding a position in such places requires a wide array of skill level.</p>
<p>You will always run into the publish or perish dilemma if you get a PhD in any research field, and hard work and brains won't always guarantee success. I would never go into it looking to make money, but the potential is there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I currently culture environmental soil bacteria.  A significant number are actually deep pink, coral, purple, or yellow, with yellow the most common non-white/clear color, and then pink/red.</p>
<p>As for viruses, they are mostly protein on the outside, although some clades have a lipid membrane.  I'm guessing the protein ones would form sort of a jelly like you say, and the lipid membrane ones would be more like a pile of eukaryotic cells, whatever that would be like- probably a slime.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what I learned when I first started working with E coli in the lab? If you grow a big flask of E coli over night... they grow in a liquid media called broth... the broth turns milky with cells overnight. Then you spin the broth at a really high speed and all the cells form a pellet at the bottom. If you poke around the pellet, it's all snotty and gooey. It's literally like what comes out of your nose when you have a really bad sinus infection. That's a giant mass of bacteria. I was shocked at how similar they looked. It was like I was digging a giant blob of snot out of my bottle, except I know it was 100% pure E coli that had grown in the past 12 hours. Ewww.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is a question that like an eight year old would ask, but I genuinely wonder what would happen if you consumed it. Like, how much bacteria could your body handle? Would it cause an extremely severe infection right off the bat, or would you get diarrhoea/vomiting immediately because your body would detect it faster? I wonder if there's a point of diminishing returns where your body can't absorb any more bacteria at once no matter how big the lump.</p></div>		</li>
