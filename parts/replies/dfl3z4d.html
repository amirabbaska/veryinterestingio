			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't found anything on these poor Russian reindeer but here's an article on one in Norway where over 300 died in a single storm. Those poor, poor bastards. Not sure if it's more tragic or more sweet (in a way) that they all die together.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we do. A lot of a lightning bolt's charge dissipates through the ground close through the strike. For us, that means the current moves up the leg closest to the strike, and down the other. Not exactly comfortable, but far preferable to the four-legged alternative, where the current will move from the closest pair of legs to the furthest, through all the vitals organs including the heart. Our hearts are largely out of the path of a lightning strike's current, so we are far more resistant than other animals.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass lightning strikes don't make sense to me. Sure, I get that a single animal can be the path of least resistance and lowest charge, but how do the others become involved.</p>
<p>Sky to animal to ground, to animal to ground, to animal to ground, etc. Doesn't make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read up on lightning strikes at crowded picnics, etc.  You'll see their are usually 10-30 people injured,  most live thanks to cpr/ems.  The reindeer heards are on large, high, really high flat grounds.   So they all build up a charge, similar to when people have their hair stand up.  From there it's boom, roasted Rudolph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Individuals, yes. But the charge dissipates per strike.</p>
<p>How do the others get effected? They would have lower potential than the ground post strike.</p></div>		</li>
