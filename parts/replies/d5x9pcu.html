<p>ISDN, for example, has been available for decades - ISDN calls are so crystal-clear that many phone companies add artificial noise to the line because people were assuming the line was dead!</p>

<p>Shit like this is fascinating to me.  I reminded of a case study from a 100-level marketing class I took in college where Dawn (the dish soap brand) was trying to cut down on the amount of suds that the product caused in a sink.  After all, they're  potentially inconvenient and they're not necessary for the cleaning power of the soap; they were just a &quot;side effect&quot; of the original formula.  They actually succeeded, but customers started complaining that they thought the new formula wasn't working as well because, y'know, what happened to all the suds!?  So they changed the formula again to actually add <em>more</em> suds, and they started advertising that their dish detergent had more suds than any other brand.  Even now we're up to our eyeballs in sudsy dish detergent even though those bubbles don't do shit aside from fill up volume in your sink.</p>
<p>We're all a bunch of idiots, is what I'm suggesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you can see where the soap is, easily grab some for use on other dishes, etc. If that story is true, I wonder if anyone who worked there at the time had ever actually done dishes themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tesla and other electric car manufacturers had to implement a &quot;creep&quot; function, where the car would slowly inch forward once the brake is released.  Since internal combustion engines require a certain idled speed to not stall, the engine will still provide enough power to make the car go on it's own (assuming on leveled ground) if the brake is not applied.  Before the function was implemented, many thought that the car had shut off as there was no engine to produce a sound and the car would not inch forward on it's own.</p>
<p>It's pretty crazy to think the amount of things we had to implement that can be seen as a step backward in terms of technology to accommodate the experience so we don't think it's broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. To understand, ponder this:</p>
<p>&quot;Why are airline seats so cramped, and why is the food so bad?</p>
<p>&quot;You should try first class...it has more elbow room and the food is great!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know, but...it costs more&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it's largely used as a perk for frequent flyers. The vast majority of people who get those seats aren't buying them at that rate, they're getting upgraded. That's why the price is so expensive - they're not really pricing to sell, they're pricing to make it worth bumping someone with status. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a good analogy whatsoever. We don't have what is often called HD Audio across systems is because companies are not forced to make the upgrades by consumers that don't know any better. If, e.g., t-mobile made more of a point that you get far clearer calls between two devices that support HD Audio on their network and people cared enough about that feature, all others would be forced to also upgrade instead of simply creaming off the cost of upgrading as profit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the food is so bad because the pressure messes with your scene of taste its also why bloody marry s taste better, i dont think that one is quite on the same lines of you get what you pay for, there is actually a pretty good reason for the food to be bad</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>POTS lines are optimized for a narrow frequency around the range of the human voice. A lot of music is outside of that range. When you add in compression and decompression between the phone company's analog lines and the digital systems playing the hold music, things get even uglier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's also why it's hard to tell the difference between s, sh and f. The difference between those sounds is how high in frequency the noisy part of the sound is. But almost all of that noise is outside of the frequency range of POTS</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The microphones in most phones are also not optimized for much. That is why wind tends to mess them up so bad. It is also very easy to overload the elements completely. The reason has everything to do with durability over higher fidelity. That being said the little microphones on my cell phone are really not that bad, at least compared to older landline handsets. But even a cheap microphone for music beats the pants off the ones in the cell phone. There is more involved like size of the transducer and the size of the wavelength of the sound, the materials used, and the signal amplification. I could go on but I need sleep.</p></div>		</li>
