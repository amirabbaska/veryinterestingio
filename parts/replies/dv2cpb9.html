			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, in a practical sense, there can be areas of harborage that the bleach will not contact. Microbes are damn small and they can be in crevices, soil, or even a biofilm that provide a safe haven for them. This is why things must be clean before they can be sanitized and why some things (like a sponge for a worst case example) can never be sanitized with something like bleach. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find that in between new sponges, microwaving them when they are wet helps. Just be careful. Fantastic way to get burned. I find that while this does not extend the life of a sponge per se, it does make me worry less about using one that's not new.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>microwave trick works well. I was the one to wash the dishes the other day, and that sponge was stinking - didn't matter how much i rinsed it. 30sec on high in the microwave made it smell like new again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly there has been recent suggestion that microwaving does not help remove harmful species:</p>
<p>[Among those who sterilize their sponges,] <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/body/microwaving-your-kitchen-sponge-wont-save-you-from-microbes/" target="_blank">their techniques could only eliminate 60% of the microbes at most. What’s more, attempting to clean the sponge only seemed to make more room for disease-causing microbes. “Presumably, resistant bacteria survive the sanitation process and rapidly re–colonize the released niches until reaching a similar abundance as before the treatment,” the researchers wrote.</a></p>
<p>Conclusion was better to have a new sponge than one whose occupants survived the last sterilization attempt :-)</p></div>		</li>
