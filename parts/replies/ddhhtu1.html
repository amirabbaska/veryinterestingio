			<div class="markdown"><p>The best (and most effective) protests have large numbers of 'relevant' constituents - relevant here meaning people that have historically changed things and/or pose a distinct threat to the ruling group - and a firm list of demands that can be accomplished by the people in charge.</p>
<p>Protests that don't work are often from groups that don't pose a threat to the ruling group, and/or don't have a firm set of demands that the ruling group can accomplish.</p>
<p>Example: a million people could march on Washington demanding $1m each, but it's extremely unlikely to happen.  If those same million people marched demanding passage of a bill in congress that was split ~50/50 in votes, chances are that bill would pass.</p></div>		</li>
