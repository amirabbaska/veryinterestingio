			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems to be happening in a lot of locations. Just from reading testimonials on reddit - Vancouver, LA, and all of Australia seem to be having similar problems. I'm sure it's happening in every growing major city to some degree. </p>
<p>The question is what will the outcome be? To me it seems like &quot;housing speculation&quot; will be a major driver of wealth imbalance over the next decade or two. Those without significant cash will be forced to rent longer and will not have the opportunity to build equity. Those with the ability to purchase property will continue to amass wealth through rents and equity growth. Or it could be another house of cards scenario like mortgage defaults in 2008, where something collapses and the whole global economy comes down with it. I can't see what that 'something' is in this scenario though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wealth imbalance is something that I worry about deeply myself, but I also think that the &quot;something&quot; you describe could very well be that prices just get too high.</p>
<p>In Toronto, the year-to-year price increase this month was 33%. That simply can't continue indefinitely. I don't think that anyone believes that in five years the average price of a home will be $5 million, which is what it would be if this level of growth continues.</p>
<p>Even now, with interest rates the way they are, investors can't actually pay for their mortgages by renting out the house. Many of them are taking a small loss in the expectation that they'll be able to sell for a huge gain. But what happens when prices get so high that speculators aren't able to afford them anymore? Prices don't need to go down to start a sell-off, they just need to slow down a bit to cause panic in small-scale investors who haven't thought things through very well. </p>
<p>Of course, even a small bump in interest rates could have a similar effect, and interest rates <em>will</em> eventually go up...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't imagine the level of risk tolerance it would require to purchase a property in a city with clearly inflated prices, expecting equity growth to outpace the mortgage payments, even if you have a renter offsetting some of the cost. You have to be either rich or crazy to play with money like that. </p>
<p>Rising interest rates will cause mortgage payments to increase, which will discourage people from buying property. When people stop buying, the value of all properties in the market will decrease - is this thought process correct?</p></div>		</li>
