			<div class="markdown"><p>Solar wind is a very, very tiny effect. If the flag accumulates charge for whatever reason then that could have a larger effect. I have no idea if, e.g., solar wind would tend to do that to cloth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the flag is made of a fabric with any stretch to it, the flag would continue fluttering for a small period of time whenever the acceleration ends. It would have a dampened spring like motion in this time period. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the momentum imparted to the flag during acceleration cause it to &quot;bounce back&quot; and move around somewhat chaotically over time?</p></div>		</li>
