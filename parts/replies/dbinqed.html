He is a medical professional and says that it's actually the kidneys that get the most blood supply of any organ, but the adrenal glands are situated right on top of them. He elaborates more, it's worth checking out. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a doctor and actually Lungs are the organs that receive the most blood supply (a whole 100%)</p>
<p>Kidneys get roughly 20%</p></div>		</li>

<p>Take home message- that immediate feeling of electricity is from the CNS's neurotransmitters, not from adrenaline.</p>
<p>BTW, there's been a lot of discussion about what has the greatest blood supply per gram of tissue... Arterial supply TO the adrenal glands doesn't necessarily mean there are a lot of pathways carrying adrenaline AWAY from the glands any faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my younger days of going to University, I would just read a lot of blog posts on the AskScience subreddit and save the links of whichever ones I found interesting.</p>
<p>I save the links by putting it into a word document that has sections of varying chapters from Bioengineering to Earth Science. I never really knew if I wanted to be a doctor, physicist, or an environmental chemist, so I just dabbled in everything. Knowledge is power!</p></div>		</li>
