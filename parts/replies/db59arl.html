			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually they do use oxygen. Plants respire, using oxygen and producing CO2, just as animals do. However, when they have access to light, they can photosynthesise, which does the opposite. When there isn't light, this can't happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I apparently had no idea what I was talking about. Plants do use oxygen at night during respiration while emitting CO2, but during the day they use CO2 and emit oxyge. Now the question becomes is the amount of oxygen used at night greater than the oxygen emitted during the day in order to suck all the oxygen out of a lake covered in ice. My guess is going to be no as that would also cause all plant life to die off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking the same thing. Maybe the plants die and the bacteria that consume them use oxygen? Aerobic or anaerobic, I never remember which is which.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, some do and some don't. Plants can cause still water to become too acidic, which reduces water's ability to hold oxygen, and that can cause massive fish die-offs, but noy because plants consume the oxygen. That was either a mistake or this person has no clue what they are talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants definitely breathe oxygen; it's just that when there is enough light, they produce more oxygen by photosynthesis than they consume by respiration.</p></div>		</li>
