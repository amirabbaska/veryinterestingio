<p>Whereas it seems to be that Buddhists believe that ignoring your thoughts and instead trying to focus on being in the moment is important.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a common misconception... I'll try to explain.</p>
<p>Basically meditation is time you set aside to notice your present-moment experience in detail, in a somewhat systematic way. This includes your sensory experience (bodily feelings, sounds etc.) but also mental activity (thoughts and emotions).</p>
<p>In order to do this, we need to avoid getting lost in thought, otherwise you get wrapped up in thinking about the stock market or tomorrow's plans, and you forget why you're even sitting there. So in meditation you're not ignoring thought -- you're noticing and acknowledging thoughts when they appear, but whenever you notice you've become preoccupied, you return your attention to some easy-to-locate aspect of the present moment (usually the feeling of breathing).</p>
<p>This allows you to stay aware of the present moment even though thoughts are still emerging. When you meditate for a long time, thoughts slow considerably, you don't get lost in them easily, and you can become acutely aware of all kinds of very subtle phenomena, like tiny muscle contractions, sounds, feelings, intuitions, and even subtler mental activity. This awareness is very stable. You learn a ton about how your mind and your emotions work, just by being able to observe them in this profoundly undistracted state. </p>
<p>The mind is constantly generating thoughts, and meditation teaches you, among other things, how to notice what kinds of thoughts are happening before you get all caught up in their subject matter.</p>
<p>This ability is useful for all kinds of reasons, namely that you get stressed out a lot less often (because stress is really just thought and emotion caught in a feedback loop). It helps you break addictions and other compulsive behaviors, because you know how to recognize a craving (and the accompanying rationalizations) as it is happening, before it overwhelms you. </p>
<p>There's a lot more to it but I hope that clears up the misconception that meditation is about ignoring or eradicating thought. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this explanation.  This makes a lot of sense to me. Can you point me in the direction of learning more about actually doing this or is this enough to get started? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll need a little more instruction to get started. A couple of great intro books are <em>Full Catastrophe Living</em> by Jon Kabat-Zinn and <em>Mindfulness in Plain English</em> by Bhante Gunaratana. </p>
<p>You can also start with a guided meditation. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/samharrisorg/mindfulness-meditation-9" target="_blank">Sam Harris's</a> is pretty good but there are tons out there. Guided meditations aren't really enough to establish a practice on your own though. I'd get a book and work through it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also about being concentrated: When writing exams, I often was thinking of something else and found it hard to focus on the work I had to do. I think if I didn't have this voice and the inner conversations, I could concentrate better on my work.</p></div>		</li>
