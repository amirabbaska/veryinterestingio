			<div class="markdown"><p>So with the sun how would you know the pull? </p>
<p>Is a sun spot for example have a greater pull than say an area where a solar prominence is occurring? Or rather would gravity or pull in these two occurrences be the same or would they be different? </p>
<p>Along with this, how does on calculate pull if there is no volume, such as with a black hole? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can probably explain the concept best if I can slow you down and talk you down from a black hole and the sun to talk about the moon. (I'm better with practical applications than fluid or theoretical phyiscs)</p>
<p>In the 1960s, NASA knew that the moon had a very non-uniform or non-homogeneous interior with &quot;mass concentrations&quot; or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_concentration_(astronomy)" target="_blank">masscons</a>. These masscons have the effect of perturbing the local gravitational field at specific spots. Practically speaking, it affects the orbit of a spacecraft in close proximity, causing it to deviate from an ideal circle or ellipse. Being the creative engineers/scientists that they were, NASA designed the Apollo missions to factor this in with a few things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>purposely making the apolune from the initial capture burn higher than normal knowing that within a few orbits, the spacecraft would naturally decline to a lower orbit.</li>
<li>incorporating data from these masscons into the Apollo Guidance Computer on Apollo 12 which resulted in a near spot on landing.</li>
<li>I also believe there was some time set aside for &quot;station keeping&quot; in the form of extra engine burns by the command module pilot while the LM was on the surface. This would prevent orbit degradation.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that said, this is only important while close to the surface. As you get further away, the perturbation effect decreases and the non-uniform mass appears to be more uniform. I believe this is due to the inverse square law which makes propagating waves in 3-D space weaker with distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in the case of the sun, the difference in gravitational pull due to local, temporary effects will be negligible. Also, for spherically, nearly homogeneous bodies, the gravitational field is equivalent to the one if all the mass was centered at a point in the centre of the sphere (model). However, this is what actually happens in a schwartzscild black hole: all the mass ''collapses'' to a single point that is called the singularity. </p></div>		</li>
