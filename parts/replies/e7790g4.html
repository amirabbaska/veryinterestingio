<p>I think you mean vortex shedding. If wind caused objects to shed their vertices it would be catastrophic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A wing fence is not a vortex generator.</p>
<p>A wing fence is to prevent span wise flow as opposed to generating a vortex. Wing fences <strong><em>may</em></strong> generate vortices under some circumstances but it is usually not the intention of the designer when it was put in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vortex generators are added to the blades of turbines so that they are able to produce lift in lower winds. This helps the turbine to produce power even when wind speeds would normally be below their cutoff speed. I would assume because aircraft have an engine, the slight decrease in drag isnâ€™t too big of a deal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>if you try to make it stick to and curve around a surface, it breaks free, leaving a large void of low-pressure air. We call this 'stalling', and when this happens, the wind no longer works at turning the blade (or lifting the aircraft, when it is a wing). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>You lost me there. I thought lift works <em>because</em> of the low pressure over the surface of an airfoil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the graph. But to be honest it just confuses me more. I don't know why vector lines are missing close to the wing surface in the stalling panel. If there is no air flowing there at all then surely the pressure is very low, which would produce lift. If there <em>is</em> air flowing there, hugging the surface as smooth laminar flow, then it would seem to contradict what others have said about the air breaking contact with the surface in a stall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is a low pressure on top of the wing, caused by the high-speed flow of the air over the top of the wing. This low pressure, caused by the Bernoulli Effect, is a major part of the lift of the wing. When the airflow breaks away from the wing, this effect stops. And the lift caused by this is much greater than you can get from that area of disturbed, low-pressure air caused as the wing stalls. In addition, a stalled wing has much greater drag, which, on a wind turbine, could even cause the blades to break.</p></div>		</li>
