Some have flaws in a portion of the chip, so that part is locked off, and you sell it at a lower capacity. This improves yield from your manufacturing process, and thus profits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right about the defects, but this isn't how the loss is managed on NAND.  The parts are sold in powers of 2, so reducing by 50% is more loss than is required.  What's done in practice is to over-size the part be a certain percentage.  The whole space is addressable, but there are markers for the known bad addresses.  So for a given part there is a guaranteed minimum and a hypothetic max.  The advertised capacity is near these values.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are those markers encoded in the same flash hardware, or in some other tech? Essentially, what I'm asking is: how can manufacturers be sure the markers and other bookkeeping bits will be readable/writable when they need to be flipped?</p></div>		</li>
