			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer and the reason why the western world is not like to adopt a flat tax any time soon: taxes give the government a LOT of social control. For instance, someone figured out once that when we have kids and charitable contribution then the whole country tends to be stronger, so we have tax cuts for them. I don't really know anyone who has kids for the tax breaks (foster kids, maybe), but charitable contributions are definitely motivated by tax breaks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many rich and stable countries, people are putting off having children until later and there are fewer children at that resulting in an aging population which is not a good thing. An example of this is Japan which has had dwindling birth rates for decades and the problem is compounded with the lack of immigration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about marriage that doesn't produce kids? What about rotten kids that put a drain on our resources; i.e. hooligans. Seems like I'd your kid is a burden to society you should lose any tax break</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While certainly true in many cases, a society no longer exists without subsequent generations.  Having kids ensures future existence of the society and a base with which to transform support of it as older generations retire/die out.</p>
<p>From a very basic perspective, the only real point of existing is to endure. Society can do this indefinitely with a viable population.  The problem is that humans die off, so they must reproduce in order to sustain the viable population and thus ensure society persists.  That is why society rewards having kids.</p>
<p>Marriages that don't produce kids are not valuable to society in the long term, only while they are employed.  A couple who has children who in turn have children, etc, contribute to the long term stability of society.  Crappy, miscreants are just a cost of doing business when it comes to having kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, I think the theory is that the tax breaks hopefully make it less likely to have shitty kids, and that having a shitty kid creates plenty of individual problems to. </p>
<p>Honestly, I am not sure what kid benefits for having a hooligan would survive them getting in real trouble anyway. Most of the direct benefits to the parents tend to come from things like tax benefits for having dependents, which go away if the kid is in jail, or to indirect benefits aimed at keeping to kid out of trouble or improving them (like subsidies for public school).</p></div>		</li>
