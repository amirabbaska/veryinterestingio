			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was planning on going to get some, but then I heard there was like 20 packets per location and you had to wait in line.</p>
<p>I mean, I'll drive 15 minutes to swing by a Micky d's to try out the sauce with nuggets. But I'm not going to drive 15 minutes, wait in line, and only, maaaybe, get the sauce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's insane that in a city of 13 million people they only had one location with like, 20 packets of sauce. I was gonna go to the LA location too but decided that I didn't feel like participating in a shitfest today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were handing out tickets to the people in line and people fought over the tickets. Also heard that someone jumped the counter and a manager ran to the bathroom and locked themselves in. After that a police car passed by and over megaphone they said that people were stealing the sauce and the store is now closed. </p></div>		</li>
