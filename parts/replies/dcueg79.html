			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably too late already. Employers are nearing the point where firing 100% isn't unthinkable in order to bring in automation. The industries where labor unions had the most pull are most vulnerable too.</p>
<p>The only way that employees will have &quot;protection&quot; soon is by law. I'm not hopeful that these protections actually get codified though. Why would they? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never actually thought of this. I worked for the local 5 outta OKC for over five years. Mason and allied craft worker!
I loved my union, at first the dues seemed expensive but after a while and I saw how much I was getting payed it wasn't even a big deal. Never ever even worried about if I was going to have work or not, I always did.
Insurance was great and they payed for all my education, college classes, books, while on top of that giving me all the real world experience you'd ever need. </p></div>		</li>
