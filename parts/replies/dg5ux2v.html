			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It's the art and asset generation costs that start to get crazy. Until we have stock libraries of assets that are &quot;photorealistic&quot; quality, and/or better tools to produce and modify them efficiently, plus affordable game engines that can actually display those assets and which are usable enough for designers to produce content with, such goals will be out of reach for most studios.</p>
<p>A game like Uncharted or Grand Theft Auto already looks amazing, and those teams are in the thousands, with budgets in the hundreds of millions. That is <em>not</em> most developers, and all but the biggest are suicidal to try to compete with that, even at smaller scope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this is generally true, the programs used to create assets are also becoming more and more powerful. Programs such as AwesomBump can take a single image and output a series of textures,  albeit, those textures are false/guessed, such as generating a height map from image brightness, or figuring out and AO map based on color variation. However it can give realistic looking results in a matter of minutes if you know what you're doing.</p>
<p>As deep learning gets better, I imagine we'll get programs that can generate realistic PBR textures simply by guessing what your object is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.foundry.com/products/modo/features" target="_blank">Check out the videos on this page;</a> it'll give you an idea of how powerful some modeling programs are currently. I think some time around or after we hit that wall of &quot;can't get more realistic&quot; we'll probably see the ability to create assets with absolutely trivial levels of work compared to today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is important in understanding the scope of the answer of the question. &quot;How good could it get with current technology?&quot; is a lot different than if we consider all the advancements. For example, ask a person a hundred years ago how long it would take to map (almost) every road on Earth... but now we have Google Maps because of advancements in technology, satellites, etc. Perhaps a company in the future could employ 5,000 people to run around with hyper-cameras and capture models of everything on the planet for an animation library. Possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Also, to directly respond to OP, some food for thought: our computer graphics are already taking us to new worlds. Our senses are limited by our physiology, but think about a connection between a brain and a computer that could let you see more colors, for example. Technology will likely lead us beyond the reality we have now, and already does in some ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sure.  textures will get fantastic.  and that'll help a lot.  modelling is still very much a manual task, and animation is all but impossible without manual hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only this but there's the Coastline Paradox as well, where it becomes almost impossible to measure something due to fractal division into infinity of every scale, creating a perfect simulation of reality is a very long way away from current basic conceptual capability I wager. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely at some point the heavy lifting of the process will be done with high resolution 3D scans of objects. Why model a tree when you can just scan a tree. I would imagine to a certain extent this is already happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the content can also be autogenerated. There needs to be a good and ever shifting balance between artistic input and generated or auto-combined, auto-derived content. Once you have scanned 20 cactuses at fine detail, you don't need to scan 20000 more to populate a virtual desert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with autogenerated assets is the uncanny valley.  A computer isn't a person, it doesn't know what real things &quot;feel&quot; like visually.  And almost but <em>not quite</em> isn't good enough when it comes to graphics, it's actually a major turn-off.  Our minds would rather have a very clearly fake 3D person than a &quot;just a little bit off&quot; person.</p>
<p>And I think we can all agree that in games, character models end up being far more important than how detailed the cactus is :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So advancing technology might require better models but the technology for model creation will also advance. It will be interesting to see how they both scale as time passes but it wouldn't surprise me if the time taken to create the assets doesn't jump by a crazy amount.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>if you repeated 20 cacti over and over, would they all 'look the same'? like in the US suburbs people complain that the houses may have about 20 different designs but they all look the same. Back to the cacti, can graphic designers randomize different aspects of each cactus design therefore making them look a little different without having to design them all over from scratch?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A tree won't scan well because the leaves will block each other.  Scans also requires a shit load of cleanup.  You also need to still do unwrapping and texture mapping. To give something the ability to animate you also need good &quot;polyflow&quot; which scanning does not give you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There will be solutions to tricky to scan objects like trees, it was just a random thing I pulled out. visible light isn't all that can be used to scan and drones could allow for many angles. I think that most objects don't have anything impossible to overcome to get a good scan for them.</p>
<p>The clean up needed will probably reduce as scanning technology improves.</p>
<p>Unwrapping and texture mapping would take time but if my reading on the subject gives me a good enough idea on the subject then I dont see why a lot of it couldn't be automated with time. I am happy to hear if there is something I am probably overlooking.</p>
<p>The animation problem isn't something I have read a lot about yet, if you have any sources of information about it or polyflow then I would be happy to give them a read.</p></div>		</li>
