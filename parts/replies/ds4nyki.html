<p>I wanted to read this as a sort of Idiocracy reference, even though, salts in water often are electrolytes.</p>
<p>An interesting side-note on this might be the difference (if there is one), between various sugars and salts, and how mammal bodies deal with those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in the body everything dissociates. Salt exists as Na+ and Cl- so it's not necessarily correct to say &quot;salt&quot;, but those would be electrolytes. Simple sugars exist in their free form in the blood and are condensed into long carbohydrate chains for storage in the muscle and liver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers are overcomplicating things. Humans can consume water with X amount of salt in it, with no ill effects, because of our kidneys. Sea mammals simply have kidneys suited to deal with the higher salt content of the sea.</p></div>		</li>
