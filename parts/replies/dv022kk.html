			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s more about accumulative morbidity. </p>
<p>A flu vaccination only has 30% expected value of preventing one from contracting the disease, but lowering the individual morbidity rate will make it less likely for everyone else to be infected with said disease. </p>
<p>That is why it’s recommended to get vaccinated. It’s not so for yourself, but for others. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Many of the medical offices I've been in recently have posted policies requesting that patients wear a mask if they're coughing or sneezing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So you're supposed to wear the mask if <em>you</em> have a cold? I thought people were wearing them in order to not catch the cold off others. I am quite positive that the rate of spreading germs to others whilst wearing the mask is lowered, and I do assume that wearing the mask in public helps in not gettiing infected by airborne virii just like this sentence in your article asserts:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The downside is that these masks don’t prevent the inhalation of small, airborne contaminants.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am pretty sure OP's question is on this topic. He's basically asking if the effectiveness of wearing a 'japanese' face mask is scientifically proven to lower infection rate. Are there sources that assert the above quote?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes you're supposed to wear it if you're sick, exactly as the guy you're responding to said.</p>
<p>and the downside is not relevant because it's not supposed to be a germ warfare mask to keep contaminants out, it's to keep YOUR contaminants from polluting the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say the large majority of Japanese people wearing masks are doing so to prevent themselves from getting sick, or this time of year to block pollen. </p>
<p>You are expected to wear a mask if you’re sick in Japan, but most of the time when I ask someone wearing a mask if they’re okay (I’m a schoolteacher in Japan) they tell me they’re fine, and they’re wearing it for protection.</p>
<p>So whatever you’re <em>supposed</em> to do, I think the guy you’re responding to is restating OP’s original question which hasn’t been answered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wore a mask and rubber gloves every time i went out in public this winter. I avoided getting the flu. I live in a hotel, and i use public transportation, and at one point tons of people where i live had it, still didn't get it. </p>
<p>I have a weak immune system (long story), and i just didn't want to deal with being sick for a month. Ive traveled to asia frequently, and I have at least worn a mask every time i got a cold or the flu for the last 9 years. This is the first winter i wore the mask / gloves every time I went out.</p>
<p>I wish we could get sick people here in the US to stay home if possible, and wear a mask if you absolutely need to get out. Its irritating to see someone sniffling and sneezing while making your burger at McDonald's...but thats more about people in minimum wage jobs not being allowed time off sometimes / not being able to afford to miss work because of no paid sick time. I digress...</p>
<p><strong><em>Edit: Im in N. Dallas for those curious, and if you saw a guy in a mask and surgical gloves, that was me!</em></strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wearing a standard mask does almost nothing to prevent you from catching something.  Those things aren't air-tight and restricting all airflow through an anti-microbial filter.</p>
<p>The masks are for catching your coughs and sneezes, so as to lessen the spread. </p>
<p>Less spread of illness inherently means a lower infection rate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct. The germs come <em>out</em> of the face of the ill person when they cough or sneeze. </p></div>		</li>
