			<div class="markdown"><p>As Chinese person that has moved to the US at age 11, i'll add for chinese it's really easy to write character in digital form on the computer or smart phone, but it's considerably more difficult to do it on paper. I could write high school to college level essays on my Chinese blog, which suggest my Chinese level has progressed after i came to the US, however, writing on paper is far worse and often struggle at elementary school level characters when writing down simple notes on a post-it, which suggest my Chinese level has stagnated or even regressed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do I misunderstand, or are you talking more about writing versus typing? I don't know what you mean by writing digitally. It's there a stylus involved or a difference in notation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, both, since i mostly type in pinyin but will switch to writing with my fingers if i'm not sure about pronouciation and knows how to write the character. In both case it is aided via suggested character list which can type characters or even formulate entire sentences just based on context and habit. I found these feature seems to be more powerfully implement in Chinese than equivalent software in English.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you write Chinese on a computer you type in the sound of the character using the Latin alphabet and a little popup appears with options for characters that have that sound. By hand you have to try to remember where all the little parts go (and which parts are needed) and people make errors doing that all the time, some of which can make your character illegible or at least something you have to think about.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, bit of trivia in case you don't know: Emoji is a Japanese word borrowed into English that was originally a blend of the English word &quot;emotion&quot; and the Japanese word 字 (ji) &quot;character&quot; or &quot;letter&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm pretty sure it's just 絵 <em>e</em> (picture) + 文字 <em>moji</em> (letter). There's also 顔文字 <em>kaomoji</em> (face + letter) which is basically a sub-category of emoji.  (ΦωΦ)　 (´・ω・｀)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is a fundamental fact of human cognition that production is a different and harder skill than recognition.</p>

<p>Complexity theory seems to suggest that verifying that an answer satisfies a set of constraints is fundamentally easier than producing an answer that will verify correctly. This might be a fundamental nature of mathematics and reality.</p></div>		</li>
