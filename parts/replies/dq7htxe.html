			<div class="markdown"><p>The impact would be indirect. Since the major market of U.S. readers/viewers could become fully canalized to the major websites that pay for better access, smaller websites that don't or can't pay for that access would just not be able to gain traction. This would apply to U.S.-based sites as well as non-U.S.-based sites that often still rely on American readers. In the long run, even outside the U.S. you would probably see fewer new sites and some smaller existing sites would disappear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there would be a huge obvious effect in the immediate future but a lot of startups and tech companies originate in the US and if net neutrality falls here then new companies may have a tough time establishing a online presence resulting in failed companies that may have otherwise succeeded if net neutrality existed therefore potentially depriving those in and out of the US from that service or product.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Directly, immediately?  Not really much at all.</p>
<p>Indirectly?  Well, if the big ISPs in the US start finding ways of making more money when Net Neutrality is gone, big ISPs in other countries will definitely try to follow suit.</p>
<p>Also indirectly, the US is a huge market, so if suddenly competition and innovation are stifled in the US, it's going to mean less money for foreign content/service providers on the internet, which means some of them may go away, or fewer of them will get started in the first place, which affects everyone in the world.</p>
<p>Imagine for example, if some new social network site popped up, but facebook was already paying all the US ISPs for exclusivity.  The ISPs could block access to that new site from the US, or just charge a monthly fee to be able to get to it.  Now that new social network site has a <em>lot</em> harder time getting new users, and maybe fails or just never really takes off.  Now you've been deprived of a cool new social networking site even though you're not an American and you don't use a US ISP.</p></div>		</li>
