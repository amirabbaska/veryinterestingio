			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not an entirely accurate description of tolerance. Regular drinkers do gain tolerance, in that it does take more alcohol for them to feel the affects, and they can function better than a novice drinker after a similar amount of alcohol.</p>
<p>However, part of the danger of tolerance is that a number of factors do not change regardless of your tolerance. Reflexes and coordination are affected the same. This is one of the dangers of DUI - a regular drinker may not &quot;feel&quot; as drunk after 4-5 beers, but they still have the same impairment.</p>
<p>Likewise, alcohol toxicity does not change regardless of your tolerance. Blood alcohol content is a percent of alcohol in your blood. Your weight will obviously affect this, but your tolerance won't. 180# person with 3 drinks is going to be about .10, regardless of it's the first time they have drank or the 1,001st. </p>
<p>.30 will be near passing out, losing control of bodily function</p>
<p>.40 you will be unconscious, possibly die</p>
<p>.50 you will almost certainly die.</p>
<p>The danger of tolerance is that you have to get closer and closer to those dangerous numbers before you start feeling the affects. Casual drinkers will probably puke or pass out before they get to truly dangerous levels, where long-time alcoholics' tolerance lets them drink right up to the point they are rushed to the hospital.</p>
<p>edit: TLDR: pounding down a fifth of jack, if you don't throw it back up, will almost certainly send you to the hospital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To an extent. Extreme alcoholics get to the point where they can survive far higher BACs than normal people. Highest ever recorded that didn't result in a fatality was 1.6%. Not 0.16. 1.6.</p>
