			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this mean that companies are putting up satellites with &quot;vacancies&quot; to be filled or as you put in your analogy are all the rooms filled up before launch? Also can you drop a tenant and replace it with another? I'm not a smart man so this analogy works for me thank you.</p>
<p>Edit: I got so many awesome replies so thank you to everyone. I'll try to get through them if my kids give me time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little of both. You can also do leases based on just a few hours if you wanted. You lock your antenna to their beacon and then you just need to call the satellite operator on duty once you're cleared and they make sure your power and frequency are good (not interfering with others).</p>
<p>It is even cheaper now that you can just send your data over the Internet to specific ground stations set up by those satellite companies pointed at their satellites virtually anywhere in the world, so you can provide sat link data from and to almost anywhere without any special comms hardware.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the have vacancies. But generally you try to sell it all before the launch of course </p>
<p>However a sat can easily last 20 years. But you’ll generally only have leases for 3-5, so you’re always in the business of finding new tenets or getting your existing ones to renew their lease. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say easily. Space years are like dog years or maybe a 1:5 ratio instead of 1:7. Once a satellite gets to 15 you start to see some cracks if not already. 18 and you're in the danger zone. They definitely go to 20 but they never go quietly at that age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you lease space on a satellite? Like if I were trying to start my own - for example - DirecTV-like service, where would you even begin in leasing a satellite, uplinking the needed software, etc.?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well if you wanted to start a DBS satellite services, you need an utter fuck ton of satellite space and some very unique types of satellites custom made for you, because that’s not a plug and play business. What you’re intending to do with your space matters what space you need to rent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd need a hell of a chunk of seed money. DIRECTV originally was a spin off of Hughs Electronics, where they were already putting up their own communications satellites. DIRECTV currently owns their own satellites, owns and operates the uplink and downlink, but outsources the operation and control of the satellites in the air. The data that DIRECTV is sending is highly specialized, so leasing space isn't really an option. In just the past 2 years they paid for the building and launch of what I'd guess to be the last satellite DIRECTV sends up for consumer television. AT&amp;T, the current owner of DIRECTV, is much more interested in terrestrial wireless for content delivery.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you sure? After they bought DirecTV they switched over from uverse to dish-based TV packages in my area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you check the wiki article about geosynchronous satellite you will find the list of satellites operators.</p>
<ul>
<li>Direct TV</li>
<li>SES</li>
<li>Intelsat</li>
<li>Echostar</li>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of them rent space bandwidth and cover most of the earth if you need to cover more than one country. So you would have to negociate with them bandwidth occupation, prices, geographic area to cover and I'm sure multiple other things.</p>
<p>Geosynchronous satcoms are huge and have massive bandwidth over multiple frequency range.</p></div>		</li>
