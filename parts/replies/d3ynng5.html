			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the default guidelines for private student loans but most likely, yes.</p>
<p>You'd have to be in default (obviously), and someone would have to buy the block that includes your loan. </p>
<p>I've done work on securitization of student loans (federal, not private), and $60,000 in defaulted student loans will be less than $15m in notional values.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how complicated would it be for me to default on my $70,000 of federal debts, then buy those debts as a debt collector and forgive myself. We are assuming here that I will actually forgive myself and not demand that I pay me back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume student loan debts have a much higher &quot;resale&quot; value due to the fact that they cannot be discharged through bankruptcy like most other debts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can, but companies don't give up student loans as easily. Student loans were created to give banks a reason to loan to teenager with no job history or money. Student loans can never been forgiven via bankruptcy or time. And I'm pretty sure it is easier to put lien on paychecks. </p>
<p>So in short student loan companies come in with the knowledge getting their money back will be a long lengthy process. But they made the loans even more favorable for the banks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's works in sponsored phone in Europe. Here, we get a &quot;free&quot; phone if you subscribe for X month (usually 24). In fact the value of the phone is included in the subscription, so basicaly it's a loan for you phone purchase.</p>
<p>Now my story. When the Iphone 3G came out, I took the subscription then cancelled it a month later. Phone company told me I still had to pay the full 24 month (1200€). I didn't. They sold my debt to a debt collector. I paid them 100€ and they drop the debt. I got listed as bad payer within all the shark phone companies.  I got to keep the phone and subscribe another phone company that just enter our market.</p></div>		</li>
