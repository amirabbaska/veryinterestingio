			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the full mass-energy equivalence formula is</p>
<p>E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2</p>
<p>Meaning that the total Energy of an object that is not subject to any potential energy field is equal to its rest mass plus its momentum energy.</p>
<p>To paraphrase Griffith's on the matter: the equation is much more important and still fits on a t-shirt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's the full equation for a <strong>free</strong> particle. If you want to include a potential energy due to some external source, you'd take the square root of both sides and add the potential energy on the right hand side.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a math student who doesn't know anything about relativity, I couldn't help but notice the sum-of-squares form of that equation: E² = (mc²)² + (pc)². Is this a Pythagorean theorem type equation? Is there an inner product at work here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's an inner product in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime.</p>
<p>The energy and momentum form a four component vector called the four-momentum:</p>
<p>(E/c,p<em><em>x</em></em>,p<em><em>y</em></em>,p<em><em>z</em></em>).</p>
<p>Squaring this vector in Minkowski space, you get</p>
<p>(E/c)^(2) - <strong>p</strong>^(2),</p>
<p>which is invariant under the group of Lorentz transformations. This is defined to be (mc)^(2), where m is the <em>invariant mass</em> (the only useful definition of mass).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should still be noted though that if two identical object meet the set of conditions above (in a reference frame where total momentum is zero) and one object has more energy than the other object, then the one object with more energy will have more mass. </p>
<p>A good example of this is explained in a PBS spacetime video on the nature of E=MC^2 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo232kyTsO0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo232kyTsO0</a>). But for those at work who want an explanation, it goes like this:</p>
<p>Let us say we have perfectly identical pocket watches in a room on earth. Relative the reference frame of earth these pocket watches have no momentum. We take one pocket watch and wind it up and so it begins running, but the other watch we leave on the table unwound. The watch that is now running now has more potential energy (from the winding), kinetic energy (from it running) and other sorts of miscellaneous energy (thermal, acoustic, etc that results from it running). This running watch indeed has greater mass than the watch that is not running, and in fact, because the watch is losing energy to the environment via thermal/acoustic/whatever energy, its mass is actually decreasing over time. Eventually this watch will stop running, and at that point when it has no energy, theoretically the once-running watch will again have the same mass as the non-running watch, assuming that the arrangement of atoms and subatomic particles, aka the molecular and atomic energies, are also equivalent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not able to watch the video right now - but that is certainly counter-intuitive, and I'm struggling to conceptualize it.</p>
<p>So by an outside force imparting additional energy into a system (eg you winding the watch), it now has additional mass?  Is that measureable - or are the numbers so small as to be imperceptible to us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the video (aka I did not do this calculation myself), the amount of mass is extremely, extremely small, amounting to a billionth of a billionth of a percent of the mass of the watch that is not wound. However, this tiny bit of mass is actually there, and we observe this type of energetic mass when looking at cosmological phenomena. </p>
<p>Another way to think of this exact same idea, which is also in the video, is think of a flashlight. If you turn the flashlight on, its mass begins to decrease. Why? Because part of the mass of the flashlight is the electrochemical energy stored in the battery which is now being lost as light being emitted from the flashlight. However, if instead, the flashlight were to be put in a weightless, mirror lined room and that system were to be put on a scale, then the entire system would weigh the same regardless of whether the flashlight is on or off. This is because the flashlight is still losing electrochemical energy, but the system as a whole has contained that light energy emitted, aka the energy of the system has remained the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's only counter intuitive because a tiny bit of mass carries a very large amount of energy relative to things you are used to having energy.</p>
<p>For example, you are used to the amount of energy that gasoline, or a block of wood has when burned. Those are probably closer to what you think about as your energy reference. So when you hear &quot;adding energy also changes mass&quot; you are thinking about it in scales of your common reference. In this case the amount of energy needed to change the perceptible mass on your &quot;common/relative&quot; scale are so large that it just &quot;doesn't happen&quot; is your daily life.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The mass of the entire system is not the sum of the masses of the individual particles. It's the sum of the individual masses <strong>plus</strong> the potential energy due to interactions (which is negative for attractive interactions).</p></div>		</li>
