			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature in physics is more strictly defined as the derivative of energy with respect to entropy, or more conveniently, 1/T is defined as the derivative of entropy with respect to energy. This means that temperature is truly related to how the disorder of a system changes as you add energy to it. </p>
<p>Therefore, a system will have negative temperature when adding energy decreases it's entropy, or disorder. The classic example is a population inversion in laser physics, where there is some maximum energy state, and putting more energy in actually pushes the particles to all be in that state, which limits the disorder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To slightly expand on this answer, the common confusion of 'lower than zero Kelvin not being possible' comes from the definition of temperature in statistical mechanics as 'a measure of the average kinetic energy in an ideal gas.' Since kinetic energy can't be negative, temperature can't be negative, here. However, this definition breaks down for any system that is not an ideal gas.</p>
<p>Also, negative temperature here means that energy will flow to any system with any positive temperature. In this sense, a negative temperature is infinitely hot with respect to systems of positive temperature. Interestingly enough, negative temperatures behave normally otherwise, such as having energy flow to systems with lower, also negative temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how would a negative temp feel if I were to touch something with a negative temp? I get that we sense the change in energy and not temperature, so I dont know which way the energy would flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are somewhat incorrect. Negative temepratures are possible for the thermodynamic definition of temperature, which is the inverse of the derivative of entropy with respect to energy. In practical terms, you have a negative temperature in a system if by increasing its energy you <em>lower</em> its entropy.</p>
<p>Negative temperature however is, thermodynamically speaking, hotter than any positive temperature, as energy always flows such that total entropy increases. As the entropy in this system increases when its energy decreases, its energy will move towards any possible system with positive temperature, as there the entropy increases while its energy increases.</p>
<p>Edit: /u/Scott_2's answer is absolutely correct, I was typing way too slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so the planck function, as it is given by wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck's_law" target="_blank">here</a>, has units of W/sr/m^(3). By integrating you will get W/sr/m^(2). To geth the total power output you will have to multiply with the surface area of the object that is radiating. To get the total energy emitted you need to then multiply by the time over which your object is radiating. </p>
<p>The graph that I picked has some weird units, I didn't see that. I will change it to the wikipedia graph that has the correct units. </p></div>		</li>
