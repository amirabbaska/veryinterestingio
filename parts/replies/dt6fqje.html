			<div class="markdown"><p>And in Spanish, &quot;sombrero&quot; just means &quot;hat&quot; and &quot;salsa&quot; just means &quot;sauce&quot;.</p>
<p>It's interesting how words imported from other regions/languages/cultures sometimes gain a connotation from the origin that they didn't have <em>at</em> the origin. Is this because the word &quot;jungle&quot; wouldn't have been imported <em>except</em> to talk about &quot;the forests over there&quot; as opposed to just &quot;forests&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pesto is also, strictly speaking, just something made by pounding/crushing (the name comes from the Genoese verb meaning to pound or crush, and shares an origin with the English word &quot;pestle&quot;). And there are definitely sauces referred to as pesto that aren't the green one we normally think of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in Latin gladius just means sword and so on. There's tons of those words where someone heard another person call something a word in their language, and used it to describe that specific thing even though the actual translation was much more generic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In East Africa jungle refers to grasslands locally. I was really confused when I was told a bus I was taking goes through a 500km jungle (Kampala to Arua, Uganda) and didn't see anything representing what I thought was jungle (rainforest).</p>
<p>They also refer to the Masai Mara and Serengeti as jungles but after seeing both I'd class them as Savanna.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suspect that's why the lion is called &quot;King of the Jungle&quot; (and &quot;King of the Forest&quot; at least in Italian), probably just a wrong translation.</p></div>		</li>
