			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the kind words.  The only reason I know any of what I wrote is that (i) my wife is a veterinarian and has been kind enough to explain and teach me how to properly perform a drug-based euthanasia; (ii) I have experience receiving or administering the drugs; and (iii) I'm an attorney and fairly disgusted with how executions are handled (I believe capital punishment is horrible, but recognize that I can't stop it, and would prefer that they do it right, if they must do it).  </p></div>		</li>
