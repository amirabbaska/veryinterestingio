For example, if you get bitten by a rabid animal, they give you immunoglobulin, and at least traditionally this was harvested from large farm animals that were exposed so that their bodies would continually produce it. This gives the recipient the temporary ability to recognize the infection while they develop their own antibodies. </p>
<p>I realize this is a specific circumstance but it seems like donor blood would be useful if the recipient had or was getting an infection soon. Especially since a pint of donated blood is like, 1/11th of the donor's actual blood, which is significant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, this is a thing. It's called passive immunization. It's passive because the host immune system doesn't need to do anything, really.</p>
<p>As you touched on, however, one disadvantage is that this immunization only lasts as long as the antibodies in the circulation are at a therapeutic concentration. Antibodies have a limited lifespan.</p>
<p>Also, a single person blood would not be nearly enough, because the antibody levels in an unactivated immune system may not be enough to fight off an infection.</p>
<p>In reality, the antibodies must be identified and purified from hundreds or thousands of donors to treat one patient. Patients receive essentially &quot;pure antibodies&quot; as opposed to receiving whole blood, because there are significant risks associated with whole blood transfusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunization isn't about making antibodies <em>per se</em>, it's more about giving the body the ability to make them. When your body encounters an antigen, they store the data in 'memory cells' (a subgroup of B cells, which in turn are a subgroup of WBCs). The next time that infection comes around the memory cells recognize it and tell the other B cells to start making the antibody in question. They don't keep producing them at all times, that's just a waste of energy. Think of it this way - they did the R&amp;D and stored the blueprints for a new weapon, but they only produce them when they actually need them.</p>
<p>In your scenario, the blood wouldn't really have too many antibodies because no infection. Not to mention the B cells would all be dead, so no more could be made from the donor's blood. Sure, the ones that existed would probably pass through - but they wouldn't exist in enough numbers to make an impact, and even that number would dwindle soon enough.</p>
<p>Besides, why would you want to give somebody temporary resistance via <em>transfusion</em> of all means when you can just use IVIGs (immunogloblins applied by intravenous means). Much easier and quicker. Less side effects. Probably also cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is not what the OP is talking about, he's talking about immunity gained through vaccines, i.e. antibodies. Antibodies are indeed transferred during a transfusion, this is called passive immunity. However, antibodies have a limited life span and need constant replenishment, which is why passive immunity is temporary. They are produced by B cells which typically reside in the spleen and lymph nodes. B cells need to be shown an antigen (part of the virus) so that they can make antibodies against it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty much what i was talking about, albeit indirectly.</p>
<ol>
<li>Passive immunization is usually done via IVIGs, not transfusions.</li>
</ol>
<p>1-a Baseline serum antibody levels are too low to be efficient.</p>
<p>1-b Transfusion can also cause side effects.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>B cells from the donor are filtered or irradiated prior to transfusion. So no active immunization either.</p>
</li>
<li>Since both passive and active immunization are inefficient/ineffective via transfusion, transfusion isn't clinically useful as a method for immunization.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I didn't mean that it transferred any significant immunity, but it does transfer some antibodies. The OP was just wondering why the antibodies created by his hep a and b vaccines can't be successfully transmitted via infusion. You only talked about leukocytes.</p></div>		</li>
