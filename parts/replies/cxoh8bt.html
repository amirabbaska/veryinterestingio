			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a paper cup for cold drinks.  Not knowing it was made for cold, I poured hot water in.  Moments later, when I return, I found some oily droplets on the surface of the water, probably molten wax in the form of oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On a related note: I once learned the hard way why you should never refrigerate a cake after it has been covered with fondant (that hard sugar covering you often see on wedding cakes). I did my own wedding cake and covered it in fondant the night before the wedding and stuck it in the fridge overnight. In the morning I took it out and put it on the counter. Cold cake in a warm kitchen meant condensation. The fondant absorbed the water and expanded, causing it to bulge and pucker and eventually peel off the outside in big ugly strips. Had to remake my wedding cake on the morning of the wedding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well, I think. On my way to the cake store to buy more fondant I may have yelled at a lady on the subway who was in my way, but I'm sure that was unrelated. </p></div>		</li>
