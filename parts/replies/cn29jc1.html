			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great explanation. Thank you! This sounds like the sort of thing that, although obviously ripping people off, doesn't feel like it's breaking any laws. I guess I'm just used to the economic climate where stuff like this is so commonplace. But it makes sense now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are replying with the question, &quot;How is this different than any salesman lying about what a product is worth?&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the answers seem to be 'there is no difference', or 'its different because there are stock market laws'.</p>
<p>The difference is that stock prices aren't based on the value of the product the customer is selling.  While both physical products and stocks work to an extent off of supply and demand, stocks are based off the <em>perceived</em> worth of the company.</p>
<p>If a car salesman tells me this car is worth whatever amount, lies to me, and shows me fake reviews, but then shows me the car, I can plainly see the car isn't worth what he's asking.  The way stocks are valued is by how quickly/much it is being bought.  The idea is that if a company is doing well, or predicted to do well, then the stock is more valuable.</p>
<p>Now, if someone calls you about buying stock in a car company and how well they're doing and how the prices are sky rocketing and will continue to do so.  But in reality the company doesn't even make cars, or anything at all, and the price has been going up because the broker got his friends to buy it.  They're all just waiting for x amount of people convinced to buy it to further raise the price, then all selling at once.  Since the company isn't even real, there is no way the stock will recover and you are simply out your investment.</p>
<p>This can't happen in the same way with a physical object.  Sure, they can trick you into buying an inferior product, but it still is a <em>product</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It cans till happen. It can happen anywhere you have a broker or &quot;gatekeeper&quot; going between buyer and seller (and sometimes not telling you that they themselves are the seller and have a conflict of interest).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockbusting" target="_blank">Blockbusting</a> is an example in the world of real estate - selling actual houses and property, and is illegal because it's a serious breach of professional ethics - much like selling people stock you own and not telling them that you're the seller - not just the broker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I'm sure there are other similar examples, I was simply explaining why it was different from your average shady salesman at the car lot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, hypothetically, Belfort would sell to his &quot;buds&quot; 1 million shares at a lowish price, then he would raise the price up and up selling to actual clients that expected to make money. Then when the stock hit a certain price that was higher than what it was worth (because Jordan jacked the price up with his ratholes) they would all turn around and sell??? Thus making them money and the suckers who bought in basically are left with worthless shares? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it isn't really selling to them at a lower price.  The price is raised because he would tell people how good the stock was and 'look how its been going up in price and how many shares were bought in the last x days, you better get on this now'.  This artificially raised the price.  It isn't him manually setting the price, its artificial manipulation of the market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention the fact that the stock market is more important to the economy than some Joe Blow who doesn't know he's overpaying on vacuum cleaners. So that's why it gets more regulation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the best explanation in the thread so far. Jordan nicely veiled the pump and dump by having his rat-holes buy in. I would rather be a rat-hole than the rat-king in this scenario though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>If you mean from purely altruistic ethical concerns I understand, but seriously would you scuttle your own existence for moral reasons?</p></div>		</li>
