			<p>That's a great explanation. Thank you! This sounds like the sort of thing that, although obviously ripping people off, doesn't feel like it's breaking any laws. I guess I'm just used to the economic climate where stuff like this is so commonplace. But it makes sense now.</p>		</li>

			<p>Wait do I get this right (re:online stock gurus), they are selling you part of their knowledge when to buy/sell that penny stock and you can use that to try and make money off those that come in slower than you? So the subscribers know they're being ripped off but hope that they can rip off somebody else some more?</p>		</li>

			<p>To be fair, most smart traders aren't going to online gurus for advice. They have their own method of speculation that they wouldn't even dare of letting others know about. </p>		</li>

			<p>Almost all &quot;get rich quick&quot; &quot;training&quot; courses operate the same way - they are sales operations selling the &quot;path to riches&quot;.  They get their clients to part with their money for the &quot;system&quot; or &quot;knowledge&quot; then the client is on their own.  Given how many review sites and reports exist on these soft scams I'm amazed people still do them.  <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Very few have any sort of awareness of pump &amp; dump schemes. A very small number may be completely aware of what is going on and get involved thinking they may be early enough to catch an initial wave. Most are unsophisticated normal folks and simply get duped.</p>		</li>

			<p>In that respect it's like a pyramid scheme (even though it's also not like one).  Those who get in early end up 'getting out' with some money.  Those who show up late for the party end up holding the bag.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is a good description of every boom &amp; bust cycle in the U.S. A good definition of &quot;late for the party&quot; would be, &quot;when the general public gets wind of boom X.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>That's why I said &quot;it's also not like one&quot;.<br><br>They are similar in that they are both scams, both reward those who get in early, and both require finding a bunch of suckers who lose their money when the early birds cash out.<br><br>The only thing sloppy is your smug attempt to be right.</p>		</li>
