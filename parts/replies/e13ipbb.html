			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure you could. In the &quot;free-floating bubble&quot; scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>The water would stay oxygenated, as the bubble would be surrounded by oxygenated air (and oxygenation is via osmosis). No problems there.</li>
<li>Fish in a tank need filtration to maintain acceptable water quality. They produce waste just like us, and so after a while the water would contain enough ammonia to start scorching their skin and gills and kill them. Some fish are more hardy than others, but most fish would be dead within a few days from this. (Don't keep goldfish in unfiltered bowls, folks!)</li>
<li>Fish maintain their balance using a swim bladder. This is an organ containing gas (which is buoyant) to keep them upright. In space there is no buoyancy, because there is no gravity, so the fish wouldn't be able to control their orientation </li>
<li><em>Very</em> tiny fish wouldn't be able to break through the water's meniscus, so would be contained in the sphere, but most fish could easily break out of the sphere accidentally (and subsequently asphyxiate)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine they wouldn't realise they're swimming out of the bubble. And even if they did, by the time they reached the edge then their momentum would carry them out of it anyway.</p>
<p>Then you'd have a fish thinking &quot;ohfug&quot; as it floated away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You'd think so, but sadly not.</p>
<p>Many fish will jump when startled (to escape predators!) which is fine when surrounded by water, but in captivity they just jump out and die. Most fish tanks have lids for a very good reason!</p>
<p>Even when <em>not</em> startled, any decent-sized fish could just swim forwards and out. I'd guess most fish will make the assumption that &quot;up&quot; is air and &quot;not up&quot; is more water (which is a fair assumption on earth). Throw in that their swim bladder won't be working (possibly making them feel extremely dizzy), and I'd expect that any fish big enough to be capable of breaking the surface and leaving the water.. would leave the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, but let's talk about ME for a second. So if there was a ball of water in space, just floating in space, a few meters across, and I was in there naked except with an oxygen tank to breath underwater, could I survive in space wearing nothing more than an oxygen tank and a huge ball of water? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>temporarily yes but due to the low pressure in space your ball of water would quickly boil off leaving you just in space by yourself wearing an oxygen tank.this whole time you are also experiencingall the nasty symptoms of being in space without protection like your blood boiling and getting wrecked by radiation. So by temporary I mean not much longer than normal naked man in space if any longer at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is not about space lulz, this is about the inside of a pressurized spacecraft</p>
<p>if a giant bubble of water teleported from our ocean to space, it would immediately boil into vapor, and then freeze into ice crystals. It might actually kill you faster than just wearing nothing. The reason is the same why pressure cookers cook better, because the increased pressure increases the boiling point of water to a higher temp keeping it a liquid up to 130-140c, but the other way around with almost non existing pressure.  On the top of mount everest water boils at 71c </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you watch video of this, you’ll see that the fish are fine maintaining their orientation. It may be less efficient than relying on the bladder, but they have enough control. Similarly, a human in water is easily able to change orientation.</p>
<p>If there’s no plant life or mechanical mixing, the water might be low on oxygen, but goldfish survive in bowls. It might be unpleasant, but probably not deadly to a robust fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually surprised at how well they were able to keep themselves orientated when I watched the video. I've had fish with swim bladder issues before and they are all over the place. A healthy fish in space is clearly better at orientating itself than a sick fish on earth!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but as has been discussed in other comments you'd probably want some way to mix the water or else the middle of the bubble would become low in oxygen after a while, and if the fish swam to the edge of the bubble it would basically float away and die.</p>
<p>So I'm now imagining a spherical machine that is mostly fabric so the air can get into the water, but the fish can't get out, and then something to slowly mix the water so we don't get a dead spot in t the middle, but not so fast that it negates microgravity or can hit and harm the fish.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know how! Let's put a fish in that water to stir it with fin motions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well we don't know how the fish will react to weightlessness, well it move at all? Will it move enough to aerate the whole bubble? Even if it moved just as much as it would on earth, is that enough? We have to aerate fish tanks, but tanks have a lot less surface area exposed to the air, whereas our bubble tank would be exposed ask the way around ideally.</p>
<p>The engineering solution is to remove any doubt and just have a machine mix the water for us, but maybe a mathematician or theoretical physicist could do the math and save us the money time and effort of adding a machine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think elementary mechanics. On earth, water has an additional force on it due to gravity. In vacuum, assuming the water is free-floating there is not reactive force to the force applied by the fish. In effect, the fish will remain where it is while the water around it will move in the direction opposite to the intended motion of the fish eventually moving away from the fish leaving it in vacuum without water.
At least that's what I would guess.</p></div>		</li>
