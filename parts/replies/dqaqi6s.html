			<div class="markdown"><p>Super interesting stuff!  Can you tell me more about this?  Are you in the US?  Is it like an incinerator,  or is it plasma?  Are there any gases that are produced and how are they dealt with?  Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The plant I work at is in Florida, and I'm an operator there. It's an incinerator plant, we're permitted to burn about 500 tons a day. The plant has two units, each unit has an accompanying pollution control system with it. Our scrubber system injects a lime slurry into the flue gas (gas outputted from the combustor after it leaves the boiler) that helps with sulfur dioxide gas, and activated carbon that binds with mercury (which is too small to filter) which makes it into a particulate (important later). The flue gas then passes through a baghouse, which is comprised of I believe 1200 bags  that catch the treated fly ash, and now enlarged mercury particulates. The rest of the flue gas passes through an analyzer which reads the chemical makeup which feeds back to the control valves regulating our lime and carbon injection, and also adjusts our air fans into the combustor to reduce CO, NO2, etc. The analyzer also reads opacity of the stack emissions. And every year we are tested by a 3rd party on our emissions for the government and have never failed a test yet. Our plant is greener than a coal plant, our fuel is free (people pay us to burn their waste), recycles, and reduces our output to the landfill by ~86%.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Landfilling is sustainable if EfW (or WtE in Florida) is a big part of the picture. It's not <em>the</em> answer, but it's a big step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Landfill mining, on the other hand, is a tricky business. As you get below the the very top layers, you end up with a feedstock that is very wet and totally permeated with organics. This increases the input mass but drops the HHV (and skews the moisture way high), which I'm sure know is problematic for typical Martin mass-burn systems (and also even RDF or O'Connor Rotary systems). Beyond that, as you really dig down, it's like a waste time machine. You start to get into eras of time that had very different EPA regulations, and the waste is laden with all sorts of things that are hard/expensive to deal with in terms of emissions. It would be hard to pass a modern stack test with late-1970s waste. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never worked at a facility. I was at the corporate office in NJ. I used to write proposals for building new facilities. I recall a few years back when we did a lot of research into landfill mining, and it came down to having a landfill that has &quot;good&quot; waste in it. Newer landfills are better because the rules are stricter for the entire life of the site. Also, landfills with minimal annual rainfall are better. It's harder to find the good ones that are within a reasonable transport distance to a facility. More than about 60 miles and the logistics cost makes the margin untenable. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Couldn't you use the waste heat from the combustion exhaust to dry that out before it get fed into the incinerator?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(many) additional steps, additional expenses. very likely wouldn't be profitable anymore.</p>
<p>also many incerators already use the waste heat to produce electricity they can sell, so obviously they wouldn't want to divert from that revenue stream.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a good idea, but there isn't really any &quot;waste&quot; heat. The heat from combustion is used to fire a boiler, which, in turn, generates steam used to drive a turbine to generate electricity. Some of that juice is used to power the facility, and the rest is sold to the local grid for distribution. Or, in a very few cases, the steam is directly exported (via pipeline) to a nearby manufacturing plant that can use it. But either way, the heat is used.</p>
<p>Also, the &quot;exhaust&quot; is not so simple. It has to go through a ton of filtering and chemical treatment before it can pass EPA emission guidelines and be vented to the outside air. So if the treated exhaust air (which is pretty hot in most cases) were going to be reused to dry out mined landfill waste, the cost to do so would be very high. You'd have to build a complicated system to handle that air, and it's possible you'd need to get a separate Title V (air) permit. All that means capital cost. And a lot of these facilities are owned by a municipal entity that built them with public bonds. You can't just do whatever you want with public money, so there's also that hurdle. </p>
<p>So yeah, great idea. But it's not practical for financial and regulatory and public perception reasons. At their core, energy from waste (EfW) plants are really waste disposal sites. They can only be profitable if the local taxpayers are willing to pay more for waste disposal. EfW costs quite a bit more than landfilling. And the people paying for it don't <em>see</em> any change; their garbage still gets picked up and taken away, but now it costs more. Most people can't get themselves to see the bigger picture. </p></div>		</li>
