			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised I had to scroll this far to see anyone mention the Wow! Signal. It is really fascinating.</p>
<p>Basically the TLDR coming from a layman who may miss some of the more technical details:</p>
<p>When SETI first started some people tried to figure out what an alien radio wave would look like. Few things will be universal between civilizations across the galaxy, including numbers and language and symbols. What is universal is matter and chemistry. The most universal of that is the hydrogen atom. Scientists said that if an alien race were to broadcast to see if other alien races existed, they would broadcast at the same frequency that a hydrogen atom oscillates. No matter how you interpret radio waves, every civilization will hear the same thing and may understand that it represents the most simple atom in the universe. </p>
<p>In the 70s for a period of about two minutes we heard radio waves that matched up with what we would expect an alien race to broadcast, the Wow! Signal. We may have been able to hear it for longer but our radio telescope moved out of range with the rotation of the earth. 24 hours later we could not detect the radio frequency anymore, so we can only determine that the broadcast was 2 minutes to 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds in length. Radio waves originating from earth, from debris out in orbit, and general background space noise was ruled out. We pinpointed where the radio broadcast came from and there are no stars in that area. </p>
<p>We eventually sent back a response. But our reply was just as brief as the original message. If the radio waves did come from an alien species, who knows if they were listening at the time? Just as we were barely able to listen in the short 2 minute window we had to receive it. </p>
<p>Perhaps alien races only send out a broadcast in short bursts in earth's direction once a year. Or maybe once every 100 or 1000 years. Maybe they only send out broadcasts a handful of times, just like the human race does, and really prefer to listen rather than speak. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So have we given up on sending responses back to them/it? If not why aren't we sending signals there every single day? That's the <em>only</em> place in the Universe that we've ever observed anything resembling other intelligent life, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe we have heard similar signals on a dozen different occasions but the Wow! Signal is the most famous. I have no idea why we aren't constantly broadcasting, but I think it's that we would rather become aware of others before they become aware of us. </p>
<p>Second, I want to add that I am not saying that these signals are evidence of intelligent life. But they are pretty peculiar...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also know that the signal was fixed with respect to the sky (due to the shape of signal gain/drop as the feed moved past its location -- it couldn't be closer than the Earth's moon) either turned on or turned off in the interval between the two signal feeds -- a few minutes apart (it was only seen in one feed).  It was roughly 36 sigma (36 times background noise) with a bandwidth narrower than an AM radio station (&lt; 10 Khz -- no known non-artificial process can produce that narrow a bandwidth at that power), and that it was on a prohibited frequency (which might not exclude covert military satellites, but beyond Lunar orbit? in 1977?).</p>
<p>Because the two feeds followed each other across the sky, and the system at that time only recorded the difference between the two (which excluded local signals like planes or microwave ovens -- their signals would hit both feeds simultaneously and cancel each other out), we don't know which of two locations (close to each other in the sky -- about a full moon's difference) the signal came from.  There were no obvious candidate stars in either location.   </p>
<p>There have been many follow-up observations for extended periods of both possible locations using many different SETI systems and telescopes (Harvard's META spent a summer observing them, I believe)  with no indication of further activity.</p></div>		</li>
