			<div class="markdown"><p>I vaguely recall my physics teacher saying something about &quot;stopping&quot; photons - he said it is possible, and the best we can do now is to stop it for a few nanoseconds. He also mentioned that it is going to be a new way of storing data for computers. Is he wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really.  Photons can be trapped in optical cavities forming standing waves, or by stopping light at a band edge with zero group velocity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A photon is just a pair of magnetic and electric fields, which can only exist at the speed of light. Light can't change speeds, because it's not a physical thing in the same way as a bullet or baseball.</p>
<p>In fact, photons don't actually bounce off of surfaces. They pass through them, which then creates a sphere of new photons, which cancel out the old one.</p>

<p>If you're more in to reading, google the maxwell equations, and accelerating charges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answer.
Yes, I get the part about no rest frame exists, but how does this relate to the fact that helicity has to be conserved?
Is it because the projection of the spin in z-axis (supposing the photon moves in z-direction) is the same for left- and right-polarised light (S_z = +- hbar), but different for S_z = 0? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A different way to see this is that Maxwell's equations require that propagating light waves must have the electric and magnetic fields polarized perpendicular to the direction of travel.  It turns out that the S_z eigenvalue says how the polarization changes as the wave propagates.  S_z = +1 means that the polarization is not fixed but instead rotates in a right handed fashion.  S_z = -1 means it rotates in a left handed way.  (a linearly polarized not rotating wave is in a superposition of +/-1 eigenstates.)  An S_z = 0 eigenstate would mean that the polarization points along the direction of propagation but that is forbidden by maxwell's equations.  </p></div>		</li>
