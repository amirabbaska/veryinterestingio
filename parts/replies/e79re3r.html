<p>No, OP, ancient civs did not have access to atom-splitting or fusing technology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a conspiracy theory.  I think in relation to Ancient Civilization conspiracy theory.  I like looking into these stuff, so I'll just spout some tin-foil hat nonsense.</p>
<p>Nukes in ancient civilization idea was formed to explain one of the possible ways of the civilization going extinct.  I think I've seen some hasty charts of radioactive elements being in higher concentration in certain geological layers that corresponds to the ancient civilization timeline (probably not true, too lazy to check).</p>
<p>Another possible way is via a global flooding event, which is described in many old myths across the globe.  But I digress.</p>
<p>Ancient Civilization conspiracy theory mainly stems from (IIRC) big pillar rocks found in some parts of the world.  I believe the most famous is Inca's Machu Picchu, where there are tons-heavy rocks that are cut to such precision that when engineers examined it, they determined that the only way the stones were cut that way was through the use of power tools.  These rocks even had penetrating circular holes in them that were measured by lasers and found to be drilled with extremely high precision.</p>
<p>There are other reasons/&quot;evidence&quot; for the ancient civilization theory, but I think those huge processed rocks are fascinating, whether or not it proves a crazy conspiracy theory.</p></div>		</li>
