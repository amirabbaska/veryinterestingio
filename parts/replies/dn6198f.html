			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's always an option of course. If there are symptoms involved, it's contained in option 3. If they don't have any symptoms at all and they just don't like it, there's little physiology involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protein is actually a basic building block of life; made of amino acids. Meat isn't the only source of protein. Also according to google there are 2g of protein in a whole cucumber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of protein required for an allergic reaction is orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of protein that we consider nutritionally significant. The amount of protein required for an allergic reaction is tiny (remember, the body is looking for that protein very specifically), so even foods that are not high in protein from a nutritional point of view, can very well trigger an allergic reaction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reference. That's actually what I was referring to for point 3, since it's not really an allergic reaction mediated by normal immunological pathways, but a neural autonomous response (generally limited to the gastrointestinal tract, usually vomiting or diarrhea), that is triggered by senses (mostly smell and taste, partly also touch). For point 2, I was referring to a more mysterious phenomenon in which an actual allergic reaction occurs, with significant cerebral contribution required. I'll try to find a reference for that one.</p></div>		</li>
