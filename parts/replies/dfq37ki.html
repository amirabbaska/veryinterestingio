			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah! Thank you thank you! I wish I could vote this more than once. </p>
<p>Whilst I appreciate most peoples comments here, they are addressing the issue in terms of US context, so thanks for answering in terms of Australian standards. </p>
<p>Yeah- I've heard of the perk ANZ is holding out at the moment, but definitely don't think I'll be spending that much. </p>
<p>I thought I'd just start off with the Comm bank low fee credit card? The $29 annual fee one (and waived if I spend 1k per annum.. which I def would). </p>
<p>I'm actually not sure what those 28 Degree credit cards are.. they're very enticing because from what I understand you don't pay transaction/conversion fee right? I travel a lot so it might be something to think about... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh... cool didn't see that you're a student. </p>
<p>In that case totally go for the <a href="https://www.28degreescard.com.au/" target="_blank">28 Degrees</a> card. Also great for overseas online purchases. I've had it for 5 years now and it has saved hundreds of dollars on fees. Also no annual card fee and although they have a silly payment fee if you pay the bill using BPAY. You just have to direct debit from their website which is free.</p>
<p>As far as transaction accounts go. INGDirect has a terrific one that has zero ATM fees. So go ahead and use that pub ATM cause they put the 3 bucks back into your account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>28 degrees recently changed their fees and it's not quite as good. </p>
<p>The best for international travel is currently citibank visa debit, it has no fees whatsoever and you get the visa exchange rate. Also it has the bonus of being a debit card :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Listen to the guy above you.. You don't need the credit card. It actually will look worse in the future as all your credit file shows is that you took out a credit card for $x limit. It doesn't say you paid it off in full or anything. It's just another item on the report that someone looking to offer you a loan has to look at. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're not sure you'll spend enough to get the perks, you can try to plan ahead. My mom put a semester of my college tuition on a card just to make the sign up bonus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Listen to this response - if your system doesn't use credit scores the same way the US does, be very particular about which card you choose. </p>
<p>I travel a lot of work, which I pay for with a travel rewards card and then gets reimbursed from my company, so I literally get free travel points which I can then use to travel for fun for free. But in addition to that, it comes with full insurance of all my travel - if my baggage is lost it reimburses me for any purchases I have to make for clothes, etc while waiting for my bag to arrive; if my flight is delayed it reimburses me for any purchases or hotel stay needed during the delay; it provides full coverage for any rental car so I don't have to use my personal car insurance. And so many more protections while traveling. There is a $450 fee, but they​ give you $300 towards travel off the bat and $100 towards global entry, TSA pre check, etc, so the fee comes out to $50 which far out weighs the free travel I get out of it.</p>
<p>So even though this will be your first card, if there's no such thing as building credit for you, definitely look into the perks and pick out a card that will really work for you. Of course, don't over reach and apply for one you have a bad chance of getting​ because being denied for a card will look bad.</p></div>		</li>
