			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily .. sperm are scarce within the males .. kind of a side effect if you will. Females do carry eggs &amp; can give birth but its (if i remember correctly -- its been a minute) like a 30% chance to get preggo &amp; if they do .. its a half/half chance their lil one will have ds as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may happen in what we call here disabled workshops between people with different disabilities. Not sure what the term in the US is but in Germany these are workshops/manufacturers who mainly employ disabled people. My neighbours twins work in one and she put them both on the pill before that for exactly that reason. Mentally disabled people get romantic feelings too but may not fully grasp the consequences of their actions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and maybe.</p>
<p>Fertility is pretty low for people with downs, only about 20% for women - for a while it was suspected that it was impossible (combination of isolation within the family and stigma kept it quiet). Males with downs have even lower fertility.</p>
<p>The chances of the baby having downs is quite high - about <a href="http://cdss.ca/down-syndrome-answers/can-people-with-down-syndrome-have-a-baby/" target="_blank">35-50%</a>. It would still be possible for a downs parent to produce a non-downs child though.</p></div>		</li>
