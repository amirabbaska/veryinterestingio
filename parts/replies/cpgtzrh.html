			<div class="markdown"><p>I bet if you devote a few minutes a day to doing it, you will be able to do it longer. I can go for about 15 seconds at a time like the other guy, but with 5 seconds rest, can do it again repeatedly. After a few minutes, I can only last 3 or 4 seconds per.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you basically shake the inside of your ear to create enough &quot;background&quot; noise so you can't hear anything??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. It's voluntary control of the tensor tympani muscle. You tense the muscle. You can hear something similar if you press your knuckle to your ear and tighten your fist. You'll hear a rumbling noise very similar to what we can do at will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rumbling does not cut off external noises completely but it definitely attenuates them, and that's the important thing.  High decibel levels are what eventually kills one's hearing.  Volitional (anticipatory) control over the attenuation is surely more effective than an involuntary response to excessive loudness.</p></div>		</li>
