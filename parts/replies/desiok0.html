			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, kindof. There was a guy named Lutz Heck who was trying to do that in Germany around that time, and since Hitler had a weird passion for both genetic experimentation and bringing back things from German prehistory, he was a big fan. He even let Heck raid the Warsaw Zoo to steal animals to take back to Germany for breeding programs.</p>
<p>Interestingly, now the Dutch and some others are trying to do it. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs#Breeding_of_aurochs-like_cattle" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurochs#Breeding_of_aurochs-like_cattle</a> But basically they're just making cows that look like aurochs, not actually recreating auroch DNA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a related non sequitor the movie Beasts of the Southern Wild calls the beats aurochs but uses dressed up pigs. That always bothered me, like no one would notice or something. Coincidentally is have an intern who worked on that movie, I think I'll make this her problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very minor nitpicks: It's &quot;aurochs&quot;, not &quot;auroch&quot;, and &quot;bison&quot; rather than &quot;buffalo&quot;. </p>
<p>Also worth noting that aurochs were <em>formidable</em> creatures, able to defend themselves against wolf packs and the like. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like that. I remember in an American history class we learned that early colonists often lost their sheep and goats and such to predators (imagine a time when the East Coast was sheer primeval wilderness), but they had better luck raising pigs, which were ornery enough to defend themselves against wolves.</p></div>		</li>
