			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah there wouldn't be nectar over glaciers and rock at the highest regions, but above the treeline is actually pretty good bee habitat because there are a lot of small alpine flowering plants.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: Everest is neither the highest or tallest mountain on Earth. It is the highest altitude but the highest point on Earth is actually the peak of Mt Chimborazo in Equador, due to the Earth not being round. The tallest exposed mountain is Denali in Alaska and the tallest overall is Mauna Kea in Hawaii, though most of it is under water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just for extra clarification: it basically means it has the largest base to peak height. Denali has a base to peak height of 17,000-19,000 feet. Everest has a base to peak height of 12,000 to 15,000 feet for comparison.</p></div>		</li>
