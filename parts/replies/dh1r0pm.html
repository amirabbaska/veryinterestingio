			<div class="markdown"><p>But why do banks not take into consideration how much you already pay in rent? As a student I have to pay Â£5k a year minimum in my city for basic rent not necessarily including any bills, yet I won't be able to get a mortgage for years despite having a good 15% deposit saved up. Haven't got a job for after graduation but separate to my emergency fund and deposit I have enough to pay a full years rent for the house I've signed for - wouldn't this money be better off on a mortgage from both mine and the banks point of view rather than lining the pockets of a millionaire landlord? Or is there just some massive conspiracy to make it impossible to buy so my generation become the first to rent their whole lives? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Most mainstream lenders only leave a soft footprint. </p></div>		</li>
