			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're saying isn't wrong, but it's not the driver for door swings. It usually has to do with doors not swinging into the path of egress. As the Mech engineer you're not the one laying out door swings, so can't speak to all the decisions involves. While what you're describing is one reason for door swing decisions, there are many other reasons, such as handicap accessibility codes and egress requirements, that are more critical.</p></div>		</li>
