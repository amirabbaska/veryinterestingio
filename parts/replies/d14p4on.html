			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like actual vomiting is different than the OP's question which is about feeling sick. I would say that of the times I feel sick, I probably only vomit about 1 in 50 times, perhaps even less. I've probably only vomited in adult life about 10 or so times (I'm in my 30s). All the times when I feel sick but don't puke I eventually just feel better after a certain amount of time. So whilst I can understand the need to vomit to rid the body of a poison, the fact that feeling sick only leads to vomiting in a small number of cases means that an answer which pertains only to vomiting doesn't quite answer the OP's question. /u/dankerino's answer which talks about the physical causes of the feeling are a bit closer to the mark for me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously. I'm 9 months pregnant and have hyperemesis. I lost about 7 or 8 lbs in just a few days from vomiting so much. I also puke from migraines too. I'd love to trade places with that guy! </p>
<p>I hope whatever you're dealing with gets better though :( you've probably tried everything already, but bananas are decent - they contain a lot of vitamin B which helps to quell nausea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sucks. Sorry to hear about whatever medical issue you suffer from. I am really lucky yeah, I hate puking so much on the rare occasion it happens. It's so traumatic for the body that I find it odd that it's a go-to strategy for our central nervous system. Sure most of the time you don't feel sick anymore, but it's a pretty big price. Personally I prefer feeling sick for a little while whilst that stuff gets sorted out internally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate vomiting. I know it's better to get it over with, but I would rather will myself not to throw up, and feel sick to my stomach all day than to vomit and get it over with. Vomiting feels like dying and I've only done it a few times my entire life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No - you're quite right! Actually, vomiting involves 6 separate steps which are all co-ordinated by your brain which has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_postrema" target="_blank">special</a> area dedicated to control vomiting.</p>
<p>The steps involved are:</p>
<p>1) Increased saliva flow to protect your teeth</p>
<p>2) Take a deep breath (stops you breathing in vomit)</p>
<p>3) Your digestive process starts to operate in the opposite direction: food moves from your duodenum into your stomach</p>
<p>4) Your abdominal muscles contract. Almost always, your stomach doesn't contract - contrary to popular belief</p>
<p>5) You retch</p>
<p>6) You start sweating and have an increased heart rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough, if I brush off the saliva coating, especially from the roof of my mouth, the urge to vomit disappears. Only for when it's not something legit though, like if I accidentally brush too far back on my tongue and activate my gag reflex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had my migraine doc explain it by saying basically the brain is going through some weird major trauma during a migraine.  The brain senses said weird major trauma happening, so it tells the stomach to empty itself. This way the digestive system isn't taking up resources/bloodflow as much.  The brain is basically freeing up resources for itself to use to deal with the weird trauma that's happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain-induced nausea. Migraines regularly breach that threshold, though they aren't the only things that can. Breaking a bone, getting a bone contusion, suffering a severe burn, getting hit really hard in the balls, these all can cause people to vomit from the pain. Any severe amount of pain can cause this.</p>
<p>Chronic migraine sufferer myself, and I have to say, having broken a bone and had a bone contusion, I've had migraines that hurt way worse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article, I'll see if I can find it, that it's the same with motion sickness. Your brain and inner ear are having a conversation, except the message your inner ear is conveying to the brain is that you've been poisoned and you need to get the poison out of your body immediately... so you puke. But puking doesn't relieve anything because you're not being poisoned, after all. So you just keep feeling sick until your balance and inner ear get back to normal. I wonder if the migraine factors into that, since they put you off balance as well, don't they?</p></div>		</li>
