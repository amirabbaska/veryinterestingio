			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't believe I have something in common with you. I keep this on my desk as a paper weight. My friend worked for a plastics company who sold it. I believe it was termed &quot;bullet resistant&quot; (don't remember what it was called), not bullet proof. We took about 6 of these and shot them up with an SKS (7.62 x 39). Long story short, every round we shot went through the glass (although the glass did change the trajectory of the bullet drastically) except when we lined all 6 up and shot through them at once. The bullet you see is the 6th glass that stopped it.</p>

<p>Rifle rounds will go right through brick walls, trees and sandbags unless the layer is thick enough - and what you'd think is thick enough is actually about two-three times too thin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless your definition is &quot;thick enough&quot; is absurdly small, sandbags absolutely stop rifle rounds. It only takes a couple inches of sand. Sand acts exactly like Adam was describing in that it disperses the energy out widely. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope, you got it in one.</p>
<p>(What you want is the old WW2/Korea black tip. Hardened steel core armor-piercing. Surprisingly, it has a BATFE waiver that it legally isn't. California may have a problem with it locally.)</p></div>		</li>
