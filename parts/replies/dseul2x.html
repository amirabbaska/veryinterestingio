			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to what Sell200 said, size is very important too. The larger the animal, the larger the surface area to exhaust heat from. More importantly the larger the internal area of a creature, causing more heat to be made with less area to expel it.</p>
<p>I understand this isn't me explaining and i'm sorry for that, the video can explain far better than I.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fahrenheit selected 96 as human normal temp, and zero was the lowest temperature he could produce using brine at the time. 96 because he was dividing top from bottom in intervals of 12 rather than 10. Neither was all that scientific for a beginning of scientific measurement. Later experiments found the freezing point of pure water to be 32 on his scale and usual human temp closer to 98.6</p></div>		</li>
