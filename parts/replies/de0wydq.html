Why no mood effect is seen for 3-6 weeks is an active area of investigation.  <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/why-do-antidepressants-take-so-long-to-work/" target="_blank">Why Do Antidepressants Take So Long to Work?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>antidepressants stop the process of serotonin transporters sucking up released serotonin fairly quickly, so researchers donâ€™t understand why it takes weeks for the medications to take effect... Scientists believe the behavioral effects of antidepressants may be due to other changes that occur as a reaction to the changed serotonin levels.</p>
