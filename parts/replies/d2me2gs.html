			<div class="markdown"><p>I ended up doing a project on the feasibility of using genetic engineering to fight Panama Disease, a pathogenic strain of Fusarium Oxysporum. It turns out that, because of the way bananas are grown (from cuttings, monoculture) if you did manage to create a single Banana plant with the necessary resistance, it would be fairly easy to use that single plan as the parent of a new banana cultivar.</p>
<p>In addition, fusarial wilt affects such a wide range of agricultural plants that you have a ton of sources of genetic resistance. I, for instance, found a paper by a group of scientists who had created a transgenic tomato using wild tomato genes. This gene could presumably be used to make other plants resistant to fusarial wilt.</p>
<p>Because I have no relevant knowledge in the feild of genetic engineering or the biology of agricultural, please excuse any mistakes. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding resistance would be better if multiple R (resistance) genes are introduced. A pathogen must be recessive for their Av(avirulence) gene that matches with an R gene in order to infect. When you add only one R gene, you force pathogen evolution and a new race of pathogen that overcomes resistance evolves. </p>
<p>A pathogen must unlock all doors to enter, so it becomes clear that adding multiple R genes (it is called pyramiding) will decrease the odds that any one pathogen will be recessive for multiple genes. Kind of a 2^x type of situation, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>Resistance can be brought in from other bananas, so transgenes are unnecessary here. </p>
<p>This is called vertical resistance and is a function of the hypersensitive response in plants (basically cell death when a pathogen tries to infect). </p>
<p>It is better to breed for horizontal resistance. Basically breed plants in a pathogen rich environment and choose the ones that show very little infection, but not no infection. This preserves the current pathogen while avoiding losses. </p>
<p>Of course, plant breeding is art with biology, so there is an example of transgene introduction: papaya has a problem with a virus called papaya ringspot virus. Basically, the breeder incorporated a surface protein from papaya ringspot virus into papaya. It doesn't really do anything other than tricking the virus. The virus does not recognize papaya as other than itself (the virus, that is) and fails to infect. Basically all of the papayas grown commercially in Hawaii have this trait. </p>
<p>TL;Dr plant breeding for resistance is complicated, but transgenes are unnecessary in this case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to quantify the taste, but it was definitely stronger-flavored.  I'd say there were more &quot;high notes&quot; and the taste was cleaner.  Seems I remember the flesh being a little yellower but that could just be the yellowing of a 60 year old memory. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That said, I like green bananas anyway, so what do I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a technological standpoint, this should absolutely be doable.  From an economic standpoint, it's a little more difficult.  Not because they wouldn't be just as cost effective, but because the tinfoil hat types hear &quot;Transgenic&quot; and start whooping like baboons.  </p>
<p>It always baffles me that people have an issue with GMO products when we've been doing the same thing since agriculture was invented, just by a different, less predictable, less controllable mechanism. </p></div>		</li>
