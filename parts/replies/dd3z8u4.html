			<div class="markdown"><p>Right idea, terrible analogy.</p>
<p>Let me take a try at it.</p>
<p>Suppose you're standing on a frictionless platform that allows you to slide easily. Your friend throws a ball to you, and you catch it. Now you've absorbed the momentum of that ball and you're moving a bit.</p>
<p>But you can move <em>more</em> if you throw that ball back to your friend, since the equal and opposite reaction of throwing it will be to add the ball's momentum to your momentum <em>again</em>, doubling your speed.</p>
<p>A black solar sail would catch the 'balls' (photons), but a reflective sail catches them and instantly throws them back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the situation you describe though, you are expending energy to throw the ball back, which is giving you the extra propulsion. How is the sail 'throwing it back,' i.e. where is the extra energy coming from? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not extra energy, the photons are bouncing back using their original energy. An improved analogy would have the person on the frictionless platform hold up a board to bounce the ball back, rather than throwing it back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of catching it, imagine he has two paddles.. one of them has, say, Velcro, the other is just wood.</p>
<p>If you tried the experiment twice, once to each paddle, you'd find you move more when it hits the wood.</p>
<p>The Velcro would transfer some of the balls momentum to the paddle as it's &quot;trying&quot; to bounce away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The photon's energy is a function of its wavelength. The solar sail takes energy from the reflected photon, so the reflected photons must be redshifted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does its wavelength go up after being reflected? Is a mirror slightly color shifted (or not because it doesn't move?)? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I presume there would be a slight color change from the doppler effect, if the mirror was already moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is a &quot;frictionless platform&quot; a relatable analogy to a layperson? One of the things Feynman always did was to describe things in such a way they were immediately relatable by the average person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course the sail is absorbing energy, otherwise how will the kinetic energy of the ship increase? The outgoing photon has a lower frequency than the incoming photon and the difference goes into the kinetic energy of the ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is right.  There is always a shift in wavelength when light reflects off of a moving surface (more precisely a movable surface), but it is typically a very very small shift unless the object is moving near the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;light energy&quot; of a photon is the same thing as the magnitude of its momentum; you can't separate those two things. Photons have no rest mass, all of their energy is kinetic energy. </p>
<p>The only independent variable quantities of a photon that you can measure are frequency, direction of motion, and spin direction.  The momentum is a vector that incorporates the frequency and the motion direction; the energy is just the frequency.  (The spin direction doesn't matter to this discussion)</p></div>		</li>
