<p>This is not to say it's a bad deal, but 30 years from now, I expect Clark county will need to tear down this stadium and build another one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, thats not really true for newer stadiums.</p>
<p>A lot of the older stadiums didn't age well because they were cheaply built outdoor stadiums that were poorly maintained. </p>
<p>But if you look at the stadiums currently in use in the NBA - most are about 20 to 25 years old and have held up extremely well.  They're in good condition because they were well built indoor stadiums, and the owners have actually taken upkeep seriously.</p>
<p>The new Raider's stadium is an modern indoor stadium and there's no reason to think that it won't last for far more than 30 years if its well maintained. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention there are only a small number of football games per season. In addition to the college games there are lots of other events that will happen there especially since Vegas is already a destination for national music tours and other large events. </p></div>		</li>
