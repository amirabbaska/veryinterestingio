			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem for most people is that logs are taught mostly in high school algebra.  Who really paid attention in high school?  I didn't, I had to relearn these things again a couple years later, and promptly forgot how to do log math again (though the basic concept remains).</p>
<p>Log scales are also used in nuclear engineering.</p>
<p>When a reactor is operating we use a linear scale to go from 1% power to 100%. (Doesn't matter if it's a 1MW or 200MW)  But during the process of startup, there's a lot of stuff happening at much lower levels.  Levels that are so low and cover such a large range that they're not visible on a 1-100 scale.  The scale ends at 1, but starts at/below 1x10^-8.  Under these circumstances, you can either make a lot of linear gauges that get cut in/out as power goes off scale (time consuming and easy to mess up), or make a linear scale.</p>
<p>On a linear scale, the distance from 10 to 20 is the same as the distance from 90-100.  On a log scale, .1-1 is the same distance as 1-10, and 10-100, 100-1000.... (Each division is called a decade by the way)  When power is rising in those extremely low levels of power, we measure how fast it's rising by timing how fast it goes between those decades.  (1 decade per minute)  </p>
<p>Here's a totally unrelated example of a log scale, useful in comparing sizes of an atom and a planet...  <a href="https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/ast110_06/sosat/sizes.png" target="_blank">https://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~barnes/ast110_06/sosat/sizes.png</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Each step on the Richter scale actually corresponds to a √1000≈31.6 times increase in energy. It's a 10 times increase in amplitude, but that tends to involve more energy. Nowadays the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale" target="_blank">moment magnitude scale</a> which is directly based on energy (using √1000) is used for bigger quakes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>7 is neutral pH (room temp water).  Each integer you go down becomes ten times more acidic so pH 6 is 10X more acidic, pH 5 is 100X more acidic than water. Other direction for bases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pH is (roughly) equal  to - log [H3O+]. 7 is neutral as it is the pH at which the concentration of the hydronium (H3O+)  ions and hydroxide (OH-) ions are equivalent in a solution, thus the solution will act as neither an acid or a base; when one ion acts as a base there is always an equivalent acidic ion to counter it and vice versa. in water, the concentration at which this equilibrium occurs is when [OH-] = [H3O+] = 1e-7, thus pH = 7= -log(1e-7). pH can range beyond both 0 and 14</p></div>		</li>
