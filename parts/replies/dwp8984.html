			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the whole story, training is important, but the everyone is missing what ability is being trained.</p>
<p>Neural networks are relational and operate on whole snapshots of data (such as a picture) to produce results based on their own self-generated weights. Humans don't actually do anything like this.  </p>
<p>What sets humans apart from computers and most every other animal is causal inference. Literally, the ability to infer a cause or predict for a specific event without directly experiencing it. Every animal has this ability to some extent, but us humies are on a completely different level. This is what makes people, people. This is what lets us learn and share information better than any other animal.</p>
<p>When a neural network is fed a screenshot, it processes the literal information from the screenshot and compares it to memory. It digests every pixel and compares it to memories of billions of other pixels based on their relationships to other pixels past and present. This is not who people do. Our working memory is literally incapable of this. </p>
<p>So human's say fuck it, I can build my own picture with blackjack and hookers. We store the identified concepts and then effectively rebuild them into a working model out of pre-fab parts borrowed from the sensory system. Human's aren't trained by the environment directly, its our greatest strength that we aren't. </p>
<p>Want proof? <a href="https://www.sideshowtoy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/alien-3-dog-alien-maquette-coolprops-feature-903227-1.jpg" target="_blank">What does the top of the alien's head feel like?</a> I bet you had an answer despite never having actually touched it before. Humans don't do visual processing, we scrape an image quickly and then do the actual processing and reasoning on our internally constructed sensory model. You train sensory information to have more prefab parts and data to build more complete models for prediction out of.</p>
<p>In short, neural networks train by finding relationships between concrete instances of pre-existing data, every single literal pixel of the literal image for example.</p>
<p>Humans parse the original concrete data into abstract concepts which are effectively bundles of pre-fab instructions for sensory organs, and effectively run those instructions through those organs as if they were actual sensory information coming into your brain that you were directly experiencing to construct an internal sensory model that can then be controlled and manipulated by extrapolating from known experiences. Effectively, ever item in your memory is actually just you in a costume. </p>
<p>Imagine the Alien again, have it raise its arm, now have it run up a wall. I bet you felt that movement a little if you wanted to. That is how your mind is constructing that imagine of the alien running, by running instructions through your sensory systems to return pre-existing sensory data to fill in missing parts.  Because to your brain, that Alien is just you. Its running instructions through your proprioception sensory system as if you were literally making those movements to return existing sensory information of what that movement feels like to build that model. </p>
<p>If you want more directly experiential proof on the sensory instructional nature of human thought, try to imagine your self as a spider, imagine running, and tell me if you can feel the limbs move the same way you did for the alien. Your proprioception senses literally cannot return that information, there is no sensory data on eight legged running to return even if instructed to do so. You can imagine the hairy legs, the feel of a spider on you, you imagine the literal feeling of a spider's leg in your hand, but I bet you can't model the feeling of movement or motion unlike the alien.</p>
<p>Well, this became long as shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agreed with (and was blow away by) all of your points and examples except for the last one about the spider. I honestly perceived no difference in imagined sensation between the alien running and the spider. The spider called forth memories of crawling around on my feet and palms crab-walk style, with heavy involvement of my arms. Perhaps that also speaks to the human brains ability to infer amd extrapolate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, that is definetly a viable response, and its still demonstrates that our internal models are still just tied to what our senses are able to reconstruct.</p>
<p>Its also a good example of what I was saying about people being trained by collecting that sensory information, you had access to some parts to fit the mental model that I did not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost certainly you didn't imagine all eight legs moving.
I think you imagined yourself crawling on fours, and if you had to imagine the other four, you shifted to them in your mind.<br />
(that's the only way I can imagine it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats not true; A trained network is easy better of detecting specific objects in images than humans are. And we do can copy / multiply a trained network without problems and also put it into hardware if we wish.</p>
<p>The imagine processing of our brain works quite similliar on how neural networks work. There are studies about this.</p>
<p>It is true, that we do lay over additional layer onto it to give meaning to objects and create connections with actions etc. but this doesn't mean that those trained networks are doing something different.</p>
<p>Those also do not compare every pixel with billions of other pixels. There are multiply layer who predict different things and at the end it gets refined and refined.</p>
<p>And i don't get at all your &quot;ever item in your memory is actually just you in a costume&quot;. What? Our brain has objects. There things in our brain like a tree. This object is based on many neurons which trigger specific attributes of a tree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lets work through this,</p>
<p>Firstly, a neural network does image processing by parsing every pixel of an image, the pixel information is then passed through a series of micro-tuned weights in several layers which then correlate to a series of outputs, hopefully reaching an activation point for some useful output. </p>
<p>In contrast, image processing in humans is a guided and reflexive process. What information from the visual field is parsed is guided by attention, and our perception of items is reflexive based on previous experience. What we see is just a much sensory memory as current information. Read up on perceptual constancy for example.</p>
<p>This highlights the next big difference and what I mean by objects being 'you in a costume.' Consciousness is a top down process constructed from stored sensory information. Everything you think is built from pieces of pre-existing sensory information.</p>
<p>Every object stored in your brain is defined in sensory data, and new objects manipulated in consciouness are extrapolated based on existing sensory data. More specifically they are defined in instructions for sensory organs.</p>
<p>When you recall the cat object, you are recalling a series of instructions for your senses to replicate, the cat walking around in your head is built from arbitrary parts that match spec. Its not objective cat information, its just you and your senses. You have effectively just wrapped your senses in a cat costume and our using your sensory memories to model a fake cat. </p>
<p>You have no sensory information of what it feels like to be a cat and be in its body, but I bet if you try, you can feel that cat in your head arch its back forward and streeeetch. Because in order to simulate that cat moving, your brain is using your sensory organs and memories. That cat is you in a costume.</p>
<p>Human consciousness doesnt parse reality as it happens from sensory data, it scrapes as much as it thinks is important based off attention and then internally rebuilds a representation of reality filled in with pre-existing sensory information to do the actual decision making with.</p>
<p>Finally, as to better, it depends on what you mean by better. Feed a sentence into a neural network design to parsed pictures and see what happens. But if I tell you that I left the key under the blue welcome mat outside my door, you have already reconstructed, parsed and stored the useful visual information and now as you feel yourself bending down, watching the welcome mat grow larger in your visom to grab the key, you have already been able to use pre-existing sensory information causally infer the outcome of this entirely visual and physical scene you have literally no original physical or visual data for.</p>
<p>You just demonstrated the complete and utter dominance of human capability to model and parse reality.   Congrats.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's something that always bothered me about the Turing test. It seems for the Turing test to be useful, the computer being tested would need the equivalent input history as the human it is being pitted against. If you had a computer with 30 years of input data to pull from, it may do well against an adult. Likewise a regular computer might do well against a toddler. </p></div>		</li>
