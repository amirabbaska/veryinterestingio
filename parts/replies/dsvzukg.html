			<div class="markdown"><p>Surgery, IVs, and other acts including plain old injury and infection can introduce gas into the circulatory system. The body has evolved to deal with a certain amount of “air” mixed in with blood simply because it usually ends up going to the lungs where it will slowly dissolve away. Lungs also end up being where most foreign bodies traveling in the circulatory system end up, and in many cases those will fester and you will end up coughing them up. Parasites such as hookworm even take advantage of this fact and have co-evolved with us and coughing them up is part of their lifecycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. All these techniques get MOST of the air out, but not all. And people hear about how a 1 cc bubble can cause death... that's because of where the air is introduced. A shot to the carotid will absolutely do it, but like you said, air introduced in other areas will essentially dissolve.</p></div>		</li>

<p>could you please explain how that works ? How does the body &quot;direct&quot; foreign bodies to the lungs?</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are, we just redefine what &quot;in&quot; the patient is temporarily.</p>
<p>The organ to be transplanted is &quot;out&quot; of the patient until we open up their circulatory system &amp; connect the replacement organ, at which point it becomes part of the system &amp; thus blood is kept in the system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Air in the bloodstream isn't that deadly in volumes you see in hospitals. I have had a few intravenous connections and early on I raised concerns about the bubbles in the tubes. Reality is it would probably take about 100x the small bubbles you see in your intravenous drips to do any real damage. As in, probably the entire tube from the drip to your arm would need to be air before you start worrying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is unlikely because even veins have a positive pressure relative to atmospheric pressure, which means that blood would come out rather than air going in (if they weren't clamped). Also, as others have said, air bubbles smaller than a certain size are unlikely to cause problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They will have absolutely have a pocket of air in them. This is not a closed system being discussed, and air will sneak in.</p>
<p>The real answer is: it doesn't matter. Air from the veins go to the lungs, where air is dissolved. Air introduced to in the arteries anywhere south of the neck are far enough where it will dissolve before reaching the brain.</p></div>		</li>
