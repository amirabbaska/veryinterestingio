			<div class="markdown"><p>The specific reason for this is actually more nuanced - someone I know who worked for Health Canada broke down the regulation for me once. Basically, things that 'naturally' had caffeine in them could have more caffeine added - so colas, which had flavoring from the slightly caffeinated kola nut could have /more/ caffeine in them, but you couldn't add it to other completely decaf soft drinks without it being classified as an energy drink (which have different regulations)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I, for one, like the new caffeinated Mountain Dew better. Before the regulation was lifted, they also had Mountain Dew Energy (later renamed &quot;Dew Fuel&quot;) that I always preferred.</p></div>		</li>
