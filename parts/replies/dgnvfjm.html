			<div class="markdown"><p>It happened to me, too, right after I imagined the last time it had happened to me, which I was doing because your writing was describing the wandering effect. I'm going to try again, will edit with result. I wonder if this can happen while writing as well...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the simplest way to ensure this happened be to have people fill out questionnaires about what they found the most dull, boring, impossible to enjoy paying attention to, then have them engage with an example of it actively, perhaps with the requirement they answer a test on it after the session ended, while instructing them to ensure they keep their phones off, but on the table constantly reminding them of what they may enjoy doing more?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I zoned when OP said 'folks', going down a path about the rarity of that word being used to describe other scientists, researchers, critics, etc and how the meaning had changed and so on. Then I was hit the bottom, your comment was like the subconscious reality checks in Inception haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I bet you could observe this by imaging someone's brain as they learn a simple repetitive task (e.g. knitting or weaving).  At first you have to direct everything because the task is unfamiliar but pretty quickly you can 'switch over' to thinking about other stuff.</p></div>		</li>
