			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes a lot of sense actually, thanks for the reply! So I guess as a follow up question, if you could put enough power behind a radio wave (or some kind of similar super low frequency), could you evoke some kind of (possibly destructive) response?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It is possible for sound to kill. Some of the loudest sounds in the world come from rocket launches and there is a considerable amount of design that goes into preventing the rocket from shaking itself apart or killing the astronauts. Thankfully it's better to use sound to heal such as ultrasound that doctors use to diagnose illness, and other ultrasound they can use to break up gall and kidney stones. If the ultrasound was misapplied it could be dangerous but then again a pen misapplied to your nose could also be dangerous. :) It's all about context. </p>
<p>Radio waves can also kill through heat such as a microwave oven which was invented when a radar tech noticed a melted candybar in his pocket while doing some testing. </p></div>		</li>
