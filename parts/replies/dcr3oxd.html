			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, if this is the type of thing you're interested in, have I got a treat for you! There's a book called &quot;At Home&quot;, by Bill Bryson. In this book, he discusses the evolution of each individual room in the modern house, but with his typical humor and meanderings into various historical happenings and notable historic characters. Incredibly fun and interesting read, despite the subject matter appearing boring on the surface. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love Bill Bryson. He is <em>so</em> funny and his writing is very accessible. He really can spin the mundane into interesting. I especially love his travelogues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a big reason playgrounds took off in the U.S. is because of the invention of cars. Before that, playing in the street was largely fine but once cars came on the scene (and early drivers were terrible drivers) it was incredibly dangerous to have every child in a city playing in the street and they needed somewhere else to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was actually a lot of debate about this. For a while the predominate thinking was that cars were what needed to stay off the streets in cities -- not children.</p>
<p>Took great effort (mainly by motoring interests) over decades to shift the thinking. And creating safe spaces for children was part of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kinda blowing my mind. Developing countries seldom have playgrounds unless it's in a school or upper class neighborhoods. Even I as a kid played on the streets running around and playing tag.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my mother was doing her genealogy research, she found that the sibling of one of my ancestors was killed as a child by running backwards into the street and being run over by a carriage. </p>
<p>So it wasn't <em>completely</em> safe before cars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The first playground was built in Manchester, England</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a Mancunian, this was interesting news to me.</p>
<p>I've tried to find the source of this. In fact, I've found that in fact Wikipedia is citing websites that cite each other and none of them seem accurate.</p>
<p>I did some digging around and can find photographic evidence - and from that I know where to find the primary source documentation - of swings and play equipment in a Manchester park <a href="http://sportcity-manchester.com/timeline-phillips-park/" target="_blank">as early as 1847</a>, and even that photo was taken as a &quot;relocation&quot;, suggesting that the equipment was somewhere else before then.</p>
<p>That of course also predates the German &quot;invention&quot; of playgrounds.</p>
<p>It seems to me we've unwittingly stumbled into a bit of a mystery that the Internet has so far not actually got a correct answer for. If we kept digging, we could rewrite the history of the playground. Shame I've got a bit on this week. Maybe one to get /r/AskHistorians working on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting!  Although, I suspect that &quot;danger from being hit by passing cars&quot; should have said, &quot;danger from being hit by passing <em>carts</em>&quot;, given the times they're talking about (1848 + 39 = 1887), whereas the first commercial car <a href="http://www.automostory.com/first-american-car.htm" target="_blank">according to this site</a> started around 1895.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Might be regional dialect, then. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse-drawn_vehicle" target="_blank">According to this site</a>, which has a ton of names for horse-drawn conveyances, &quot;car&quot; is not among them, although &quot;cart&quot; is.  Won't argue it, though.</p></div>		</li>
