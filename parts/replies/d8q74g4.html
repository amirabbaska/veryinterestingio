<p>Kids, take care of your ears - they are for more than just listening and I can tell you there is nothing worse than spending day after day after day puking into the bog because your ear is fucked up and making you feel travel sick. Shit, just feeling travel sick for weeks at a time is grim.</p></div>		</li>

<p>lift up your brain</p>

<p>Ya know, this struck me. I'm never the kind of person to say no to things. Generally not afraid of much. I can't think of many things that would just be too much for me.</p>
<p>I've already had a craniotomy. The thought of someone going back in there and lifting my literal brain up just..I couldn't do it. Nope. Not for me. I keep a lot of important stuff in there.</p></div>		</li>
