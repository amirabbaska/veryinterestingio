<p>Yes. Although they take care to avoid potential dangers like reefs, wrecks or uneven land.  There isn't much in the sea to worry about other than man-made activities. (although Sharks like to munch on the cables sometimes)</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Special casings, rubber(?) sort of, partly. All casings are &quot;special&quot; but it's not just rubber.</p>
<p>Deep sea cables are thinner than shallow and they are all generally wrapped in wire mesh and non-permeable protective coatings, but it's not like they are bomb proof or anything.</p>
<p>I cannot remember the show name but it went into depth on the coating/wrapping. It seemed like it was less than it &quot;should&quot; be but then explained how there is not much to worry about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In shallow water they will bury them with a trench.  But out on the sea floor they're just sitting there. </p>
<p>These days of course the cables are fiber optic wrapped in steel cables and plastic coating, but the original ones were copper.</p></div>		</li>
