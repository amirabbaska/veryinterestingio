<p>having larger breasts indicates you have access to a stable food source </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how do large breasts coincide with food source, or how much someone eats in general? There are skinny people with large breasts and large people with very small breasts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution falls into the category of &quot;good enough&quot;. Most skinny women have small breasts, and most plump women have large breasts. So long as the indicator is right most of the time, that's plenty for natural selection to work with.</p>
<p>There's a specific term for natural selection &quot;failing&quot; by causing individuals (or the entire group) of a population to reproduce suboptimally, and it's called genetic load. In some cases, it's just the cost of the best phenotype available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Body fat indicates stable access to a food source. If a woman is in starvation she will not develop breasts. Note we are talking about evolutionary signs for sufficient food, which means we are comparing starving and not starving. We are not comparing people who are skinny to those who are fat. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Most of our infatuation is socially developed and due to a myriad of social factors including how taboo sex is or is not</p>

<p>As far as we know breasts have been revered in all societies at all times of history. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=indian+boob+statue&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=901&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz9vSu4N_RAhVMTCYKHfk8BCMQ_AUIBygC#tbm=isch&amp;q=greek+boob+statue&amp;imgrc=RU7x-VKDuPdfwM%3A" target="_blank">Greece</a>. <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/eb/87/7b/eb877ba2941ad8e1710351726b7ad295.jpg" target="_blank">India</a>. <a href="http://jiakpopcorn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/fondle_statue1.jpg" target="_blank">China</a>. <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/a4/79/06/a4790693d3bcfec2d3691146fa8d0381.jpg" target="_blank">Egypt</a>. Firm. Round. Full. Large. Symmetrical. The similarities across time and space are rather striking. This infatuation is independent of culture. It is almost entirely biological.</p>
<p>There is yet further utility to breasts: their symmetry can be easily judged, further indicating health. In fact, this is a hint to the arms race between large and small boobs. Lots going on with boobs.    </p></div>		</li>

<p>Again, I have to disagree. The men in those tribes will be picking mates based upon boobs among other factors. Men outside those tribes are not more or less interested in boobs. Boobs have always been and always will be a fascination. Our obsession with them is no more a social construction than Gravity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Finally a good answer. Maybe replace &quot;large&quot; with some other adjective, as it confuses people into thinking you claim the bigger the more attractive, which is obviously not true.</p>
<p>*I would also add that it is an indicator of estrogen levels. Women whose breasts are both big and symmetrical have higher estrogen levels.</p></div>		</li>
