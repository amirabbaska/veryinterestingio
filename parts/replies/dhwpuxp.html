			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Every time I say I don't like whiskey or rum or beer or whatever, everyone says &quot;you haven't tried this yet&quot; or &quot;you haven't properly put effort in to trying, you're just being negative from the get-go!&quot;</p>
<p>I've had it, and had it to my heart's content. I have no interest in getting an education in it, and haven't liked it so far, so why am I going to force myself into an education or to the point that it becomes palatable and maybe even desirable?</p>
<p>I have no intention of getting to that point, so why try? (Smoke weed every day tho)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Urrh I don't like beer/alcohol either and each time I'm offered I pleasantly say no thank you I don't like the taste. Most of the time people are dumbfounded and bewildered by that statement so I more than often have to resort my second reason - My dad was an alcoholic, but nowadays it seems to be the only means to convince so I emotionally have to make light of that past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohem1, sorry to hear about your dad.  Yeah, I also have some negative associations with alcohol, but I'm fairly sure I wouldn't have been much of a drinker anyway.</p>
<p>One brother died at 23 in a car accident after a night of drinking.  Another brother was in the car with him, but luckily didn't have major injuries.  In a separate incident, I cleaned up the vomit of another older brother, and tried to comfort a friend who was afraid to go home to his dad after his first bout of drinking; I got peed on for my efforts (he wet his pants and I didn't realize until too late that the water I was kneeling in had come from him)</p>
<p>So I didn't have any romantic notion that alcohol was nothing but good times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fine, he's dead.</p>
<p>But to think a simple &quot;No&quot; isn't enough when asked. Alcopop is about the only thing balanced enough for me to drink, sweet with slight taste of sour or bitterness. My uncle and I do take a zip for dads birthday to commemorate the good times, even if they are few.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree it has more to do with repeated exposure than age.
I drank way more spirits than beer in my teens and as a result I still can't stand the taste of beer but totally fine with the hard stuff.</p></div>		</li>
