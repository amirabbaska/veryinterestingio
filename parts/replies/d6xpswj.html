<p>Do I have the right to put the shade up or down? Do they have the right to move it? Should it be discussed and agreed upon by both of us? I don't know!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Close for boarding. Open for pushback/taxi/takeoff. Close in flight when it's okay to use portable electronic devices. KEEP CLOSED IN CRUISE! Open sometime between when they tell you to incline your seat and when you hear the landing gear extend. Close at the gate just before you deplane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Budget airlines will reduce legroom to fit a couple more rows of seats compared to more expensive airlines, who charge more per seat. The seat placement is easily adjustable, while the window placement is not. </p></div>		</li>
