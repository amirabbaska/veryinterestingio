<p>Well, methane has 100x the heat trapping ability of CO2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have to be careful here - this number is meaningless without a time horizon.</p>
<p>Since methane has a typical half-life in our atmosphere of ~12 years, you can only talk about &quot;global warming potential&quot; of other greenhouse gases relative to CO2 in terms of a given time. For instance, over 100 years an equivalent mass of methane produces 34 times the warming that CO2 does; over 20 years, though, it produces 84 times the warming.</p></div>		</li>
