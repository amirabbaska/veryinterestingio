			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, true enough. They may not be dinosaurs, but badass wolf-lion-crocodile-things with dinosaurian teeth from the age of the dinosaurs are relevant in basically anything by being pure, concentrated badass.</p>
<p>In a similar vein- notosuchians actually had cousins called sebecids that lived <em>after</em> the dinosaurs died out, with similar ear adaptations. So there were giant possibly-eared dinosaur-headed land crocodiles with jaws a metre long that, up until about ten million years ago, were murdering <em>so many protollamas</em> for their dinner. Because prehistory has absolutely no sense of restraint when it comes to badass.</p>
<p>EDIT: Protollamas came from North America, not South America, so they were off the table for sebecids. So imagine them murdering sloths pretending to be cows and that would be much more realistic. Thanks to /u/DaddyCatALSO for pointing that out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you have gotten a lot of replies.  I haven't read them all but like a few guys said there isn't just one but many dino-mummies.  Colleges and museums have such a stockpile of unfinished skeletons, they will never be gotten to.  We do have imprints but I do believe certain delicate things may not have made it.  The closest thing we will ever see of a real dino is the genetically altered chickens that won't be anything but an embryo.  Everything is artistic interpretation.  If we use modern birds such as the bird of paradise or peacocks then I believe dino could have been beautifully adorned.  The main reason that dinos are depicted in the way they are is due to the naivety of the people who first found the bones and named them terrible lizards.  If we had known then that there was a modern analog then the whole history of depicting specimens would be in a much better place now than before.  Also so many fossils have been fucked up due to mishandling that we will never truly know if  some species are different or they make be at a different part of their life cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlike crocodiles, hippos don't rely on ambushing unsuspecting prey, and since they're also some of the biggest and nastiest creatures around being noticed isn't a huge concern.</p>
<p>If anything, having big fuck-off danger ears probably helps more than hurts: most animals know better than to mess with them, so advertising their presence makes sure everything  else can give them a wide berth.</p></div>		</li>
