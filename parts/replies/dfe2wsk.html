			<div class="markdown"><p>Crystal field theory can help to go some ways with explaining the structure that ligand complexes of transition metals form. This then all comes down to the geometry of the complex. For example the most common being octahedral, tetrahedral and square planar. In an octahedral complex there is the metal centre and 6 ligand bonding groups (there may However be fewer Ligands depending on the denticity of that ligand, I.e whether it is monodentate like a carbonyl ligand and only binds once or is bidentate like acetylacetonate &quot;acac&quot; where two of the regions on the ligand bind.<br />
With an octahedral complex there are two varieties of complexes that may form. A high spin and a low spin complex, the five orbitals I spoke about earlier in a d-block element then split further and are no longer classed as degenerate. 3 of the orbitals reduce slightly in energy to form t2g low spin orbitals and the other two form eg High spin orbitals. The electrons fill the orbitals obeying the aufbau principle so will not spin pair unless necessary but weird things begin when you get to d4 as it can either form a low spin or high spin complex. Coincidently this is where a lot of the magnetism we observe arises from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking of pure metals or alloys, I'm thinking the bonding is not the same, even though it is aso often octahedral, tetrahedral or cubic?
Like when iron arranges in FCC or BCC depending on the temperature, can we predict that with crystal field theory? </p>
<p>And really interesting with the magnetism and d4, feel free to tell more of your up for it!</p>
<p>Btw, what's your title and field of study? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is the realm of computational thermodynamics. You give a computer the elements that are present, the temperature, etc, and it will use quantum theory to predict the crystal structure(s). For simple metals, alloys, and intermetallics, the crystal structures are predictable, accurate, and well characterized. For many-element alloys, though, the calculations start to deviate from experimental observations. This is probably due to the approximations that are necessary to get these kinds of simulations to run in a reasonable amount of time. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>No. Detailed calculations are required to predict structure, which hinges on delicate energy effects. </p>
<p>For example, Mn has a unique structure, difficult to visualise, in which the atom have effectively two different oxidation states. Yet at quite modest temperatures the structure changes to more familiar forms.</p></div>		</li>
