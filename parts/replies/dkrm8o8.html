<p>I don't know anything anything about quantum algorithms, but in general they will probably deliver a result with cubits in states that are 1|0&gt; + 0|1&gt; (or 0|0&gt; + 1|1&gt; ) Which means you have a 100% probability of reading &quot;0&quot; (or 1 for the case in brackets).</p>

<p>Ideally they would, but generally they need only produce the right answer more often than an incorrect answer. The algorithm can then be run multiple times to observe the distribution of answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  I was under the impression that measuring phase happened often e.g. in Grover's algorithm.  On the other hand I don't even know what a complex number is so...<em>shrugs</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Measurements occur at the end of each iteration of an algorithm (as opposed to mid-way through), because you would lose the quantum-ness otherwise and be no better than classical computing. Measuring often is a matter of running the algorithm multiple times, as OP mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If for some reason a quantum algorithm results in a specific qubit superposition with specific a and b values, then to obtain those a an b values, you literally have to repeat your algorithm and use some statistics.</p>
