			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine the &quot;taste&quot; of blood comes primarily from the iron component in blood, something which wouldn't not be able to pass from the blood vessels in the lungs into your mouth. On the other hand, the molecules passed through an IV would be small enough to pass through the semi-permeable blood vessels up to your mouth, the same way oxygen is passed into the blood when you inhale. I'm just taking a guess here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you can taste blood if you exercise heavily (10 minutes at heart rate 95%). So while the red blood cells should not be able to leave your body the iron might be able to if you damage your blood cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not, since red blood cells are much bigger than medications, so they won't pass through the lung capillary.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not accurate. If red blood cells couldn't fit through capillaries in the lungs they couldn't pick up oxygen to deliver to the rest of the body. The smallest capillaries in the body are just wide enough for red blood cells to go through &quot;single file&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had that too! Although it was when they did a push through my picc line. It always surprised me how fast it was. Honestly it became a trigger or association for me. Eventually it became one of the worst parts of treatment because I associated it with nausea. I'm a couple years out now and doing well. I've gotten away with not many of the associations you hear about that cause people to feel sick. The taste of saline solution or that smell still does it every time though. Just thinking about it turns my stomach.</p>
<p>Keep up the good fight! Keep being visible and talking. Too often we don't have a voice even when it comes to discussions about cancer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say it depense on the drug.</p>
<p>I know around 10% of ethanol isn't metabolised and is expended through the lung, but OP's example sound unrealistic, a saline IV is isotonic with your blood so there shouldn't be anything that could get transported to the lungs, certainly not some salt water mist to taste it.</p>
<p>So I would say it sounds plausible, definitely isn't true for everything (I would choke up the saline example to power of suggestion) but could be for some drugs. </p></div>		</li>
