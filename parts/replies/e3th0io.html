			<div class="markdown"><p>By foundational I just mean that the idea forms the basis for the scientific method.</p>
<p>Falsifiable means that the statement is testable. If I say tall people earn more money, this is a statement which we can test and either prove false or fail to prove false. If I say tall people see the color red differently from shorter people, it is not falsifiable because we have no way of testing whether or not it's true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the statement &quot;the sun is going supernova&quot; be falsifiable? Because if the sun does go nova, nobody will exist to measure the result.</p>
<p>The same logic could be applied to the statement &quot;There exists life after death.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are developments that a star goes through before he goes super nova.<br />
Also, our sun isn't large enough to go super nova. It will become a red giant.<br />
