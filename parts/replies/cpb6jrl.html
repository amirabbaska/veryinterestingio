			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out that there's a huge difference between Japan-hidden, and hidden for the rest of the world.  </p>
<p>For most places, &quot;hidden&quot; means that you have to know a guy who knows a guy, who takes you a back alley somewhere and takes cash for your drugs.  In Japan, it means that you put up a bright red sign on your door to your shop telling the world you're up to illegal activity, so the cops know to ignore you.</p>
<p>When I lived in Osaka, I had a friend who reeked of pot.  Having heard about how strict Japan was about drug imports, I asked him where he got it.  He took me to this place in Amerikamura whose only sign on the door was a picture of a mushroom and a joint, and when we opened the door, there was a glass case going the length of the store, on one end having things like pot and magic mushrooms and the other end having literally meth and crack, with a guy sitting behind a cash register.  They took credit cards.  It kind of blew my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for sharing. Though I'm aware of places like that it isn't normal &quot;hidden&quot; in Japan (I've never actually seen one myself in Japan. I've seen plenty of pink salons and such but not a drug vendor. Most drug dealers I saw were at alleys and stations). You were straight up dealing with some bigger pockets of Yakuza.</p>
<p>Hidden in Japan definitely can mean like &quot;hidden&quot; anywhere else. Except like in all places in Asia, you might not like how deep the rabbit hole goes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Shinjuku I saw a neon sign for a brothel underneath a Shinto temple. A guy across the street trying to get people into his bar was trying to tell me in English I can get a blowjob underneath the temple. Matter of fact there were streets of them. Hidden indeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to be fair on that end, prostitution is quasi-legal and not really looked upon the same way as it is in the US.  IIRC, anything besides PIV sex is legal, which can lead to some interesting brothels.  My girlfriend was telling me the other day her friend in college used to go to a brothel where he would lie down naked, a girl would oil herself up and just rub up and down his body.  It's sex trade, but since it wasn't PIV, it was totally legal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Kitakyushu. A couple months ago the head of the Kudo-kai gave himself up, and the police response was massive. I'm assuming they were expecting a violent struggle for power, because they sent thousands of police from all over Japan. There were cop cars everywhere in Kokura, loaded with cops, just waiting for some shit to go down. </p>
<p>Now, that said, I've been living here for years and have never come across any violence or intimidation. They have a reputation of being ruthless, and even going after normal citizens, but if you stay out of that world, you won't come in contact with them. </p>
<p>However, 2-3 years ago they were going around stabbing people around Kokura for a bit. That was fucked up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is basically rule of thumb I give people anywhere. Just stay out of the worlds you don't want to be part of. </p>

<p>I thought it wasn't very smart for the government to ask the people to stand up against the most violent Yakuza by putting a sign on their businesses. It didn't unite the people against the Yakuza it just put a target on individuals for the Yakuza.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shop/restaurant/bar owners were pressured by a new law (I think?) to put up signs on their businesses that said something along the lines of &quot;No Yakuza allowed in this establishment.&quot;  Some of the businesses that did that became targeted by the Yakuza and then things got stabby. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can confirm it works the same way for the mafia in italy, at least for the first 3 points, either there are no solid evidences against bosses because minions will take the blame, the bosses live in hidden places and move things from the shadows or they just go to jail and keep doing whatever they want because widespread corruption allows them to basically own the prison itself, is less &quot;accepted&quot; that yakuza (you won't see celebrities openly showing up at the funeral of a boss) but it has more power in certain areas and can just ignore the law</p></div>		</li>
