			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a much better answer than saying simply &quot;things look better when when we look back on them&quot;</p>
<p>I can look back at positive events in my life and I probably remember them in a more positive light than they  happened.</p>
<p>However, I cannot remember anything that wasn't a positive that I know think was. Maybe I'm an exception, but if something sucked I remember that it sucked. I may not remember all the details of the situation, but I do know how it made me feel, and hat doesn't change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you aren't still feeling whatever feelings you were at the time. You're remembering feeling those feelings. Memory is a funny thing, and can be rewritten/overwritten subconsciously to suit a changing world view, or to preserve your own high opinion of yourself. </p></div>		</li>
