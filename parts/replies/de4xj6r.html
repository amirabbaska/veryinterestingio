			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, like I said, since there is no gravity, the bouncing will have more impact since there is nothing holding it down, like on earth.
Throwing it though? Most likely, you will. For a yo yo to go back down on earth, that would require gravity. A yo yo in space, well, it comes back, and instead of dropping it and letting gravity do the rest, you will have to throw it.
Space is violent I guess hehe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, we're removing the affect of everything, air, gravity, dust, etc.
Once terrestrial items are taken out, it's basically just physics, 3rd laws are the only thing at hand in space.</p></div>		</li>
