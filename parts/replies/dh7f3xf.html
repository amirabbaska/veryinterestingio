			<div class="markdown"><p>So cholera is a good example of a microbial infection. It is able to survive the stomach, and enter the intestine, where it binds to the epithelial layer (the top layer) of cells and then secretes the toxins, so whilst it indeed causes diarrhoea, it does so via infection. Because it's an infection, people which cholera are able to infect other people with cholera, which is why you hear about cholera outbreaks and such. Staphylococcus aureus is a good example of microbial intoxication. If staph. A enters the stomach, its killed because it isn't designed for it. It's toxins are stable enough to survive however. So you'll get sick, not because you have a whole bunch of active staph in your intestine like with cholera, but because their toxin has passed into your intestine and is able to cause damage anyway. The difference is that staph food poisoning isn't contagious because there aren't any microbes, only limited amounts of the toxin they secrete. </p></div>		</li>
