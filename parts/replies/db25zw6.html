			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the explanation, fire is a combination of two chemical reactions. The first chemical reaction breaks down the fuel. The second chemical reaction takes the broken down fuel and oxidizes it, or combines it with oxygen from the air. This second reaction releases enough heat to repeat both reactions and sustain a flame. </p>
<p>When you blow out a candle, you stop the second reaction, but the first one continues until it fully cools. </p>
<p>There are several types of fuel (coal among them I believe) where a fuel source is heated in the absence of oxygen to create readily burned compounds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I am not mistaken the breaking down of the molecule and the oxidation with oxygen is one step. A carbon carbon bond does not break without the carbon reacting with oxygen first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>When we blow out a candle, the temperature drops. Wax still on the candle can no longer combust. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This isn't correct.</strong> </p>
<p>The temperature drops, <strong>combustion</strong> of the wick <strong>continues</strong> but isn't complete, hence instead of transparent CO2, you see relatively larger reactive intermediates of combustion (black smoke). Although combustion continues, the energy required to continue combustion is greater than the energy released, hence the wick continues to cool and the smoking eventually stops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought combustion only existed when a flame begins, otherwise the candle wick is smoldering. I may be completely wrong in my understanding, I just always picture combustion at a campfire as the moment everything goes from smoke only to engulfed in flames within a fraction of a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently the definition (in chemistry at least) is as follows: rapid chemical combination of a substance with oxygen, involving the production of heat and light.</p>
<p>So fire is a symptom of, not the end all be all, of combustion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds a lot better - my assumption had always been that the smoke was the wick burning instead of the wax due to the wicking, fast enough to prevent the wick burning while the candle is lit, being reliant on the flame to wick fast enough. No reason, never really looked into it. I think incomplete combustion is all you need to explain it though.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrHnLXMTOWM&amp;list=PL0INsTTU1k2UCpOfRuMDR-wlvWkLan1_r" target="_blank">The Chemical History of the Candle playlist, produced by &quot;engineerguy&quot;</a></p>
<p>After watching those, I highly encourage watching his other videos.  He covers all sorts of engineering things at an understandable level, it is interesting, and he has a great personality.</p></div>		</li>
