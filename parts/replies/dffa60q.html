			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct. Coffee actually causes a small temporary spike in BG levels, so if anything the opposite is true; your body would need to produce more insulin to mitigate the BG increase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coffee is known to decrease the uptake of nutrients from food, as is tea, albeit not as much. Optimally, one should keep at least 30 min between eating a meal and drinking coffee. Same for tea, but as I said the effect is less, so probably better for you.</p></div>		</li>
