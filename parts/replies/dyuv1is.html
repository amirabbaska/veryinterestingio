<p>If you take them both out at the same time, you could get them mixed up.</p>
<p>If you put the left eye in the right socket, and vice versa, it makes driving very dangerous. But you can watch the girl at the other table without your gf catching you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of your prescription such as astigmatism could be from the lens (lenticular astigmatism). Also, as you age you can’t focus on near things as well from the lens hardening which is called presbyopia but that’s a separate issue from general nearsightedness or farsightedness. </p></div>		</li>
