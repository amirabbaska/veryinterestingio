			<div class="markdown"><p>So is this the reason why some stars collapse into a black hole while others explode as a supernova? Is there other factors that determines whether a star will collapse or explode?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars 8 times solar mass and above will explode in supernova. What remains then depends on the size. </p>
<p>From approx. 8-25x solar mass the remnants of the star collapse into a neutron star, held up against gravity by neutron degeneracy pressure. </p>
<p>From approx 25-90x the remnants keep collapsing, gravity overtakes even neutron degeneracy and a black hole forms. </p>
<p>From there we get crazy, with stars collapsing to black holes without supernova explosions, or hypernova where they just blow themselves apart spectacularly and leave nothing behind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, do we have an estimate on the previous solar mass of the black hole said to reside in the center?  If so how might our galaxy have been different prior to this collapse?  Would we be able to see this supermassive star with the naked eye?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends primarily on mass (responsible for lifetime of star) and metallicity (fraction of composition that is not Hydrogen or Helium. Responsible for cooling rate of star). <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0212469.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a famous paper describing the different conditions required for different supernovas (see figures). It should be noted that this paper is 15 years old and much development since then has altered the particular boundaries, but for all intents and purposes it does convey how important mass and metallicity is to the death of stars. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This process makes the core pressure drop momentarily, causing the star to collapse and become a black hole rather than explode as a hypernova!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought black holes were the leftovers of supernovae of sufficiently large stars and dying stars did not just collapse into black holes without an explosion, assuming they are big enough to not just go red giant -&gt; dwarf star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the largest known stars is thought to do this in the next few million years. It might not even be visible when the process happens because it happens close to the speed of light and in a fraction of a second. It would be as if the star blinked out of existence.</p></div>		</li>

It cites two papers <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/319719;jsessionid=C7153E2747204F89F675ADDDB52FA5F6.ip-10-40-2-120" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/375341" target="_blank">2</a>.</p>
<p>This apparently occurs for stars with more 250 solar masses.</p></div>		</li>
