			<div class="markdown"><p>exactly it means after the relief/laughter/no belief you went back to believing: &quot;this shouldn't be happening (anymore)&quot;</p>
<p>This is with everything that causes aggression (the belief: &quot;it shouldn't be like this&quot; whatever it is).</p>
<p>Everybody is different and everyone can be different at different times. As long as you feel (not think/believe, but feel) you do the right thing, it's all good.</p>
<p>This is where things get tricky with me, because what I feel is the right thing often clashes with many people, so I have learned to let go of what I feel is right and simply let things happen to me wether I like it or not and simply turn my rational brain off. In fact, I did it right now, automatically. (in the past I would've probably kept writing for much longer, which in my experience get negative responses) It's weird though because I often experience a stinging pain in my right ear whenever I do this (this being: break/stop a train of thought completely with an automatic shutdown/reboot of the rational part of the brain).</p></div>		</li>
