			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit- I misread the above.
Below is an addition not a correction</p>
<p>That’s not 100 percent accurate- it’s the irregularity that’s so disturbing to us. We are essentially pattern seeking animals. And trying to figure one out will drive us around the twist. “Chinese water torture” was allegedly so effective because wondering when the next drip of water would come drives people crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy that’s so true for the water torture, like when I press snooze on my alarm and can’t get peace of mind because I don’t know if I’ve got 5 minutes or 10 seconds until it goes off again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not just he irregularity that’s bothersome, it’s the variation in the stimuli. Even at regular intervals, a drilling tap or a snoring person are irritating, and it’s because there’s a break in the noise that’s perceptible to us, so we can’t ever reach the point where we become unaware of it, unlike the droning of a generator or the hum of an appliance or rain etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there an element of acceptance to it? Gusts of wind in trees are pretty irregular but still relaxing, maybe the fact that we can't control the wind or rain lets us be at peace with it whereas a leaky faucet or a snoring person is something we can fix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with much of this and some people actually have what is called misophonia which i believe I definitely have in relation to certain noises.  Not always with lip smacking which is a commonly referenced trigger for misophonia but similar noises most people don't think much of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it’s repetitive sounds. Especially the sound of a fly buzzing and stopping and buzzing and stopping. It makes me unreasonably and irrationally irritated. Hearing people snore usually results in the overheating and agitation as well. The worst is the sound of a fan spinning and rhythmically creaking. It’s unbearable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate lawn mowers, the sound of a loud bus passing, the sound of the guy in the cube next to me sighing or listening to his headphones, the sound of someone singing poorly or a song I dislike, the sound of Christmas music, I could probably think of more.  Do you think the hatred of these qualifies as misaphonia? Or do you think it falls on the range of &quot;normal&quot; human reaction?</p></div>		</li>
