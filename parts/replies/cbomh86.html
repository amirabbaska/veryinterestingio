			<div class="markdown"><p>Transparency would be good. There was a chrome extension which would allow you to see what the removed comments are. Perhaps they should encourage people to use that? That way they still &quot;close&quot; the thread down, but there's transparency about what's being removed? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the problem is that <em>you</em> guys can still view the thread after it's been deleted, it's marked as such in the modqueue.</p>
<p>We can't. At all.</p>
<p>So if something that wasn't <em>great</em> science but <em>meh</em> science gets deleted, all we see is vast graveyards of <strong>Comment deleted</strong> - <strong>Comment deleted</strong> - <strong>Comment deleted</strong> and there's no way for us to even know what was IN the thread, to decide if it was something worth responding to, before asking you to undelete it, so that we can respond or address.</p>
<p>Basically the only people in the position to ask you to undelete something are the first people who saw it - who might very well be the same people who reported it for deletion in the first place.</p>
<p>Although I'm ok with the current removal system and I'm not too terribly cut up about losing some of the comment content, what the guy you responded to is trying to say is that <em>a lot</em> of stuff gets deleted (for good reason), but there's not always a barometer that differentiates &quot;This was circlejerk, so it was deleted&quot; vs &quot;This science was unsourced, so it was deleted&quot; vs &quot;This science was kind of meh on the science part, possibly unsupported by many scientists&quot;.</p>
<p>And all we see is just <strong>Comment deleted</strong>.</p></div>		</li>
