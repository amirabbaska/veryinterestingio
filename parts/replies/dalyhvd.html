			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. One interesting point is that they have to have multiple antennas and transfer communication from one site to another because the earth rotates (specifically three sites about 120 degrees apart).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Errors increase as the signal to noise ratio (SNR) decreases. The power of an electromagnetic signal obeys the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse square law</a>, which directly relates signal strength to distance. As you keep going further away from the transmitter, even if the power in the noise signal were to remain constant, the SNR would drop.</p>
<p>As for the exact <em>source</em> of the noise. I don't know for certain, but I would hazard a guess that it is probably just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%E2%80%93Nyquist_noise" target="_blank">thermal noise</a>. But I could be wrong, which I admit in the hopes of someone providing a more detailed source about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but there are likely several contributors to the overall noise experienced by the receiver. Thermal noise may be a contributor to the overall noise in part, but it's noise in the S and X band frequencies that we really care about. These are the communication bands used by the Voyager 2. Our Sun, (and many other sources in the galaxy) create noise in these bands</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you get into deep space, you will still find AWGN coming from stars radiating from all directions.  This is what's called the &quot;noise floor&quot;.  It means that no matter where you are in the universe, you'll experience some minimum amount of noise.  The noise will add to the signal you're trying to receive and distort it.  </p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where you're in a quiet room and someone starts talking to you.  You can understand him just fine.  However, imagine you're in a loud concert hall and the same guy talks to you in his normal speaking voice.  His voice would be drowned out by the noise around him.  This is directly analogous to long distance communication.  There is a certain amount of noise that you can never get rid of, and the further you get, the quieter the guy you're trying to hear gets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electro-magnetic waves (radio, light, etc) obey an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse-square law</a>:  The power of the signal is proportional to the inverse of the square of the distance.  e.g. if the signal distance is 3 times as far, the power is divided by 3^2 , or 9. </p>
<p>As far as I know, the solar wind doesn't directly affect radio propagation.  However, it may increase the receiver noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At such long distances, how is it possible to use a directional antenna? Is the antenna output somewhat cone shaped (not straight like a laser) to allow for some misalignment between the satelite antenna and earth? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Directional antennas follow the inverse square law, same as the non-directional antenna, the main difference being the proportional constant. Thus the signal will cover a vast area by the time it reaches the destination. Misalignment means you are already extremely off course.</p>
<p>On a side note, lasers do as well. Its a common misconception that they do not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The antenna output (i.e its radiation pattern) is indeed directional.  However, take a look at this <a href="http://www.astronwireless.com/img/aa_rad4.gif" target="_blank">radiation pattern</a> for example.  You can see at the top what's labeled the &quot;3 dB beamwidth&quot;.  You can see it carves out roughly a 40 degree cone around the center of the beam.  The 3 dB beamwidth tells you that if you sweep out a cone of that size, the power received will be at least half of the total peak power.  The peak power is how much power you would see if the peak of the beam was pointed exactly at the receiver.  You can see that a difference of a few degrees misalignment makes little difference on the gain here.</p>
<p>The radiation pattern I linked above is not a very directive antenna so the 3 dB beamwidth is quite large.  We can make them more directive and reduce the 3 dB beamwidth.  This means that it'd be harder to keep good alignment, but when we do have good alignment we'd get a stronger signal.  However, the only way to make an antenna more directive is to increase its size, so there are real physical limitations on how directive we can make it.  Ultimately though, the misalignment between satellite and earth is not a big concern.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes. Lasers beams to are actually cone shaped. It is not so much by design as it is a physical inevitability.  </p></div>		</li>
