			<div class="markdown"><p>Oncology nurse here! That is all true, and I don’t know the specifics on registering as an organ donor. However, I have had patients pass and when that happens, we have to call the donor network and they confirm or deny donor eligibility for the deceased. Most of our patients do not qualify, but with certain cancers you can still donate things like corneas. That being said, you surviving leukemia is much more important than being able to donate blood or organs! Stay healthy! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe radiation also disqualifies you but chemo is enough. I had AML as a teenager and only got chemo (&quot;only&quot; lol), and I'm not eligible to donate blood or organs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your blood  regenerates after 120 days. Radiation won’t have an affect on your blood. But you could have potential cancerous cells with certain tumor markers floating around in your blood. Which would not be good to transfuse into an immune compromised person. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to <em>organ</em> donation there is <strong><em>tissue</em></strong> donation. Bone and skin, corneas, valves, etc. Although cancer may render some organs unusable, maybe some tissues can still be used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much! And thank you for everything you do as a nurse! It’s always a delight when I get to see my old nurses and I’m eternally grateful to them. Congrats on being a great human!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really is a bummer. I don't have cancer, I do have a disease that can be passed to others if they recieve an organ from me. I can't donate blood because my disease also targets my blood cells and destroys them, so my blood would be useless to others. When my ID expired and I had to get a new one, they asked if I wanted to remain an organ donor and of course I had to tell them no. It felt bad. I didn't realize how proud I was to have that little heart on my ID.</p>
<p>P.S., how are you doing now?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for understanding! And I’m sorry you’re having to go through something similar. I’m always worried the employees will think I’m just a selfish person instead of not able to donate. I know they probably don’t care either way, but it makes me self-conscious anyway.</p>
<p>I’m okay now! Been in remission since I was about 7 and I’m nearly 25 now. I have some long-term effects from the chemotherapy such as needing hearing aids and having a shit metabolism, but I’m otherwise healthy and that’s what matters. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you wanted to donate your organs. But since you can't do that, if you still wanted to do something good for science with your body, you could donate it to a body farm! (When you're done with it, obviously :p)</p>
<p>They don't yet have a lot of research on how decomposition occurs differently in the bodies of people who have been through cancer treatments. </p></div>		</li>
