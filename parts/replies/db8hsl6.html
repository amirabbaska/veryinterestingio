			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer IMO.  I listened to an interview with someone from the security firm/group that worked on the DNC hacks who said that in these cases they're brought in because of suspected activity.  They start monitoring the network with tools that basically record everything the intruder does. These intruders often employ the same methods and tools as have been previously identified and through their activities and procedures, thier &quot;style&quot;, can identified as most likely belonging to a particular individual or group.  In the DNC hacks there was little doubt about who the intruders were because of these &quot;hallmarks&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the HUMINT angle is particularly important here. This assessment was reportedly from the CIA, which undoubtedly has digital assets but is primarily focused on human intelligence. They're always in the shadows and can use a number of inferences, around the type of attacks, the hacker groups involved, the Russian governments response to the hack itself and US media's reports of it, etc, to come to a conclusion. </p>
<p>This differs from the FBI, which is focused on counterintelligence and a bit more legalistic (with a higher standard for &quot;proof&quot;), and the NSA which is primarily signals intelligence. Will be interesting to see if we hear more about their conclusions and how they compare to the CIA's. </p>
<p>TL;DR - intelligence agencies have different focuses and different sources. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent point. The US has made spying on Russia a priority for the last 70 years. Back in the day, the US would actually send submarines underneath the north pole ice and deploy divers who would attach tape recorders to their undersea cables. They'd have to send a sub out each month in order to switch out the tapes.</p>
