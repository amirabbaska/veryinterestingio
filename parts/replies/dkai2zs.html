			<div class="markdown"><p>theres a neighborhood on the border of brooklyn-queens where housing was built and they later realized the area was too low to hook up a sewer main. so it became a dumping group for mob corpses.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, boy. Bad news. There are ways to overcome the issue like building out smaller pump stations and force mains or lift stations. Either way, gravity is preferred because it is free and works most of the time. I believe the entire city of Boston runs off gravity to the treatment works without a force main component at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its a poor area near an airport. its only about 10 sq blocks tops. not worth it to make a pump station probably.</p>
<p>they say there's a strip mall being built over there, maybe someone decided to invest in the area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My pops runs a hot-tapping company and this is some COOL F<strong>**</strong> stuff. Vid is great but essentially the existing water line has a &quot;saddle&quot; strapped to it. The saddle is essentially a valve with an on off switch. After securing over the main water line, the drill (which is a large, typically diamond sharpened, open and round bit) the valve on the saddle is opened and the high RPM drill machine is bolted to the existing saddle with an air tight (water tight) seal. Then the drill is slowly entered introduced to the pipe. After passing through the outer diameter of the line, the drill is backed out, the valve is closed, and the drill is detached and later on you can attach (develop) more opportunity off that line. What you have is an L joint pipe that will typically feed a housing subdivision, industrial fire sprinkler system, etc. I used to collect the debris which is usually (in our scale) an 8-12&quot; cool looking piece of the line u drilled into. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome! Water mains that size are pretty scary. The rate that they can fill trench boxes and wash away streets is shocking when they're broken or wide open. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they are. There's a reason why from the lowliest laborer to the top end of operations in just about any underground utility company we ALL have a valve wrench in our trucks.  Got to be able to stop the destructive deluge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I have worked in both industries so I have a little knowledge about them. Plus I find it really interesting. I don't feel like utility workers get enough credit for employing the equipment that you design. The interceptor (maintenance, operations and construction) crews aren't paid nearly well enough for the crazy stuff they're expected to do. Same deal with the plant operators. I may work in the industry and spend some time in the field but not nearly as intensely as the crews. What do you design if you don't mind me asking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do sales for a major manufacturer of tapping saddles, tapping equipment and sewer saddles among other things and these guys are totally right. It’s pretty incredible the work that the installers of this stuff do. I can’t imagine working in muddy ditches all the time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really question. What do you still design? To the unknowing, it seems like this is what needs to be done every time but in different sizes. I'm not naive, I know there is always room for innovation but I'm curious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a residential system (house) connecting to the main sewer there isn't much to design prior to installation (other than pipe routes etc).  However each gravity main sewer needs to be designed individually based on the upstream flows, geotechnical conditions and the grade of the area. </p>
<p>I design what is at the end of the pipe and that is where is gets interesting r/wastewater</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hot tapping in municipal applications hasn't changed much. In pipelines and refineries though, hot tapping is going through a revolution of sorts. Hot tapping on high temperature or high pressure systems is very dangerous and extremely precise. New machines are being developed to handle those temps and pressures. Also, each fitting is quite different depending on the applications. </p></div>		</li>
