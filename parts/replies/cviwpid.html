			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially everyone wants to blame syphilis on someone else. </p>
<p><em>Syphilis had been called the &quot;French disease&quot; in Italy, Poland and Germany, and the &quot;Italian disease&quot; in France. In addition, the Dutch called it the &quot;Spanish disease&quot;, the Russians called it the &quot;Polish disease&quot;, the Turks called it the &quot;Christian disease&quot; or &quot;Frank (Western European) disease&quot; (frengi) and the Tahitians called it the &quot;British disease&quot;. These &quot;national&quot; names were generally reflective of contemporary political spite between nations and frequently served as a sort of propaganda; the Dutch, for example, had a colonial rivalry with the Spanish, so referring to Syphilis as the 'Spanish' disease reinforced a politically useful perception that the Spanish were immoral or unworthy. The inherent xenophobia of the terms also stemmed from the disease's particular epidemiology, often being spread by foreign sailors and soldiers during their frequent sexual contact with local prostitutes.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Shortly after Christopher Columbus and his sailors returned from their voyage to the New World, a horrifying new disease began to make its way around the Old. The &quot;pox,&quot; as it was often called, erupted with dramatic severity. According to Ulrich von Hutten (1488-1523), a German knight, revolutionary, and author who wrote a popular book about his own trials with syphilis and the treatments he underwent, the first European sufferers were covered with acorn-sized boils that emitted a foul, dark green pus. This secretion was so vile, von Hutten affirmed, that even the burning pains of the boils troubled the sick less than their horror at the sight of their own bodies. Yet this was only the beginning. People's flesh and skin filled with water; their bladders developed sores; their stomachs were eaten away. Girolamo Fracastoro, a professor at the University of Padua, described the onward march of symptoms: syphilis pustules developed into ulcers that dissolved skin, muscle, bone, palate, and tonsilsâ€”even lips, noses, eyes, and genital organs. Rubbery tumors, filled with a white, sticky mucus, grew to the size of rolls of bread. Violent pains tormented the afflicted, who were exhausted but could not sleep, and suffered starvation without feeling hunger. Many of them died...</p>
<p>Perhaps more than any other disease before or since, syphilis in early modern Europe provoked the kind of widespread moral panic that AIDS revived when it struck America in the 1980s. Syphilitics were condemned from pulpits and from chairs in university medical schools. John Calvin (1509-1564) announced that &quot;God has raised up new diseases against debauchery&quot;; medical authorities willingly agreed. The greatest English surgeon of the sixteenth century, William Clowes (1540-1604), who counted Queen Elizabeth among his patients, announced to his colleagues and patients that syphilis was &quot;loathsome and odious, yea troublesome and dangerous, a notable testimony of the just wrath of God.&quot; A century later, a French physician, M. Flamand, summed up this point of view concisely by announcing that venereal diseases were &quot;the just rewards of unbridled lust.&quot; Disease commonly invited theological speculation, but in the case of syphilis people felt that little speculation was necessary. Just as fornication opened the door to the pox, so the pox opened the door to chastisement and blame.&quot;</p>
