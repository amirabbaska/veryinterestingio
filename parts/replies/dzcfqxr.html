<p>If I had a time machine, this is the era I would want to just sit around and watch nature get down. </p>
<p>Assuming I had an amazing hiding spot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the first fossil that's made dinosaurs actually seem <em>real</em> to me. I have little doubt that they existed, but this one fossil in particular just looks so life-like, as in they were actually alive while doing the thing portrayed in the fossil, not just a fossilized skeleton of an already-dead animal.</p>
<p>Also, the sheer size of that proceratops - the proportions - make it look like a cross between a dragon and a frog. It's easy to understand that a lot of people would think these things are entirely made-up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't even take millions of years! There are people whose whole careers are dedicated to studying fossilized human poop.  For example the area around Mt Vesuvius (best known for Pompeii) contains preserved sewers with human waste that tell us a lot about the lives and diets of the Roman population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a sand dune many metres tall.  From time-to-time the sloped, unstable side of the dune can collapse, producing a sand flow that could smother any creatures at the bottom.  It's like a sand avalanche.  In Mongolia in the Flaming Cliffs there are quite a few dinosaurs that appear to have died this way back in the Cretaceous Period, including that famous &quot;fighting dinosaurs&quot; specimen.</p></div>		</li>
