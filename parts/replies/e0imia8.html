			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Great comment. I completely agree and cannot stress this point enough. I’m speaking from personal experience that these types of substances can be very dangerous. I was an advocate for psychedelic exploration, I truly believed that under the right setting with the right intention it could help people dealing with all kinds of issues. Personally, when I started experimenting with DMT, I was overall a healthy individual; But after some exposure and one particular weekend, the substance catalyzed a year of battling mental illness. Psychosis leading into bipolar manic episodes. I’m just extremely grateful for making a full recovery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think weed, cocaine and MDMA had a similar effect on me for some time. There were certainly months I felt so bad. Some particularly traumatic experiences on them really switched my mind. </p>
<p>Seeing replies from professionals stating long term rewiring of the brain makes me uneasy. At times I have trouble controlling my anger and seek to be alone whereas before I was an easy go joker. </p>
<p>At least I can find some comfort that those days are gone and I look forward to the future and making a life for myself. Something that never crossed my mind when I was an addict</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After I had some traumatizing experiences being high on weed, any time I see it or read about it or see the word, my heart races. I got my med card so I can get some mostly CBD strains. The other day I took an edible and had a full blown panic attack, and it made me realize I do not like being unable to control my mind. I feel secure when I can think straight because I'm a very anxious person. I just really wish weed was as enjoyable as it used to be. Too many fucked up situations while high made it more anxiety inducing :( I wanna enjoy a high or just a little relaxation, I don't like alcohol, so I'm hoping with my card I can get the right strains</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After jumping from different hospitals for 9 months, I was finally put on Lithum and Respidol  which happened to be the right medicine for me. I completely recovered I think with that help and by changing my lifestyle to completely focusing on getting better</p>
<p>(Once the medicine started working I was able to get my sleep schedule back on track, I accepted I couldn’t go out and do everything with everyone all the time, so I sat in bed and read or watched Netflix, and went on walks when I wasn’t in out patient therapy). </p>
<p>The medicine gradually reduced my racing thoughts, restlessness, and overall manic behavior. Even though I felt like I turned into a zombie because I didn’t feel anything, just simply apathetic, after months of being on that treatment plan I felt recovered enough to ask my doctor to wean me off all medications. </p>
<p>He predicted I would be back within three months to handle the relapsing symptoms because like all my other doctors, they assumed I’ve always been Bipolar. But I never walk back into that dingy hell hole since, it’s been a little over two years without medicine or therapy.
I really felt they did not  know much about Substance Induced Mood Disorder but I can testify that personally, I was able to come back from it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have some trouble with that question because a psychedelic drug ruined my life for a bit lol. But I still have my reasons for why I decided to explore them to begin with. Personally I don’t think a trip is worth it at all. It comes, it’s weird, it fades back to normal and you go about your life. </p>
<p>But if it’s a strong interest for you I would recommend mushrooms, a small dose - wait a few hours and if nothing happens another small dose kind of thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you bee reading these threads? There's a certain probability of good and bad that you need to estimate. And once you've estimated you need to determine if the risk is worth the rewards. </p>
<p>Are you going to let one persons anecdotal experience make your decision -- which could alter your path in life?</p>
<p>Don't take the easy way out when you're thinking about important things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I'm so glad I clicked in here.</p>
<p>I agree. In particular the micro-dosing of LSD that has become a thing worries me. The research into LSD is really interesting and quite exciting that we're looking into a substance that has been taboo politically for a long time. But your average Joe lording it as something everyone with depression, anxiety, motivational problems etc can benefit from is frightening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went from just ADHD to full on psychosis after dabbing in LSD too much. Now I have bipolar and ADHD. The latter is difficult to treat without affecting the former.</p>
<p>Though it's my own fault for going full retard. I have friends that were completely fine doing the same amount of acid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to hear.</p>
<p>I find that LSD taken at the surface has great potential for working through one's problems. I was able to see things I struggled with at a different angle and realized many of the things I worry about aren't as big of a deal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately after sobering up most of that doesn't matter. While on the surface I had worked out my problems, underneath nothing changed and eventually I was back to my old habits.</p></div>		</li>
