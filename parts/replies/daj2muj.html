			<div class="markdown"><p>This covered pretty much everything. To make a short story longer, I'd like to go into more detail about efficiency. </p>
<p>Efficiency is &quot;power out/power in&quot; and since your power in (sunlight) is free, it seems plausible that efficiency just wouldn't matter: If you have a panel that's half as efficient but it costs 1/3 as much you'd be golden. </p>
<p>This is not true in practice, because solar requires supporting structures, it requires wiring, it requires a clear area with no shade, etc. and the part of the system that is &quot;everything else&quot; costs more than the actual panels. And the part of the system that is &quot;everything else&quot; tends to scale with area. So your double-size solar panels (half as efficient, so twice as big to produce the same power) will require twice as much racking to hold them, which costs twice as much. Twice as much wiring, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus increased loss to transmission distance. i.e. if you can't squeeze enough cells onto your roof then you'll need some in your yard which is further away. If your town can't fit enough cells then there need to be some outside of town.. same goes for state, country, planet you name it. Size matters.</p>
<p>Also, any surface area we're covering up is that much less solar absorption available to the ecosystem. We're still dependent on trees and the like for all of the free breathable air we use every year. Hoping not to have to start importing that from China along with everything else.. they don't have much to send last I heard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At one point I calculated that you could provide most of the electricity the US needs by putting solar panels on Area 51. </p>
<p>How do you know they haven't already done that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I understand that OPV can be used in some cases that silicon panels can't, so maybe there are some niche applications for it? Like maybe on top of cars...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some ways this is solar fricking roadways in a new coat - you <em>could</em> put a panel on your car, but why would you if there is plenty of space available that is easier to fit out and more efficient afterwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who worked in R&amp;D developing organic solar cells I feel qualified to add couple things.</p>
<p>Organic solar cells are not meant to replace rooftop solar. Organic solar cells are very lightweight, cheap, semi-transparent ,and flexible. The main applications we intended for portable power (can bring solar cells on trip without extra weight and setup), BIPV (building-integrated photovoltaics) for tinted windows that generate electricity, and for long travels without access to electricity so you can generate enough to power a cell phone. Other benefits include low cost of production, ability to retrofit ink printing equipment for production, ability to charge in less intense sunlight (like indoors), and the ultra portability reduces the weight load of soldiers that carry heavy battery packs.</p>
<p>High efficiency rigid solar panels will have better efficiency, but start-up costs of a silicon PV system is much higher than for organic solar cells, and they cannot be moves to a new location easily. </p>
<p>So these solar cells are for different applications than normal rooftop or utility power generation. Portable, cheap, flexible, versatile. A different niche of the market for solar power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good start, but I'll elaborate on a few key missing details. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) are supposed to be cheaper if you solution process them in a roll-to-roll process. Imagine an inkjet printer or slot-die coater printing on flexible plastic substrates. To install them, you just roll them out. Silicon PV requires heavy framing, which drives up the install cost (something like 80% install cost vs 20% module cost). OPVs could in principle be put down with a staple gun. In addition, you could do this on a curved surface. Furthermore, OPVs are semitransparent and can be used as window coatings in high-rise office buildings, increasing the potential surfaces to harvest energy.</p>
<p>However, all the best lab devices in that chart linked above are made on a spin-coater. This is because lab-sized devices are small and for reasons relating to the morphology of the light-absorbing layer, the films need to dry very quickly and spin-coating is one of the fastest drying solution deposition methods. Going from spin-coater to roll-to-roll process is a major hurdle due to the drying time issue. Some of the best large-area devices made on a printer only get ~ 3% power conversion efficiency.</p>
<p>Stability is still a big issue. The best OPVs, even when encapsulated only last a few months. For any building application you need 10-15 years lifetime. There are organics that are photostable over decades. But not all materials in an OPV device are. There are also many interfaces in a solar cell, in addition to the nanoscale morphology in OPVs that can change over time.  </p>
<p>The materials cost issue is a strange one. The highest performing OPVs use complicated polymers that currently cost ~ $1000/g. They are not industrial-scale friendly. That being said, the active layer of OPVs is ~ 100 nm, so each square meter would only have 1 mg ($1) of material. There are many OPV materials that cost ~ $1/g, but get half the efficiency (at 1/1000th the price!). Silicon is expensive because it needs to very pure (99.999% pure). Si PV also has much thicker active layers (~ 200-500 um). Taking into account the density, you need about 1000x more Si than organic by weight. </p>
<p>The bottom line is OPVs is not a mature technology and will probably need 5 more years of development before all these issues are worked out.</p></div>		</li>
