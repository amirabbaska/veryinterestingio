			<div class="markdown"><p>While not disagreeing with the general message, there are tons of left-wing echo chambers, I would say, far more and spread than right wing echo chambers, who tend to be fairly niche and not endemic in society (Mostly obscure websites, contrast with mainstream ones such as many universities, especially humanities focused ones, that end up being left-wing echo chambers). </p>
<p>This is said from my perspective, a left-wing person who has out of curiosity visited many different echo chambers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, unfortunately people get into those closed groups no matter what you believe. I think the best evidence of that is the &quot;all natural/organic/antivax&quot; crowd, which appears to be pretty liberal leaning and is fairly cultish in their fanaticism.</p>
<p>Still, it's my experience that the right has radicalized far more than the left. That pushes out the moderate-right, creating more of those far-right echo chambers.</p>
<p>But it is important to recognize when the left is doing it, too, and unfortunately I see the left becoming more radicalized in response to Trump, so that's a problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are you implying that America is a conservative nation by the standards of the world? Because that's just not true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the standards of any asian country, or African, or many European or South American countires it's a liberal country. The userbase of Reddit doesn't have anyhting to do with it. </p></div>		</li>
