			<div class="markdown"><p>He definetly had the awareness, it was on the news here in Norway, where it happened. The other truckdriver (the one who filmed) honked his horn to signalize danger, so that the one who braked had just enough time to react. The truck was the last model before the one with automatic brakes, although it had some kind of brake booster. This did not help on the reacton, but rather shortened the distance and time of stopping. </p></div>		</li>
