			<div class="markdown"><p>In Scandinavian nomenclature, up until the modern era, your name would usually be &quot;Blank Son of Blank&quot;. or &quot;Blank Blankson&quot;. That's how Scandinavians end up with names like Hans Hanson; Their name is literally Hans, son of Hans</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On that note, Welsh families only started having fixed surnames about 500 years ago. Before that there was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patronymic" target="_blank">patronymic naming system</a> which I believe is similar to what's found in Iceland today. (Eg, you would have a first name, then a &quot;son of&quot; (&quot;ap&quot;), then your father's name). Unfortunately for many families when fixed surnames started being used there was only a very short list of safe Christian names to pick from, which ended up with loads of Jones (The letter J wasn't even in the Welsh alphabet traditionally).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;So the great tragedy was that at the very time that the Welsh were being forced by the clerks of the courts or the parsons of the parishes to take fixed surnames, it was the very time when the Welsh were being forced to take a very very small range of names. So there were hundreds and hundreds of people being forced to take fixed surnames at the very time when there were hundreds and hundreds of fathers being given the name John. So their children, also probably John, landed up in three generations, instead of being Llywarch ap Gwalchmai ap Gwasmihangel, they ended up being John Jones. And that's all. John Jones. Hundreds and hundreds of John Jones.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copper turns green as it ages, which is why old gothic or neo-gothic buildings have beautiful green roofs (the Statue of Liberty is copper and a prime example of this), so both &quot;redsmith&quot; and &quot;greensmith&quot; make sense.</p>
<p>I have heard that back when they finished installing a shiny new copper roof the workmen would pee on it to speed up the process to turn them green.</p></div>		</li>
