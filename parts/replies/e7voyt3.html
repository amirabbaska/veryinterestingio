			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do different molecules stick together? Depends on their <em>intermolecular forces</em></p>
<p>Many molecules don't distribute their electrons evenly. This creates partial positive and negative charges that attract the molecules together and allow them to bond into liquids or solids</p>
<p>Other molecules symmetrical, so they don't have these persistent partial charges. However, electrons still move around a lot, so they create tiny, temporary partial charges that then attract each other, albeit weakly. These attractions are called Van der Waals forces. </p>
<p>The more electrons you have, the stronger the Van der Waals forces you can get. Helium is tiny and only has 2 electrons, so it's Van der Waals forces are miniscule. (Hydrogen, the only smaller element with 1 electron <em>per atom</em>, naturally pairs up with itself, so even hydrogen has 2 electrons <em>per molecule</em>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an almost entirely incorrect explanation of Van der Waals forces. The first sentence is basically correct, but that's about it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Van der Waals forces are caused by interactions between partial charges generated by either permanent or temporary (instantaneous) imbalances in the electron distribution around a nucleus, called dipoles. Molecules form permanent dipoles via polar covalent bonding, where the electrons in the bond spend more of their time closer to one atom than the other. All elements and molecules also produce instantaneous dipoles, from the random probability of the electrons moving around the nuclei forming some kind of imbalanced configuration for a brief (or &quot;instantaneous&quot;) moment, creating a partial positive charge on one side and a partial negative charge on the other. These are called London dispersion forces, which are also a type of Van der Waals force. When this happens, one instantaneous dipole can also induce instantaneous dipoles in other nearby atoms or molecules. How effective that induction is is dependent on the polarizability of the atoms or molecules and how far apart they are. The polarizability of an element is based on how many electrons are around it and how far away from the nucleus they are. Elements with many electrons are more polarizable, because some of the electrons are farther out from the nucleus and &quot;shielded&quot; from its charge by lower energy electrons that are closer to the nucleus. This means that the further out electrons are more easily affected by external forces, like a nearby instantaneous dipole. So in elements with few electrons, such as helium, this force is much weaker because the electrons are more tightly bound to the nucleus, so external forces are less significant influences on the distribution of electrons around the nucleus.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>tl;dr smaller elements/molecules = fewer electrons = less nuclear shielding = weaker London Dispersion Force = weaker Van der Waals forces</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's awesome.</p>
<p>So why is Helium a more stable molecule than Hydrogen? That is, why are 2 protons, neutrons, and electrons more stable than a proton and electron?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this only really (I know it doesn’t ONLY happen to helium) happen to helium for the most part because it’s the most basic noble gas? Is that what allows it to work for helium and not hydrogen since the noble gas is inert?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, all these other superfluids are pretty out there...Helium is the only 'regular liquid' that goes through a transition to a superfluid.  And yes, noble gas atoms can only attract each other through Van der Waals attraction...where two neighboring atoms ever so slightly polarize each other and thus cause a weak dipole attraction.  Helium is more reluctant to do this than the other noble elements essentially because it is the simplest, as you say...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A super fluid is exactly what it sounds like: A liquid that flows with exactly zero viscosity. On a macroscopic scale we also get some strange properties; the lack of viscosity causes superfluid helium to flow up the sides and out of a beaker. They also have some strange temperature effects: temperature becomes smoothed out extremely quickly in a superfluid as compared to a regular material. Above the superfluid point liquid helium will bubble violently as it tries to boil, but as soon as it dips below superfluidity it goes eerily still; there are no areas that are slightly hotter so it can't attempt to boil. Look these up on YouTube!</p>
<p>The exact specifics of how it happens get complex, but it's more or less similar to superconductors as well, except the fluid in question are charged electron pairs.</p></div>		</li>
