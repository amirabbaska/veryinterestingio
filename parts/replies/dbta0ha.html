<p>High power indeed.  Once I forgot to turn of my  <a href="http://www.narda-sts.us/products_personal_nardalertxt.php" target="_blank">RF radiation monitor</a> (was working someplace where I needed one) and set it down on a table next to a GSM cell phone.   I was surprised when It squawked in an area where it shouldn't have.  A second later, my phone was ringing.</p></div>		</li>
