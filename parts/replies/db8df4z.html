			<div class="markdown"><p>It has been off and on money throughout that time. Sometimes just on one coin. Sometimes disappearing and reappearing. So the first statement is only kind of true as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not only &quot;kind of&quot; true.  It was made law in the 1950s that it is the U.S. motto.  It was after that it was added to paper money.  Same with the pledge of allegiance, they added &quot;one nation under god&quot; at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One nation under God was added to the pledge of allegiance in the 1950s. But even then, it wasn't added to our currency until 80 years after the founding of our country. </p>
<p>It's why I don't understand why the folks that jerk off to literal interpretations of the constitution also stroke their little Choosters to white Anglo-American Jesus fist fucking Americas enemies to death while reciting the pledge of allegiance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're conflating currency with the pledge of allegiance. &quot;Under God&quot; was added to the pledge in the 50s as part of the anti-communist movement that swept the nation</p></div>		</li>
