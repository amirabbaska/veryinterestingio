			<div class="markdown"><p>We only see multi-headed animals when it's a genetic mutation in a single animal though, which is very much less than ideal. I think the poster is more wondering why there was no evolutionary pressure for species to develop multiple heads on purpose, not accidentally on a few individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution is just genetic mutations in a single animal that gave it enough of an advantage that it was able to reproduce more and pass the genes on to its offspring. There is not some kind of goal with evolution, if a mutation is beneficial or neutral (as most are) it gets passed on. If it is a hindrance they die before reproducing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I know, I worded it poorly. I meant like actually developing two heads through multiple generations rather than one randomly being born with two heads because of chance when it's not &quot;supposed&quot; to have two heads when compared to its parents or siblings. </p>
<p>If it's not &quot;supposed&quot; to have two heads then it will certainly be disadvantaged compared to the other members of its species, but it's curious as to why no species have evolved to have multiple heads as I would see it to be certainly advantageous especially if the &quot;brain&quot; or control center were more protected in say a chest cavity and then multiple appendages to have sensory organs attached. Then if you lose one, you can still see, smell and eat with the other, and it's less risky as the brain wouldn't be put at risk when the sensory organs would.</p></div>		</li>
