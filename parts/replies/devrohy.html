			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense, but I wonder why some languages stuck with uppercase letters. </p>
<p>In German for example there are differences in meaning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Der gefangene Floh = the captured flea</p>
<p>Der Gefangene floh = the prisoner fled</p>
<p>Warum sind füllige Frauen gut zu Vögeln? = Why are chubby women nice to birds?</p>
<p>Warum sind füllige Frauen gut zu vögeln? = Why are chubby women good/nice to fuck? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>But context would let you understand what is meant, so not sure how convincing this argument is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes! German mainly uses the uppercase to distinguish nouns from other things like verbs and adjectives, unlike in English where you have to know exactly which words to capitalize (names, countries, etc.). You have to sometimes know wether you want to use a noun or adjective. So some languages stuck with the uppercase purely for grammatical reasons as well as to make things understandable even without context.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's all that convincing to be honest. There are similar constructs in English. A popular one is &quot;time flies like an arrow&quot;. Can be saying time flies quickly much as an arrow does, that you should time flies as you would time an arrow, or that time flies like an arrow in the same way that fruit flies like an orange. Obviously we know  that the first of these is the intended meaning even without capitalisation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's why I doubted this explanation. However, just because you can glean the meaning without capitalization doesn't mean it's not the motivation behind it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can someone explain why Cyrillic alphabets (I only really know this to be true in Russian, but I assume other Cyrillic languages are similar) have some wildly different upper/lowercase letters, while Latin letters look mostly the same (I, L, Q, R, B, and T being the weird ones)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rest is just random developement. In most languages, the binning of a sentence is big, names, months and places. Im Germany, every <em>noun</em> is big. In English, Tiles Are Big, but nicht in Deutschland.</p></div>		</li>
