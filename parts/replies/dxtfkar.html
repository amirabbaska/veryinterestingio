			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a lazy eye, but I can also relax my eye muscles enough that my eyes drift outward. I cannot see with clarity with my eye(s) in this position, but then again that's also the same when crossing them inward. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What people call lazy eyes is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strabismus?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">Strabismus</a> and it's not necessarily permanent. In my case my left eye drifts outward when I'm tired, fixated on an object or when I'm not looking at anything in particular (trying to imagine/remember something). I can also make my eye drift at will. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a lazy eye but it's not as noticeable when looking at something farther away, the closer an object is the more my dominant eye takes over it seems and my lazy eye goes back to doing its own thing (tested it with various selfies).  Relaxing them without focusing on anything also just makes my lazy eye go lazy.</p></div>		</li>
