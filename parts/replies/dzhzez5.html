<p>I'm sure it's the same pair that every year builds a nest by my front door, in the Christmas wreath. The front door is hardly ever used, so it is a safe and sheltered place for the nest. The wreath is still hanging because it's occupied. I've even seen the babies over the years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a wreath on the wall to the side of our front door with a bird nest in it every year too! The funny part though was that we did actually use our front door on a daily basis, and every time you would come to the door, mama bird would divebomb you and you literally had to duck. But then you could take a peek at the babies as you walked in :) I don't remember exactly what kind of bird this was, I think it was a type of finch, but I am pretty sure it was the same bird for several years in a row. Or maybe it was her offspring coming back once they were grown?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's possible. It might be the case with my &quot;tenants&quot;. I don't know how long they live and what their reproductive years are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Such a beautiful song to hear in the morning tho! It's funny, I realized Pigeons, when I heard their little 'coo' of sorts, reminded me of the soft tone that the mourning doves had. I didn't know they were ACTUALLY a kind of dove until I saw the wiki page for Rock Dove lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're fun birds to watch.  Comically bad at building nests but very nimble flyers and good parents.</p>
<p>My only problem with them is their very loose definition of &quot;morning&quot; when the hooting wakes me up at 3:30 am.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only until recently I thought it was &quot;Morning dove&quot; since you hear them in the morning.  &quot;Mourning&quot; really makes sense though.</p>
<p>Also, the whistle they make when they launch into the air is from their wings, not their voice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's amazing that mourning dove populations have remained more or less constant. They are some of the easiest prey birds I have seen. Their chicks are constantly falling to their deaths, and they are often run over by cars because they wait till the last moment to fly away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are misusing their bird evasion techniques on cars. Doves are slower than hawks and falcons so when they are attacked they wait until the very last second and do an evasion maneuver </p></div>		</li>
