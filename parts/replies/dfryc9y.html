			<div class="markdown"><p>One unexpected effect of CFCs. This chemical was found to be completely safe as an aerosol. It's widespread use is partially due to the fact that it was safe. We can see many historical examples of this like with DDT and THALIDOMIDE where a chemical thought to be safe had horrible side effects in unexpected ways. </p>
<p>The DDT films of trucks going through neighborhoods spraying all of the children is classic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thalidomide is actually quite interesting. There's a type of thalidomide that is completely harmless and works as it should. The other causes horrible birth defects but still works. These two types come from stereochemistry when producing the compound. It is very possible to separate the two types. Sounds great, right? Let's bring it back with only the good type. The human body actually, unfortunately, converts the drug between the two types in a 50/50 mixture meaning that the drug can never be safe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fun thing with CFCs here is that the reason it's a problem is very tightly tied to why we thought it was safe.  We wanted a chemical that would be very stable and non-reactive--CFCs manage that by having very tight bonds between the carbon and the fluorine and chlorine atoms, because fluorine and chlorine are very electronegative.</p>
<p>But anything will break if you hit it with enough energy, such as you find if the molecules drift up to where they get zapped by UV above the ozone layer...and now those loose chlorine and fluorine atoms are hyperreactive due to that same electronegativity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sad thing is that a man that teaches and proctor's the test for EPA certification where I am from thinks that the switching to more green refrigerants and evacuating all units that use refrigerant are just more ways that the government impedes in people's lives. He thinks that the hole in the ozone layer has nothing to do with CFC's and other pollutants.</p></div>		</li>
