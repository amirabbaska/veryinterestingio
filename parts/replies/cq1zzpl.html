			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a field that is known to exist that may or may not have particles associated with it -- gravity.</p>
<p>The standard model does not contain gravitons, although some or all string theories do. I believe that solving this is related to uniting general relativity and quantum mechanics, which has not been done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could black holes be considered fundamental particles, then?</p>
<p>If particles in other fields are just the field getting all bunched up on itself and packing a bunch of energy in a small space, wouldn't a black hole be the particle for the gravitational field?  I mean, it's really big, but it sounds a lot like the other particles in a lot of ways.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, when you pour iron filings around a bar magnet, they'll line up with the magnetic field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>one of my favorite &quot;oh <em>shit</em>&quot; moments was when I realized this is not because they are all in the same place, or they are following equipotent lines, but because each filing amplifies the field through  itself, causing them to line up.  Since the magnet redirects the field, the filings actually have very little to do with the original magnets field- they form little magnets themselves.  In order to follow the actual field, you would need a non-ferromagnetic, high permittivity, material and an extremely strong field.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, so <em>you're</em> the reason I always hear all this nonsense about &quot;condensed energy&quot; and the like. :-P I really don't think that's a good way to explain it - I mean, to say that particles are energy. I've seen it lead a lot of people astray. I would much rather emphasize the point that energy is something particles <em>have</em>, not something they <em>are</em>.</p>
<p>And I think I've replied to a bunch of your posts recently... I'm not trying to be a spoilsport. They're really good explanations that sometimes just happen to trigger one of my scicomm pet peeves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh believe me, I hate the &quot;matter is just energy condensed into a slow vibration&quot; crap too. I openly invite you to give me a better analogy, because, unfortunately, the analogy with Greece and Persia trading gold is the best analogy I can come up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I really like the part about the gold trade. All I'm objecting to is the idea that particles <em>are</em> energy, or are made of energy - it'd be kind of like saying a Greek or Persian person is made of their wealth. Specifically, the first line and next-to-last sentence of your post-edit post.</p>
<p>For the bit at the end, it actually sounds better to me to say that the particle is the &quot;knot&quot;, rather than the energy of the &quot;knot&quot; (or pulse or bump or excitation, if you ever feel like staying away from &quot;knot&quot;). As for the beginning, well, giving a short explanation of quantum field theory is a tall order ;-) as you know... but perhaps there's something along the lines of saying that particles are concentrated vibrations, or pulses, or something like that, which doesn't involve saying that they <em>are</em> actually energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to picture fields as the surface of a liquid; and particles as the droplets that get spit out if the waves on the surface get strong enough.</p>
<p>But I'm quite far from being an expert on these things; maybe this analogy is seriously wrong in some way I don't know.</p></div>		</li>
