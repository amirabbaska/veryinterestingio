			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I do know on the topic I would think this is not the case. That estimate of energy expenditure is across the whole brain, which is all constantly receiving energy through oxygenated blood (that whole you're only using 10% of your brain thing is so extremely false). This energy is necessary to keep your brain cells alive! However, when regions of the brain are more active, they body does increase blood flow to that region, i.e. It uses more energy. This is the basis of how functional MRI works. However, what we think of as mind wandering is actually an active process! Studies using functional MRI have actually identified what people refer to as the default mode network which is MORE active when you are not doing a specific task than when you are. So while paying attention to a particular thought feels a lot more effortful, it's really more about the regions and networks of the brain being engaged than it is about energy use! Mind wandering is actually a pretty active field of research right now, very cool :) </p></div>		</li>
