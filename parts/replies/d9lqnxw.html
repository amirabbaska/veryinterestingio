<p>Disease and disorder are technically synonymous, but disease often implies organic derangement and disorder often implies psychiatric derangement. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to note I love that you made the distinction between broad definitions and colloquial/popular usages.</p>
<p>There is crossover that goes against that(physical problems with the brain can cause mental problems, for example) but by and large that is the distinction, the areas where one terms is commonly used over another.  I'll try my hand with a different set of layman's terms in case it helps someone see the concepts at play.</p>
<p>Disorder often relates to a lack of order, with &quot;order&quot; being somewhat a human abstract, is <em>mental</em> in origin. A sort of breakdown or struggle in mental function.</p>
<p>Disease comes from older terms for &quot;lack of ease&quot;, typically meaning <em>physical</em> or <em>biological</em> in origin. A sort of breakdown or struggle in biological function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of funny how disorders really have nothing to do with 'order' or lack thereof and diseases really have nothing to do with 'ease' or lack thereof.</p>
<p>Also 'chemical imbalance' has nothing to do with any balance or imbalance. But I guess vernacularly people misuse the word 'balance' a lot with things like 'a balanced diet' or 'my life feels in balance right now' which also has nothing to do really with balance or imbalance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add another one into the mix in case anyone is wondering,</p>
<p><strong>Sequence</strong>: a single underlying defect that sets off a chain of events that leads to a bunch more problems.</p>
<p>As an example, there is Potter Sequence, which is typically caused by kidney disfunction leading to a small amount of amniotic fluid in the womb. The amniotic fluid is typically what keeps a baby from getting squished, so babies with Potter Sequence come out with squished kinda malformed faces, clubbed feet, and some other things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in Potter Sequence the baby literally doesn't have enough room to grow and ends up squished?</p>
<p>And it's the mother's kidneys that are dysfunctional right, as opposed to the baby's?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the baby ends up not having the normal cushioning and gets squished. </p>
<p>And actually it's the baby's kidneys. Most of the amniotic fluid it just baby pee! </p></div>		</li>
