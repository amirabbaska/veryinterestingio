			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like as good a place to ask as any, so here goes:</p>
<p>How do modern spies work and what is their purpose? Surely most information is gathered through hacking these days as background checks and physical security are so strong. But if this is the case then surely they don't actually need to be in the target country?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hacking can be an expensive undertaking, sometimes taking years to yield results. While it is probably more valuable, there's still value in having a &quot;diplomat&quot; at the right party talking to a minor politician that has had too much to drink. Not everything gets digitized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's still plenty of spy work done by standing around at a street corner all day, talking to people or breaking into places / cracking a few ribs. Not every computer has a network connection, not every bit of information is on a computer in the first place or should be, especially in this day and age. There's a reason why the Russians have ordered typewriters:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weakest point in many security plans is people. Why brute force encrypted servers when you can pay someone to get the info for you? </p>
<p>Look how many people get busted for espionage. Everyone has a motivation you can use to get what you want. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What would happen if the US raided an embassy to arrest a spy? I mean, in all reality an embassy is only protected because the country it resides in allows it to be. What's stopping the host country from just waltzing right in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The host country doesn't want the same thing to happen to their embassies around the world.</p>
<p>Just like being in a fistfight.  Whatever you do to the other guy, he will do to you.  Poke him in the eye, bite his ear off, etc. and he will know that the fight is down and dirty so he will reciprocate.</p>
<p>Waltzing into an embassy/consulate is strongly frowned upon in the global political community since everyone has their secrets and the things that they don't want anyone else to know that they know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea is, countries need a certain number of bureaucrats in each other country dealing with various things, providing a point of contact between countries, helping trade etc. and they're not specifically allowed to stay to function as spies, it's just an inevitability that when you say &quot;yeah you can have a building in our country to deal with general admin&quot; the other country are also going to do a bit of snooping. This isn't necessarily malicious, the US and UK embassies in each country no doubt serve as spying stations to at least some extent, it's just a natural part of diplomacy to want to see what other countries are up to, even your allies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was why I found Europe's (faux) reaction to NSA stuff hilarious. Pretending they were so shocked that their ally would spy on them. And the thing is, some people bought it! Like, come on you na√Øve people, this world is for grown-ups. You know what European countries are doing to the US? Also spying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was never any formal agreement. It's more like countries started realizing that there were benefits to having agents operating under the protection of diplomatic immunity. These agents usually don't get directly involved in anything that would get their immunity revoked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do these diplomats actually wield a lot of power when influencing political matters? I would think that the ones being influenced would have advisors of their own too</p></div>		</li>
