			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure people realize it's in that order deliberately - it's an order of preference. In order to cut down on waste and pollution we need to think first about reducing how much we use, then about reusing, and then about recycling. I feel like it's completely backwards lol. I suppose at least people are trying?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reduce is <em>hard</em> at a consumer level. Sometimes reduction just doesn't occur between competing brands, especially for food.</p>
<p>Inversely, I work plastics. I got to keep eight kilos of plastic out of a landfill one day because I put a stopper into a machine that prevented the production of an obsolete part that we just threw away. Putting the stopper in cost us about $30 for materials and time, and saved us $20 worth of plastic. It will pay for itself next time we use the machine, but it is currently an investment that yielded a negative return.<br />
I also pushed for inline recycling procedures to be put in place, but those only started paying off after three months of constant effort. I kept nearly two tonnes of plastic out of a landfill, but it still only just paid off the cost of the granulator we use to regrind the plastic. Sure the granulator will be an asset that can be measured against the company's equity, but it's hard to show that when the company is a nest egg that will use up its assets rather than sell them.</p>
<p>As an aside, I have promised to turn in my resignation if we ever start producing disposable plastics. Hopefully my objection has been noted.</p></div>		</li>
