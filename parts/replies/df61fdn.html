			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like it wouldn't be too difficult to check if the password is contained within the question or answer during account creation.  </p>
<p>And if they circumvent this somehow, then it's their own fault if someone guesses it, rather than being the fault of a company who came up with an extremely easy question like &quot;what's the first name of your eldest sibling&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without derailing too much it's more difficult to check if the password is in the security question than you'd think. If the site is doing password management correctly, they don't actually store your password. </p>
<p>So the only way that what you're proposing would work is if you entered the security question on the same page as the password or they temporarily saved your password (not ideal). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that, that's why I was saying only during account creation.  You could perform the same check whenever they <em>change</em> their password by allowing them to change their security questions/answers on the same page as the password change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it really that hard?  Just require the password when setting/updating the security questions. </p>
<p>1) Verify password matches.
2) Check if password is in questions.
3) If either of the first two fail,  fail the whole transaction. Otherwise, proceed with transaction
4) Clear any data stored during transaction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They could hash each word or selection of adjacent characters more than the minimum required for a password and check them. Of course that doesn't cover &quot;ter2take swap around the beginning and endhun?&quot; But it would mean you actually have to try to be insecure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate it when it asks questions that I know people will know. I choose some 20 character password with upper and lower case and special characters and then have to protect it with &quot;Who is your favourite sports team?&quot; Anyone who knows me would know the that. It's all I talk about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or any question with a small set of answers... What was your first car? Probably an old Civic or Corolla. Who was your best friend in 5th grade? Probably Michael, Chris, Matt, Josh, Jessica, Ashley, Emily, Sarah, or Sam. What was the name of your first pet? Probably Bailey, Max, Charlie, Bella, Lucy, or Molly.</p>
<p>You better hope they implement these security questions with an account lockout after 3 wrong attempts and they make you answer more than one security question. Too much of this information is available on Facebook, anyways. You're just hoping that they found the Facebook page for a different John Anderson.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If their password system is done properly this would be impossible.  Passwords should never be accessable by the site.  If a site can send you your password you need to stop using their site immediately since their security is utterly broken.</p>
<p>Sites do not store your password and compare what you entered to it.  They stored an encrypted version of your password which they can't decrypt, if done right.  When you enter your password they encrypt it and compare.  So they authenticate you without ever having to know your password.</p>
<p>If they can send you the password it means they store it in plain text.  This is the Enterprise version of a post it note on your monitor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If they allowed users to define their own questions then some would be &quot;My password is *******.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate the questions. Where did my parents meet? In the city I live in. What was my favourite childhood toy? Well. Umm. My N64... Nintendo 64... or Nintendo64 or maybe I was thinking early childhood, in which case SNES. Or Super Nintendo. Super Nintendo Entertainment System? Or fuck maybe I put down my army men... or that remote control car... or....</p>
<p>Fuck that shit. First roommate. Brad. Bradley? I need to answer 5 questions on the same page and there's multiple possibilities for each. Everything is either so easy anyone could guess or so hard I can't get it.</p>
<p>Turns out I was probably wrong about my favourite person from history. But I got back my tax refund that day so didn't care about logging in any more. </p></div>		</li>
