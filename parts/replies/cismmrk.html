			<p>I mean that the <em>modern</em> DNS  is that everyone is agreeing to follow anything from ICANN and the IETF, and that agreement is with the International Telecoms union who has agreed to not do something else.  The ITU represents 193 countries in the world, and is itself a UN treaty organization.  <br><br>The ITU establishes how all of the telecoms systems of the world are connected, and it is a UN treaty organization, without it the &quot;Internet&quot; would be each country having their own walled off separate system that would not have uniform access rights between countries - in effect the way the postal system was before the international postal union, where you needed stamps for all of the possible countries your package could travel through.  Imagine an internet where if you wanted to resolve a server in Switzerland if you had to pay a US, EU, French, Italian, British (gibraltar) fee to access their routing systems and their name systems.  And with the ITU we might end up back there too.  But it is through the ITU that we have physical or radio interconnections between countries and oceans, and it is through the ITU that we agree that the US management of DNS is permitted.  But it's just that - management - and the ITU could try and essentially make their own DNS as a new international recognized standard.  Countries do that to some degree now (notably China) but no one else agrees to go along with them.   <br><br>It's a treaty in the sense that agreeing to let the americans keep running the show is an treaty to not do anything else.   The most boring kind of treaty.  But they have (repeatedly) agreed to this arrangement, as both China and Russia have actively pushed for the ITU run their own DNS, and the ITU membership (which is basically every country in the world ) has consistently declined.  <br><br>Definitely DNS was created by the US and is still largely run by the US, but that only works because everyone else agrees they're going to continue to go along with it, in part because they agree that they cannot agree to do anything else.  <br><br>Though the ITU could decide to break everything if they decide on a new DNS, but some member states refuse to go along with it.  Current DNS only works because we all agree to keep using the same system.  If we decided to have competing systems it would be a mess.  <br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>That's rather convoluted.  Nothing about the DNS or the administration of it was set up by or planned via the ITU, and the ITU has no particular authority over it.  If the ITU really wanted to somehow replace DNS administration with something else, that could get interesting, but it has never tried; that doesn't mean there was ever any &quot;treaty&quot; about it.  It all happened entirely outside the ITU's purview.  They never had much to do with it.  I think you're either imagining something that didn't happen, or somehow pretending that the mere fact that the ITU isn't acting in a ridiculous fashion and trying to replace DNS somehow means that they &quot;created&quot; DNS even though it was created entirely outside the ITU and they had no involvement in creating it or setting up the ways in which it is administered.</p>		</li>

			<p>I agree it's somewhat convoluted, but the ITU has repeatedly agreed to keep using the system established by the US and to not replace it.  That's how a lot if UN decision making bodies behave. <br><br>As to authority though,  the ITU has whatever authority member states grant it. If 192 of 193 countries all agree to build a new DNS then the US managed system ends up in the dumpster ( kinda, naturally the relationship between big countries, their allies and the UN depends a lot on specifics).  <br></p>		</li>

			<p>That's a very very very far cry from saying the ITU had any role in <em>creating</em> DNS, or anything about the way DNS is managed today.  It didn't.  All you're saying is that the ITU hasn't decided to try to wreck it or replace it with something of their own.  You also seem to presume that if they tried they'd succeed, which seems very unlikely to me.<br><br>&gt; If 192 of 193 countries all agree to build a new DNS<br><br>There has never been even a movement to <em>try</em> to make that happen, let alone any chance that such a movement would succeed.  That's totally irrelevant.</p>		</li>

			<p>There have been repeated efforts to change the structure, most recently by China and Russia in dubai or doha, the last meeting anyway.  <br><br>That plan didn't go anywhere because as much as we agree we don't like the Americans, we very strongly split on what the alternative would be like.  So we agree to keep letting them run the show.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I think you misunderstand what the question was about and are talking about different things, but we've gotten very far onto a tangent.  The original point remains: It is flatly, 100%, entirely, false to claim that DNS was created by treaty, or that the management of the DNS system for today's Internet was created by treaty, or anything of the sort.  I don't think you're even trying to claim that anymore.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sure.  And saying that the DNS system was created by treaty is completely false and not in any way simplifying anything.  It's just wrong information.  The complication came in trying to explain the ITU's lack of a role in the system.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;It is flatly, 100%, entirely, false ... or that the management of the DNS system for today's Internet was created by treaty<br><br>It is ITU treaty that has agreed to use the system the US created.  But that is an agreement, and it is central to the function of the internet.  Just the same as the ITU agreed to a phone DNS system developed by a national government the International postal union agreed to use the Prussian system I think it was (one of the german states anyway), international rules for ships at sea were set based on British standards after Titanic  etc.  <br><br>A bit of history:  In the 1980's there were a LOT Of DNS systems for various 'Internets' - DEC, Apple, Xerox, IBM  all had essentially proprietary networks, France had Minitel (which was a national rather than corporate Private internet). One of those many competing networks was ARPANET that had been around since 1969.  <br><br>Now we all know who won that battle - ARPANET became NSFNet became the Internet.  But that battle could have played out very differently.   <br><br>In 1996/1997 the ITU tried to take control of DNS - the plan had been for the ITU to take over IANA (or at least that was how they thought the plan went from Jon Postel, who in november of 96 thought he agreed to give them control of .int), and that 50 companies would get established to run 3 gTLD's each that was a combined working group of the internet society, WIPO and the international trademark association who thought this was the way to do things. <br><br>But that agreement - or lack thereof because in they end didn't agree determined what happened to the internet.  The Europeans felt (rightly) like the plan didn't include them, and the US felt (rightly) like the plan required a member state vote.  And member states didn't agree to the plan.   Partly because of US pressure and partly because it was a pretty terrible idea.  All the ITU ever got was control of .int and registration (Depository) of the signatories for the ccTLD's.  <br><br>In 1998 Jon Postel handed off control from 4 of the root servers away from the US to non government entities anyway. And then the NTIA and the US government wrote laws which people have been objecting to and trying to change ever since, but since the world is split between people who want wildly different things.  So in the end the ITU has considered the issue and declined to do so.  <br><br>The book telecommunications and Empire pages 140 and 141 has a fascinating take on it.  The OECD and EU, and the aforementioned working group all put forward various proposals for the ITU to take over before 2000.  And they never managed to agree on those plans.  And since then it has been people going to the ITU asking them to take over or make a new standard and the ITU says no- because the ITU is member states and member states can barely agree on the colour of an orange.   Such is the way of international organizations.  But it's very much the ITU and treaty rules that created the situation we have now.  In 1996 IANA was one guy - Jon Postel - and that was it, and despite his health scare in 1991 and the fact that the ITU has proposals to replace him in place, they didn't.  So the US did when he died in 1998.  <br><br>Without the ITU we'd probably have the same arrangement we had in the 80's with many separate internets but they'd be all nationally (and probably commercially) walled off and mutually incompatible.  It is because they agreed to not take over from Jon Postel in 1996 that we have ICANN- and because they have agreed to not take over with every proposal since that we still point all of our root servers <br><br>There have also been numerous alternate DNS setups implemented (which you can point at if you are so inclined) and that the ITU and Internet Society have... shall we say declined to endorse any of them.  (For the obvious reason that it's technical nightmare and the problems are tremendous.  Getting .biz over to ICANN properly was a bit of a mess for anyone pointed at Pacific Root).  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Where is the DNS system located? Like if I type google.com where does the signal go to find out what IP address it actually is? I'm assuming when you type google.com it goes to your internet service provider, who then connect to some DNS system server somewhere else, and get you your IP address.</p>		</li>

			<p>I believe lots of servers hold the DNS list and they are <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;msa=0&amp;amp;msid=103993808347197645891.00043a30b2657ea61ea33&amp;amp;ll=11.424429,26.178063&amp;amp;spn=142.883537,288.632813&amp;amp;z=2&amp;amp;om=1&amp;amp;dg=feature" target="_blank">located around the world</a>.  Your ISP may or may not have one... if they dont, they just request it from a DNS server.  You can also manually change your web browser to request an IP address from specific DNS servers too.</p>		</li>

			<p>PSA: Google operates a dns server at 8.8.8.8. If you're sick of getting a weird advertising-filled splash screen from your ISP when you mistype a URL, just change your connection settings to use 8.8.8.8. Also handy in the rare instance that your ISP's DNS servers go down but your connection to the internet still works. Happened to me multiple times in Phoenix on Cox over the years.</p>		</li>

			<p>The DNS system is spread out the 13 official root name servers are located around the world, but most isp's and several companies (including opendns and Google) run replicas.  That replication can be a complicated process.  <br><br>The servers (each of the 13) themselves are not really a box in a dudes basement they are usually really a globally distributed cluster of machines that all talk to each other.  <br><br>The root servers basically list all of the top level domain controllers (the people who control .ca, .com, .ag etc), and the your query goes off to them for the exact ip address.  <br><br><br>Your computer can also cache (temporarily store) entries for websites you frequently visit.  <br><br>Once you query the DNS system for an IP address routing takes over.<br><br></p>		</li>
