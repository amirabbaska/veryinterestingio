			<div class="markdown"><p>What's worth pointing out here is that the DNS system is a heirarchy of distributed servers. For example, if I want to look up www.google.com, starting at the 13 root name servers /u/sir_sri mentioned:</p>
<p>Me: Hey root nameservers, where's www.google.com?
Root Nameserver: I don't know, but server X handles .com. Go ask him.
Me: Hey server X, where's www.google.com?
Server X: I don't know but server Y handles google.com. Go ask him.
Me: Hey server Y, where's www.google.com?
Server Y: It's at IP 74.125.129.99.</p>
<p>In this case, Server X is operated by Network Solutions, who has the contract for .com. Server Y is operated by Google. However, Google registered their domain via MarkMonitor, who handles &quot;registering&quot; Google's information (most importantly, the IP address of the aforementioned Server Y) with NetSol's .com registry.</p></div>		</li>
