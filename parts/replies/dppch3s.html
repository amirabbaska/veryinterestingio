			<div class="markdown"><p>I know I'm not OP but I have a question about birth control if you don't mind to give me a simple answer for it. My fiance started taking birth control about a year and a half ago now. Not to prevent a pregnancy but rather to regulate her menstrual cycle, how exactly does birth control help with that and would there be any risk to her to stop it if we started trying for a baby?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It regulates women's menstrual cycle because the pills that are given, there's three weeks of hormone infuses pills and one week of placebos (my doctor said it was like &quot;sugar pills&quot;). The three weeks of hormones prepares your body, and the last week, which is the &quot;sugar&quot; pills, induces your period.
So every three weeks, I knew on the fourth week I was going to have my period.
In the beginning, it threw my cycle off a little bit because my body was getting used to the sudden influx of hormones I was taking every day, but after a couple of months it regulated my period and I knew exactly when I was going to have it, which was really convenient.
As for the risk, I'm not sure if there would be if she stopped so you guys can try for a baby. Just as my body was getting used to the sudden influx of incoming hormones, I'm sure it'll be the same if you had stopped it. I don't think there will be serious risks, but I would have her ask her doctor when she gets her birth control pills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, the research is still out on this one.  We do know that women are born with a finite number of eggs, and when they begin to run out so-of-kind-of coincides with menopause onset, but as far as I know, the relationship between egg numbers and menopausal onset are not strictly causal... menopausal onset has a lot to do with hormones, which definitely are impacted by sex organs, but there are a couple of different biological factors that determine levels of estrogen.  It’s definitely safe to say there is not a 1:1 ration of years on birth control : years menopause delayed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Birth control use doesn’t delay menopause.  Every period has multiple follicles that mature, but generally only one is viable and is ovulated.  The others or so aren’t ovulated, but simply break down and are eliminated.  So if you have 180,000 follicles at the start of puberty, you might only ovulate one mature follicle a month, but there will be dozens of immature follicles eliminated.</p>
<p>Birth control pills just prevent ovulation.  They don’t stop the maturation of mature or immature follicles.  Once you get below a certain threshold, your periods will become more irregular (due to less estrogen produced by the follicles) and ultimately will stop (i.e. menopause).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all. The idea that menopause is related to &quot;how many good eggs you have left&quot; is a total misconception, though it can be helpful to very very basic understanding. Your age and menopausal onset are generally correllated with the number of viable eggs, but not because they run out or anything. Most women will have plenty of eggs that never got released at all by the time they hit menopause, but the eggs will just degrade so they aren't viable, or the body won't be able to sustain the pregnancy. That's basically why women are not adapted to lifelong fertility: eggs degrade over a lifetime, and pregnancy fucks you up.</p>
<p>I guess it's possible the hormones have some other long term impact of menopause, but not because of the number of ovulations. Fewer ovulations do, however, lower rates of ovarian cancer. Women who have never been pregnant and never taken birth control see higher rates on average.</p></div>		</li>
