			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that this is one of the best answers to this question, because environments are not static either; they change and organisms adapt in reaction or die out.  For example, will we ever see the likes of Ediacaran fauna like <em><a href="http://facweb.furman.edu/~wworthen/bio440/evolweb/cambrian/opabinia.jpg" target="_blank">Opabinia</a></em> again?  The PreCambrian environmental conditions were so different from those around today.</p></div>		</li>
