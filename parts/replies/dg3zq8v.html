			<div class="markdown"><p>The design point is quite reversed actually.  They design them to target parts of the bacteria replication or cell wall synthesis etc.  Where the drug can get to in the body is a function of it's chemical structure and therefore a byproduct and not by design.  Vancomycin is a good antibiotic but won't get into the blood stream taken orally.  That is why it is usually given IV.  It is given orally for c.diff but that is precisely because it won't get absorbed and can therefore attack the c.diff in the intestinal tract.   </p></div>		</li>
