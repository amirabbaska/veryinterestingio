			<div class="markdown"><p>This would actually probably be easier than maintaining an array of free floating satellites. China would be my guess for the first ones to do something like that. They've been operating one there since 2013 and its been fairly successful</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually wouldn't be easier to maintain. Moon dust is actually extremely abrasive, and it does actually move around somewhat (contrary to popular belief). You'd have to clean the telescopes every few years, and that would be extremely hard given the abrasiveness of moon dust. Earth-Sun or Earth-Moon L2 is probably a better shout!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the motion of the Moon mean that we couldn't point lunar telescopes at the same place for long enough to get the type of pics we wanted? IIRC the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field image, for example, required the Hubble to be pointed at exactly the same spot for 11 days or similar. This just wouldn't be possible on the Moon. </p>
<p>This could all be total BS as I am utterly uneducated in these matters so please feel free to correct me wherever appropriate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm. why wouldn't it be possible on the moon? that's what equatorial mounts are for, to counter the motion of the body the telescope is sitting on. it's why we can get such great pictures from earth without star trails :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how many and how far apart they are. There really is no limit in theory. It just depends on how much time and resources you want to devote to it. The larger the array, the higher the resolution. We could get high definition images of stars on the edge of the observable universe, but our array might need to be light years in size. </p></div>		</li>
