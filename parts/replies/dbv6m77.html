			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm always arguing with people as to how Nietzsche was actively trying to fend off nihilism. I still don't understand as to why the vast majority of people believe he was a nihilist, or preached nihilism.

			<div class="markdown"><p>People tend to equate &quot;God is dead&quot; with &quot;there is no god, therefore nothing matters, there is no meaning of life, etc.&quot;.
It's kind of like... Those quotes where everyone only quotes the first part of the actual quote and it distorts the meaning? I can't think of a good example right now, but they definitely exist. Everyone just says &quot;Oh Nietzsche said that 'God is dead'&quot; and not that &quot;Oh Nietzsche said that 'God is dead' and therefore we should look to ourselves for life-affirming shit&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends. </p>
<p>I don't think it is, personally, but others I have discussed nihilism with use it as a word that is almost synonymous with depressed or hopeless. It's similar to how people misuse the word &quot;anarchy&quot; to mean, exclusively, &quot;chaos&quot; which I think is kind of unfair but whatever. I know plenty who think it I am wrong.</p>
<p>But with nihilism, I don't often feel depressed. It feels freeing in some ways. When I say that I believe life has no larger meaning, people think that's sad or cryptic but I don't. I think it's freeing to believe that or to be convinced of it because it allows me to make meaning of my life <em>for me</em> and not for some larger &quot;purpose&quot; or what have you. It allows me to enjoy the here-and-now more. </p>
<p>So, not sure but sometimes words can lose their meaning and be kind of warped into something else which can be a shame depending on the situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really nihilism. Nihilism is rather strict in that there's no meaning to life at all and there can't be. Essentially, there's no point to anything, not even living. It does sound drab, though I find appeal in it. But fundamentally, I can't be writing this comment and be a nihilist. Anyone that writes of nihilism isn't one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IMHO:  People think that life has to have a reason.  Religion tells us that there is a point to our lives, and that if you do X, Y, and Z then you will eventually be rewarded.  Some people also think that the only morality comes from religion and religious values.  If life is a marathon run, there is eventually a &quot;finish line&quot; that we can reach.</p>
<p>Nihilism suggests that life has no purpose.  Therefore, there is no reason for us to put forth effort towards achieving anything.  Instead of working towards a goal, you might as well just do whatever makes yourself happy.  If that means you just sit around doing drugs until you die, that's okay.  And if you hurt other people around you, it doesn't matter because nothing means anything in the long run.  </p>
<p>It doesn't help that this kind of mentality has been used to justify mass murder by Nazis, communist regimes, ISIS, etc.  If there is no God and nothing matters, it is easy to conclude that human life has no intrinsic value.  If human life has no value, why should I tolerate people who disagree with me?  Why should I bother helping the poor, or helping Syrian refugees?  Why not just kill them instead?  (I mean, it's not like we're going to be punished, because there is no God and no objective morality.)</p>
<p>This is where we have to go back to the ideal of the Ubermensch.  If there is no ultimate purpose to anything, then the answer to this is to make our own morality based on the principles of empathy and shared humanism.  If there is no obvious goal we have to work towards, then we have to be strong enough to identify our own goals and decide what meaning our life will have and what we will accomplish.  Not everyone is strong enough or self-aware enough to accomplish this.  Those who can't handle it routinely turn to drugs, distractions, or religions in an effort to ward off despair (or at least numb the pain of hopelessness).</p></div>		</li>

<p>What about &quot;If there is no God and things matter&quot;? What would that be called?</p>
<p>The whole &quot;No God = Nothing matters&quot; sounds like something a religious person came up with while having an existential crisis after realizing there is no God.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Likewise what would be my motivation to do the opposite of any of those things? If people truly wanted to kill each other they'd be doing it (some do but not enough to crash society). Not to mention Earthly deterrents (ie jail) are put in place, to mutual benefit, for this exact reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because nihilism is approaching the existential question on a completely wrong level of analysis. It posits the question on why things matter on an objective scale, a scale above human perception and a scale that spans an eternity. The thing is, it doesn't matter whether life has meaning on a purely logical basis or whether your actions will matter millions of years into the future. You're an animal and that gives your life some very real purposes and those are shared with all other animals, especially other humans. As a most notable starting point, pain and suffering exists and we strive to avoid it. What's wrong with a purpose like that? It doesn't apply to inanimate objects and isn't dictated by a divine power?</p>
<p>Moreover, we're irrational beings. We need to believe things in order to categorize things according to their importance in order to be able to act at all. Which means that without beliefs grounded in your cultural surrounding you're left with a hole where justifications of your future actions should be and all sorts of things could come in to help fill that hole. Which is especially dangerous coupled with the notion that human life has no intrinsic value.</p>
<p>To top it all off, even if we assume that an individual nihilist could derive and maintain a productive moral philosophy and be on good terms with themselves and society, they're rejecting stories and symbolism which bind people together within societies and create common values to operate under. They consider those artificial and thus meaningless. They're <em>artificial</em>, but not arbitrary, they're an emergent property of human interactions and they're very important.</p>
<p>Also, if you deny objective morality, then you can easily justify Machiavellian acts, as greater reward in the future definitely outweighs present evils.</p>
<p>Yes, nihilism is perfectly logically sound, arguably the most logical answer to existential question along with absurdism, but that doesn't mean it meshes well with human nature.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nothings wrong with it, but that's not the point. The point is that it's an opinion. An opinion most of us share, but still an opinion. Some people are going to disagree and you can't come up with an argument that asserts that your side is right and theirs is wrong. At least not a faultless one. </p>

<p>Which is wholly arbitrary in any case. (Nihilism is describing life not telling you how to live yours). </p>

<p>Again all of those things are arbitrary values that you're striving for. Of course they have explanations and uses, but they're basically universal accidents. They happened just because that's how things are. And a nihilist could easily just do those things because that's who they are, and that's what they do, without deriving any higher meaning from it. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>This argument is irrelevant to a nihilist. It's really irrelevant to anyone, which is the point of nihilism, but of course people will act that way because they're people and people want the things they want. Some people like Machiavellian traits, and that's how they act. Nothing good about that, or bad about that. Of course it might be bad for society or bad for this or that individual, but there's no one waiting up in the sky to punish you when you do wrong (which still doesn't assert a higher good, it just gives you more incentive to follow certain rules, an incentive already created here via human nature, jail, and the education system), so in the end it's not going to change anything. You genuinely can do anything you want and it will not matter. That's just how things are. </p></div>		</li>
