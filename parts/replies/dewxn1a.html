			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it's because everytime I think of cleaning off my keyboard and mouse, I'm using them and my computer is on. It's definitely not something that seems important enough at the time to shut down or hibernate my computer. That said I do take time maybe once a month before I turn on my computer or at the end of the day to clean the keyboard and mouse.</p>
<p>Further, using a damp Kleenex doesn't really help. I feel like I Need rubbing alcohol and a cloth or Q Tip or something.</p></div>		</li>
