			<div class="markdown"><p>On the third point of metadata, I used to frequent 4chan.  Someone made a post asking about how to go about approaching a specific girl that he really liked, but was too shy to admit feeling to. He included a partially anonymous photo of her.  He didn't strip any metadata.  So I decided to be Cupid. Was able to find the girl on Facebook (gps coords&gt;sale record for that address&gt;last name&gt; Facebook photo that matched partial photo) and messaged her.  I left out the part about him posting on 4chan, but said the guy she had a cigarette with that morning really liked her.  They ended up dating.</p>
<p>Not sure if I'm a creep or hero.  Probably creep.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but of all the creepy things a 4channer could have done with some girl's info, that seems like a wholesome thing to do</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm all for justice but not sure how I feel about law enforcement using CP to bait people. That CP resulted in a traumatized child, is it ethical to use it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not exactly CP, that was probably bad terminology. It would technically be called &quot;Jailbait&quot; and I'm not a 100% sure where they would get it from. I've seen them posted a couple of times, I'll try to capture a screenshot the next time i see one but I'm not sure that would be very wise. lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if you're right. I remember reading here (not this topic but one similar a few months back) that they use already filed pictures that can be identified because of the data on it. I don't know all the technical info, but they're easily able to track the picture and that they're reused pictures. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Jailbait are post-pubescent teenagers aged 13-17. People that are attracted to teenagers are called hebephiles. It's easy enough to bait them by using photos of an 18 or 19 year old that looks really young. </p>
<p>Baiting a pedophile would require photos of very young children and that is what I'm on the fence about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That could work. For it to ethical though, they'd need consent from the parents of that child. I don't have children but I'd be pretty pissed off if I found out a law enforcement agency was using photos of my kid to bait pedophiles without my permission.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes I understand that but I'm just wondering if it is ethical.</p>
<p>I think it would be fair and reasonable to approach victims of child pornography that are now adults and ask if their photos/videos can be used for investigation purposes. My bet is many victims would agree. </p>
