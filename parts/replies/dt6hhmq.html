			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to highjack the top comment, but it is also a product of etymology. &quot;Zangool&quot; or &quot;Jhangool&quot; just means forest in various languages that are found in Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan. In particular Hindi, Urdu and Pashto. Not sure if there are others languages tht use the same term. </p>
<p>More than likely, British colonists adopted the term and applied it to any tropical/sub tropical forest they encountered after their occupation of the region.</p>
<p>TL/DR: Jungle is just an adoption of an Urdu/Pashto/Hindi word for forest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the german language we also have the term <em>Urwald</em>, which is even more confusing. An <em>Urwald</em>, in the common sense, means jungle in this tropical manner. But actually it is also correct to call any ancient, untouched forests  <em>Urwald</em>, be it in the Tundra, in the tropics or in the mediterranian.. maybe there is a chronological limit behind it? Like the trees (and its surrounding oecosystem)  have to be at least 200 years old to call it an <em>Urwald</em>?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well the question would be &quot;how long would something like a forest have to exist to arrive at a stable condition?&quot; </p>
<p>Something like the red wood forests in California would take much longer because of the long life of the trees, and part of the ecology is in the recycling of the trees when they die and are replaced. </p>
<p>An example can be seen in the Amazon jungle.  It is now evident the massive areas were under cultivation when the Spanish arrived and most of the population was killed off due to disease. Yet we had no clue because of the jungle that had taken over.  </p>
<p>The life span of a Palm tree is maybe 100 years. (but produces fruit yearly)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every relatively untouched forest is <em>Urwald</em>, and that's the <strong>primary</strong> definition. There are several small ones in Europe, but most German speakers are not aware of those remnants (eg. in Poland).</p>
<p>By virtue of the dominant fraction of relatively untouched forests being tropical rainforests, <em>Urwald</em> gained the secondary meaning of exactly that. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>1776, &quot;dense growth of trees and other tangled vegetation,&quot; such as that of the swampy regions at the base of the Himalayas in India...<br />
Extended by 1849 to other places overgrown by vegetation in a wild, tangled mass. Figurative sense &quot;wild, tangled mass&quot; of anything is from 1850.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sounds like common usage predates Kipling by quite a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also interesting that &quot;jungle&quot; was adopted by English from South Asian languages even though they're apart of the same language group (Indo-European). Anyone have more insight as to how we differentiate between adopted words and shared roots within a language group?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before.  There's actually a lot of cool/weird instances where random words from faraway places make their way into the lexicon.  I like (USA) 'boondocks' from (philippines) 'bundok'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, the hindi/urdu word for forest is jungle( जंगल ) which the Britishers picked up from India just like many other words. Another example is loot ( लूट ) which the local population used to describe what they were doing, and which turned out to be the most apt word to describe their shenanigans.</p>
<p>Other examples - thug, tank, payjama, Avatar, karma, bungalow, bandana, cheetah, chutney, guru, cot, shampoo, dacoit,  juggernaut,khaki, mantra, veranda, typhoon, pundit etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did field work for a few years alongside biologists in Central American lowland tropical rainforest. Jungle is a word very commonly used to distinguish between the mature forests that have contiguous canopy and sparse undergrowth, and the jungles that have dense undergrowth. </p>
<p>Tropical forests transition over time from jungle to mature forest. It is the same biome in a different state of development. This comment suggests that because it is not a biome, it is not an accepted or useful concept, and they seemed to reach this conclusion by omission while reading a wikipedia article. Jungle is a useful word with an accepted definition, and people may be mislead by the above post because jungle is a word that modifies tropical rainforest to be more specific or &quot;precise.&quot; </p>
<p>If it is your job to walk across a large tract of tropical rainforest, it's extremely practical to use words like jungle to describe more or less passable areas of forest. Words like jungle or precipitous are not at all literary and when a colleague uses these words to describe an area on a map, it could mean the difference between walking at a brisk pace and making it to a field station in time for dinner, versus needing to cut a path with a machete at a snails pace, not reaching your destination, being stuck in a forest in the middle of the night, stepping on a snake and dying! (Yes, I'm being dramatic). Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome!  I'm a coral reef guy, so my forest knowledge is pretty much just what I learned in undergrad.  It absolutely makes sense that you would need to get more precise than just &quot;tropical rainforest,&quot; and of course &quot;jungle&quot; would be a useful word to do so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We also have alder trees that lose their leaves, so I wonder if we are the rare, temperate deciduous forest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless you're talking about deciduous temperate rainforests, of which there are many. (Edit) The southern Appalachian high platteaus are mostly deciduous temperate rainforest.</p></div>		</li>
