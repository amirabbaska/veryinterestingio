			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this, chunking an atom into smaller pieces and the resulting pieces having smaller masses works for every element above iron. For elements below iron it works vice versa -  when adding chunks you lose mass  (= mass). So if you combine two deuterium atoms you get a helium atom, which weighs less than the two deuterium ones. Thats how fusion works.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So this missing mass is accounted for in the energy released in the reaction?</p>

<p>Is this why iron production is the death knell of a star?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, once a star starts to produce iron in its fusion reactions it begins to die as iron is stable and will not undergo fission or fusion because both would put it at a point of higher potential energy. So the star keeps making iron and not getting any energy out of it until it dies</p></div>		</li>
