			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true for humans as well. A great example is eyesight. It tends to decline sharply after viable reproductive years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But does the success in reproduction decline with age? What matters is the age at which reproduction is reasonably successful, not the age at which reproduction is possible at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Even if there isn't a formal menopause for example in dogs the estrus cycle becomes irregular and infrequent with age. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I edited this to the comment but ability for reproduction is not only fertility.  It is very strongly correlated to general survivability. For instance life span of rats in wild is about 1 year, as a pet rats can live up to 2-3 years and they are fertile and capable of reproducing during that period. Rats in wild have so short lifespans because they have many predators. So a rat is not likely to live much more than a year in wild due to predation even if it's genes would grant it 10 years lifespan. Since rats rarely live beyond a year in wild, they can only reproduce during that period. As a result, only the genes essential for survivability for the first few years are selected by evolution. Now even when we keep rats as pets, they can only go for 2-3 years at max because they lack the mechanisms that allow longevity.</p></div>		</li>
