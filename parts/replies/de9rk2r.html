			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just speculating on what might be possible. I agree on your comment for actual temperatures. The temperature ranges I listed are survivable by many complex organic materials. Like several of the polymers. So there <em>might be</em> some life that could exist at those. But most chemicals start to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_decomposition" target="_blank">thermolyze</a> at those temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, the Tardigrade (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade</a>) can withstand temperatures between 1K and 420K (-272C to 150C).  It can also survive a wide variety of what we might consider as extreme conditions (e.g. 30+ years without food and water, ionizing radiation 100s of times greater than the lethal dose for humans).  However, it is NOT an extremophile since it merely survives in extreme conditions rather than thriving.</p>
<p>I think there is a range of finding life that goes from thriving colonies to expired survivors.  The thriving colonies point would be ~4.2 km (~125C) and the expired survivors point would be ~5.2 km (~150C).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is assuming that life exists under rules that we are aware of.  Why can't a different form of life exist under these conditions that requires different elements in order to maintain its survival? Whenever we look outside of our solar system we look for specific conditions necessary on order for life to occur based on what we currently know.  Maybe not all life is the same and maybe not all life requires these same circumstances.</p></div>		</li>
