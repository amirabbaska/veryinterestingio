			<div class="markdown"><p>Related related fact: the process of nucleation by which water turns into snow is made easier by impurities in water used for manufacturing snow by ski areas that make their own snow.  If your local ski hill's snowmaking water source is hard water, when all the snow melts there will be big white splotches of calcium and other impurities left behind.  When I worked at one it made the grass grow fast and thick in the spring.    </p>
<p>Also snow likes to pick up dust and dirt just from in the air and when you get a warm spell the top layer of snow quickly turns from white into a brownish haze until the groomers run over it and blend up the surface and make it appear halfway white again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just did the spotlight in dark room test a few days ago to see just how dirty our apartment is. Turned on fans like normal when we sleep and it was like snow. I'm a mouth breather when I sleep, no wonder Im endlessly congested.</p>
<p>3 stage high flow slandalone purifier arrived today and theres hardly anything when I do the spotlight test now, such a huge difference. </p>
<p>Will be swapping out the HVAC filters next</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also get a box fan and a 20x20 filter from the hardware store for $35. That'll get you 95% of the benefit of the bigger filter systems, at 5% the cost. That setup works wonders when you're doing construction at your house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went a bit overkill and got a 265sq ft unit for $157 (Amazon Winix 5500-2) since it had a washable charcoal filter. There are other more affordable units with similar ratings for less though. And as othera have stated, a box fan + filter + velcro is a MUCH cheaper option.</p>
<p>Box fan wont give you odor, germ or fine particle elimination though. I'm highly allergic to Cedar/Grass and live next to DFW Airport in Apartments. Essentially a bad air trifecta for me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get a decentish one that's good for a bedroom for around $100 bucks, or a good one for bigger rooms (like open living/dining room kitchen) for two or three times that.</p>
<p>If you suffer from allergies at all, it's well worth the cost.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there much of a difference (besides cost of electricity related to decreased airflow) between cheap filters (overlapping fibers) and more expensive ones (coffee filter looking ones)?</p></div>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/randomtask16" target="_blank">randomtask16</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>We change them fairly regular, but its an apartment with 90% carpet. Despite weekly vaccuming and no pets the carpet still has tons of dirt/dust in it. </p>
<p>In additon, our blower unit leaks pretty bad, when we close the bathroom door wherw it is there is noticable airflow under the door toward the unit, away from the actual intake. I assume with this much air bypassing the filter the ducting has to be nasty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you don't mean outside, if you move a lot through or by an area the dust doesn't have a chance to settle since the air constantly circulates. Also the amount of particles in the air will obviously affect how much dust gathers.</p></div>		</li>
