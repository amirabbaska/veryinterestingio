			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible, but no known system is deployed on ships or land bases. The Russians developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kontakt-5" target="_blank">armor</a> for tanks to protect against kinetic rounds.</p>
<p>I also couldn't imagine having that type of armor on ships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That kind of armor are intended for more conventional kinetic rounds. Against a powerful rail-gun you would probably need a cartonisly amount of armor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In order to intercept and destroy a purely kinetic projectile, you need to impart equal or greater kinetic energy at an opposite vector and with even distribution.</p>
<p>You need to shoot a bullet with another bullet, precisely tip to tip.</p>
<p>The reactive tank armor in your example is much too heavy for ships and would be ineffective against 20 rounds per second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That link you posted, am I understanding it correctly that they're talking about placing explosives between armour plates in order to protect against explosive rounds? That makes little sense to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely can. </p>
<p>All you need to do is cause it to yaw a tiny amount or destroy/damage the stabilizing fins. </p>
<p>Its own motion through the air will do the rest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only problem is that it is moving at Mach 6 and is quite heavy. Intercepting with something that is fast enough and has enough force would require.,,
Perhaps a rail gun </p></div>		</li>
