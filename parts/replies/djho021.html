			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a thing. A cursory DuckDuckGo search <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2943-brain-tumour-causes-uncontrollable-paedophilia/" target="_blank">brought this up</a>, but I already knew of this story - if not in any amount of detail.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> man gets brain tumor, pedophilic urges come up. He gets it removed, they disappear. Not surprising when you consider who we are is just a squishy 1-kg jellyfish - all sorts of things can happen, do happen, when you mess with the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Downvoted.  </p>
<p>Yeah, googling &quot;tumor that causes a person to want to fuck children&quot; doesn't turn up any results.  I'll gladly reverse my vote on your lack of help if you can provide me with further information.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even aside from less obvious muscles like the heart and those in the digestive system, can you really control the more obvious muscles? There's a shitload of muscles in your neck, for example. Maybe you can tense up your neck to some degree, but can you tense up just the left anterior scalene inserted at the C5 vertebra? Hell no you can't. It's probably a good thing too, your muscles all work together to balance and stabilize things. If you could really control individual muscles you'd probably end up breaking your own neck or shredding ligaments in your leg or something horrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to this smooth muscle in the media of most of your larger arterial network which controls the dilation of your vessels to maintain adequate flow. Also during normal gait your sensorimotor network performs many automatic adjustments to minimise heal impact. Indeed, one could even argue that the muscles you think you're in control of are actually dominated by pain receptors and I think it might therefore be fair to say that you are actually not really in control of any of your muscles.</p></div>		</li>
