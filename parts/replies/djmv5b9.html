			<div class="markdown"><p>You can ignore the fact it's Trump (it's not political, purely infrastructure), but watch this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffkI999rxh8" target="_blank">This is all the work needed just to approve the plans for a 18 mile road, not even a highway, in Maryland... $24,000 per page. </a></p>
<p>Regulations and all the approvals needed today aren't all too necessary. It took 4 years to build the Golden State Bridge, and 5 years to build Hoover Dam.</p>
<p>Now you need 15 years to build asphalt for cars to drive on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a bridge near where I live that needs repair. My community wants and needs it fixed.</p>
<p>For some reason because I live in Allegheny County, which is the county seat of Pittsburgh we have to get a regulatory approval that this doesn't interfere with Bald Eagles, Peregrine Falcons, and migratory Canadian Geese.</p>
<p>To get that approval we need to spend $600,000.</p>
<p>To make sure a 20 yard bridge won't affect birds that don't live here. Not the migratory ones. Peregrine falcons and bald eagles don't live in my community. </p>
<p>That's $176 per person that lives here to make sure an animal that doesn't live here won't get affected by a bridge that people need to drive over.</p></div>		</li>
