			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, friendly neighborhood chemist here. I can answer how much that bucket would weigh different...</p>
<p>According to the International Union for Pure and Applied Chemistry, at standard temperature and pressure Radon typically exists as a monoatomic gas with a density of 9.73kg/m^3 .</p>
<p>So, let's say we filled a 5-gallon sealable bucket with radon at standard temperature and pressure (i.e. roughly room temperature at sea level). First, let's convert 5 gallons to cubic meters. 5 gallons is roughly equal to 0.0189 cubic meters.</p>
<p>Okay, we know the density of radon as well as the volume of it used. From that we can calculate the mass of radon in the bucket.</p>
<p>(9.73kg/m^3 ) × (0.0189m^3 ) ≈ 0.183897kg</p>
<p>So, the bucket contains 0.183897 kilograms of radon under these conditions. Let's convert that back to imperial units... 0.183897 kilograms is roughly equal to 0.405 US pounds.</p>
<p>So it contains roughly 2/5 of a pound of radon gas. At STP, Radon gas is 8 times more dense than air, so this volume of radon weighs 8 times more than the same volume of air would.</p>
<p><strong>So I would say yes.</strong> If you took two buckets that were exactly the same and filled one with air and the other with radon gas and then sealed both, the one with radon gas in it would probably feel heavier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With half-life of 3.8 days that would be some hot bucket, literally... half life of 3.8 days gives us lambda of 2.1 E-6/s , your bucket has 0.82 moles in it, or 0.82 <em> 6 </em> 10^23 atoms, so you have <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=0.82+*+6E23*2.1E-6%2Fs+*+%285+MeV%29" target="_blank">0.82 <em> 6E23</em>2.1E-6/s * (5 MeV)</a> = 828 kW of heat from radon's alpha-decay alone, not to mention the daughter isotopes (several times that).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radon gas has a density of 9.73 kg/m^3, vs air which is 1.2754 kg/m^3, so assuming you held an average beach ball (1 meter diameter) full of Radon, and it would weigh 3 kg more than the same ball filled with air.</p>
<p>That's definitely noticeable - it's about the same as two 1.5L water bottles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>is it possible for a gas to be so dense that an uncompressed bucket of it would be noticeably heavier than an empty one?</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PJTq2xQiQ0" target="_blank">somewhat related demonstration</a> that is kind of interesting involving sulfur hexafluoride and an aluminum foil &quot;boat&quot;.</p>
<p>The bad news is that SF6 is <a href="http://apps.sepa.org.uk/spripa/Pages/SubstanceInformation.aspx?pid=10" target="_blank">about 23,000 times as bad as carbon dioxide</a> when it comes to its global warming potential.</p></div>		</li>
