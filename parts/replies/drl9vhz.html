<blockquote>
<p>The total injury rate was almost the same between two groups; however, the incidences of muscle/tendon injury and low back pain were significantly lower in the stretching group (p &lt; 0.05). Static stretching decreased the incidence of muscle-related injuries but did not prevent bone or joint injuries.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A typical muscle stretching protocol performed during preexercise warm-ups does not produce clinically meaningful reductions in risk of exercise-related injury in army recruits.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15495679" target="_blank">The role of flexibility in injury prevention and athletic performance: have we stretched the truth?</a> (2003):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of stretching to prevent injury, off-set muscle soreness, and improve performance has been widely accepted and promoted in sports. However, little or no scientific evidence supports the practice, and recent research suggests that stretching, which increases flexibility beyond that needed for sport-specific movements, may cause injury. This article presents studies that have looked at the effects of stretching on injury and performance. Many earlier studies that showed benefits of stretching did not look at the effects of stretching alone; they also involved general cardiovascular workouts in the experimental but not control groups. More recent research shows that general fitness, rather than stretching, is a more important risk factor in injury prevention. This article also discusses studies of the relationship between joint laxity and injury and the role that stiffness may play in enhancing performance and preventing injury. Overall, the evidence suggests that increasing range of motion beyond function through stretching is not beneficial and can actually cause injury and decrease performance. These findings should be used to challenge common warm-up practices in athletics.</p>

<p>A higher injury rate appears when switching from one regimen to the other, because lax ligaments need different handling than those not stretched.</p>

<p>People develop different strategies for using their articulations with or without stretching. When they switch from one to the other, they keep their old habits, increasing the risk of injury.</p>
<p>The best example is a runner's ankle: without stretching, it can handle rougher landings, but when the runner starts stretching all of a sudden because he's in a race an he sees others doing it, the suddenly laxer ligaments are no longer able to withstand the strain he keeps putting them under.</p></div>		</li>
