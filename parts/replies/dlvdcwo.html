			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way, what you are really describing is the difference between an open-label and blinded study, but I think you are asking about accidental unblinding due to either efficacy or safety. To the that point, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24350975" target="_blank">this study</a> doesn't directly answer the question, but shows a very high and statistically significant correlation between AEs and efficacy, which the authors suggest spontaneously unblinded patients to active treatment which gave a sense of increased efficacy.</p>
<p>I can't find it now, but I recall a presentation at a meeting where a fair number of patients were able to determine whether they were on blinded drug or placebo due to AEs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The placebo effect for the most part affects conditions that rely heavily on self-reporting to measure their effectiveness. </p>
<p>Where fixing a broken bone or reducing cholesterol are measurable through direct observation, something like depression or fatigue are not. Hence why the placebo effect can be so powerful. </p>
<p>That said, there are still similar effects in any drug trial. Take the cholesterol example I give above. Someone given the placebo pill, &quot;wants&quot; the experiment to work. When they present for their next examination, they want see that their cholesterol has gone down. This is a natural human desire to succeed and to see others succeed. </p>
<p>So that person may consciously or unconsciously engage in behaviours which will have a positive effect on cholesterol - walking, eating right, etc. </p>
<p>So at the end of the trial the placebo will appear to have had a physiological effect, even though it didn't. Through comparing the placebo -v- drug results then you can work out what the actual effectiveness of the drugs is. So if real recipients see a 10% improvement in cholesterol and the placebo group sees a 5% drop, you can say the drug on its own reduces cholesterol by 5%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091-6749\(07\)00577-5/fulltext" target="_blank">There are definitely objective responses to placebo, such as in asthma.</a></p>
<p>The reverse of this article is true: I can't find it now, but in one study patients administered what they were told was inhaled allergen had measurable decreases in lung function even though they were given atomized saline.</p>
<p>*Edit - had to fix article link had parentheses and messed up Reddit's formatting.</p></div>		</li>
