			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but your body will reshift your macro nutrients so after about 8 (most likely less, just a conservative number) it WILL cancel out. That being said exercise does more than just burn calories, and doing so will probably make you lose more weight than not eating and not exercising</p>

<p>Common misconception, exercising helps you becoming /staying fit, not losing much for weight.</p>
<p>Eating less than you need, that helps lots with weight loss. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what OP meant was if you work out and burn 500 calories a day and eat those 500 calories extra in the long run this will be better because you will get some muscle growth (depending on the workout) which means that in the future your base calorie need will be increased so you can eat more while staying at the same weight. </p></div>		</li>
