			<div class="markdown"><p>We will only be guessing at how sexual reproduction began. How bacteria share DNA is only a hint as to how it happened. They are Prokaryotic. We are eucaryotic. The important thing is that it enabled the blending of mutations into one organism even when they occurred in separate organisms in a species. Evolution happened much quicker after that.</p></div>		</li>
