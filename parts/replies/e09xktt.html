			<div class="markdown"><p>So, my understanding is that in implosion type weapons, the conventional explosives compress the fissile material to a certain density, and once this density is reached the material reaches criticality. Then in gun type weapons, there is no real change in density in the material itself, but two pieces of fissile material are brought together, and reach criticality when they are together. Is this correct? </p>
<p>Also, what is the difference between a nuclear weapon and a nuclear reactor designed for generating power? Is it the same reaction, and the neutron absorbing control rods in the reactor are the only thing stopping the whole thing from exploding? Is there some other limiting factor here, or is it maybe a different type of reaction? I’ve been interested in nuclear weapons practically my whole life, but this is something I’ve never understood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a very high conceptual level, the difference between a nuclear reactor and an atomic (i.e. not thermonuclear) weapon is the rate of the reaction. They operate on identical principles: a neutron is introduced into the nucleus of an unstable atom. The unstable nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, some liberated binding energy, and a varying number of neutrons. The neutrons given off may have many different fates, one of which is to strike another nucleus and start the process over. If, on average, every neutron that starts a reaction results in at least 1 neutron being released that also then goes on to cause another fission, that's a chain reaction.</p>
<p>Now, the apparatus that this reaction occurs in has a property called criticality that is determined by its geometry, fuel, etc. (in short, its design). Criticality is, at its core, a measure of how many neutrons from a given reaction go on to cause other reactions. If the criticality of a design is less than 1, then over time, the reaction fades and stops since each generation of reactions releases fewer neutrons to cause more reactions than it took to start that generation of reactions. A chain reaction is not possible, and the power output of the device wanes as the neutron population dwindles. This is called subcriticality. If the criticality, however, is exactly 1 the reaction will continue ad infinitum, never dropping or gaining in power output as long as nothing in the setup changes to make its criticality deviate from 1. Finally, we have criticality greater than 1, or supercriticality. This is where the interesting things happen. These reactions proceed at an exponentially growing rate. If the criticality is 1.1, then in the first generation, I have one neutron (on average) to cause another reaction, but in the second generation, I have 1.1 neutrons (on average) to cause further reactions. In the third, 1.21, and so on and so forth. Since each reaction liberates a little bit of energy, if I'm constantly creating more reactions every generation that the reaction proceeds, my energy output grows in time as the number of reactions grows in time. In other words, supercritical reactions have an exponentially growing power output.</p>
<p>Now, there is one other wrinkle here. It's the idea of delayed and prompt criticality. When we talk about criticality, we talk about how many neutrons each generation of a reaction produces that can then trigger another reaction. However, there's another subtle concept at play here of delayed criticality. Not every neutron that can cause another reaction is immediately released when an atom splits. Sometimes, due to decay cascades, a neutron capable of causing another reaction is released many seconds after the initial fission that leads to its creation. This means that a reaction device can be designed that is prompt critical, meaning that only the neutrons released immediately by the reaction are needed to keep the reaction critical. Since these reactions take place over the span of nanoseconds, the exponential power rise takes place extremely quickly, as only the neutrons released at the instant of the reaction are required to generate the exponential rise; every few nanoseconds, a new generation of reactions greater in number than the last is created. This extremely brutal and rapid power rise is generally very hard, if not impossible, to control. On the other hand, a reaction device can be designed so that the contributions from the delayed neutrons are required to maintain criticality; the neutrons released at the instant of the fission are not enough to maintain criticality on their own and this is called delayed criticality. Since the neutrons responsible for maintaining the system's criticality may take many seconds to manifest, the increase in power of a delayed critical reaction happens over timescales of seconds and that allows it to be measured and controlled. For instance, if you see the power output of a delayed critical device start to rise, you can insert materials into the devie that soak up neutrons and return the device to a subcritical state. When you want the power to rise again, you can remove enough of the neutron absorbing materials to allow it to become delayed critical again. However, if designed properly it can never become prompt critical. It can still explode because its power output still rises exponentially. It just rises slowly enough that even if control is completely lost, the device blows itself apart before it can release a truly devastating amount of energy and you don't explode with the power output of an atomic weapon; you get Chernobyl instead of Hiroshima.</p>
<p>So, all of that is to say that an atomic weapon and a nuclear reactor are basically the same thing and have fundamentally identical nuclear physics driving them, but with two very different ideas on how critical the device should be and two very different designs (geometries, fuels, controls, etc.) intended to implement the degree of criticality required for their purpose.</p>
<p>An atomic weapon is designed and built so that they go from a safe subcritical state to an extremely prompt supercritical state at detonation as quickly as possible. This means the exponential reaction increases on nanosecond timescales based on the neutrons released at the instant the atom splits and releases power at a exponentially growing rate that will destroy a city before the device disassembles itself a hundred nanoseconds or so after the device reaches prompt supercriticality. Luckily, this is extremely hard to do because any tiny mistake results in a device that doesn't have enough supercriticality to liberate enough energy to destroy a city before it blows itself apart.</p>
<p>A nuclear reactor, on the other hand, is designed with the idea that prompt criticality is to be avoided at all costs and that the transition from a safe subcritical state to a BARELY delayed critical state happens as slowly as possible. This allows for control mechanisms that can maintain the delayed criticality of the system basically right at 1 so it releases power at a fairly steady rate that will power a city and not blow itself apart even as it operates for years on end.</p>
<p>Thermonuclear weapons are a completely different wall of text. Their physics are not fundamentally 100% identical to a nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>Also, I made a few simplifications for the sake of the explanation that aren't precisely technically correct if you follow the strict physics and math behind it but the concepts are there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this is really good. This helps me understand it a lot. </p>
<p>Could you maybe explain what happens in a thermonuclear reaction? From what I’ve read in this thread, my idea is that the hydrogen fuel allows the release of more neutrons, which allows more of the fissile material to undergo fission. My guess would be that the fusion reaction between hydrogen atoms releases more neutrons than a fission reaction. Is this something like what happens? </p>
<p>Whatever this fusion reaction is, it must also be taking place in boosted atomic weapons, which use tritium and deuterium to boost the yield of the weapon. My guess for this would be that in a boosted atomic weapon, the hydrogen fuel causes more of the primary weapon’s fissile material to undergo fission, while in a thermonuclear weapon, the hydrogen fuel causes  material other than the primary to undergo fission. From what I’ve read on Wikipedia, the design of thermonuclear weapons incorporates a plug, or tamper, of fissile material, and fission of this material is what causes the massive yield of the hydrogen bomb. Is this correct? </p></div>		</li>
