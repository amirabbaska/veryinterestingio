			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the salinity boundary that might exist perhaps create some sort of osmotic membrane even though it's just two fluids moving side by side? I'm just asking, I don't have any knowledge in this area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's density driven. In general, liquids of different densities don't like to mix. This is true even when the density differences are due to dissolved particles. Check out the wikipedia for pycnocline for more info (although this is more the density gradient through the water column, not along the surface of the water. It's the same mechanism though.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The salinity and temperature differences would help with keeping the two water bodies separate, whereas the color difference is purely the sediment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sediment load is part of what determines the density of the fluids and sediment load (along with velocity, flow type, salinity, temperature, density, etc) contributes to fluids staying separate.</p>
<p>You can see in this <a href="http://www.sagemagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DSC8152.jpg" target="_blank">photo of the Rio Negro convergence</a> a similar thing happening.  These are two rivers, both fresh water, both the same temperature.  One is black because of dissolved tannins, the other milky because of sediment transport.</p>
<p>In this case there is no salinity or temperature difference (or extremely minimal at any rate).  The differences are primarily due to sediment, flow velocity, and volume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the colors, despite being the most visually obvious difference here, are actually just an unrelated outcome. The main reason the two different types(?) of water are being separated is more specifically attributed to other factors, that are not quite visually polarizing....?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having lived right where this happens in Umhlanga/Umdloti for many years, I can say that this would happen whenever the river would burst its banks after a storm or heavy rain. This muddy river water would gradually creep along the coastline, and swimming in it you would find that instead of deep water and normal beach sand, you could walk knee-deep quite far out into the surf on soft, very fine mud, almost like a clay.</p>
<p>You could also pick up a handful of said mud anywhere and find these tiny white worms inside. Never sure what they were but they only seemed to be in the mud.</p>
<p>What you’re seeing isn’t just muddy water, it’s mostly a creeping sandbank moving along the coastline. That, plus the meeting of two bodies of water with different temperatures and densities are most likely to blame for the distinct difference in colour.</p></div>		</li>
