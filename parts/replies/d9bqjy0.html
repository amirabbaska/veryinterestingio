<p>I'm Scottish. I have never watched it in my life. But my Uncle Donald tells me all about it when he's golfing. Got one right in the bunker the other day. Sure the conversation was about golf. Certain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HBO isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last week you saw a channel with such ability and movement with TV? HBO puts cable in another level and we will be blessed if we ever see a channel with its ability and passion for TV again. Fox News breaks records. Disney breaks records. HBO breaks the rules. You can keep your statistics, I prefer John Oliver</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: there are anecdotal reports that on substantial doses of dextromethorphan (cough medicine) for prolonged periods, you eventually lose recognitio  of your own inner monologue. Instead it feels like someone telling you what to do and you simply do it. Like: &quot;i'm tired, that chair sure looks inviting&quot; becomes &quot;sit down. You're tired&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I never experienced a third person monologue on DXM, I did loose motor coordination and forget who/what I was. My friends had to carefully walk me home one time because I felt that if I was hit by a car I'd just wake up a new person the next day. I don't think that's a particularly strong argument for reincarnation.</p>
<p>I also used to love ketamine which is very similar to DXM. Coming out of a K hole one time I thought I was Scotsman living in a run down, heroin den in inner city London. I was still in my quite nice bedroom in Australia.</p>
<p>I know you were just adding a fun fact, but I used to believe all these experiences had profound implications on psychology and philosophy. In reality I was just fucked up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took maybe 100mg, so like 3 capfuls or something.  This was for withdrawal easing, not trying to robotrip.  But that stuff is no joke.  Makes you a little psychotic, manic, eyes darting around.  I got a bit of dissociative anxiety that I get when I take too much of anything and stray too far away from the real me, so I have no interest in going full monty on that stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be the scaffolding by which a lot of early psychology and philosophy was founded though, so you had a conclusion somewhat adjacent to the truth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had this when I had a massive fever.</p>
<p>Except I had several versions of myself commanding me, all dressed up as racial and cultural stereotypes.</p>
<p>Listening to music made them shut up. I think the mexican was fighting the chinese one for dominance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have extremely vivid nightmares related to migraine health and in one of them I dreamt I was fleeing a threat and found shelter and in the shelter were six other identical copies of myself each simply wearing a different colour but otherwise plain t shirt. </p>
<p>Purple, Teal, Yellow, Orange, Green, Red. I did not consciously realize they looked fucking exactly like me until I woke up. </p>
<p>In the nightmare we had to climb out a second story window to hide on a roof and Teal fell to her death.  </p>
<p>I've also gone to sleep with a terrible head ache and woken up with temporary memory problems. The most severe incident came when I fell asleep after reading For Whom the Bell Tolls and when I woke up I couldn't remember how many people I lived with and was anxious that I was supposed to be doing something before they got home. (I only live with my husband) I was also really really confused about whether or not Pilar and Pablo were real people I had spoken to or not.</p>
<p>I ended up piecing it together when I logic'd out that it was suspicious that I couldn't determine if characters were real or not and I must be having irrational thoughts. Recognizing this made me relax and then it all came back like frost fades from glass.</p></div>		</li>
