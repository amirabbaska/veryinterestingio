			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. It also explains why you should NOT put salt on ice in VERY cold weather; it will tend to melt the top of the ice, which will then refreeze, probably to a slicker surface than it was originally. The point to remember is that the salt doesn't melt ice directly, it changes the temperature at which ice melts.</p>
<p>For ice cream, of course, you want the cream to freeze faster, so lowering the freezing point will make it happen faster at a given temperature.</p></div>		</li>
