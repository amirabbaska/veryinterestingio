<p>When you stutter or mispronounce your words because you get excited, nervous or wound up in some other way, you're almost always breathing with your chest.</p>

<p>I think you'll find that the research indicates a good chunk of the Western World breathes by expanding their chest and not their stomach on a regular basis. At the very least this can't be a sole cause for stutters or everyone would be stuttering constantly.</p>
<p>Unless you mean something like using the chest muscles to assist the diaphragm. That sounds like it would be a more unusual situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure most people are good at managing 'their setup' most of the time, but I also said it's when people get wound up during a conversation for various reasons. It's the breathing that lowers ones capacity, and when we get into conversations that demands more than normal we sometimes fumble our words due to the stakes, intensity or whatever else reason is creating more pressure/desire to not fail to communicate.
It depends on the conversation whether I engage in chest-breathing, if there's a lot of people talking and it's a more high-intensity environment you first need to sync up to the pace of it to be able to direct the flow of it. Copying their body-language would then help.
I'm always mindful of how I position it though, I want to have my shoulders directly beneath my feet... good posture makes it much easier to do this by default.</p></div>		</li>
