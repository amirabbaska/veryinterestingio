			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of the continuum, as you describe, isn't it just semantics as to what we &quot;know&quot; and what's just hypothetical?  Isn't the line kind of arbitrary - and you could make a nihilistic argument that we don't truly &quot;know&quot; anything?  Do we &quot;know&quot; that electrons exist or do we just have a ton of observations that are all consistent with them existing?  I mean, I haven't seen one (and physically can't with my bare eyes) but would me seeing/touching one be any different than a sensor detecting one and measuring it's properties?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an experimental physicist. I most like the logical positivist view. Consider the following statements:</p>
<p>(1) Electrons exist.</p>
<p>(2) Observations of all experiments obey the expectations of a theory that includes electrons.</p>
<p>To me, both (1) and (2) are the same statement (or, at least, they contain the same idea expressed using different words in English).</p>
<p>To the extent that, in a certain energy regime and at that scale and so on, experimental results are indistinguishable from a universe in which electrons exist; in that energy regime and scale and so on, electrons can be said to exist.</p>
<p>I do not believe there is a more meaningful notion of existence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the general idea here, but I think it might be a bit incomplete, though.  (2) doesn't necessarily imply (1) because it doesn't take into account some notion of the number or rigor of the observations.</p>
<p>As an example, imagine that I noticed that every time I wore my lucky socks last year, my team won their baseball game.  I could conclude that &quot;in 2016, there was a magic spirit that made my team win whenever I wore its favorite socks&quot; and it would be true for every observation so far.  Yet, nobody (well, almost nobody) would say that '/u/deto's magic spirit of 2016 exists' as a result.  To chart how the word 'exists' is actually used, we'd probably need some notion of 'A <thing> exists if the probability of all the observations of <thing> occurring in the absence of <thing> is less that <some value>'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you would be willing to endorse statements like &quot;nothing existed before human beings&quot; or perhaps &quot;nothing existed prior to the advent of the modern scientific method&quot;? Or at least &quot;electrons did not exist prior to 1897?&quot; What about statements like &quot;it is impossible for the scientific community at large to mistaken about the existence or non-existence of anything&quot;? Because those seem like pretty straightforward consequences of your equivalence.</p>
<p>Logical positivism is pretty much dead. It was briefly a very influential movement. But I don't think any philosophers &quot;are&quot; logical positivists anymore. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Experimental science - especially the natural sciences, but also most of social science, medicine, etc. - is as its core statistics: The vast majority of things can't be observed unambiguously and therefore answered by a binary decision (yes/no).<br />
<strong>Every</strong> scientist is a statistician.</p>
<hr />
<p>In that vain: We <strong>don't know</strong> that electrons do exist.<br />
We <strong>do know</strong> for sure that (after all these experiments where results were conclusive and in agreement with the theory) there is a 0,00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% (arbitrarily chosen - it's still much lower...) <strong>possibility</strong>, that what we've observed is due to chance.<br />
Most people agree that we can call it &quot;<em>knowing</em>&quot; at that (un)certainty, though...</p>
<p>A more recent example: CERN &quot;finally&quot; called the Higgs boson by its name 2017 instead of calling it a &quot;candidate&quot;/'possible Higgs boson&quot;. The first official announcement 2012 was with a 5 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval" target="_blank">sigma confidence</a>.
That means in 1 of ~3 million &quot;universes/worlds&quot; a result with similar confidence would have occurred even though the theory is not correct (or less hypothetica: If the theory was false and we repeated <strong>all</strong> experiments and measurements 3 million more times, aggregated all the data, etc. we expect that the current result will never ever repeat itself in any of the 3 million experiments)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why the belligerence? I didn't claim to be an authority on the subject, and I accept any corrections made by a proper astronomer -- I simply wasn't aware that anything I wrote was controversial.</p>
<p>As I mentioned explicitly in my answer, there is a continuum in the directness of measurements -- some are more direct than others. The observation of gravitational waves (which I also mentioned explicitly in my answer) is indeed about as direct as many other observations in astronomy -- the waveforms fit nearly perfectly those expected from theoretical calculations of a binary black hole merger -- but it still isn't a direct observation, which would, for example, be a detection of Hawking radiation or occlusion of background stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it's a matter of taste, but I would argue occlusion of background stars is less direct than gravitational waves. What I mean is that we have observed radiation emitted from the BBH system. All of observational astronomy is also looking at radiation coming from objects in space, the only difference being the type of radiation.</p>
<p>PS. sorry my first comment started off so ornery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With regard to neutron stars, can we observe them, and if so do we observe a distinct lack of very massive neutron stars that is compatible with their collapse into a black hole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a very good question! The directness of the observation, of course, falls on a continuum, and the example of neutron stars is a good one.</p>
<p>I know that neutron stars are observed as &quot;pulsars&quot; -- extremely intense sources of X-rays that have the periodicity of the rotation of the star about its axis. But the mass of a neutron star is not very easy to measure, and generally has huge error-bars.</p>
<p>Regardless, suppose we histogram the masses of such pulsars and we find that it falls off sharply at some point (rather than following the weak downward trend in the data up to that mass). That indeed would be a sign that something interesting is going on at that edge. But as far as I know, we don't have enough statistics at present to reach this conclusion. But I could be wrong -- my area of expertise is high energy experiment, where we deal with length scales a few tens of orders of magnitude smaller :-)</p>
<p>In any case, this cliff in the histogram would be a hint, not direct evidence of black holes. For instance, we could also have quark stars or electroweak stars, both of which would also lead to this cliff.</p></div>		</li>
