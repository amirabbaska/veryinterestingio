			<div class="markdown"><p>File this under games people play when they have access to pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>I was working in a hospital pharmacy.  It could be bone numbing boring at times.  It could also be 'fight or flight' at times.  An alarm bell would sound, sending the closest pharmacist and technician to the closet to grab the crash cart and run to the announced site of the code.  This was state of the art stuff for the 70s in a training hospital.  </p>
<p>The adrenaline high was very real, and learning to think and control your movement after that alarm bell rang took some time.</p>
<p>But that's not the story that came to mind.  We were sitting around, bored to tears, and I was fiddling with some orders when I managed to give myself a papercut on my finger.  It burned like hell and started to form a drop of blood.  A co-worker grabs an ampule of epinephrine, snaps off the top, and splashes the epi on my cut.</p>
<p>The rush of energy up my arm and throughout my torso was amazing.  Slow enough that I could perceive the movement of the drug but too fast to describe as anything other than instantaneous.  Yes the bleeding stopped immediately; epi is a peripheral vasoconstrictor, which means the capillaries supplying the papercut were shut down.  But who cared.</p>
<p>What was most amazing was that nothing was boring.  The senses were enhanced.  The details of the edge of the paper that cut me were now fascinating.  My co-workers were fascinating.  My hand was fascinating.  And I couldn't sit down.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This quote is a little out of left-field, but your last bit reminded me of this (fictional) account of a wounded man:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[His] attention was arrested by a pebble that lay on the pavement near his knee. It was so dense. So persistent. The gods could not lift so much as a feather, but he, a mere human, might pick up this ancient unchanging object and place it wherever he wished, even into his pocket. He wondered why he had never appreciated the stubborn fidelity of matter. A dried leaf lay nearby, even more stunning in its complexity. [...] Matter remembered itself so very clearly. He could not think why he had failed to notice it before. His own shaking hand was a miracle [...] and the orange trees in the tubs [...] and the birdsong starting in the morning, and the water—water! Five gods, water!—in the fountain, and the morning light filtering into the sky...</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Removed some stuff which helped the quote but could be a little spoiler-y to anyone who goes and reads the book later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lovely passage.  Thanks for this.  What is this from?</p>
<p>I experienced something similar on top of a mountain in Alaska.  To the north lay the town where I lived.  A few thousand people serviced by eleven churches and eleven bars.</p>
<p>To the south, the ice field of a glacier, without a human trace on it.</p>
<p>Sitting astride the peak, I would look side to side, and it occurred to me that throwing one leg to either side was the most important decision of my young life.  Sitting there, alone, hearing nothing but cool air, I enjoyed for the first time the freedom to choose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have read <em>The Curse of Chalion</em>  eleven times, I love it so much.   Sadly, now when I go to read it again, the whole story cascades into my head with my favourite parts highlighted, and I don't want to actually read it anymore.   I really wish I could read it for the first time once more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard a lot of anecdotal evidence about mentally handicapped people having incredible strength and how it relates to this particular subject. Theoretically, shouldn't it be possible that some mentally handicapped people's brains might have less of these &quot;inhibitors&quot; or &quot;internal limiters&quot; as /u/ninemiletree described? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially.  Think about it this way.  I put a heavy thing in front of you.  I tell you to lift it.  You grab it and get a sense of it.  Its really heavy.  You start to lift.  You notice a little twinge in your back and think &quot;shit, I wonder if this will make my back flair up like it did a year ago?&quot;  You start to lift harder, and you get a little pain in your stomach.  You remember sometimes lifters can get hernias, and you wince.  Your hands start to sweat.  You think &quot;I have to dance at George's wedding next week, it would really suck if I blew out my back lifting this weight.&quot;  You lift some more, but god damn it, the weight is too heavy.  You can't lift it, you tell yourself, and you stop trying. </p>
<p>Now, take a clone of yourself, but remove higher reasoning, memory, deduction.  I put the weight down and disturb your environment.  That makes you angry, and so you grab the weight, heft it up, and throw it out of your way.  </p>
<p>A lot of times, we are not even aware of how many limiter systems our brain employs to prevent us from doing something it thinks will injure you, especially if you lack sufficient motivation for doing it.  Those negative signals inhibit your ability to recruit motor units - you <em>think</em> you want to send the signal to your arms to lift the weight, but in reality, all those negative thoughts are inhibiting the strength and frequency of that signal, until you <em>feel</em> much weaker than you are in reality, because you can't muster a large enough simultaneous recruitment to heft the weight.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was in Naruto, the <a href="http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Eight_Gates" target="_blank">Eight Gates</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Eight Gates are eight specific tenketsu on a person's Chakra Pathway System. They limit the overall flow of chakra within a person's body. The basis for the idea of the chakra gates comes from the body's limits on the functions within it. This makes the body much weaker, but it keeps the body from expiring too soon. By undergoing intense training, one can learn how to open these gates allowing the user to surpass their own physical limits at the cost of extreme damage to their own body. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except 3 story arcs later you'll somehow use that power all the time without any ill consequences. On top of that, use of that awesome power has generally hyperinflated since then - all your friends and enemies also use it all the time - and now you must train more to reach something even more risky and exclusive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Adrenaline most likely acts to remove several different limiter systems. Your pain sensation is dulled or removed entirely, your blood vessels are dialated and your muscles are more heavily oxygenated, and your neural activity increases; more brain activity = increased signaling, which means you're better able to activate more muscle fibers at once.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>would that mean that trained athletes, who train to activate all the relevant muscle fibers as best they can, would experience a less drastic increase in &quot;power&quot; if they received these shocks during their trained movement?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the fitness world there is something called newbie gains. It essentially means that after you start training strength you will experience a rapid increase in how much you can lift in the first few months. This isn't actually muscle growing because you lift, muscle simple does not grow that fast. It's essentially you training your ability to signal your muscles. You train your pathways to be better at activating your muscles, which result in you being stronger without actually growing much muscle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, athletes in strength intensive sports (not necessarily cardio/endurance sports) train to improve muscle recruitment, and have less headroom to improve their performance.</p></div>		</li>
