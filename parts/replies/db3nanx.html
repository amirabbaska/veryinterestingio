			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun story about those landings:</p>
<p>The Russians had hilariously bad luck with these landings. In particular, the lens cap was very problematic. They sent a number of those probes to venus and lots of them had malfunctioning lens caps.</p>
<p>Each time, something would go wrong. Sometimes one of the caps wouldn't come off, sometimes both wouldn't come off. Often for different reasons.</p>
<p>One of the last landers went quite succesful at first. Both lens caps came on and the lander was intact. The lander also had a device which would measure the composition of the soil. The lens cap... landed <em>just under the composition measurement device</em>. All it sent back was the composition of the lens cap... <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gUgFJGp.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a>'s a hilarious picture of the event. If you look closely, you see a lens cap under the measurement device in the left picture. What's even funnier is that the problem could have been solved by simply attaching a wire to the lens cap...</p>

<p>edit: Seems like some other people have already mentioned the event in the comments. Oops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those were glorious days for exploration! I remember following the Venera and Viking programs when I was a kid. I've always remained with the impression the Russians gave consideration to using diamond lenses on the cameras [Yeah, I know, they used quartz in the end] and I can't find a single source to back me up on this - did I dream this or have the Venera engineers toyed with that notion at some point?</p>
<p>That <em>view</em> though!!!!</p>
<p><em>Some</em> bad luck, but some good too!!!</p>
<p>Спасибо, Россия!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Russian probes to Venus were so much more impressive to me than the American probes to Mars. The Venus probes had to be so much more robust and armored than the Mars probes. The Russians really did a great job considering how difficult the goal was.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or surprisingly good luck. I doubt it was easy landing probes safely in an extremely thick atmospheric soup that also happens to be strong acid and it's <em>also</em> so hot that your probe might as well be on fire because the difficulty just wasn't high enough yet. They picked a ludicrously difficult target to probe and more or less pulled it off. Even with modern tech, after learning from all those past mistakes, space probes can struggle to complete their missions successfully. Under far less adverse conditions.</p>

<p>Would a thin wire even survive that atmosphere? How many kg of additional protection would be necessary to protect that wire until it's supposed to deploy?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The actual landing part is relatively straight forward precisely because of the thick atmosphere. Once you slow to subsonic speeds, you need much smaller, and thus simpler parachutes to do the job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wire could have been inside the lens cap, which seemed to survive OK. It might not survive exposure to the atmosphere for long, but as long as it survived long enough to hold the lens cap away from the soil composition probe for a few minutes, that'd be enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>would that mean that in bright light the surface would glitter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surficial mineral processes tend to be quite dynamic, and might involve both precipitation and dissolution in response to changing conditions. The possible formation of pyrite coatings at higher altitudes has been compared by some authors to the snowline on our mountains. Also, most of the pyrite deposited through such dynamic processes would be fine grained, so it would probaly be more like a dull bronzish coating than shiny crystal faces, say something like this <a href="http://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4c3dadiCQ08/T5_tsl0nUYI/AAAAAAAAAnk/F8o2ujWeueQ/s720/1121.JPG" target="_blank">chunk of massive fine to medium grained pyrite from Cyprus</a>. That being said, it <em>might</em> be sparkly locally.</p></div>		</li>
