			<div class="markdown"><p>As a professional Youtuber, just to poke my head in:</p>
<p>If you have any favorite channels, <strong>support them on Patreon if you're able</strong>. Even if it's just a dollar. It's basically a monthly tip-jar thing linking directly to that Youtuber with Patreon taking a small percentage. It gives the Youtuber in question significant insulation from all of this advertising-game bullshit, so they're materially unaffected and can keep <em>being</em> your favorite professional Youtubers.</p>
<p>Heck...the entire Youtube website could collapse and to those using Patreon it wouldn't make much difference. They would just upload the videos to other sites and continue as normal.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Patreon is a truly wonderful tool.</p>
<p>To the uninitiated, Patreon is like Kickstarter only instead of greenlighting a single project, you support an artist on a monthly basis so they can afford to make content for your enjoyment. Even one dollar helps.</p>
<p>I set aside $8 a month to help support my favorite indie wrestling promotion because I can't be there in person to buy tickets and concessions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those people can still speak, they just don't get paid for it if it's offensive.</p>
<p>This isn't a free speech issue.  The government (nor YouTube) are keeping anyone from voicing their opinion.  As a paying YouTube Red subscriber, I have no problem with ad controls just like the ones every other ad venue has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You must not follow politics and I envy you for that.  </p>
<p>In an oligarchy:</p>
<p>Money = Speech</p>
<p>The person who puts out 1-2 videos a day has more free speech than someone who can only put up a video 1-2 a month because youtube decided LGBT content should be restricted (which already happened).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yet they can still speak.  Restrictions on commercial speech, especially when imposed by a private party have always been the norm.</p>
<p>If those people want to broadcast non-commercial speech, they are more than welcome to. </p>
<p>No private entity is required to give you a soapbox.  Same said entity is especially not required to pay the user of the soapbox for the privilege of broadcasting their unsolicited opinions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not an oligarchy, that's modern western democracy.  (Which could be argued are similar or functionally the same in practice, but are different in theory)</p>
<p>AFAIK, there is no upload limit for any type of speech on YouTube (though I would fully support their right as a private service to restrict whatever the fuck they want).  Getting paid for your speech is not a right.  Making a living off your speech is not a right.  Hell, the internet is not a (legal) right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The WSJ wasn't wrong about their post though. There were ads played on a racist video through a bug in youtube. It sucks, but this was youtubes fault. Why shouldn't the WSJ report on this type of issue? </p>

<p>h3h tried to bring down WSJ and ended up slandering WSJ. He had to delete his video about how &quot;WSJ lied about their story.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
