			<div class="markdown"><p>And vice versa - algorithms that can change pitch without affecting speed. This is how those (imo annoying) auto-tune vocals are done. (I'm looking at you, Maroon 5!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Auto tune doesn't need to be annoying either. Most music today has some degree of auto tune that's used to keep a natural but consistent sound. Not to mention vocal comping where you cut up multiple takes together to get one solid take. Modern day audio processing is amazing.</p></div>		</li>
