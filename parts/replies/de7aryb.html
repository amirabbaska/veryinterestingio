			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info. It helped me finally understand the process.  Wouldn't you have to disconnect the joint (either hip or knee) in order to get the right angle to drill the hole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you start from the greater trochanter, you just make an incision in the skin and soft tissue a few centimeters above the greater trochanter and don't even have to get near the joint (you can feel the bump on the side of your leg at your hip...thats the trochanter, we go just above it). And for the knee, you do have to go into the knee joint, but you can just flex the knee a bit in order to get the right angle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To help with the /u/jkoer's answer, look up an xray of a femur. You can see the joint is actually not in a straight line from the shaft. Instead there's an angle at the greatest trochanter and it turns inwards towards the hip. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation. Question: if cancellous bone is important to bone health but you remove it all prior to inserting the rod, what kind of negative effects does it have on the affected bone in the short and long term?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't remove it all, just in a small portion that you place the nail in. It's a much more complicated answer to adequately explained nailing. </p></div>		</li>
