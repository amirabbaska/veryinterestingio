			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for typing all of this out. And for attaching the graphics.  I mentioned in a comment earlier this is for my daughters 5th grade science project and the mention of plankton is great also since we are talking about the oceans ecosystem.  She’s way more into science than I am but this is really interesting and I’m learning a lot and you breaking it down, simplifying it and terrible to admit as an adult but including pictures helped ME a ton lol. When she gets home from school today I’m going to show her what you guys told me. Thank you so much!</p></div>		</li>
