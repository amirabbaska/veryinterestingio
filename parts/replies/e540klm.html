<p>*iirc air escaping into a vacuum through a choke point such as a hole in a container is limited to supersonic velocities which would be a bit more than half of what you're proposing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: oh, you're thinking of the flow velocity.  No, don't think about that.</p></div>		</li>
