			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright, that's fair enough. Is there any indication as to when the DoJ will finish their review? I don't even know exactly when it started, but a google search says they made the official announcement back in March of this year. How long would a review like this be expected to take?</p>
<p>Is there any signal from people in the know as to whether the review is likely to conclude for/against the merger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if the six to nine month figure is correct, it could be anytime before the end of the year. The DoJ will rule when they rule.</p></div>		</li>
