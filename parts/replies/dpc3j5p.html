			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in a structural geology course this semester, and we've recently learned that the net slip of a fault is almost always greatly different from the actual displacement of each block, and in a lot of cases (at least in the examples we're given), the surface displacement is a lot greater than the actual distance moved - so is this kind of like the same thing for a tsunami wave? Or is rather just a matter of energy/momentum of the waves building up?</p>
<p>I remember in sedimentology last semester, learning that waves crest once they hit their respective wave base or whatever it's called down along the shore slope - but I have no real idea of how the original energy of a tsunami, which can be hardly noticeable out on the open ocean, compares to the energy or force it's got when it's cresting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In simple terms, the size of a tsunami will scale with the volume of water displaced, but how exactly this is related to the details of the earthquake are a little more nebulous. Common idea is that it's directly linked to the amount of vertical deflection of the surface, but, sticking with the Tohoku example, some recent work suggests that <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JC012556/full" target="_blank">it's really the integrated motion of the surface</a>, which to someone who doesn't study tsunamis but works on thrust faults on land, this makes sense and frankly I'm kind of surprised that previous tsunami generation models discounted the role of horizontal motion as this paper suggests. </p>
<p>In terms of how the surface displacement relates to net slip, maximum slip at depth, etc this gets into a lot of details and starts to bring in questions of coseismic vs postseismic moment of the fault and details of the rupture complexity among a host of other things. We tend to like to think of earthquakes and ruptures of faults as simple movement on a single fault plane, but <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/03/22/science.aam7194" target="_blank">astoundingly complex fault ruptures like what we saw in Kaikoura</a> really give us a sense that things can get real tricky, real quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right, a couple of years ago, we relied on potencial energy transference for tsunami's models.
Now they are integrating the momentum (horizontal forces) to the models.</p>
<p>Its incredible that a theory fundamentally wrong predicted this events relatevely well.</p>
<p>Its a good example of the problems with science. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>We document 289 living Japanese coastal marine species from 16 phyla transported over 6 years on objects that traveled thousands of kilometers across the Pacific Ocean to the shores of North America and Hawaiâ€˜i. Most of this dispersal occurred on nonbiodegradable objects, resulting in the longest documented transoceanic survival and dispersal of coastal species by rafting.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long wavelength model for tsunamis is convenient and described the gravity waves well but what about I'd imagine there's also a lot of energy released as sound waves (shockwave?) from the initial perturbation. Does that not have a big effect (the same wave sound waves kill fish when you set off a stick of dynamite in a lake)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, I have not been able to find any study that quantifies this in any sense or provides any evidence of this killing or harming marine creatures from sound or pressure waves within the water. Submarine earthquakes definitely do produce sound within the water, this page has a <a href="https://www.livescience.com/13819-japan-earthquake-sound-hydrophone.html" target="_blank">video which contains a sound recording from a hydrophone network near Alaska, again in relation to the Tohoku event</a>. This is obviously quite distant from the source, but a relevant bit is that these sounds are quite low frequency (even in the video that has been sped up 16x they sound low frequency) so I'm not sure how (or if) sound waves like this would do anything to marine creatures that are sensitive to sound or pressure changes.  </p>
<p>EDIT: To add to this, for reference the exact frequency of seismic waves will vary as a function of the details of the earthquake and the properties of the medium through which they are traveling, but p-waves usually have frequencies of no more than a few Hz and s-waves will have much lower frequencies, usually below 0.1 Hz so these are VERY different frequencies than things like sonar (that seem to mess with some marine organisms). Additionally, with something like dynamite, you are producing a compressional wave VERY quickly, where as an earthquake is a quick event geologically, but for a big event, it may take up to several minutes for the rupture to finish so while we have never been able to measure the rate of surface deformation during an earthquake (closest we've come are things like <a href="http://www.tectonics.caltech.edu/slip_history/2011_taiheiyo-oki/Displacement/" target="_blank">this</a> which are records of gps position changes through time, but notice you're seeing displacements happen over minutes), the surface displacement is not all appearing instantaneously, it's likely growing over several seconds to a minute or two so the possibility of producing a compressional wave that's going to physically hurt marine animals doesn't seem that likely (though I could be wrong).</p></div>		</li>
