			<div class="markdown"><p>Your biggest variables would be wheel size and softness, the grade of the bearings in the wheel (abec 3, 5, and 7), and the relative smoothness of the ground, and maybe how loose or tight the trucks on the skateboard are, and how they're oriented.</p>
<p>For instance, when riding a long board (once you get up to a certain speed) you can effectively pump the board as you lean forwards and backwards, causing the board to continue rolling with less overall exerted force as opposed to pushing. But you can't really do this on a conventional skateboard. The wheels are comparably smaller and harder, which would serve to decrease your overall momentum at a faster rate and cause you to have to constantly push. Also, the rigidity of a normal skateboard makes it harder to transfer that force exerted to the wheels. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and short decks (real skateboards) have smaller wheels. I use up way more energy skating just because my bearings are pretty gritty and slow. But I'm nearly 40 and despite skating for 30 years my ass does not need to go fast anymore. Also, street and sidewalk conditions will slow you down and so will headwinds.</p></div>		</li>
