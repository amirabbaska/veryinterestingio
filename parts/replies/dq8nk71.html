			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true. If a company's server farm is in the US somewhere, whatever ISP they're using to get internet access could throttle their outgoing connection, at which point it wouldn't matter where in the world you were, as the slowdowns would be happening on the source side of the connection.</p>
<p>Big companies are likely to just relocate outside the US or spin up parallel off-shore data centers for international customers, but smaller companies who can't afford that (and most US based companies in the short term) would be slowed down, even if the customer isn't on an American ISP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. ISPs for datacenters dont work like consumer ISP's. You dont pay for, lets say, a 300/50 connection for your block of servers, you buy what basically amounts to a data pipe and they charge you based on how you use it. So if you have a theoretical 100gbps line out, but you never use it, it doesnt cost &quot;much&quot;, but if you fully saturate it 24/7 thats when it gets expensive. The pricing is entirely based on average throughput, not a metering of how much data you actually sent. So if you occasionally burst 100gbps for 5 seconds, but otherwise average out to 10gbps through the billiing cycle, thats what they charge you for (plus the base cost of the line). &quot;Throttling&quot; your connection would be counterintuitive because they would just end up charging you less, and theyre also not providing you the service youre paying for. And at the prices they charge, someone in the legal department will have a real problem with that. </p>
<p>In short, network neutrality in the united states means nothing to someone who doesnt live in the united states, the services you want to access hosted in US data centers will continue to operate as expected for you. Its only a problem if youre using a consumer ISP or if you want to use a service or view content someone is hosting on their consumer ISP, which is pretty rare. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the few answers that actually gets it. The FCC is talking about removing consumer protection and clawing back consumer rights, nothing to do with business transit/transport agreements. Unfortunately a lot of misinformation out there detracting from that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation I've seen describing how this affects non USA citizens.</p>
<p>Basically anyone who lives inside USA borders and uses internet as a consumer could be affected by their ISP's throttling tactics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From a purely technical standpoint this might be true. But the threat to minor companies that competes on the US market is real and a lot of those companies have a global customer base but not the ability to forgo their domestic base or to relocate.  </p>
<p>A lot of the world consumes American products that can't be produced without their domestic market. And if that is threatened by ISPs wanting to leverage their domination into vertical integration earnings (if that is a word even) then it very much affects non US citizens.  </p>
<p>Also, not to speak of the cascading effects of this being a potential goldmine for other companies with strong market positions in other parts of the world to exploit and lobby for.   </p>
<p>And finally, the threat to the American democracy in an misinformed and superstitious electorate and the global consequences of that is already apparent. The risk of future system where not only profits but agendas and ideology is filtered by a monopolistic information stream is not something that should be ignored. Especially since it will be very very hard to undo the damage of such information bubbles will do to the competency of the American voters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be money lost, since you pay to send data. If Verizon/Comcast/AT&amp;T starts to throttle, we can find another peer. That market is not a monopoly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that's right.  Upstream data rates are set by your upstream provider based on the contract you signed.  If they are throttling you more than that, then they are breaking their service contracts.  This would be like your ISP selling you a 100mbit link and throttling all your traffic to 50mbit.</p>
<p>Also, when you talk server farm, it is very unlikely that they have only one link to the internet.  They would have multiple redundant links to different providers.  And traffic takes the most efficient route to the destination.</p>
<p>Also, moving their data centres over seas will make no difference.  It is the last hop ISPs in the US that will be extorting them.  The ISP that consumers connect to will throttle Netflix to their users, unless Netflix pays them a protection fee.  In turn, they can also charge their users an extra fee to provide &quot;Super fast Netflix access&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
