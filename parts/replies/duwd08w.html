			<div class="markdown"><p>All these responses lead me to believe it's almost guess work. When your evidence is all circumstantial how can I trust anything the news says about hacks. Would any of that even hold up in court as evidence of an expert couldn't come in and use fancy language to convince people with no clue about what he is talking about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, a lot of hackers have been caught through the years, and many more will be caught. However, when talking hacks of the magnitude where, say, an election is manipulated, or sensitive (like national security level sensitive) data is stolen, hackers usually aren't teens in mom's basement.</p>
<p>Let's use the alleged hack against the US election as an example, and let's assume that it actually was Russia who initiated it. In this case the hackers most likely knew of every potential hazard, and took every precaution many times over to avoid detection/capture. Making it pretty much impossible to find out 100% who did it, not to mention actually proving it.</p>
<p>Also, hacking is much more than just running some exploit tool against a target. The actual exploit is preceded by months of intel gathering and mapping of the target system, and often any neighboring or surrounding systems/IT-environments.</p>

<p>I've read that one of the largest pitfalls of the USSR being dissolved was the abundance of well educated computer science grads in countries that have well established universities but little to no economy in which very talented people can find suitable jobs.  Is this mostly pop culture or is there some truth to that? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yhea most of this wouldn't hold up in court if it was properly explained, it's also shockingly easy to frame someone by either hacking into their computer and using that to hack someone else or by simply altering the logs. The only thing that stops this from being a massive problem is whatever or not the police belief someone is capable of hacking (you can't frame a 80 old digiphobe, but you can frame a computer science student). And the number of people with the skill necessary to pull any of this off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that's why I say that the logs may be altered or deleted. Of course it depends on how compromised your machine was (did the hacker have enough permission to alter/delete the logs?) and if it's a vital machine you can even implement logs that can't be deleted or altered on a hardware level (the easiest of which is to write a copy of your logs to a printer as well). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for an enterprise service provider. The gubmint has taps in all over the place, watching source and destination IPs. You might be connected to a proxy or a VPN, but they may be able to see that. If someone sees malicious traffic hitting them from that proxy at the same time you're sending to it, the guv has a pretty good case for pinning it on you.</p>
<p>Now, if you use multiple proxies, it gets a bit more complicated.</p></div>		</li>
