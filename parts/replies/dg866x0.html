			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of things cause High blood pressure, and your body (and meds) uses all those mechanisms to lower BP.</p>
<p>For example, if your blood pressure is high, your body will basically pee out some of it. We can actually give drugs that exacberate that effect, causing you to pee a lot every day (called diuretics).</p>
<p>Your body (kidney) will also stop making enzymes that causes vasoconstriction when you have a high blood pressure. To help with that, we also give drugs that inhibit enzymes in that pathway. This prevents constriction.</p>
<p>We can also give drugs that directly dilate the vessels, such as CCBs or Nitroglycerin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be from increased blood volume, but that is usually more to do with increased sodium levels attracting unusually high amounts of water to the blood stream than actually too much RBCs. However there is a disorder called polycythemia Vera which is over production of RBCs treatment is good old fashioned blood letting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To keep it short, there are a lot of ways your blood pressure can rise. One way is too many red blood cells. More commonly is obstruction or hardening in the blood vessels. </p></div>		</li>
