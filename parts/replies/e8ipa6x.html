			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, surprised this isn't higher up, just the sheer mass differences in the rotors of a heli vs that of a plane, plus the wings of the plane (among other flat surfaces providing stability)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Looks like a  plane engine's RPMs are five to ten times higher than a helicopter's? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, RPM is limited by tip speed. Generally speaking, you don't want your blades breaking the speed of sound because you get shocks on the blades. This can be damaging, reduce efficiency, etc.</p>
<p>So a larger blade will have a faster tip speed than a smaller blade if they are rotating at the same rate. The larger the blade, the slower your max rotational rate is. A smaller blade can spin faster before hitting the limit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most props move air most efficiently at speeds of 900-2500 rpm. Any faster is just wasted effort.</p>
<p>Helicopters are difficult to compare with propellers.  While they both rotate, their structure and the airfoil shape is really different.</p>
<p>It is worth keeping in mind that while helis have tail rotors, fixed wing aircraft have the fuselage and tail surfaces stabilizing the airframe. The overall amount of still air touching the various surfaces of the aircraft is more than enough to counteract the prop wash air</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes a lot of sense. A plane achieves lift from it's aerodynamic design, so you need to generate enough momentum for the air to push it up. That's such a crazy concept.</p></div>		</li>
