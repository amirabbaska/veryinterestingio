			<div class="markdown"><p>As a child this would fascinate me, seeing different ants attacking each other, the way their dealt with the corpses (took them to a specific place, never knew what for, guess food? dont think they have burrial rites, then again I was like 12 at the time so thought they were just eating them later). </p>
<p>hear there are slave raids as well, such an odd concept. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't watched an ant war in person put it on your bucket list. Imagine watching the final battle in Braveheart for a few hours. It's tragic but I think it gives us some perspective when it comes to thinking about how many men we as a species have thrown into a conflict. The estimates you read in a book become far more real when your eyes focus on two little beings who don't have a movie, who no one will care about, and whose story will only be told in their final moments among thousands upon thousands of others fighting to survive.</p>
<p>It's lucky to find one happening. There was one at my place last year, it had been brewing for the better part of a decade when two ant colonies had expanded and moved closer to each other. One colony had undermined a bunch of the back yard making the ground very soft and eventually we made them move. Another had moved its way from the neighbor's house towards our garden. The next thing we know, there are two giant blobs slowly growing and undulating if you're watching from a distance.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection it was obvious that both colonies had met across the pavement of the entire driveway and were flooding the area with reinforcements.</p>
<p>Wounded ants lay in all directions and smaller ants would carry them back to the colony and away from the fighting.</p>
<p>In the large blobs it was a massive melee and the ants were fighting tooth and nail for every inch of ground. There's not much organization in the way we would consider it. Imagine moreso a long series of trails running into each other rather than formations meeting like would happen in human wars. These sporadic fights grow and grow as the pheromones permeate the battlefield and other ants, sensing danger, go rushing into the chaos.</p>
<p>After about an hour of watching the battle, (I was really excited that morning to see it happen just outside my house) it was much easier to notice which side was which so I named one side Cleopantra and the other Mark Antony. </p>
<p>Well, Cleopantra's forces got ahead after the first hour and a half and eventually the blobs moved towards Mark Antony's side. The wounded were numberless but if you look away for a couple of minutes, they get taken to the back pretty quickly and it's as though the bodies disappeared like in a video game. Their approach to organization is really astounding. Each ant is doing its part without any captains or colonels telling them what to do. That makes these sporadic wars flash and dissipate quickly.</p>
<p>Eventually, Cleopantra's high water mark receded and Mark Antony's forces regained control of the blacktop. It was a well-fought battle but Antony's side must have deployed a major reserve regiment or something. There was a a very crowded line flooding the battlefield as the blobs moved to their side and eventually the thrust of fresh fighters pushed Cleopantra back.</p>
<p>When ants die it's sometimes pretty dramatic. Like a samurai movie, some will writhe and what limbs they have left will curl, something you can see when you spray a chemical agent on them. Mind you, I didn't intervene in this fight, there was already plenty of death to go around without a divine sole landing on the field. A lot of ants were chewed in half or had bits ripped off. It's amazing how much those mandibles can mutilate. </p>
<p>Within another hour it looked as though nothing had happened. The passion on that driveway, thousands of ants desperately struggling for supremacy. It wasn't worth it for each side. So many were lost all for naught. It really is astonishing to see an ant war.</p>
<p>*Edit: I just wanted to add. No matter how &quot;civilized&quot; our Eighteenth Century Enlightened warfare was or how far we have come as societies since living in caves, how the good of man came out on top in WWII, we still have a proclivity for annihilating anything that seems like an enemy in a battle. These ants took care of their wounded and medics were not attacked. That's something that separates us from the ants. Humans shoot medics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't heard of them before, there are some fascinating documentaries and papers on Slave-making ants. As their name implies, they enslave other ants by invading their colonies and stealing their pupae. They then bring these pupae up in their own colony and use them as a labor force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is dead on. Also, the oldest recorded queens are documented surviving 28-30 years. The workers likely wouldn't survive as long, but would be replaced on a more regular interval. Typically colony ages/life cycle is based on the life span of the queen; not non-reproductive workers.</p>
<p>However comment by /u/WoodstocksApple assumes a typical colony with one queen. Google <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentine_ant?wprov=sfsi1" target="_blank">Argentine Ant</a> and you'll see a species that has a few queens per 1000 workers, lives communally in a 'Supercolony', and is one of the more globally successful invasive species. When you're colony is millions of workers per square meter over large swathes of the planet, hundreds of queens produce new workers all the time- what does a colony life span even mean in that context?</p>
<p>-Source: Got a PhD studying invasive ants. Seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got a bit of a question. A many years back at a golf course I stumbled upon an all out war between ants and flys (could have been flying ants, I was young). With the ants bring all the dead back and stuff, I found it amazing. What would cause such a 'war' between different species to occur?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be competition for the same limited resources that lead them to be aggressive towards each other, or that one or both of the species actually hunt the other. Could both be same species competition or different species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was almost certainly flying ants. Ants can develop wings if left to sexually mature and will swarm off with a young queen to find new territory, sometimes attacking other colonies to establish their own.</p></div>		</li>
