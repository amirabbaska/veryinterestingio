			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. My understanding is that tidal forces are basically just a result of an inconsistent gravitational field within the body of the object. Any large body is subject to tidal forces but it is less apparent in stiffer/more viscous bodies which can resist the forces more.</p></div>		</li>
