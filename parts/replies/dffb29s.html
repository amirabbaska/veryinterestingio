			<div class="markdown"><p>For me when I feel a migraine coming on I get this metallic taste in my mouth, then my vision blurs and fingertips on one side of my body starts to go numb. Then I begin to experiance something called “transient aphasia”  I can think of the words I want to say but when they come out it just sounds like I’m babbling. It feels like someone stuck a bicycle pump in your skull and keeps increasing pressure. They last on average 6 hours, which I will typically spend in a pitch black room crying into the floor. The only medicine I’ve found that helped is Perocet (from when I had my wisdom teeth out) and marijuana, which doesn’t take the pain away but will at least let me sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imitrex, my friend. Sumatriptan is the generic name. It has been a godsend.</p>
<p>I also use a product called Mygrastick (it's on Amazon), which is just peppermint oil in a roll-on container. If I apply it right as I can tell a migraine is coming, it often keeps it at bay. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, sumatriptan wasn't as helpful but my neurologist just put me on nortriptyline. It is a prophylactic, I take it every night before bed. I've noticed nortriptyline has helped lessen the severity of my migraines when I do get one, usually from the weather. Mostly my migraines end up having a more manageable pain so I can actually go to work, be social, etc. </p>
<p>In the same vein as the Mygrastick, I have an essential oil diffuser in my room and put a few drops of peppermint, lavender, and eucalyptus oils in just before I go to sleep. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I didn’t even know these drugs existed, all of them seem to act on Serotonin receptors, does that mean I have low Serotonin levels and is there a test for this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same thing. I often get into a scalding hot shower where I am free to vomit and burn my body at the same time. Beats the pain of a migraine </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with you there.. Best thing ever happened to my perception of migraines-- clusters. They make all other types of headaches fade into the background. I've been through the triptans, they don't work on my migraines, nor do the preventatives.  However, knowing how much worse the pain can be really helps me keeping going (until day 6 or 7, then it's time for medical intervention).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And strangely, if that same pain were transferred to, say, your arm, it'd be just mildly annoying.</p>
<p>Migraines fuck up your whole program. Hearing, sight, smell, touch - it all gets distorted.</p>
<p>I just had a three-day whopper of a migraine. I had dried blood in my ear later on the side that was affected. That's a new one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cluster headaches would not be annoying if moved to your arm. You would suspect that you were either on fire or in a wood chipper.  </p></div>		</li>
