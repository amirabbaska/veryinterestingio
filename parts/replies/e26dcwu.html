			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC most try to get parking fees. They also get taxes from vendors, etc. These venues also typically host other events outside of their sport; concerts, shows, special events, which brings in tax revenue. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It also helps boost tourism, so local businesses like hotels and restaurants will also benefit from a stadium.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Often that's the main selling point of the venture when it is pitched to the local government and its constituency- that the presence of the stadium will result in more business in the area, boosting the local economy.</p>
<p>However, your skepticism is well warranted, as local businesses <em>don't</em> tend to benefit anywhere near as much as suggested(if at all), and, anecdotally, the rowdy patronage of what visiting sports fans do  grace the local bars and restaurants with their presence tends to drive away locals, reducing business on game days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the reason literally every time. And very often it works. There are neighborhoods and city centers all over the country revitalized by the building of a stadium or two.</p>
<p>But one thing to remember if that it's usually not about &quot;tourists&quot;. It's about attracting people in from the suburbs. It's usually done for the benefit of the core of the city that is blighted.</p>
<p>Here in Denver, the stadium complex for baseball, hockey, basketball and to a lesser extent football are all very big draws and bring a lot business into the city proper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of the issue is that with the declining popularity of professional sports, will the cost of the subsidy be worth the economic boon of having a sports team. </p>
<p>In 1990 a $16 million annual subsidy in sports infrastructure could yield $24 million in additional tax revenue. </p>
<p>Today whether or not these programs break even is hit or miss. The big concern is that a lot of the time it's paid upfront in lump sums. So a government might have given $200 million to a team for stadium expecting $20 million in benefits each year for 10 years. </p>
<p>BUT with the decline in sports they might only be getting $12 million, or $8 million the next year. Doesn't bode well for these investments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you point me towards some evidence that interest in sports are declining?  Because I'm pretty sure every major professional league has been growing alot recently in attendance, viewership, and revenue except maybe the NFLs viewership</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. If it is declining it doesn't matter since the ticket prices are literally more than 10x what they were in my youth. Professional sports are making a shit ton of money for owners. They don't need any subsidies at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The prompt and answers are about the NFL...  But, to take the conversation off topic, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1696/baseball.aspx" target="_blank">Baseball</a> has been declining for a long while, <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/243066/average-regular-season-attendance-in-the-nhl/" target="_blank">Hockey</a> has stagnated or shrunk (remember, as attendance stays the same its fans as a % of pop declines).  <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/fifa-corruption-scandal/soccer-numbers-look-game-u-s-n365601" target="_blank">Soccer</a> is gaining steam quickly and the <a href="http://csbsjurecord.com/2017/04/nba-looks-at-a-struggling-future-amid-declining-popularity-talent/" target="_blank">basketball</a> is falling drastically.  So yeah, sports in the US are declining in popularity.  The only exception is soccer thanks to the World Cup.</p>
<p>Edit:  For a more professional analysis. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/220562/pro-football-losing-fans-sports-holding-steady.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup</a> tracks this every 5 years.  According to them, football is rapidly declining and all other sports have stagnated.</p></div>		</li>
