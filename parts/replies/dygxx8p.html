			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that this is a fantastic reply, however it does not cover all embryophytes, the land plants, but only spermatophytes, seed plants. Plants that reproduce by spores, such as mosses, liverworts, and ferns have a different reproduction method that depends on the presence of water. I don't think I'd do a very good job of describing it though so maybe someone can fill in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true.  I was focusing on the two types people are most familiar with seeing, especially the flowering branch.</p>
<p>Mosses are relatively straightforward, but ferns and liverworts are peculiar.</p>
<p>I'll give it a shot done very simply, and with diagrams (the full situation is more complex than I'll describe it, and I probably won't do any of it justice):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Mosses</em>:  male and female parts fertilize, make a new structure from that fertilized union, which grows a spore capsule (those bits that look like antennae on some mosses), which breaks open, spores spread, and when they land in the right type of environment the spores start growing, in a more-or-less straightforward fashion.  <a href="http://s4.thingpic.com/images/Eo/duhNZzdEkPJyPNwD35FDQq6N.jpeg" target="_blank">Moss reproductive cycle diagram</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ferns</em>:  make spores, release them, appropriate environment leads to spores growing into gametopytes (a small heart shaped thing that looks more like a small liverwort than a fern).  The odd thing is that the gametophyte is the reproductive part of the fern and it has male and female bits that mature at different times to avoid self-fertilization.  Once it is fertilized a zygote is formed which then grows into a new fern.  As my old botany professor said, &quot;Imagine that you didn't have sex, you made a Mini Me and that went out and had sex for you instead.  Where's the fun in that?&quot; <a href="https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~joyellen/Fern_life_cycle2copy.jpg" target="_blank">Fern reproductive cycle diagram</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Liverworts</em> {disclaimer - I don't know these very well}:  liverworts can reproduce sexually and asexually, we'll focus on the former, and use Marchantia as an example.  Somewhat like a cross between the strategies moss and ferns use, but with different names for the parts.  It makes male and female reproductive parts and sens the sperm and eggs out separately.  Those get together and make a little plant thing called an enlarged archegonium (archegonium being the name for the structure surrounding the egg), which contains a zygote, that in turn makes spores, which are then dispersed and grow into new liverwort plants.  <a href="http://www.bio.miami.edu/dana/pix/marchantia_lifecycle.jpg" target="_blank">Liverwort, Marchantia example, reproductive cycle diagram</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Club mosses</em>:  pretty much the same as regular mosses.  It's worth noting that unlike regular mosses, club mosses have vascular tissue (that is, they have specialized tissues to move water and nutrients around in them), which is why they can grow into relatively large, upright plants rather than being limited to being a fuzzy surface cover.  <a href="https://doralbio5.wikispaces.com/file/view/0961.JPG/207755246/609x452/0961.JPG" target="_blank">Club moss, Lycopodium in this case, reproductive cycle diagram</a></p>
</li>
<li><em>Horsetails</em>:  Pretty much like ferns.  <a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-0IYMMhTYn4c/WfSo-jUan2I/AAAAAAAAknc/zf3e5Lp_NwEFZcUBVCNsO6ppJTvWIi__gCLcBGAs/s1600/lifecycle-equisetum.jpg" target="_blank">Horsetail reproductive cycle diagram</a></li>
</ul>
<p>That's a <em>really</em> basic overview and it seriously does not do it justice at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great summary. I love how fantastically weird these plants seem when you are mainly used to how spermatophytes work. It feels like peering into the ancient past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thank you, those were both great explanations. can you do a bit on clonal colonies, like aspen?  do they polinate across colonies?</p></div>		</li>
