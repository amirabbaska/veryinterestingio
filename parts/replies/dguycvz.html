<p>Unfortunately even in these modern times classes do somewhat still exist and probably always will as there will always be people that like to judge / brag etc.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you can't be same with different money?</p>
<p>i know uni grads earning less than people with almost basic education, so what's their social class? you can take villager out of village, but you can't take village out of villager, same goes for money, money won't buy you class if you are dumb without manners, they are often linked but often also they aren't</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously the two things (money and class) aren't perfectly correlated but do you deny that they are closely linked? Also, I'm talking about social class and not manners. Do you understand the difference?</p></div>		</li>
