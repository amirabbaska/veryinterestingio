<p>Fact: Woman have periods.</p>
<p>Reddit: Well yes but once a woman reaches menopause she stops having them. Some woman who have a very low BMI don't experience them. Plus there are tons of woman who can't have periods because of a ton of reasons.</p>
<p>Fact: You're a cunt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not what aspergers is, it's what people who are dicks say aspergers is so people won't think they are dicks.</p>
<p>People who are actually on the autism scale aren't any more likely to be pedantic dicks than anyone else. </p>
<p>(And yes, I realize the irony of being a pedantic dick about people who are pedantic dicks) :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>The words &quot;cats hate belly rubs&quot; wouldn't normally be taken to mean &quot;all cats ...&quot;, but &quot;most cats ... &quot;, which I stand by.</p>

<p>Just like how kids like candy. Yeah, there's a small group that this doesn't apply to, but that doesn't make the statement less true.</p></div>		</li>
