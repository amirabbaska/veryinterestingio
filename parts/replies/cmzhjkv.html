			<p>&gt; The words &quot;cats hate belly rubs&quot; wouldn't normally be taken to mean &quot;all cats ...&quot;, but &quot;most cats ... &quot;<br><br>Nope, that would be interpreted as <em>all</em> cats, which is why we have words like <em>most</em> and <em>many</em>. You're being stubborn here and making it seem like you don't know how our language works, just admit that you should have said most.</p>		</li>

			<p><a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6197-4_9" target="_blank">Totally, and wholly wrong.</a> If that were true then the word &quot;all&quot; would be pointless. Normal usage is for the indefinite pronoun &quot;all/most/some/etc...&quot; to be used for emphasis or when it cannot be inferred from the context. Since you clearly can infer that &quot;most&quot; is the most sensible answer you can also infer from the lack of any indefinite pronoun that &quot;most&quot; is the missing pronoun.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Most&quot; can only be inferred if you already know that it doesn't apply to all. If someone had never seen a cat before in their life and you said &quot;cats don't like their bellies rubbed&quot; it would be assumed that no cats like their bellies rubbed. This does not make the word &quot;all&quot; pointless; there would still be times that &quot;most&quot; was assumed and you would need to specify that you actually were referring to <em>all</em>.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Has nothing to do with the point so this is just deflecting.<br><br>It has everything to do with the point. You're giving me a hypothetical case where &quot;all&quot; would be inferred that's based on people never having seen a cat. The fact that we all know what a cat is here is entirely relevant since it is important context for people to infer from. (That said, I was being a little factitious with my wording.) <br><br>The stuff about &quot;hates&quot;: even if people don't know what a cat is they can still infer that no group universally hates something (unless it is the defining feature of that group), and can infer &quot;most&quot; from that.<br><br>And yes: it is on everyone else to figure it out because that's what most people do without even thinking about it.<br><br>But can I put a line under that and try something different instead? Maybe it will work better.<br><br>- English is a natural language, rather than a defined one. This means there is no authority on correct usage.<br><br>- As such a sentence in English is correct so long as readers can infer the correct meaning, and so far as it follows common usage.<br><br>- Dropping prepositions and pronouns in common in colloquial English. (&quot;I'm going out. Wanna come with me?&quot; for example.) This isn't suitable for formal writing, but formal writing is not expected here.<br><br>- Ambiguous sentences are correct, and the ambiguity resolved through the context: &quot;Police help dog bite victim&quot;, &quot;I saw the  man with the binoculars.&quot;<br><br>- &quot;Cats hate belly rubs&quot; is formally ambiguous, since the pronoun used to refer to the cats (all/most/some/no) is left out.<br><br>- But it is possible to tell from the context (i.e. &quot;hate&quot; doesn't generalise well, different cats have different personalities, generalising being generally a bad idea outside of pure maths anyway) that not all cats hate it, and that therefore &quot;most&quot; is the intended pronoun.<br><br>And finally: I don't think anyone thought I actually meant &quot;all&quot;. If everyone understands something, and correct English is defined by usage how can it be wrong?</p>		</li>
