I used to work at a science based interactive museum, and this exact thing was one of the interactive exhibits. </p>
<p>It had a bunch of different materials, like carpet, wood, glass, metal. All the same temperature, but they all felt like different temperatures due to how efficient they were at conducting or insulating heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Floor is lava, yes, except the lava is frozen, and your veins are frozen, and your life is slowly bled from you while you reach for your life alert. </p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>not really frozen at all, but just cold enough to sap your strength every minute. </p></div>		</li>
