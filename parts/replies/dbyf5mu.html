			<div class="markdown"><p>It does in a way but you don't feel it as much that's why it can hurt so good when you get a massage. This is mainly because the speed at which the touch receptors signals reach the brain and spinal cord are much higher, think of a formula 1 car for touch receptors, and a Prius for pain receptors. Basically the formula 1 car reaches the spinal cord faster and at a higher frequency than the Prius does. So the touch &quot;drowns out&quot; the signals from the pain. </p>
<p>The signals that reach the spinal cord also have to go through a gate per se, there is an interneuron that connects the peripheral nerve (from the body) to the spinal cord tracts going up to the brain. When there is a lot of the touch stimulus the interneuron acts like a gate that doesn't allow the pain signals to go up to the brain (See gate theory of pain). This is also how acupuncture and dry needling are effective pain relief tools. They are stimulating various nerve signals that essentially reduce the amount of pain your brain perceives. </p>
<p>There are far more complex things going on as well, where the brain modulates the &quot;pain&quot; signals with opioid like chemicals.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that technically pain receptors don't exist, they are called nociceptors (they sense noxious/dangerous stimulus). Pain is created by and perceived by the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also believe that pain receptors are found mainly in the skin. Because the skin isn't damaged, but the muscle is, massaging the muscle would allow you to experience pleasurable stimuli, but less pain, due to the need for pain receptors to be in the places we need them.</p>
<p>I mean, we don't really need tons of pain receptors in the middle of our biceps. If something was really wrong, it would be tearing the skin, and we would feel it. But simple torn muscle fibers from working out? The body doesn't need to feel crippling pain all over the body every time we get stronger. However, we do need to know when we touch something sharp or hot, so our pain receptors are located mainly in the skin to allow us to know when our body is technically in &quot;danger&quot;, even if it is only a hot bowl of soup.</p>
<p>Pain receptors are also found in abundance in the corneas, where the body is obliged to close our eyes if light or external force causes pain to occur in our most valuable sensory input.</p>
<p>You can also find them in and around the entrances to our body, namely the ears, nose, esophagus, anus, genitals, eyelids, and stomach (where the bellybutton was originally an entrance to the body). This is to alert oneself if some foreign object is trying to crawl into your ear and lay eggs in your brain or something like that.</p>
<p>However, there are far less pain receptors in the muscles, meaning that when you massage the muscles, you generate much less pain. So, as other people say, it gets drowned out, but simply because pain receptors are quite a bit less common in such areas.</p></div>		</li>
