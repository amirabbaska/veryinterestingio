<p>Empty a pressurized airlock? Sure, that would just be just a puff, but open both doors of an airlock and let the entire atmosphere of a large, futuristic space vessel escape? It could take a while before there is a significant difference in pressure and thus a difference in force.</p>
<p>Haven't watched enough such scenes to point to a specific one. The Martian seemed to do a pretty good job, but not the scene in Aliens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did say a sizable hole. Sure if you have a very small leak then sure it could take a little while but if you have a hole large enough to develope a large amount of force the pressure differential is likely to dissipate extremely quickly. Quick calculations show that if you had a 20 in diameter hole like one large enough to rip large heavy objects into space then the initial volumetric flow rate would be roughly 2950 ft^3/ second. That flow rate would be enough to empty a 2000 square ft home of oxygen in roughly .7 seconds (if the initial pressure remained constant). </p>
<p>Obviously the pressure wouldn't remain constant which would increase the length of the evacuation process but it would also significantly decrease force generated by such a pressure differential. The pressure should follow an exponential decrease meaning it will only have any really pulling power for a short period of time under most circumstances.</p>
<p>You could figure out the actual time vs force curve though integration or through a numerical simulation but I don't have that much free time so.</p></div>		</li>
