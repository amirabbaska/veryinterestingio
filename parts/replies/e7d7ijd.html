			<div class="markdown"><p>Fat is not necessarily bad. In a lot of ways, fat is protective against metabolic diseases.</p>
<p>In a small percentage of people who can continually create new far cells, they can gain a lot of weight without developing metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Those two diseases appear when the (typically) finite number of fat cells get full and can no longer absorb fat and glucose circulating in the blood stream, which causes the liver and pancreas to become clogged with the excess fat.</p>
<p>Some people who cannot gain fat get type 2 diabetes at very low body fat percentage. Asians also get diabetes at lower body massage index than Caucasians.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Their lifestyles are similar to Westerners now. Mass produced processed foods, office jobs, stress. </p></div>		</li>
