			<div class="markdown"><p>It was also Kickstarted by at least 1 meteor impact, and massive volcanic eruptions, so it is not exactly comparable.</p>
<p>I think soft engineering of feedback loops might actually be part of the solution though, there are feedbacks that go both ways, e.g. when co2 rises, plants grow faster and take more out of the atmosphere, so if we stop chopping down all the trees, there could be a reverse feedback loop drawing out more co2. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not aware of any current research that points to an asteroid impact for the P-Tr event (not the K-T). Source?</p>
<p>This review article by Benton &amp; Twitchett is a good summary of the disputed data - <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703000934" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703000934</a>
It's from 2001 so a little dated, but covers the claims that are most usually mentioned (shocked quartz, fullerene isotopes, etc. - most from the 70-80s). I'm aware of the two candidate craters in Antarctica and the Falklands, but I haven't seen anything to suggest they were more than speculation.</p>
<p>Most of the reason the K-T impact was so devastating was not the size of the asteroid or the timing (just after/alogside the Deccan Traps) but due to the location, shallow marine. The gypsum (calcium sulphide/phate) thrown into the atmosphere produced acid rain, and the sulphides in the atmosphere blocked the sun. If the same crater had struck elsewhere, we'd still be dealing with a huge loss of life, but perhaps not such an extensive mass extinction.</p>
<p>And sorry for rambling... It's my current project focus atm in uni, so I'm reading all the research I can about it. I'm open to any contradictory articles, like I said earlier. </p>
<p>&amp; I do agree re soft engineering. There are huge consequences to our actions that very little is being done about ... there are actually hypotheses out there that trees are already offsetting our carbon emissions by up to 2x what we currently think!</p></div>		</li>

There was recently an anthrax outbreak in a small town in Siberia, causing dozens of people to become sick. The cause of this outbreak is supposedly permafrost thaw. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Methane is everywhere, bottom of the deepest seas and oceans contain a layer of mud basically that consists of decaying animals of all sorts, all of which produce a lot of methane over the years, believe what you are referring to as trapped in the ice is basically a collection of that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm mainly thinking about the organic layer of arctic tundra. The organics don't begin to decay and release methane until the underlying permafrost melts, at which point the surface layer turns to an organic soup and begins to decay like any other wetland. </p></div>		</li>
