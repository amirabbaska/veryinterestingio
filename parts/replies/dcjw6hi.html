			<div class="markdown"><p>Strange. I thought in most places disposal is free. Here in Austria shops even have to take back your old electronic devices when you buy new ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electronics make a bit more sense since you can profit from recycling. In the US, at least from my experience, it all goes in a dump and someone needs to pay for that dump. At least with cars, tree waste, remodeled house trash ect. </p>
<p>It's possible to recycle electronics here. A few places will take some of it for free. if you have enough, they will pay for it. Mostly made to complicated for most tho. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the property I live on was a dump many years ago. Very little plastic, lots of glass and metal. We've found some pretty neat things over the years when we try to clean it up from time to time. I guess back then, people didn't think about the environment or simply just didn't care. I guess the same could be said for people today.</p></div>		</li>
