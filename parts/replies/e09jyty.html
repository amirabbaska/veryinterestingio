<p>That being said, the real question is why doesn't water at the bottom of the ocean compresses so much that it freezes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer that question: water just isn't very compressable. Water decreases in volume by about 2% at the bottom of the ocean. The bottom of the ocean is only around 40 MPa of pressure. For reference atmospheric pressure is 0.101325 MPa so it's a huge change. You would need pressures an order of magnitude greater than that at the bottom of the ocean to form ice above 0 deg C.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the pressure isn't what keeps water at the bottom of the ocean at 4C. Since water at 4C is densest, it just sinks to bottom. If it got colder, it would just rise? Seeing as water can only have a freezing point higher than 0C at around 1GPa, the high pressure at the bottom of the ocean doesn't even play a role here. /u/twik900 seems to imply that the pressure is what keeps water at 4C.</p></div>		</li>
