			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry if this is a stupid question.</p>
<p>But since we know that sleeping repairs muscles, helps memory etc.</p>
<p>Why do we say we are not sure what it is for?</p>
<p>Isn't it for all those things?</p>
<p>Surely the body needs to be in a state of sleep to make sure those processes run without interruption.</p>
<p>If you're awake how will the muscle repair begin if your body is not sure wether you will start using them again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the question is why you have to lose consciousness for those processes to take place.  When it comes to muscle repair (or bodily maintenance in general) all the processes that cause that to happen, happen whether or not you lose consciousness.  My suspicion is that it does directly have to do with memory formation or mental processes in general, because it is, after all, the mind that has to shut down for it to do whatever it's doing.  The body doesn't need unconsciousness to repair and maintain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The brain also does a lot of processing while we sleep. That couldn't really be done while we're conscious because you'd basically be dreaming while awake, which could be very dangerous. Similarly, it's probably not a great idea to do extensive repair work when the body is in motion and don't work that could be damaging the structures you're trying to repair. Sleep paralyzes the muscles, which is great for not falling out of bed, but also ensures that you're not trying to deadlift one and a half times your body weight while the body is trying to repair your muscles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The mind doesn't shut down during sleep; don't you dream?  The connections between the mind and body shut down.  When I run in my dreams, I am lying in bed.  When I scream in my dreams, I lie silent in bed.  </p>
<p>When you are asleep, the body can grow and repair without having to worry about your brain trying to move it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take the case of the jellyfish I linked above again: They have no real muscles to speak of, nor do they have a brain. They are one of the simplest life forms out there - they are literally just a central nervous system with a physical body.</p>
<p>You would think they wouldn't need to sleep at all. They have no need to retain memories, and I have my doubts that they damage themselves too much simply by moving around.</p>
<p>So if they don't need to repair their muscles, nor to retain memories (because again, <em>they have no brain</em>), then why in the world do they have to sleep?</p>
<p>As u/Deathwedgie mentioned, why do we lose consciousness? But in the case of jellyfish it goes a little beyond that. What is it that causes them to react slowly when they haven't slept? Why does a lack of sleep affect something that has no brain like it would with those who do?</p>
<p>In short, we understand the <em>benefits</em> of sleeping. But not the root cause of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats a very good point.</p>
<p>Maybe the central nervous system is the reason we need sleep.</p>
<p>The jellyfish example serves as an eliminator for brain/muscles/memories needing sleep, one could assume.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it for certain that these are the same functions? May our sleep be multiple kinds of subgenres of different versions of rest layered on top of each other. Do jelly fish for example have different stages of sleep, if not are the stages we have traceable through some common ancestors of other species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I can think of is that in synapse we transfer electric or chemical signals and these deplete over time.</p>
<p>Of course we recharge this compounds while awake, but probably not at the rate of consumption.</p>
<p>While we are off we can make up the difference.</p>
<p>So the nervous system must work like a battery.</p>
<p>When we do not have enough sleep or recovery of these &quot;charges&quot; then we are forced to work at a slower rate (feel sleepy) so we do not completely deplete our sources.
Remembering that not sleeping kills us - probably causing failure in some parts of the nervous system as they can not recharge anymore.</p>
<p>I am not talking at the available energy within an organism, but the rate at which we can transfer this energy to neuron cells.</p>
<p>And of course sleeping must have developed more benefits to more complex organisms.</p></div>		</li>

<p>we're still not even entirely sure what sleep is for.</p>

<p>Tononi's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK435759/" target="_blank">synaptic homeostasis hypothesis</a> is the most compelling one I've come across regarding the functional necessity of sleep at a neurophysiological level.</p>
<p>And given that its primary focus is at the synaptic level, it seems capable of incorporating sleepy jellyfish with neurons but no CNS under its umbrella!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so incredibly fascinating, and explains a great deal. I have to wonder how much of this applies to a creature without the higher brain functions (like Jellyfish), but either way this is really fascinating.</p>
<p>Thanks for the article!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plants need periods of darkness to function properly. They don’t have brains. Mostly because their mechanisms allow for
Food creation during light and drawing nutrients up, and food storage and dropping them down into the roots at night. Without both, the plant suffers and can’t fun tion optimally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating, I did not know this. I was under the impression that plants under 24/7 sunlight could grow to be many times larger than normal - like with what we see come out of Alaskan harvests during the summertime.</p>
<p>Either way, it's interesting to see.</p></div>		</li>
