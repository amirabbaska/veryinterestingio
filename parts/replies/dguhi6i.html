			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me be a bitch for a second and say your argument doesn't make sense for me. Here is why:</p>
<p>You said, lets pretend 0/0 = 0, and then if we take an example of</p>
<p>0*3 = 0</p>
<p>Then by algebra you did</p>
<p>(0*3)/0 = 0/0 (so far with you)</p>
<p>then, (0/0)*(3) = 0/0 (here you contradicted yourself, you cancelled out the 0/0 as 1 and assumed that 3 will remain as the answer on the left side, these might be due to our regular practices)</p>
<p>but this case is different since if we are assuming 0/0 = 0, then,</p>
<p>(0/0)<em>3 is not equal to 1</em>3, but rather 0 *3 then equaling 0,</p>
<p>hence 0 = 0</p>
<p>again, </p>
<p>0*3 = 0</p>
<p>(0*3)/0 = 0</p>
<p>0/0 * 3 = 0</p>
<p>0 * 3 = 0</p>
<p>0=0</p>
<p>I hope you understood what I am trying to say. Please correct me if I did anything wrong. Again, remember that this a special case where 0/0 = 0. </p></div>		</li>

<p>(0*3)/0 = 0</p>
<p>0/0 * 3 = 0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here you are using the Associative and Communtative laws. But if we assume that these 2 laws apply, we can also transform this equation to </p>
<blockquote>
<p>0*(3/0)=0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But now we can see where this goes wrong, because </p>
<blockquote>
<p>0*(3/0)=0=(0*3)/0 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>is clearly not equal since the left part (3/0) is undefined while the right part equals to 0 under your assumptions. </p>
<p>Now we have broken two of the most fundamental laws in math.</p></div>		</li>
