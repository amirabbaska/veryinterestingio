			<div class="markdown"><p>Even a few modern games have issues with the hardware speed as well.  I remember trying to play a original release of Quake on newer machines, but it wasn't possible because the closer the character moved to a wall, the less there was to process and render speeding up the game.  As the game speed up, you just ended up running faster right into the wall.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure it was Quake?</p>
<p>Quite certain by the time Quake came out, programmers were using timers to control game simulation.</p>
<p>Quake ran fine on anything from a 66Mhz Pentium to a 233Mhz Pentium II. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I first got the game on a Pentium 66 and it played fine.  Later I had a PIIC 333, P3 800, AMD 1.3.  At some point I was just not able to play it because of it.  I haven't pulled it off my shelf since 2000 because of that.</p>
<p>I heard Descent was another one.  2 players could drag race in a multiplayer game and the faster computer would win.  These days that wouldn't happen because the game server would enforce the rules.  That game had a unusual balance of client/server network model even for its time.  It allowed players to jump in and out of games at will.  If the host left the game, then one of the other clients could get assigned the host almost seamlessly.</p></div>		</li>
