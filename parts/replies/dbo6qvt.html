<p>Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy in which there is high blood pressure and either large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction.</p>

<p>I feel like Wikipedia's working isn't clear here. The high blood pressure itself is what causes the protein in the urine so the definition they use combines both the cause and one of the symptoms.  Just thought that was odd.  I guess there isn't really a better way to say preeclampsia is very high blood pressure and at least one negative effect on an organ. </p></div>		</li>
