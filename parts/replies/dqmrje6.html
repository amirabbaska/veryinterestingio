			<div class="markdown"><p>Hoe exactly does that work? Does someone go there and tell you they think they have Ebola or do they actually fake the symptoms?
Because I'd have thought that would be obvious really quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, because it's that simple. I've got two degrees and work experience, never seen any kind of job like this and I found it fascinating. A lot of times, especially in research areas, it's a very small community involved so reaching out to someone for career advice is pretty common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Um, to share another way, my husband went to school for clinical lab sciences, but applied for public health jobs in bioterrorism preparedness. He's worked in two different states, and found a separate job during the Ebola outbreak in Liberia, where he lived for 15 months (and the rest of us were with him for 9 months). He said if you're genuinely looking to get into that kind of work he could PM his job details to you for better searching. :)</p></div>		</li>
