			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be for some people, but I only really get annoyed about the cell phone thing if you're somewhere where it really isn't appropriate and you're loud about it. The other day there was some guy talking on speaker phone outside of our classroom about a gross medical issue. It's not okay. Bathroom stall, library, outside active classrooms... Especially not on speakerphone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Outside a classroom, in a library (especially a college library), or in a bathroom stall (especially if you're taking up the only handicap stall twiddling your ass on a phone call) are not right.</p></div>		</li>
