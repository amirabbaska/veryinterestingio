<p>Similar survival curves can be seen in other cancers - however, there are still some types that have had very little improvements such as recurrent, certain metastatic, specific mutations, etc.  Or more recently, with the advancements in genetic sequencing and biopathology, we are better at determining how high risk a person's specific disease is.  What used to be seen as a single type of brain tumor has now been discovered to have multiple sub-types where one sub-type is almost 100% cured and another has very poor prognosis.</p>
<p>The research that millions of donation dollars goes to is doing good things, even if it may not seem like it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct, although if you develop (for example)  colon cancer, and it spreads to your liver, it would be colon cancer in your liver,  not liver cancer.  Same for breast cancer that spreads to your lungs,  breast cancer and lung cancer are distinct cancers, but breast cancer that spreads is still breast cancer.  Or at least that's how I understood my oncologist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is absolutely correct.</p>
<p>And it’s very helpful for your future doctors if you can say “I had a history of colon cancer cancer that spread to organs X, Y, Z” instead of saying “I had colon, liver, and brain cancer”.  The former is helpful and tells your family doctor what they need to keep an eye on.  The latter isn’t very helpful.  The doc may just assume you’re talking about colon cancer with mets, because primary liver cancer is fairly rare unless you have risk factors and primary brain tumors don’t often metastasize outside the brain/spinal cord).  However, it’s better if you can help the doctor remove the guesswork.</p>
<p>Hope you’re doing better now!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to that - the method of testing and approving drugs in medicine is very rigorous. Lots of trials starting from animals to people to sicker people and so on just to prove these drugs work before they can be sold and available to those that need it (there are some quicker shortcuts such as patients being put on clinical trials). </p>
<p>One big problem with these drugs are the side effects associated with them. Since cancer cells are like our cells, it's hard to kill them without killing our own. That's traditionally a problem with the older, more classical chemotherapy drugs. The newer biologic (based off our own DNA and proteins) drugs can also have the same problem. If in these research trials and tests the drug is found to kill too many of the person's good cells, it makes it harder for it to progress through the stages. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally phase I trials for cancer drugs actually start with the sickest people as basically human safety trials / a last shot at helping otherwise non-responsive, terminal patients, but beyond that, yes.</p>
<p>Also there's sometimes problems with animal cancer models not reflecting human cancer, making gene-based therapies fail pre-clinical animsl models while having been promising in vitro or in humanized tumors.</p></div>		</li>
