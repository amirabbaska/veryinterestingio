			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! This is definitely something that comes up often. For now, we just point to the research supporting the fact that rainbow colormaps are terrible at representing data (in most cases). There's actually a lot of literature supporting this, it just isn't often talked about since colormap choice seems like a small detail to many. Our paper (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0199239" target="_blank"><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0199239" target="_blank">https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0199239</a></a>) can be used as a reference, as well as some papers we cite within it!</p></div>		</li>
