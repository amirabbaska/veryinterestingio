			<div class="markdown"><p>Article says 27 to 5 Celsius in tropical areas as an average - maybe it said mean? - temperature for years. So, 80 to 41 Fahrenheit. Imagine that in the jungles of today's world. Animals would die en masse</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I imagine it was the combination of both. Not only do they get less energy because there is less sunlight for plants to grow, but they also lose more energy because they have to use it to stay warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the study: “The long-term cooling caused by the sulfate aerosols was much more important for the mass extinction than the dust that stays in the atmosphere for only a relatively short time. It was also more important than local events like the extreme heat close to the impact, wildfires or tsunamis,” says co-author Georg Feulner who leads the research team at PIK. It took the climate about 30 years to recover, the scientists found.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no simple answer to the K-Pg mass extinction. While the impact hypothesis is now [widely accepted] (<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/asteroid-killed-dinosaurs/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/asteroid-killed-dinosaurs/</a>), ongoing analyses are finding some interesting nuance to the problem. For example, evaluation of [sedimentation rates] (<a href="https://phys.org/news/2013-03-global-asteroid-impact-k-pg-extinction.html" target="_blank">https://phys.org/news/2013-03-global-asteroid-impact-k-pg-extinction.html</a>) (how much sediment was swept off the continents, in this case) lends support to massive wildfires burning nearly every twig and leaf on land. This would help account for the [&quot;global fern spike&quot;] (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5547/1700" target="_blank">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5547/1700</a>) and, clearly, collapse of terrestrial ecosystems.
There are two big issues with studying the K-Pg extinction: </p>
<ol>
<li>There are few areas that preserve a nice sequence of layers that represent the time right before and right after the event (possibly due to massive erosion from landscape disturbance).</li>
<li>It takes a lot to kill off so many lineages. Life is resilient, and it's not likely that a single cause could do it. All of the other mass extinctions have complex mechanisms and complex timing to them.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Civilization would collapse but humans are smart and the most resourceful lifeforms on the planet. Add the fact that we can eat almost anything and have plenty of stored food that would last decades and I'd say we wouldn't die off. </p></div>		</li>
