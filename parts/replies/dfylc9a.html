			<div class="markdown"><p>How is the speed gain negligible? Conventional trains on rail cap at about 400kph.  A vacuum transport system could reach mach 4.  Safety was a major concern the first time someone flew across the Atlantic, now thousands of people do it daily.  </p>
<p>Air locking is the only way to make this possible, and would significantly reduce the time to pressurized. </p>
<p>Think train pulls into station inside the tube, walls at either end shut. Tube pressurized to 1 atm. Debark and load.  Shut.Tube, pressurize by removing all ait in lock. Open doors...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>After listening to this podcast I think they were only aiming for just below Mach 1 for the final speed. Although that is still 3 times faster than conventional rail.   It takes far to much energy for Mach 4 to be possible. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously you can close the vacuum at a station and you'll be fine, but the safety issue is that if something breaks (or is sabotaged, this would be great terror attack target) at any point along the Thousand mile tube you'll have a column of air entering at Mach 1 and it'll tear apart the pressurized cars and kill everyone in them. Also I don't know how they plan to power these, turbines don't work in a vacuum, rockets need air and I suppose you could use electromagnets but that gets expensive very fast</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fyi, rockets don't need air. Rocket fuels either have their own oxidizer or carry a separate tank of oxidizer/oxygen. Not saying it's a good option for this, just thought I'd correct that part of the comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the goal is a vaccum that is similar to 15-30 thousand feet altitude. The specific pod they decide to use will help define exacltly what pressure it will have, some designs ride on cushions of air like your elemetary school leafblower hoverboards or have ram jets or other crazy stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all of these cases of an attack your assuming the track would be accessible to people on the surface of the earth... Most proposals place a hyperloop underground.  Additionally, like oil pipelines there isn't just one single layer of material before you get the the goods, so to speak.  </p>
<p>Emergency bulk heads that drop in an emergency would likely mitigate most disaster, and would shut down the line all at once.  People could be emergency removed by pressuring the tube.   The other major concern of an accident is really just something that has to be accepted... People die in planes, trains and car accidents every year, and we still support all of these industries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor bone of contention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you've got a positively pressurized vessel inside a negatively pressurized vessel</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're calling the passenger compartment &quot;positively pressurized&quot;...compared to what? Not atmospheric pressure?....and the transport tube &quot;negatively pressurized&quot;...compared to what? Apparently atmospheric pressure?</p>
<p>Intentional or not, you're manipulating your systems of reference to exaggerate, and that's dishonest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, obviously.  What else would you compare the pressure of a vessel to other than its immediate surroundings?</p>
