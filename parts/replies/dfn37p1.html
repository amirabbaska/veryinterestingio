			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I didn't think Ed Harris really did it. I just meant I thought the liquid breathing tech itself was real, which apparently it was. I saw a comment somewhere in this thread saying that when breathing liquid we can't get rid of CO2 fast enough, which made me wonder if I was wrong thinking it was real in The Abyss. I guess the mouse wasn't doing it long enough for CO2 to be a problem.</p></div>		</li>
