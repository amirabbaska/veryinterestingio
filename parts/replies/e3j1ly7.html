Coastal Norwegian town about to get ransacked contaminates their stock of fish with lye, then after the raiders leave, it's the only food they have left, so they rinse it as best they can and no one died eating it. New delicacy! I can't stand it though. Something about the texture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, in fairness, I think that seaweed and fish eggs make about as much sense as anything else. Seaweed is a leafy green, so if you live by the ocean where it's abundant, I don't think it would be much different than if you lived inland and tried cabbage or something. Similarly, if you know eggs are edible, and you see fish eat eggs... well I guess it would make sense to think you could eat it. </p>
<p>That being said, if you were making a reference to sushi specifically, the answer is even cooler. So, imagine you're some guy living by the ocean in China, sometime several millennia ago. You've caught all these great fish, but they're going to go bad before you can eat them, and you can't store them for the winter. So you look around to see what you have available to fix this issue, at which point notice you have a crap ton of rice and salt. So you pack the fish in a mixture of rice and salt, which kills off bad bacteria, but allows for lacto-fermentation. The result isn't the best tasting, but now you have something that won't go bad and kill you when you eat it, so that's a plus. </p>
<p>Skip forward to the big period between the 12th-18th century, and people are still a big fan of fish that doesn't kill you when they eat it, but they're less enthusiastic about the fact that lacto-fermentation makes their food smell like gym socks. Some folks start reducing fermentation time, and people actually enjoy the semi-sour taste. On the other hand, in Japan some cooks have started just serving rice with fish that hasn't been fermented at all, and while this prevents the nasty smell, you don't get that good bit of sour. The perfect middle ground popped up in the form of rice vinegar at some point between 1600-1800, since this allowed you to add some sourness to the fish/rice combo without any fermentation. However, the resulting dish looked more like a bowl of fish and vegetables with rice than our modern sushi.</p>
<p>So this fish rice-bowl idea has started getting really popular in Japan, and you can find it in a ton of cities by 1800. Some time around 1820, a chef in Tokyo (allegedly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanaya_Yohei" target="_blank">Hanaya Yohei</a>) is looking to mix things up, so he squeezes some vinegared rice into a little oval, and instead of using a bowl, he just drapes a slice of fish over the top. Boom, all the sudden you have what we would call sushi (Nigirizushi), and this stuff is awesome. You can make it fairly cheap, really quickly, and it's basically the perfect little snack food. However, for the better part of a century the concept stays pretty much in Tokyo, where it's a popular niche dish. In order to complete the last leg of this history, and to propel sushi into it's esteemed modern position in Japanese cuisine, we're going to need a dose of unspeakable tragedy. </p>
<p>In 1923, Japan gets hit by one of the worst earthquakes in its history, and Tokyo is particularly badly devastated. The quake hit right about at dinnertime, when most of the city had a stove running, so pretty much instantly absolutely everything was on fire. It got so hot that people's feet were sinking into the asphalt on the roads, and a straight up fire tornado killed 38,000 people who had tried to find shelter in a warehouse complex. All in all, over 140,000 people lost their lives, and Tokyo was looking pretty devastated. This is pretty dark, so let me get to the little silver lining about how this helped us to eat sushi. With so many homes destroyed, people from Tokyo started dispersing around the Japan looking for new places to live, and they brought the idea of small bite-sized sushi with them. As it turns out, the rest of Japan was absolutely crazy for this stuff once they were exposed to it, and with the advent of refrigeration people started experimenting with adding new types of seafood, leading to the huge variety we have today!</p>
<p>As a quick aside, the kind of sushi dish wrapped in seaweed (Makizushi) seems to have developed a little bit earlier. Around 1750 wrapping rice and bits of fish, veggies, or mushrooms in a tube of seaweed got somewhat popular, so this version <em>technically</em> predates modern sushi. However, as far as I can tell it kind of drew from Nigirizushi when it came to adding vinegar+fresher fish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That example doesn't actually seem too weird to me. Seaweed is a plant and probably every plant has been tasted for edibility by a human at some point; and we've eaten raw meat and fish much longer than we've eaten it cooked. People probably started liking fish eggs about as fast as we started fishing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Please excuse my ignorance but could someone not just culture the mold and find out what it is? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly right. A lot of cheese manufacturers copyright their own strain. You see this a lot with 'probiotic' yoghurt products too. Sure you could easily subculture them, but 'Big Cheese' wont let you use it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're getting confused; you cannot copyright or trademark living things, only your own creative work (like books, art, etc.).</p>
<p>Breeders can make use of the patent system <em>for certain things</em>.  It's generally much more specific (i.e. less broad) than most people understand.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Plant breeders can get variety protection for new varieties they develop.  This is generally a 20 year protection and requires a thorough description of the variety being protected.  If you find something in the grocery store with a fun name (like 'sunshine' berries, etc.) there's a good chance that's a protected variety.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The method of propagation matters; there are different rules for vegetative propagation (cuttings, root/shoot-stock, etc.) vs. sexual propagation.</p>
</li>
<li>You can also get utility patents (which is basically what most people think of with patents), but they're much harder to get.  For micro-organisms, there have been some recent patents for yeast to produce compounds from hops and cannabis.  This applies to the particular genetic construct that was used to transform the yeast, and is applicable because RNA-derived sequence is considered an unnatural invention (see the BRCA supreme court case).  </li>
</ul>
<p>As far as I know, there are no patented strains of yeast used in brewing, cheesemaking, etc.  These are not plants, nor are they novel for the purposes of a utility patent.</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> patented methods of yeast culturing, harvesting, drying, etc.  Perhaps that's causing confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things. One, in most cases, that part about being a guarded secret is generally not true. Most blue cheeses have one of two or three strains that do the blue cheese thing, the most common one being penicillium roqueforti, but there are others that produce a more greenish color and generally more <em>funk</em>y flavor or greyish color and a generally more earthy/mushroomy flavor. Most people use penicillium roqueforti and it's no secret. </p>
<p>Sometimes, though, these cheese producers are using a blend of cultures, with 4+ different strains and in different concentrations. In some of these cases, one strain will take over in the initial 2 weeks and do its thing before dying off. As a simple example, let's say milk has a gently acidic pH to start. One of the added cultures thrives in an environment of 4.5-6.5 pH, and so loves warm, neutral milk. Another however is mostly inactive unless the pH is between 3.3 and 4.8. That first culture will take over and colonize for a while, but when the pH approaches 4.5 the other bacteria jump in to action and cause the pH to drop further - to around 3.9. Now the first culture is largely inactive, but has done it's part. In a cheese that will be aged for a year or two, you would be very hard pressed to find any cultural remnants of the initial culture by swabbing the cheese. However, it's presence is important to the development of the cheese nonetheless. </p></div>		</li>
