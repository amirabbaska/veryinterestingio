			<p>My point was they either made money (a positive profit) or lost money (a loss). I dont care how it compares to last year. My question was how they can report a loss and a profit at the same time. Profit means you made money. Loss means you lost money. As others have explained, the &quot;profit&quot; they are referring to is &quot;operating profit&quot;, without adjusting for other cost of doing business, not net profit.  </p>		</li>

			<p>The BBC statement, which I did not read, is sourced from the quarterly report I provided. It also states the same thing you mentioned. However, I think you misunderstood.. See I'm explaining the difference between profit and net income/loss for 2015. Not the trend in net income/loss from 2014 to 2015. The $12.1B is an income statement item and is therefore closed to equity at the end of 2014 anyway so it would not affect the 2015 income amounts. You are correct about the $11.7B hit in 2015 due to the gulf oil spill which was used in calculating the $5.9B in replacement profit.</p>		</li>
