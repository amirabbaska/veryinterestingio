			<div class="markdown"><p>The fruit fly study is really interesting, though now I would be curious to know what are the down sides of long life? Surely longer life in flies would just lead to more offspring. In what way are they being disadvantaged? Are they slower? Less fertile? Something else?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a general negative correlation between longevity and fecundity - i.e. how rapidly a group reproduces. There have been experiments in which animals were put into an environment with none of their natural predators, and as their average lifespan extended they found the individuals were reproducing later and later. Not really an answer to your question but just an illustration how the two things could be linked in principle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall having seen a study that showed a pretty strong correlation between the age of puberty/sexual maturity and longevity, even among indivuduals of the same species. E.g. late sexual maturity means a longer potential life span.</p>
<p>On a very shallow level I can definitely see how achieving reproductive capabilities later than other individuals might be a disadvantage as you may die of external causes before you can reproduce. Longer generations would make a species adapt slower to environmental changes, which may also be a weakness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding it right, it's not that long life is disadvantageous, it's just that the genes that cause longer life also happen to cause other negative things. It's like if you change a few lines of code in a video game to give yourself infinite ammo, there's a good chance you're also going to create a bug somewhere in the game. It's not the infinite ammo causing the bug, they're just both being caused by the same thing. With something as complex as dna, it's hard to change one thing intentionally without screwing something else up by accident.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In fiction, genetic modification is sometimes portrayed as programming or stacking lego bricks, to create a hybrid of two or more animals. This view is far from the truth. While some properties are controlled by a single or a few genes (like colour blindness), many properties and conditions are caused by the interplay of hundreds or thousands of genes, and that is without taking into account epigenetics. Turning this around, one gene may also be responsible for hundreds of properties. Apparently, thousands of &quot;autism genes&quot; have been identified. Trying to repair those will inevitably lead to other problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What makes you think this is the case? What are the chances that the same genes that affect longevity also affect something else that is detrimental? I find that very unlikely. Based on the observations from that fruit fly experiment, it looks more like longevity itself was detrimental, since the long-lived species in isolation had no issues. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Longevity correlates directly with certain aspects of bio-chemical responses and behavior. Even social behaviors are often directly influenced by a stark shift in life span. Humans are an actual field of study on this particular phenomenon. As we have only recently nearly doubled or lifespans. The results are already quite telling, if not troubling in determining future problems. We are starting to have fewer children rather than more, and also having them later in life. This seemingly minor thing is already effecting the biology of future generations as having children later in life creates all sorts of health issues that were rarer in previous generations. Something you have to consider, is that nature often takes the path of least resistance. The most efficient route, rather than the most advantageous one. It would seem obvious that living longer would allow for more opportunities for reproduction. But opportunity might not necessarily be the driving force. A shorter life span might actually be the most efficient course to promote high reproduction rates in a species. &quot;No time to dawdle. We gotta make babies.&quot; mentality. As to where with a long life might have a &quot;I'll get to it eventually. I got time.&quot; perception. </p>
<p>Edit: there is a theory. That this effect has happened before. Where adults lived longer, thus had few children later in life. Therefore causing later generations to have increased risk for health problems. That would in turn shorten their lifespans. Thus creating an accordion type effect throughout history that slowly corrects for these shifts in lifespans. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Doesn't really seem like this could be an evolutionary force for lifespan. Humans seem to be the only species that even has the mental capability to make this choice, and even then we've really only had the technology to easily facilitate this beyond abstinence quite recently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What a break down! Thanks for this. It makes me think that language was one of the big factors behind making longevity advantageous. With the introduction of oral traditions and story telling comes our massive advancement in accumulated knowledge.</p>
<p>There’s no “tribal elder” when there’s no language or accumulated wisdom.</p>
<p>I’m completely guessing, but this will have me thinking today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do also think a large part of it is that elders who are unable to do typical adult tasks (hunting, foraging, farming, fighting, etc) are still able to keep an eye on the younger children, feed them, teach them, etc. Which then frees up more capable hands from childcare to move on to other important tasks. </p>
<p>While language is helpful, yes, extra hands is <em>very</em> helpful. </p></div>		</li>
