			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing to note is that over the last 10 years Hollywood has kinda stopped making movies like &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Gladiator.&quot; For that kind of money you can make a new superhero movie/established reboot and not risk anything. There are still large opulent productions from established directors, but they tend to be more in specific genres and less aimed at the Oscar market.</p>
<p>So part of the reason that the really artsy indie films have been celebrated more now is because Hollywood basically ceded the high-end arthouse space to them. And while some big budget films get made and nominated, many of them are just really great Hollywood fare that happened to be good anyway and not specifically aimed at the Oscar market until studios realized what they had (Inception, Mad Max), and the others are from auteurs who are quite consciously pushing and doing something radically different stylistically (Birdman, La La Land). </p>
<p>I could be wrong though. Hidden Figures is pretty much a counterargument to what I'm saying. Still it feels like Hollywood has decided that Oscar films aren't worth investing in. It's fine if they're good and get recognized, but genre films are where the money is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another problem Hollywood has is they're no longer the masters of drama. TV is. Goodfellas is amazing, but no character in it can possibly be as complex as Tony Soprano, simply because of the time constraints of a theatrical film. A character like Walter White can not be built over 2 hours, nor can a story as intricate as The Wire.</p>
<p>OTOH, Fury Road is 2 hours of almost perfect entertainment, but its premise couldn't sustain a 5 season HBO series. Probably. Maybe. Fuck, I'd probably watch it. But the point stands. Hollywood is more going all-in with premises that are best told as short stories, but the Oscars are still looking for novels, mostly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They did this in the 90s, too.  If you go back and watch the old Billy Crystal opening monologues, a lot of the jokes are about panicky studios only having one movie nominated (IIRC Jerry Maguire) and the awards going to the &quot;arthouse&quot; films (English Patient, Good Will Hunting, Sling Blade, etc).  Shakespeare in Love <em>was</em> considered a small-studio movie at the time, I think (Miramax was not a major studio and it mostly did &quot;arty&quot; films, and nobody had heard of Joseph Fiennes).</p>
<p>It was also a period where diversity was more valued and you had more black and hispanic leading actors of major films (Denzel Washington, Whoopie Goldberg, Angela Bassett, Antonio Banderas, etc).  That dropped off sharply again in the 2000s in favor of blockbuster white-led films and is only now slowly starting to reemerge.  </p>
<p>Obviously there are a fair number of exceptions on both sides of that (it's not like Denzel Washington stopped acting), but for the most part movies go in waves between blockbuster popularity and then a backlash appreciation of more thoughtful films, and back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hidden figures was a surprisingly good Hollywood movie, and it has an important story that needed to be told. But it does fit into a long-standing trend of Hollywood films that address overlooked minorities in american history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this. It is far more usual that the films winning Oscars are not the same as those that are most critically acclaimed. It is usually those which have made a big splash during the year and it is rarely one that would be considered Art House.</p>
<p>But then artistry doesn't mean just one thing. La La Land was, in my opinion, a poor exercise in storytelling. <strong>However</strong>, the cinematography and choreography were so on point that La La Land - which I personally hated so badly I spent that 800 hours (or however long the fucking thing lasts - an eternity, I think) staring at my watch - totally deserves to be heralded at the Oscars. It's an odd thing that I can watch a film, hate it, and still think it should win awards, but I think that's how art goes. You can see the mastery of something without actually enjoying it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shakespeare in Love was actually a pretty big upset when it beat Saving Private Ryan, the favourite going in.</p>
<p>Good examples of big Hollywood blockbusters beating smaller box office films now generally held in higher esteem include Forrest Gump over both Shawshank and Pulp Fiction, and Dances with Wolves over Goodfellas.</p>
<p>A great example of Hollywood insiders boosting a mediocre movie over a masterpiece is the tepid Ordinary People over Raging Bull.</p>
<p>That said, there's definitely a general bias at the Oscars of &quot;serious drama&quot; over comedy, action, or speculative fiction, while those are often the highest grossing genres. The Grammys avoids this in part by having major awards for multiple genres.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, Miramax was a small arthouse studio at the time.  Nobody had heard of Joseph Fiennes, and the only reason people had heard &quot;Fiennes&quot; before is because Ralph Fiennes was in the artsy English Patient 2 years before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying Ordinary People is bad; it's a fine film, but compared to Raging Bull, it's just good. The Academy voted for it overwhelmingly over Raging Bull because it was directed by Redford, a major Hollywood personality, while RB was directed by Scorcese, a New Yorker who shunned LA culture.</p>
<p>Alongside Scorcese, Woody Allen, Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock got boned by the Oscar bias towards Californians. </p></div>		</li>
