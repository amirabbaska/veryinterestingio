			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual reason phones struggle in the cold is that, the batteries arent as effective in extreme cold. The battery gets too chilled to provide enough energy to the phone, so the core clocks ramp down to compensate power usage. That is assuming it is still working in the cold at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically. Low temperatures also increase the internal resistance of the battery, further compounding the problem. That's why they sell beefy car batteries for cold areas, at 0f/-18c your battery is only able to output half of what it could at room temp. </p>
<p>I live in one of those cold areas, in a townhome complex. It's always entertaining to listen to people try to turn over their engines in the morning on a cold day.</p>
<p>The same principle affects your phone though. While it's unlikely that your phone battery will reach 0f unless you leave it outside over night, you still lose a good amount of power depending on how cold it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The reaction in the battery is slower the colder it gets. </p>
<p>The conductivity in wires increases as it gets colder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of reaction. In the case of batteries, the operation depends on ion mobility through the battery, which decreases with decreasing temperature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note because I know it despite the fact that it's useless. The speed of electrons is given by the equation v=I/Ane</p>
<p>Where </p>
<p>v=drift velocity(velocity of electrons)</p>
<p>I=current</p>
<p>A=cross sectional area of wire</p>
<p>n=number of electrons</p>
<p>e=charge on a single electron</p>
<p>Obviously current will be dependent on resistance which is dependent on temperature </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, in normal circumstances, the drift velocity is much slower than the speed of the electron. They move around a lot due to the temperature but overall have a slight tendency to drift towards the positive terminal. </p></div>		</li>
