My eyes don't even try to adjust anymore they just say &quot;fuck it, stick your arms out and pray you don't step on your kids toy jet with the really sharp edges. Good luck.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a photosensitive chemical produced by rod cells that allows you to see at night. Light destroys this chemical, and without it, you can't see at night. If you shut off all the lights in your house and close your eyes for about 15 minutes you'll acclimate to the darkness and be able to see in low light conditions, as the chemical takes about 15 minutes to replenish. If there isn't any light to see, though, you'll not see anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a fun and dangerous game of hide and seek at night . The “seeker” goes into the bathroom with the light on and stares at the light while counting. You keep the rest of the house as dark as possible. Flip the bathroom light off and go seek. It’s hard as hell even if someone is standing right against the wall. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly why scientists don't refer to them as &quot;red cones&quot; or &quot;blue cones&quot;, but rather as &quot;S cones&quot; (for &quot;short wavelength&quot;,) &quot;M cones&quot; (for &quot;medium wavelength&quot;), or &quot;L cones&quot; (for &quot;long wavelength&quot;.)  Knowing which cell was stimulated tells you almost nothing about what color was perceived, because there are so many other factors, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opponent_process" target="_blank">the opponent process system</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_constancy" target="_blank">color constancy</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purkinje_effect" target="_blank">the Purkinje effect</a>, etc.</p>
<p>Color vision is complicated, and a lot of the comments in this thread are garbage, mostly because people are talking about artificial color models like RGB or CMYK instead of the actual human visual system.  Unfortunately, it's been a while since I studied perceptual psych, and I don't remember it well enough to give a good answer to OP's original question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sensitivity of cones is pretty well documented.   We've known about their structure for half a century or so, including mean frequencies, percentages of each type of cones, and the sensitivity of each cone type.  </p>
<p>Why we evolved those sensitivities is another debate.</p>
<p>So, it's not just the wiring, it's the strength of the signal of the sensors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Color is 100% a product of what our eyes can pick up, it's one of my favorite examples of anthropocentrism. Imagine if <a href="https://cdn.psychologytoday.com/sites/default/files/styles/image-article_inline_full/public/blogs/1987/2008/10/2111-75460.png?itok=-9ccaJvk" target="_blank">dogs named the colors.</a> <a href="https://www.beeculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/4Eyes-1050x478.png" target="_blank">Or bees.</a> Pit vipers can see infrared. So yeah you're totally right, if eyes had evolved differently we might see yellow as subdued and blue as vibrant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is likely because blue light is refracted more than other colors as it travels through your eye, not because of sensitivity. If you try to focus on the blue light, other colors become blurry. Someone whose vision is 20/20 (corrected or otherwise) will be nearsighted to blue light in the higher frequency ranges. This also explains why incadescent blacklights have a purple haze around them. The frequency emitted by the filament includes some violet in the visible spectrum, and light of that frequency gets refracted much more than most other light that enters the eye.</p></div>		</li>
