			<div class="markdown"><p>Radiation causes the interior of the Earth to be really, really hot in general; presumably, the calculations /u/Smithium did were to get an idea of what parts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_diagram#Crystals" target="_blank">water's phase diagram</a> would be relevant to the temperatures and pressures deep in the Earth! The conclusion was apparently that the pressures are high enough that any concentration of water would be liquid. I believe that there aren't typically large bodies of water deep under the crust though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get bonus points! I wouldn't think to put it like that, but that is basically one of the key sources of heat (originally) that far down. I would imagine that the radiation itself would be negligible compared to the magma/rock it has already heated, but in the end yeah, there is radiation.</p></div>		</li>
