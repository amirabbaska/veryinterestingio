			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good answer. As a little addition, it should be noted that the HIV reverse transcriptase is very error prone. Instinct says that this should be a bad thing, but from a viral evolutionary perspective, there's almost no faster way to induce random mutation into the mix. Most of these may be neutral, but those rare ones that give it an advantage, allow it to avoid host detection, or render anti-retroviral medication less effective is a win for the virus. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons we don't have a vaccine yet, we have no idea how to generate broadly neutralizing antibodies by immunization. In natural infection, only about 20% of patients generate bnabs, and these are always lagging behind the virus anyway, because of the high mutation rate from RT </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What we do have is a way to engineer the human immune system to be immune to HIV infection by knocking out the CCR5 receptor. This is being tested in humans now, so there may be a cure on the market in the next five to ten years.</p>
<p>It’s not trivial to get the engineered stem cells back into the bone marrow, so it remains to be seen how broadly adopted the current methods will be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most may be neutral?  That's surprising.  Given how densely coded the HIV genome is, with multiple reading frames and overlapping coding regions,  I would expect almost all mutations to be fatal.  Doesn't mean there s not a lot of within-host variation, but I would have though a lot of that is from nonviable virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind the Weigel factor. Mutations in the third nucleotide of a codon are less likely to change the amino acid of the protein than the second, which is less likely than the first. There's a lot of redundancy in the codon usage, and also many aa changes that don't result in a significant change to the active sites of the protein and as such will have minimal effect. </p>
<p>The odds for a deleterious mutation in HIV is higher than for bacterial of eukaryotic genomes, but it's not an absolute. </p>
<p>But yes many will be deleterious, but there are many more viruses to make up the difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV-1 can be split up into several categories. One of the categories accounts for 95% of infections worldwide. That one category can then be split into <strong>nine</strong> genetically-distinct strains. Not only can there be variation among strains, there can be variation among individual HIV viruses infecting the same host. Resistance to antiretroviral medication is a massive problem for treating HIV. Despite this, the mechanism of replication tends to remain constant, but the machinery involved may have slight structural changes that make it unrecognizable to the medication. </p>
<p>Essentially, antiretroviral medications work one of four ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block Reverse Transcription (but not reverse transcriptase itself)</li>
<li>They will inhibit Reverse Transcriptase</li>
<li>They will inhibit the protease responsible for cleaving viral protein precursors</li>
<li>They inhibit entry into new cells</li>
</ul>
<p>Over time, if the HIV is able to continue to replicate, resistance to antiretroviral drugs can arise due to strong selective forces. At that point, you have to switch to a new class of drug. Once you run through every class of drug, well sorry pal, you've reached the end of the line. </p></div>		</li>
