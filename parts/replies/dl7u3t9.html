			<div class="markdown"><p>the air pump's blades are experiencing localized transition from laminar to turbulent flow when exceeding their design load - therefore not moving air as well, so not experiencing as much resistance from that air, basically the blades are stalled. This loss of resistance lets the speed wind up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that this phenomenon operates under the same principle as when you block the intake flow of a vacuum cleaner. The motor speeds up because under vacuum there is no air to provide resistance against the blades.</p>
<p>In the case of your air mattress, when the internal air pressure of the mattress meets the pressure capability of the fan, air is pushed neither out nor in--so I suppose this creates a similar low-resistance condition to that of a vacuum.</p>
<p>Though the motors in both cases are under less load, they often require airflow to keep cool, and shouldn't be kept in this state for extended periods unless designed to be. You risk overheating them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To trade a little accuracy for ease of explanation:</p>
<p>When you're pushing air through the fan, it takes in new still-ish air, spins it, and pushes it out the other side.</p>
<p>When you block the fan, it can't get new air, so it just keeps spinning the already-spinning air that's in the fan.</p></div>		</li>
