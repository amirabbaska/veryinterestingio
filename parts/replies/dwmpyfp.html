<p>it's enshrined in American law and scientific ethics that it's 100% ok to lie to test subjects about what you actually plan on doing to them, so long as they know they're being tested in a broad sense.</p>

<p>I don't know a whole lot about this kind of thing, but that doesn't sound like informed consent to me. Unless you're referring to how it was in that time period specifically, which was well before informed consent was a thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Studies involving deception or concealment must meet all criteria for a waiver or alteration of informed consent. The study must pose no more than minimal risk to subjects, and the waiver or alteration must not adversely affect subjects’ rights and welfare. The nature of the study must necessitate use of deception or concealment and, therefore, the waiver or alteration.</p>

<p>The problem is that you literally cannot do science with informed consent because of placebo. The entire point is to have a control group which you lie to.</p>
<p><em>However</em> you usually lie about giving them some substance and instead give them sugar pills...not exactly insane quantities of LSD lmao</p></div>		</li>
