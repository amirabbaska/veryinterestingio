			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. I know epigenetics is the hot new thing, but so many people seem to dramatically over-estimate the effects epigenetics have on variation in traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I feel like epigenetics are such a buzzy term these days. Surprised to see that it was the top answer, but I guess I shouldn't be. There are plenty of other answers that could have been given before term epigenetics was even a thing. Moreover, most work on epigenetics is largely correlation and its true impact on phenotypes is somewhat speculative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scientific definition of epigenetics is currently in flux, however it is moving towards (semi) permanent (semi) heritable changes in DNA structure which occur in a manner besides actual base-pair mutation. Things like methylation patterns and histone/chromatin structure are absolutely epigenetics.</p>
<p>Stochasticity affecting early development by subtly changing developmental trajectories without actually affecting the structure of DNA is not really considered to be epigenetics within molecular biology. Neither is changes in gene regulation which are transient and due to regulatory elements interacting with environmental signals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, I am working to write computer simulations of the various cell network motifs and for complex signaling pathways, and it is amazing how <em>early</em> stochastic noise can cause some significant effects downstream in development. I have a feeling it is responsible for a lot more variability than people realize.</p></div>		</li>
