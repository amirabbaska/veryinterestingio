			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean, why is black the natal coat in some groups, but blond the natal coat in others?</p>
<p>I don't believe this is well-established. There are many theories. Paternity cloak (babies all have blue eyes so they don't get killed by a dominant male?), sexual mimicry, and so on. I think it is fair to say that natal coats are found in many primate species but we don't know exactly why.</p>
