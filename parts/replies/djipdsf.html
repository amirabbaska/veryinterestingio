			<div class="markdown"><p>No. A proof by contradiction will assume that there are only a finite number of primes and reach a contradiction. It is possible to prove it this way, I agree. But this is not how Euclid did it. He proved that given any finite set of primes, there is a prime outside this set. There is a prime outside <em>every</em> finite set of primes, and thus the set of primes is infinite. These finite sets are not assumed to contain <em>all</em> primes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People get so particular about that. Proof by induction, contradiction, contrapositive, etc. can all be interchanged between each other in just a few extra words. They're good as a learning tool, but I don't see a meaningful distinction.</p></div>		</li>
