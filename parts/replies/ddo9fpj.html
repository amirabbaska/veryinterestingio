<p>This helps us smell better by giving each nostril a break once in a while.</p>

<p>I'm guessing it might be more about delivering a smell across a broader timespan, since often odors are complex mixes of many chemicals, so you'll separate the component chemicals' smells a little further (either because of differing rates of diffusion/volatility or because of receptor fatigue), kind of like impromptu chromatography.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's about both things. Nostrils need to be moist and in cold/dry climates nostrils can get dried out and become less sensitive so the nasal cycle let's the nose catch up on moisturizing but it is definitely about detecting more smells as well. </p></div>		</li>
