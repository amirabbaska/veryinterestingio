			<div class="markdown"><p>What about Neanderthals? They mated freely with Homo sapiens and obviously had fertile offspring. Neanderthal was closely enough related to be in the same genus, but are different species. How does this play into the view that species differ when they can't produce fertile offspring or naturally procreate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point, by the classic definition Neanderthals should obviously not be a different species. Of course the classification of Neanderthals as a separate species is from a time when we did not have the molecular techniques to determine that Neanderthals and sapiens interbred. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't have enough data to be super sure.</p>
<p>It's quite arguable that they are not a separate species, that Neanderthals Denisovans and fully modern humans are all the same species, just different sub species.</p>
<p>There is a lot of recent genetic research, just read about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My opinion is that the only reason we classify them so differently is that scientists are prone to a kind of human bias. Like, if an alien species were given our species rulebook and told to name all the things, they would put humans in the same genus as Chimpanzees, at <em>least</em>. </p>
<p>Any other two species so similar would be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't Neanderthals sometimes considered a subspecies of Homo Sapiens? Modern humans are Homo sapiens sapiens and Neanderthals are Homo sapiens neanderthalensis. I'm not sure if the classification has changed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for giving a great answer. I'm also a biologist and I've done my fair share of evolution research. Within the realm of Evolutionary Biology this has been a debate. You made a simple explanation to generally answer the question AND inform them that there isn't really a consistent definition for species. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! It can be tough when people don't realize how complicated of a question they are asking. It would be easy to go on and on and get much more complicated. Tough to give a simple answer sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay - awesome response. As a biologist I have a follow up question. What makes a species viable but not fertile? How does the genetics play to make it work to make a zygote, but that zygotes progeny can't? That's just weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of mules, it's the number of chromosomes -- they have 63, where a horse has 64 and a donkey 62. The chromosomes cannot pair up properly for reproduction, so mules are usually sterile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then shouldn't they still be able to mate with other mules, I remember reading somewhere it's because their chromosomes are in the wrong order so when they reproduce the mothers genes don't match up with the fathers genes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird as hell. How can the disparity mean sterility? What about not having something in F1 generation means no one in F2 case means no progeny? It comes down to one sperm meeting one egg in the generation prior to it.... I just can't wrap my head.</p></div>		</li>
