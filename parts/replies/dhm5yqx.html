			<div class="markdown"><p>What's weird though is that I often experience emotion in my chest. I got into mindfulness a few years ago and part of that was exploring emotions and how they feel in the body. When I feel happy, it's like it's happening in my heart. Same with sadness, though I think that's a combination of guts and heart. Fear and anxiety are gut feelings for sure. </p></div>		</li>
