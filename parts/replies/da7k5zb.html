<p>jk, I know this is not what that means, hopefully we can start coming up with more lucrative carbon capturing technology(captures it effectively for cheaper/less energy) so that the selfishness of business men(and women) can actually help our environment versus harm it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Afaik it's the circulation of water that enables this. </p>
<p>Cold water circulates into a tropical area, heats up and drops its carbon. Meanwhile, warm water that's already dropped its carbon replaces the cold water, cools down in the Arctic, and picks up more carbon. </p>
<p>Kind of like the precipitation cycles that give us rain. </p></div>		</li>
