How quickly that will happen with technology is always uncertain and based on pricing and market consumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone interested should research a Canadian company called MorganSolar. They have tried to solve these problems by designing a highly efficient concentrating PV module that does not require silicon to be produced and which requires only common manufacturing techniques, making the cost per module decrease as their production rate increases. This has the added benefit of being independent of the cost of silicon, which some experts believe will increase as silicon demand increases for use in solar as well as other industries. </p>
<p>Edit: thank you for the feedback everyone! It probably sounds like I have an agenda because I am promoting a company, but I'm honestly just trying to learn, so the feedback is appreciated!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that kept solar cost from plummeting like  transistor costs is that we keep shrinking transistor sizes for decades.  You cannot  shrink solar cell sizes only make improvements on efficiency.  So we only get small linear increases in efficiency but exponential increases in transistor density. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give a concrete example on BOS costs and innovations, I point to the MC4 connector.  For many years, solar panels came with either screw connections or unterminated wires.  This meant that each one had to be wired by hand, in-situ, by a licensed electrician.  In ~2011, the MC4 connector entered the scene, and by this point pretty much anything you buy will have those connectors on them.  As they connect quickly by hand, the labor cost of wiring the strings themselves is almost entirely eliminated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be rude, but having worked in the industry for some time, the materials are not the problem to get costs lower.</p>
<p>The only real hurdle left is net metering, and balancing loads on utility lines. Every utility company I worked with hated solar because it has forced their engineers to deal with the massive amounts of load, particularly in high solar density communities, during daylight hours. Electric companies are used to 'pushing' electricity, from specific hubs. Solar throws a wrench in that, because you now have mini hubs everywhere someone has a solar system. The challenge then becomes how to maintain consistent voltages for homes that don't have solar.</p>
<p>Many people haven't experienced 'dirty electricty', but that's becoming more common when you live next to people with solar because the Utility hasn't balanced loads correctly. Many people are fed between 226-254volts (unless you have a single bus feed; rule of thumb is 120V per bus bar). Optimally, you're supposed to get 240 exactly, but voltage fluctuates based upon where it's fed from, the distances from said feed, temperatures, and usage. If you fall out of the normal bandwidth, your home electronics will act weird or blow out. Think 'brownout'.</p>
<p>I used to see this because of how our microinverters on systems (for monitoring purposes) were capable of reading the utility voltages. It's not rare, but it's also not uncommon.</p>
<p>Until utilities completely 'buy in' to solar, they will let their lines do the talking for them. They (already are) will charge exorbitant fees and surcharges to interconnect with them to store your surplus electricity and have their engineers provide you and your neighborhood with solid electricity. Once that changes and you get self sustainable grids where EVERYONE is on solar (and has sufficient battery tech), only then will prices dip to their lowest, IMO</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this.  The same thing has been happening in Canada with our utility providers. </p>
<p>Though the real issue is a lack of proper grid storage technologies, the engineers are simply responding to additional headaches and problems.  </p>
<p>Renewables are intermittent and difficult to predict.  This throws a big wrench in those who are tasked with balancing out the grid supply / demand.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, I was wondering about this.  Where I live the AC power is ridiculously high voltage sometimes, to the point my neighbors are concerned about their electronics.  It's supposed to be 115 volts and we commonly get as high as 125-135.  I've been considering getting a small UPS for my PC and entertainment center, would that be a good idea?</p></div>		</li>
