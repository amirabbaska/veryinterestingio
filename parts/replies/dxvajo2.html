			<div class="markdown"><p>No meteorology background but I have worked at a ski resort for several years and we see a hand full of thunderstorms a season. Graupel is almost always the tell tale sign for us. I've only seen lightning a couple of times however. When it happens it is quite the spectacle and can be pretty sketchy.
Thanks for the info, that was very easy to understand.</p></div>		</li>
