			<div class="markdown"><p>Financially, marriage shares debt in many cases (student loans included, depending on who originally cosigned for them). For instance, my parents we cosigners on my undergrad federal loans, but I was the sole signer on my graduate loans. When I married, my wife now bears equal responsibility for the loans in my name, but my parents would have to pay for what they cosigned if I defaulted.</p>
<p>Realistically, though, it's impossible to default on student loans unless you intentionally ignore them or are just plain stupid. The option for the extremely poor or unemployed people is income-based repayment, where they take a percentage of one's income. In the case of a married pair, this would be the household income, regardless of whether or not taxes were filed jointly. </p></div>		</li>
