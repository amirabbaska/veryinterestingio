			<div class="markdown"><p>So what if my parents die, and they still owe money on the house, and they don't have enough liquid assets to pay it off in full (or their life insurance policy isn't enough to cover it), but their Will says I'm to get the house. </p>
<p>Do I get the chance to inherit the house and take over the mortgage where they left off, or do I get the privilege of buying it from the bank and starting over at $0 paid off? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve recently bought the house my father and I live in, my name is the only on the mortgage because my dad is too old to get a mortgage. He had to sign a waiver that if I’d fail to pay the mortgage that he’d forgo his right to stay there, or something along those lines, that’s the general gist. </p>
<p>If I died tomorrow then I’d fail to pay the mortgage off, but I’ve got life insurance that pays out the value of the house, so logically, that money can be used to pay off the mortgage. I’m sure your parents have a similar arrangement of insurance. So you should be able to take over the house.</p>
<p>The details might be different in the USA but this is how it’s works in my situation in the UK.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Quite a bit, It is illegal to discriminate against someone who wants to borrow money based on age. This includes mortgages and mortgage refinances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, you can also get your mortgage to have a separate Life Insurance specific to it that will pay off the mortgage if you or a family member dies, sometimes this is a &quot;free&quot; benefit from the lending company. Also there is <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/finance/mortgages/the-basics-of-private-mortgage-insurance-pmi.aspx" target="_blank">PMI</a> but that is for the Lender's benefit, not the Borrowers, even though the borrower is paying for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The morgage has $X left on it, the estate (including the house) is worth $Y, if $Y is less than $X you get nothing from the inheritance.</p>
<p>If the house is worth less than $X but $Y is more than you as the inheritor could use some of the other assets to pay off the mortgage (This may require selling the house). </p>
<p>Mortgages are rarely transferable so you will have to re-start with a new mortgage in all cases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TBH, isn't this why some people list their property in the name of a Trust, and name each spouse as co-trustee, followed by the children? </p>
<p>Hence, if the parents die, the trust, which has the kids name on it already, has bypassed the probate process, and is not considered part of the estate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the primary reasons people use trusts.  My wife is a trusts and estates lawyer and her job is essentially to work with &quot;high net worth individuals&quot; to maximize the total wealth their heirs will receive.  This generally involves consideration of a mixture of things - trusts, gifting, charitable gifts, life insurance, wills, etc.</p>
<p>Generally it's not worth going through all of that hassle unless someone's net worth is quite large: the 2017 the US estate tax had an exemption for the first $5.49M (no taxes paid below that amount, 40% tax above it), in 2018 it more than doubles to $11.2M</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can still be very useful for mixed families. There was a ridiculous case in Canada a few years back where a husband died first, his entire estate transferred to his wife, then when she died, the kids he brought into the marriage got nothing because her estate passed onto her biological heirs only. The judge even said &quot;this is totally wrong, but I have to do it because of the wording of the law.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of different, and how effective it is varies wildly depending on your local laws.</p>
<p>In most jurisdictions though, there's measures which disregard transfers within a certain period before death - can be anywhere between months and years - and there's usually always measures against deliberately depriving your estate of assets. Also, there may be additional rules where something isn't considered truly out of your estate if you still have use of it - so even if you sign your home over into a trust in your kids' names, if the trust also requires them to give you unlimited use of the home for the rest of your life, it may be deemed that you still have de facto control of the property and it's still part of your estate.</p>
<p>Estate law is a huge mess of crap built on by statute and precedent, and can be wildly different across different countries and different states, and is the kind of thing best handled by specialist lawyers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that it's a fraudulent conveyance and a judge can undo it. </p>
<p>The long answer is that a lot of people try to pull these off (more likely when bankruptcy is imminent, not death) and that resolving it often involves very complicated (and expensive) litigation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, you cannot have heirs before you die (just heirs apparent). There are plenty of claw-back laws to prevent you from just giving things away from your estate to sidestep creditors. Most are based on timing and the &quot;usual course of business&quot;. If you gave your kid a gift of couple hundred/thousand dollars out of the blue before you died, a creditor might get that money back. If you gave the same amount to your landlord/church/sport club, like you do every month/year, it would be harder to claw back.</p></div>		</li>
