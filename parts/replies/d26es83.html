<p>The horizontal velocity would be zero but the gravity would still act upon the bullet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring air resistance [EDIT: and the curvature of the earth, you pickypantses], it would fall with <em>exactly</em> the same vertical acceleration regardless of its horizontal speed. The only difference is how far it moves horizontally before its vertical acceleration brings it down to the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cool thing about bullet physics is it immediately starts dropping as soon as it leaves the barrel (assuming the barrel was held horizontally or at a downward angle) it's just hauling so much ass it gets to its target before it can hit the ground. (I'm assuming close ranges here.) At long ranges the shooter actually arcs the bullet, and on a bright day you can even watch the projectile arc in!</p>
<p>Then you start getting into optic height over bore, and working out your zero for pure accuracy or a combat zero in which you estimate bullet arc for close and long range shooting...it's not really hard to wrap your head around but it is fun. I'd imagine actually having to work with the variables true long distance pros contend with would be a head scratcher though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is also important to note that a bullet that is dropped and a bullet that is shot will both reach the ground at the same time. I.e. the horizontal velocity does not affect the perpendicular velocity caused by earth's gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the fired bullet will have the earth falling away from it as well. If the bullet is fired fast enough, the earth will fall faster than the bullet, and the bullet will never hit the ground. We call this orbitting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of mind-blowing, but it makes sense, I suppose. Air resistance wouldn't act upon the shot bullet to keep it suspended any longer? Or did you mean in the prescribed scenario only ...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we talk the speed of a bullet were looking at the muzzle velocity. The expanding gasses take time to accelerate the bullet. If the gun is moving forward at 1000m/s and shooting a bullet with a muzzle velocity of 1000m/s backwards it wont really be like the bullet is stationary relative to the ground until it's reached it's max speed from the expanding gasses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if instead of shooting the bullet backwards from the direction the car is traveling, it shoots forward instead? Would it's velocity then be v(gun on the car) + v(bullet) = 2v? As seen from the ground, so someone standing next to the car would see the bullet travel at twice the speed of the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring wind resistance, yes, the bullet would pretty much go twice as fast as a normal bullet. At really fast speeds (fractions of the speed of light), adding velocities is no longer close enough and you have to use <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/velocity.html" target="_blank">this formula.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be 2v for a very brief point in time. Small arms tend to be limited in muzzle velocity by drag. At some point you can only put so much more powder/barrel length to get more speed. As a result rather than fire a small bullet really fast they just make the bullet heavier and keep the speeds in the same general range.</p>
<p>The bullet would very quickly slow down from 2v, without more data such as bullet weight, drag coefficient and v you can't infer anything all that precise. Fun fact though, a USN pilot once shot himself down doing something very similar to this. He fired while in a dive then sped up while diving and overtook his bullets.
