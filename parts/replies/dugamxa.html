			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the original burger patties cost $200,000 to produce. Only two years later those same patties cost $12 to produce. And this is still in limited batches that do not take advantage of the usual economy of scale efficiencies. Ex: Instead of growing a single pound of beef for say $10, a super sized vat could possibly grow a hundred pounds of beef for only $100. So, a hundred times more meat for only ten times the cost. (Note, these values are not based on anything, just pointing out the concept).</p>
<p>Not &quot;cheap&quot; compared with the prices of normal ground beef, but now actually in the range of affordable. Costs have been decreasing further, but the main efforts are currently directed to trying to have the vats also produce fat deposits instead of just muscle. The reason being is that the fats contribute quite massively to the overall flavor of the produced meat, and while we can salt/season the meat using external seasonings, that would increase the logistical complexity of providing the meat.</p>
<p>Basically, vat grown meat is fairly cheap today, but not perfect. Once they nail down the fat growth stuff, I imagine you'll see things picking up.</p></div>		</li>

I wish we could enjoy the same foods we did, and while I know this is incredibly selfish of me, wishing this for me is also wishing it for the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone that has slight hopes of being a Mars colonist in the future, I had long ago resigned myself to the idea that I'd basically become a vegan due to the logistical impossibility of providing meat. These developments give me hope that I can enjoy a burger on Mars one day, so I've been doing my best to pay attention to them when I have time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for the $12 quote? Seriously interested, but my (admittedly quick) searches haven't pulled up a reputable source, just blog posts quoting reporters quoting more blog posts.</p>
<p>If it can be so cheap, I wonder if there's a way to buy hunks of (even the &quot;imperfect&quot;) lab meat to mess around with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have they gotten past the fact that the whole process is still reliant on byproducts from the meat industry?</p>
<p>From what I recall, the growth medium they were using was basically just rendered down animal protein from cows blood, bovine serum albumin or something similar.</p>
<p>As far as I'm aware, they still can't synthesize everything required in the process, so it still uses slaughtered cows, you just don't eat them directly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, the vat-grown meat basically involves taking a sample from a cow (effectively a single 2mm by 4mm plug of muscle tissue), cleaning it up a bit to ensure there are only meat cells and nothing else, then placing that in the bio-reactor for a few weeks.</p>
<p>The bio-reactor is basically a stainless steel pot filled with standard nutrient gels and maintained at the ideal temperature for cellular growth.</p>
<p>In theory you can acquire basically a limitless supply of meat from a single muscle-extraction. In actuality, you will likely start new cell lines every now and then just to avoid possible problems. But even with this, there'd be no reason to ever HAVE to kill the cow other than pure impatience. It wouldn't even really save you that much time in the long run. You'd be able to skip like 2 weeks worth of an exponential growth rate, one that will REALLY quickly reach the limits of your available growth vats anyway. So really it is saving you a few weeks of a one-time startup cost.</p>
<p>Yes, this likely means that some companies will inevitably do it, but plenty might not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they need to figure out the fat part too don't they?  I wonder if they could in effect do different 'cuts' of meat by tinkering with fat ratios and distribution, as well as muscle fiber layout.  Or is the intention mostly, grind this stiff up? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grinding it up really helps cover for any lack of marbling and texture problems</p>
<p>If you're not grinding it up, and not electroshocking it to work it, then you'll end up with something like veal where the muscle is soft from never being used.  You'd need to work the meat as its grown to create the texture we expect from steak so i expect to see lab ground beef long before we see lab steaks</p></div>		</li>
