			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the reply.  I am aware of the standard decent with modification arguments for origin of our species, and evidence of our species mating with similar species, I am looking for any published literature, or research now underway, on the OP question.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the evidence found mostly points to human female —  Neanderthal male integration with our species. For some reason, male Neanderthals did not really pass on anything to us through their Y chromosome; we can wonder about the mechanism for why not.
I cannot recall the sources. It should be easy to find with a search engine.</p>
<p>Edit: What I failed to mention is strange is that we do not have the mitochondrial DNA which is passed by the female genome. </p>
<p>This combination suggests that Neanderthal males mated with human females, but these human females probably did not produce fertile male hybrids — basically it was probably female hybrids with some Neanderthal genetics.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're misinterpreting the fact that there are no surviving neanderthal Y chromosomes.  At least, other people have made a similar conjecture on that basis.  </p>
<p>It means that there is no unbroken lineage of males without an intervening female descending from a neanderthal father. But, <em>there is also no neanderthal mitochondrial DNA,</em> so there is no continuous female line descending from neanderthals either.</p>
<p>I asked about that here on this subreddit a couple years ago, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/47izbp/do_any_modern_humans_carry_mitochondrial_dna_or_y/" target="_blank">the replies were very informative</a>.  The replies to my question cited statistical models that suggest that losing the neanderthal mitochonrion and hte neaderthal Y chromosome was the most likely statistical outcome, even if the mating ratio was equal and yielded fertile offspring of both genders.</p></div>		</li>
