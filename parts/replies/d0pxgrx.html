			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we will, if we keep up destroying the environment at the rate we are doing now. Climate change is destroying the zones in which we can effectively produce food, while people keep breeding at a swift rate, leading to increased hunger. Farming areas are becoming increasingly monoculturous, which makes them susceptible to plagues. Antibiotics are being prescribed for viruses and being force fed to cattle, in doses too low, ramping up the rate of growing resistance in bacteria in an exponentially increasing rate.</p></div>		</li>
