<p>the interesting thing is that ambidextrous people tend to have a bigger chunk of nerves joining the two halves of their brains</p>

<p>If a person learns to be ambidexterous, will these develop?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>at least from what I've heard casually, people think some of naturally ambi and lefty people are that way due to minor developmental issues in utero and the nerve growth is to facilitate the switchover. I buy it anecdotally at least because I tend to use my left hand for fine motor skill actions and my right hand for gross motor skills. So it feels a lot more comfortable for me to throw a ball or write using my left hand, but I prefer my right hand for gross motor skills like bowling or swinging a bat</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even when my non dominant foot was just as good as kicking it still took my several years before I could use it without making a conscious decision to</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It took me 6 years, as a child, to learn how to use both hands. On the plus side, I can write in cursive, type, operate machinery, use tools, etc with both hands, now. I started this fun little project in kindergarten. When practicing cursive, I swapped hands for every line.</p>
<p>Finite control didn't occur til my mid 20s tho. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First to be pedantic, if it's in the brain it's not a nerve. Nerves are only in the PNS. I know that wasn't your comment so don't worry about it</p>
<p>The corpus callosum joins the hemispheres. It's entirely made up of axons, so it's just a huge bundle of ~200 million commisural fibers crossing the gap between the hemispheres. For this to become larger you'd have to add more axons to it. We almost never extend new axons in the CNS as adults for multiple reasons. What we DO form from experience are new dendrites and therefore synapses on the neurons that those axons go on to synapse on. New and strengthened CONNECTIONS. But these won't make the axons bigger or add new ones so the corpus callosum wouldn't get larger from experience, no. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking of this for a moment brought the following possibility to mind: What if they're actually right-clawed and simply using their dominant/strong claw to remain perched while using their off-claw to manipulate things? If I'm trying to hold my place on something, I'd use my stronger hand. What claw do they tend to use while grabbing something in flight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your dominant appendage is the one with better developed fine motor skills, not necessarily more strength.</p>
<p>Just like a human kicking a ball, they'll post on their off-leg and use the dominant leg for the task because it has better control.</p>
<p>While you <em>might think</em> you'd hold on with your dominant hand while your off-hand does the work, that's just not the way it works out. From rock climbing, to framing roofs, your off-hand is hanging on while your dominant hand clips in a rope or swings a hammer. For those finicky tasks with little room for error, using your off-hand is frustrating as hell.</p>
<p>As for what claw they tend to use in flight, it's both. <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnJGmTUjyA2qTpDOIfH0x5TUOnfMT5rbhX8JogaMaFBEcXDTrI" target="_blank">Birds tend to extend both claws towards their target and grab.</a> </p></div>		</li>

<p>Also no one who was ever born blind has also been schizophrenic.</p>
<p>I think there's a lot of weird relations between the brain and behavior and personality that we don't know about. But also, what a can of worms that could open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your question, but it is important for everyone here to understand that the whole left and right-brain notion is a myth. By that I mean people aren't  &quot;right-brained&quot; because they are critical analyzers or &quot;left-brained&quot; because they are creative and intuitive (or whatever). This notion has no scientific support. It is a long-standing myth in the psych community alongside the &quot;you only use 10% of your brain&quot; bull. With instances like this, it is important to note that there are just as many - if not more - differences within groups than between groups. The brain isn't divided into a creative side or critical thought side.</p>
<p>That being said, in regards to handedness, I have read studies that look into how left-handedness is correlated with unique brain anatomy and function. However,  circle back to the understanding that, again, there is just as much variation within the group (left-handedness) as between (left vs. right).</p>
<p>Regardless, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5465301/" target="_blank">here</a> is an interesting paper on how left-handedness may be correlated with greater mathematical achievement; however, the relationship is incredibly complicated and varies with gender, age, and task.</p>
<p>Thanks for letting me rant a bit and for opening up a very interesting discussion!</p></div>		</li>
