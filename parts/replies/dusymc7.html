			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding (which comes from a single anatomy class, so take with several grains of salt) is that breast milk is produced by holocrine glands, which (explained simply) fill with milk and then rupture to release it, dying in the process. Because this cell death takes place on a such large scale over a period of time, it reduces the chances that cells will become cancerous by killing off some of them before they can do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can, but not always.</p>
<p>I was friends with a group of women who all were due the same time (birth group). My period came back after a couple of months and I nursed for over two years. One lady was totally period free during the same time period while another got pregnant right off the bat and technically never had a period because of it, but definitely ovulated right away obviously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does -- but honestly, with today's lifestyles, it's iffy. Things that make it work best are cosleeping, NO pacifiers, NO bottles, mom at a healthy weight, etc. If you have a baby that sleeps long periods at night (which is well worth it!) you'd likely find your cycle returns sooner. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It is fucking hilarious at the doctor's office, though. &quot;Date of your last period?&quot; &quot;February of 2016.&quot; Fantastic double-take. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the link between younger breast development and higher breast cancer risk it would seem likely that a period of decreased estrogen would also affect that risk. </p>
<p>I also agree with the statement that breast tissue undergoes maturation during pregnancy and milk production that don't occur otherwise.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I breastfed for 13-months. But got my period 2-months post partum. So are you saying because I didn't have a year of decreased estrogen that my likelihood of breast cancer is slightly higher than someone who did go an entire year with no period? </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not an expert in this area, but the research I've looked at would seem to suggest a few things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Cancer risk is a multifactorial equation and estimating an individual person's lifetime risk is impossible.</li>
<li>Women who have fewer menstrual periods seem to have lower risk. That includes later menarche, earlier menopause, more pregnancies, etc.</li>
<li>Breastfeeding has its own impact on lowering risk which may be at least partially independent of the estrogen issue.</li>
