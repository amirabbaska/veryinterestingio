			<div class="markdown"><p>Slab track would be incompatible with the extremely heavy freight trains common in North America no?</p>
<p>But I suppose bridges use ballastless track. So possibly would just be really really really expensive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe that's true... I'm not sure what a coach car weighs off the top of my head but I know most of our loaded freight cars weigh 130 tons. I can guarantee that is more than a 30-50% difference from a coach car.</p>
<p>Locomotives are probably closer in weight, if not identical. I've seen Amtrak use the exact same diesels we use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slab track would work fine with heavy trains. The issues is that slab track is more expensive and, importantly, time consuming to build. In the US the vast mileages of track, a lot of it single track, mean that using slab track would be impractical as it would cost too much and the lines would be closed for ages while they're building it.</p></div>		</li>
