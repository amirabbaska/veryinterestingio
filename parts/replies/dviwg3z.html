			<div class="markdown"><p>Physics  'knowledge of nature',  is the natural science that studies matter and its motion and behavior through space and time and that studies the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is to understand how the universe behaves. Acording to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" target="_blank">wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Since physics is a study of the behavior of the universe, it can be wrong and when it is (e.g. our model of the universe described in physics no longer matches our observations). i think it is fair to say physics stops working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's a matter of definition.</p>
<p>There's physics, the human field of study.</p>
<p>Then there's physics, the actual rules of the universe.</p>
<p>The word is used in both ways, but OP seems to understand it by the second definition, hence their confusion. The human science can be wrong, but the universe itself can't be. I was responding to OP's question, so I assumed the second definition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>no. physics != the actual rules of the universe. I understand that it may be used in that way but its not the definition. Its not like mathematics. Since its origin it was human science. every official definition you'll find states the same.</p></div>		</li>
