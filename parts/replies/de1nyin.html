			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a follow up question in the same vein. I was talking to this dude I work with who's a musician that had taken classes on sound engineering, and he said that with low frequencies you chest, or more accurately your ribcage was better at picking them up than your eardrums. Is there any truth to this? The logic tracked when I heard it, with the eardrums being very tiny bones that pick up more precise, high frequencies, and your ribs/sternum being able to detect lower frequencies due to their combined shape (i.e. entire ribcage) and them being larger bones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you asking as to whether or not the rib bones themselves will vibrate more easily to lower-pitched sounds than the bones in your middle and inner ear?  </p>
<p>Funny enough, I was a double major (music, I.T.) in college!  Unfortunately, I've never heard anyone discuss the conundrum of rib bones being affected by sound pressure waves because frankly, who cares?  </p>
<p>I also think you and your friend are confusing pitch (the length of the pressure wave - measured in frequency) with volume (the size, intensity, and energy of the wave - measured in amplitude).  Simply put, in order for the pressure wave to penetrate your flesh to vibrate your rib bones, you'll need an excess of volume/energy, which your ear drum will most certainly detect long before your rib bones would, &quot;detect&quot; the sound wave.  </p>
<p>I'm gonna call B.S. on your friend here.  Claiming that your rib bones can &quot;detect&quot; lower frequencies is just.... dumb.  Your coworker sounds like a stoner.  Why on earth would he say that?  Because &quot;sound engineers&quot; use their uber-sensitive chest feelers to detect when it's time to drop da bass?  Give me a break...</p></div>		</li>

<p>You know what, it never occurred to me but that's probably very likely.</p></div>		</li>
