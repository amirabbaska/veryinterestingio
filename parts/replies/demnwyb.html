			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition there are regulations such as not being allowed to have unused branches on a water line, to prevent still standing water over long periods.</p>
<p>That said, once they had to disconnect the water on my flat to fix something in a water meter. When the water got switched on again, a <em>lot</em> of very brown water came out. That must have been hiding somewhere...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great point. In Germany there is no chlorine added to the water, just great treatment and sealed transport. In the US the chlorine smell really differs by region.
The worst I experienced was in Spain. Not only is the tab water full of chlorine, so most people carry huge water tanks to their homes for drinking and cooking. But the Spanish costumers associate the smell of chlorine with cleanliness. So most cleaning products produce this chlorine smells. I had to wash again all the clothes washed in spain back in Germany to get rid of the smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting, thanks for adding another perspective.  Nobody has addressed well water yet though, hopefully my copper pipes are enough (along with no light), because I left a clear hose attached to a spigot on the main, and it filled with mold.  Freaked me out.</p>
<p>Only mentioning this because your<em> English is fantastic otherwise.  It's </em>prevent<em> and </em>prevented*.  Always a V, never an F.  Does the F match your accent when saying the words?  If so, it's a charming error.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>F and V have a basically identical in sound in dutch, the only difference is the some general rules regarding location, like words generally start with a V and not an F and words never end with a v.</p>
<p>And of course there's tons of exceptions these days to fuck everything over.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That depends on the dialect/accent. Especially in the west of the country, f and v sound almost the same. In other parts, there is a clear distinction between f and v. This holds true for other sounds as well such as s/z and g/ch.</p></div>		</li>
