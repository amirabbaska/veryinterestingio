			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a perfect explanation, well done! I will add that this also extends to games that are generally pretty good, but that port terribly. I'm talking of course about Shadow of Mordor - it was clear almost immediately that it was never meant to be played on a PS3 or Xbox 360 - I pre-ordered it (idiot I know), and from the very first cut scene I knew I would be taking it back to the store for a refund. The graphics were just...I mean, I would have been offended if the game was for my playstation 2. </p>
<p>Not pre-ordering would have let me see what the reviewers saw in the 360 and PS3 versions, and I would have known to avoid it entirely until I upgrade to the new systems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great example.  Pre-orders rob you of the opportunity to make a truly informed buying decision.  I mean, why else would they attach incentives to pre-orders?  Because pre-orders benefit developers more than they benefit consumers, and without those incentives the average consumer is savvy enough to realize paying for a promise is foolish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about if you are buying a game without needing to make an informed decision.  For example, I buy the new NBA 2k and new FIFA each year....I don't care how shit the reviews are, I know I'm going to buy it.  What is wrong with preordering it then?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Loading screens, EVERYWHERE.  To pause the game, there is a loading screen.  To <em>unpause</em> the game, there is a loading screen.  Every mission start, there are at least two, sometimes three, loading screens.</p>
<p>It's glitchy as hell, too.  I could not complete a mission I'd worked very hard to set up because the Uruk I was supposed to assassinate got <em>thrown through the ground in the opening cinematic</em> and could not be reached.  I could see his health meter, but there was no way to reach him...  I restarted, twice, and the same thing happened.  I had to kill the Uruk that I had branded and gotten promoted all the way up to this point just so I could progress the game.</p>
<p>Half the time, the uruks' dialogue sound files will not load, so the subtitles will pop up and the audio is just all &quot;AAAAARRRRRRUUUGHGHGHGH&quot; background yelling.  It makes for pretty hilarious conversations between Uruk captains when one of them keeps replying to insane, wordless yelling as though it's actual conversation.</p>
<p>The game doesn't know how to register branded Uruks.  I was supposed to follow one of my uruk captains around and help him recruit other uruks.  FINE!  I'm great at that.  I'll brand <em>all</em> the other uruks in the area.  When I did this, the chieftain I was trying to help just wandered around, into walls, along walls, trapped himself in a corner and marched in place for like ten minutes.  I put down the controller, went and made some soup, grabbed a beer, checked on him again, and he was still ambling aimlessly along the wall, very far away.  The game threatened me that I was &quot;Leaving the mission area.&quot;  I ran up to him and shanked him to death and was told I'd failed the mission.</p>
<p>I chased a fleeing Uruk captain to the end of a dock in the fishery, caught him, fought him, branded him, and... he disappeared.  When I checked the army list, he had been promoted and was not branded at all.</p>
<p>There is this one plant near the secret human lair (whatever it's called) that just won't load properly?  It's just this enormous sheet of grey texture that's clearly blowing in the wind...</p>
<p>ALSO, FIRE DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THAT.  The fire is this deep, ruby red that sends out a perfectly steady, dark red glow.  It's absurd and hilarious, considering that fire is <em>the only colorful thing in the game</em> for the entire first section.  I don't know who signed off on this.  Saw that every fire behaved identically to an enormous red party bulb and thought &quot;Yeah, pretty good!&quot;</p>
<p>I will <em>not</em> take mine back for a refund, because it's the funniest damn game I've played in a very long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't remember having that many loading screens, despite running it from a hard drive in another computer over the network. I remember it as pretty bug free with one exception. If it failed to launch properly, your save-file was deleted. It was also pretty repetitive, but that didn't matter because it's so much fun.  </p>
<p>I recommend everyone to play it (an back up your save file every time you exit it!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's not entirely the developer's fault. Often times it's the publishers who set ridiculous release time tables on them which leaves them unable to test and the game properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a give and take process.  There are definitely cases where too much is expected from the developers from the publishers, but a lot of this comes from the developers providing the publishers with inaccurate information.  Its a two-way street.  Publishers don't want their brand tarnished with crappy releases any more than developers do.  Sometimes the developers hide a massive delay in production for fear of being dropped from the project or having their funding cut.  This is partially the publisher's fault for creating a history of this sort of thing happening, but its also the fault of bad development studios that wound up costing publishers a lot of money and delivering nothing worth publishing.  There's risk management on all sides.  </p>
<p>Regardless of this, its not fair to trick the consumer into shouldering the burden of risk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. But I also believe that it's the publishers job to to judge the quality of the game and judge whether it's ready for release or not. Just look at Nintendo. They maintain a strict code with regards to quality and have no qualms about pushing back a release if they feel the game has not yet met up to their standards or feel that a game could benefit from more development time to ensure that it reaches its intended potential. At the end of the day the publisher does have a say in terms release and quality, but too often they are more worried about the optimal release window to maximize profits than the actual quality of their games.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a fair assessment of the problem but not entirely accurate. I'm in the industry. I actually own my own game studio and I can tell you that a lot of the problems here come directly from publishers. Holding devs and publishers (suits) equally responsible for this problem is naive. </p>
<p>In fact, most if not all game devs don't want to release buggy games. We want to release great and amazing games that everyone wants to play. We didn't get into this industry to make money. If we wanted to make money, we'd work in software development and not game development. </p>
<p>What causes these problems are suits and marketting guys who won't invest in a title unless they KNOW it will make money. Publishers have mountains and MOUNTAINS of data that tell them what you'll buy and why and they look at a helluva lot more than pre-order numbers. Those matter, sure. But there's a lot more to it than that. They look at final sales because those are profit to the publisher (Note that, btw, the publisher gets the cash, the studio gets it later). Why do you think Blizzard is making Overwatch? Hearthstone? See all those mobile game commercials during football games? </p>
<p>So, when you think of this problem and the devs' place in it, try to remember that, many times, the devs are prisoners to the problem. Do you think we like working our employees to death?</p>
<p>If you want developers to get more time to make games (This will solve the entire problem, btw. It's not greed driven, it's time driven), then don't buy the buggy games! Don't just stop pre-ordering them, DON'T BUY THEM! Stopping pre-ordering just impacts a single aspect, it solves a single symptom of the problem. It's like taking an advil for a headache from brain cancer. </p>
<p>Finally, don't hate on early access. Making games for indie developers is hard and expensive. Indie developers working in a garage make for a wonderful story but a pretty shitty life. Your money for early access goes straight towards feeding devs and making sure the game gets made at all. Is it perfect? No. But don't stop doing it. We need that help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say not to buy the buggy games, but what about AC Unity?  No one got to know that it was buggy until a ton of people already purchased it. And keep in mind this in a gaming climate where you pretty much need to get online based games as close to the day of release as possible if you want to keep up with the rest of the player base.  We've been taught this by MMOs who have barren starting areas just a few months after release.  We've been taught this by online multi-player shooters with leveling systems that reward higher level players with better guns.  We've been trained that the sooner you buy the game, the more likely you're going to have a positive experience.  And that's entirely on the developers who design the games in that manner.</p>
<p>You say that the developers are prisoner's to the problem.  But the developers are the ones that agreed to work with the publisher that put them in that prison.  I know of a FEW instances where a developer had to work with a publisher they didn't want out of a long standing contractual agreement, but usually, developers have a choice to decline the publisher's offer.  But you aren't going to, because their dangling that sweet sweet cash that you need to feed your families.  Claiming developers aren't responsible because the publishers that they chose to do business with in the first place knowing in advance that the publisher has a reputation for being pushy is just a cop-out.</p>
<p>The consumer should not be punished for anyone's bad decisions.  You can't lay all the blame on the publisher, when it is a mutually agreed upon partnership.  That's not how it works, you have to share in the responsibility of your failure.</p>
<p>And I don't <em>hate</em> early access, I <em>hate</em> the multitudes of indie developers that have turned what could have been an amazing tool into scars and anguish for a lot of consumers.  So many customers who could have been vital to your development process have been burned by studios that don't care as much as they should.  And that's square on the shoulders of the indie developers who chose to mistreat their early access buyers, no publisher to stand behind.</p>
<p>These are all things that contribute to the growing concern in your main customer base, and instead of being defensive, you and all the other people involved in making games need to own up to your mistakes and try harder to do better. The current environment is not safe for consumers, and that's the last thing anyone interested in making any kind of profit wants.  Weary consumers usually don't continue buying into a market that's burned them.  The game industry is the luckiest industry in the world, because gamers are SO FRICKIN LOYAL that they can get burned and burned and burned and still come back in hopes that they don't get burned again.  The problem is that the industry is starting to hit its limit.  It has pushed many people to the point of no return.  The industry is running out of extra lives, and needs to harken back to the days of Atari, and E.T. and recognize that history can and will repeat.</p></div>		</li>
