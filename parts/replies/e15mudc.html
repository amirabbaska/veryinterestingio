			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! While this description, as stated, might suggest a deterministic universe (at least in the quantum mechanical modeling of it), it is manifestly not. </p>
<p>I describe the light-weight mathematics of it below, but the conclusion is that
even though the state of a system is described by a (complex-valued) vector, we cannot see the vector itself. What we <em>see</em> is inherently an outcome of a probabilistic process. So while the universe manipulates these vectors with huge (2^n size) objects, we only see puny probabilistic outcomes of this calculation when we see (or measure) the system. </p>
<p>Philosophically, this gives a fundamental uncertainty or probabilistic nature for everything that we see/observe. In that sense, quantum mechanics is inherently a non-deterministic description of the world. </p>
<h2>Some Math</h2>
<p>To describe why I have to describe an important remaining piece of quantum mechanics. </p>
<p>We said that the state of a system is described by a complex valued vector v. This vector gives a scalar complex value to every <em>classical</em> outcome. So if this vector is d dimensional, then there are d possible classical outcomes.  </p>
<p>We cannot quite see v, however.</p>
<p>What happens when <em>see</em> the system (formally, <em>measurement</em> in the so- called <em>computational basis</em>) is the following probabilistic process: we observe classical outcome i with probability |v_i|^2. </p>
<p>Thus, for e.g., we observe the first outcome with probability |v_1|^2 and so on (the sum of absolute value squares of the vector have to add up to 1). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I understand you correctly, what you're saying is that for all practical intents and purposes the universe is not deterministic, but if we we're able to 'see' the universe in its complex vector, the story might be different?</p>
<p>Anyway, I would say that the former post of yours were decidedly not saying anything about if the world is deterministic. The second property means you can find v from w and U, not that w is the only possible result from Uv - which if I understand your basic description should be the case if the world were deterministic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Excuse me if this has been answered below, but is this essentially saying that &quot;We can determine that rolling a ball at 5mph, the ball will travel 5mph (but not exactly 5mph) as to be more specific, hundreth or thousandth decimals different&quot;?</p>
<p>Edit: my botched question <em>was</em> answered below in a more well stated fashion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a different way of looking at it, at least philosophically, is that the mechanisms that appear to create the state of the universe are causal and deterministic.  However, interacting with these phenomena and observing change in the state of matter which could be called consciousness is non deterministic because the way in which the state is observed is unpredictable.  Therefor while the outcome of the next state of the matrices is deterministic it can not be predicted.  In conclusion, its both. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A person talking about black holes said the singularity makes the world line of particles end. So maybe that's an exception?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All you say is right, but aren't you forgetting the effect of wave function collaps? It think this changes everything. Once a QM state is observed, the wave function collapses. You cannot reverse wave function collaps with a unitary matrix, I think. Therefore, QM states are only time-reversible as long as there are no observers.</p>
<p>In the Many-World-Interpretation, it is the same. Here, worlds are branching continously whenever QM states are observed. But once the wave function has collapsed into a certain state in your world, you cannot restore the original wave function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're going Many Worlds, isn't any given collapse a bit of a formality? If all outcomes are happening/not happening to the same extent on different world lines, then isn't the wave function preserved, except locally on any given world line?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose globally you are right, whatever your interpretation of QM. Even in the classic Copenhagen interpretation, if you take the universe as a whole, there is no outside observer, so the whole universe remains in a perfect QM state.</p>
<p>Seems like a contradiction, but I think QM collapse is an illusion for observers inside the universe. From our human point of view, QM states seem to collapse because our QM states get entangled with them.</p>
<p>Like when you produce two photons whose spins are entangled. Each photon 'knows' with certainty that the other one has opposite spin. If one of photons was an observer, it would regard the spin state of the other photon as collapsed. From the outside however, the QM state of both photons together remains pure until we measure the spin in one of the photons (thus entangling ourselves with the QM state of the system).</p></div>		</li>
