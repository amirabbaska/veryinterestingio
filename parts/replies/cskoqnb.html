			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that the average vagina is NOT 10 inches deep. Honestly a 10&quot; penis might be great for bragging, but fairly terrifying for actual sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, 10 inches with normal circumference isn't any more scary than normal penis with normal circumference. You're only getting about 6 inches in, on a good day, regardless of how much you have. Its like, if you only need to climb 3 steps, it doesn't matter if you have a step stool or a 10 foot ladder. </p>
<p>What's terrifying is the circumference. If your dick rivals a coke can, my vagina is not aroused by your awesome manliness; it's hiding in terror. This is why dildo and vibrator manufacturers need to stop exclusively advertising the length and start advertising the diameter or circumference. Some do, but some are just like &quot;8 inch dildo of awesome veiny-ness&quot;.  Which leaves you trying to judge the diameter based on the overall proportion. </p>
<p>That's risky. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is where most of the problems in /r/bigdickproblems comes from.</p>
<p>Having an 8.5&quot; dick is not great. It has never once gotten me any more sex than a normal penis would. In fact, in often gets me less sex because I've had girls look at it and go &quot;yeah that's not gonna fit sorry&quot;. Or even worse, when they're willing to give it a shot but it just straight up doesn't fit so it comes to us just mutually agreeing that sex just can't physically happen right now.</p>
<p>I hate my dick.</p>
<p>EDIT: For everyone saying I don't have to put it all in, I'm also very girthy so that's the fitting problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to pretty much be. I'm only a fiver but flaccid I was almost the same length. I'm not sure if it's age or weight gain but over the last few years I've shrunk to something like one inch when soft. </p>
<p>I still get around five when hard but my dick now just about disappears when it's soft.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now I haven't been with many guys in my life but out of those I have seen in both states (which is all of them), none were showers, all were growers. But that could just be that they were all white lol, don't know if the proportion of growers to showers changes with ethnicity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ability to have a small flaccid penis allows the male to move about and do things more easily. This is why people with small flaccid penis' are able to hold jobs, be creative, and many other things that give them advantages in life. People with large flaccid penis' have a hard time working, being creative or doing a lot of other things because of how distracting it can be. I'm not saying that people who have large flaccid penis' sit around all day collecting welfare and struggle with any sort of education.</p></div>		</li>
