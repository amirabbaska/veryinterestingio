			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed on this one.  I did a test in my own house.  </p>
<p>Leaving the AC on, takes about 30KW per dar.</p>
<p>Using the AC only when I'm at home, (about 6:00pm to 8:00am) takes from 18KW to 25KW.  </p>
<p>You may want to improve the efficiency of your AC installing attic fans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought AC runs on duty cycles. If you have really good insulation in your home, there's less warmup and it might use less energy just to keep it at a lower temperature than blast it down later.</p>
<p>Lets say your AC runs a 10% duty cycle to maintain 74F. And it uses a 100% duty cycle for 30 minutes to cool it down from hot. That means that if you're gone for longer than 5 hours it's more energy efficient to turn your AC off.</p>
<p>But if you're house only needs a 5% duty cycle to maintain 74F, and it uses a 100% duty cycle for 1 hour to cool from hot, That means you'd need to be gone for 20 hours to make it more energy efficient to turn your AC off.</p>
<p>The % duty cycle drops with better insulation, less sources of heat, etc. I think you just have to test out your AC system to determine what works for you and the house you live in.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Additionally, if you're paying a lot for A/C it may be a good idea to look into reducing your electrical bill by replacing it with a solar bill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is ludicrous. </p>
<p>People who have to worry about paying their electric bill don't have the money to replace it with a solar bill and then wait the 10 or so years for the investment to pay for itself.</p>
<p>And someone living in an apartment (like the OP) doesn't have the option.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Many if not most solar companies will either finance the installation so that your monthly payment is equal or less than your former electricity bill, or retain ownership of the panels but lease them to you for less than your former electric bill.</p>
<p>Also, if you live in a state with high SREC prices many companies will purchase your future SRECs in exchange for a discount on installation.  I looked into solar a while back and with the ridiculously high SREC prices in my city, a 12KW system would have only cost me $1,500 to own outright, because of the $10,000 federal tax credit and the company would buy my future SREC production for an additional $25,000.  </p></div>		</li>
