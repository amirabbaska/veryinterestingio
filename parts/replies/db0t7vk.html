			<div class="markdown"><p>Your analogy with a falling object's mass and height is good - your small aside to kinetic and potential energy is wrong, though. Voltage is potential, which it not the same as potential energy. Current does NOT correspond to kinetic energy.</p>
<p>It really IS like your initial analogy. The electric shock is like having an item dropped on your head from a tall house. Voltage is the potential, equivalent to the gravitational potential, which you change by moving up and down the stairs. The gravitational potential is the same, regardless of the mass you are carrying. The amount of energy you are expending DOES however depend on the mass you are carrying. The potential is g<em>h, the mass is m and the energy is mgh.
In the same way we have an electric potential U, and the energy (per time), which is the stuff that kills you, is U</em>I, where I is the current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea I raise the difference between electric potential and potential energy in technical terms but they can be visualized very similarly where potential energy is pretty well discussed in secondary education where electric potential isn't discussed unless you take more technical courses at a higher level. More people can realize potential energy and they're fairly similar &quot;visually&quot; enough at least for the eli5 at hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another analogy is a lake; a 20000 million ton lake (high voltage) has the potential to do real damage, but only if it is moving.  A trickle from a creek (low amperage) might actually feel kinda nice, but a dam breaking can wash out an entire city.</p>
<p>Lighting killing you would be the dam breaking and you being right in the middle when it does.  Lightning not killing you means you might have been standing beside the dam, but far enough away that you only got splashed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so first off let me start by saying... I'm not going for total accuracy here. Analogies are meant to draw a picture in your head, not be used for hard calculations, or a whole lot of extrapolation. That said, I'm not sure how to &quot;eli5&quot; this exactly so I'm just going to do my best to explain it at all without getting technical. Basically when electricity has multiple paths to choose from, those paths are referred to as being in a <em>parallel</em> configuration. Going back to the water analogy that's so beloved (and for good reason). If you've ever played with the jets in a pool, you know if you cover one up, the other ones put out more pressure. This is what's essentially going on with the electricity. If there's a hole (a path for the electricity), there's going to be electricity flowing through it, though most of the <em>quantity</em> of water (electricity) will flow through the biggest hole while the other holes are largely negligible. As far as travelling through your body, electrons (which make up electricity) like to take the path of least resistance, but they also like to stay away from each other. They like to spread out so to speak. On an electric scale, the best way electrons like to spread out is over the surface area (I can't think of a way to explain why this is simply at the moment). So a fraction of electrons are gonna be working there. But most importantly, a majority of the electrons are going to follow a path through your body. When you get struck by lightning, its going to go from wherever you get hit to the ground. When it hits, say your arm, it'll travel down your arm, down your side, and down your leg then down your foot without getting to deep into your body. There's no point in the electricity working deeper in your body and taking a longer route when it just needs to go from point A to point B. This is why when you work with electricity, you shouldn't use both hands. If you do, the electricity goes from, say your left hand, down your left arm, across your chest (and your heart) and then out your right arm/hand. This is also why tasers aren't too dangerous for most cases. Because the probes stick close together so the electricity only travels from probe a to probe b which ends up being only a few inches on the surface. </p>
<p>Sorry if that was scattered or confusing. I wasn't able to get on my computer and I wanted to get this explanation on there before I forgot and I have a hard time tracking my thoughts via phone. If you need any clarification I'll do my best. And keep in mind that's just a simple explanation that doesn't do what's a whole field of engineering justice.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there like a chart somewhere that plots a line of voltage vs amperage that will kill a human? I suppose you can't just multiply the two together and say &quot;anything <1000 is fine but >1000 and you're dead&quot;. So there's got to be some sort of exponential line chart or something? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really hard to do. The first problem is that amps don't exist on their own. Amps are created when voltage goes through a resistance. You need about 5 milliamps, or .005 amps, through the heart to be fatal, but you don't just have amps. You have to calculate them.</p>
<p>On average, human skin has a resistance of 100k ohms. So you divide the voltage by 100,000 to get the amps, and if it's more than .005 and goes through your chest, it can kill you. At 120 volts, a normal outlet can give you .0012 amps. Instead of killing you, it will just feel very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>This changes very quickly if your hand is wet, or you're holding onto a metal support with your other hand, or a number of other things. If you're hit by lightning, it's likely raining, reducing your skin resistance. </p>
<p>And then there's another problem. Does the electricity actually go through your heart? There are full-body chainmail suits used at shows where electricity arcs through the air to hit people, but since it all goes through the armor instead of the body, the people are unharmed. If most of the voltage travels through the skin instead of the torso, you could be left with severe burns but still alive.</p>
<p>It's already a lot of work calculating current values of complex series-parallel circuits where you know the available power and all the resistances. The body is mostly unknowns. Sometimes someone gets lucky and is just harmed, not killed, by lightning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voltage can not go through something. You can have a difference in potential, aka. voltage drop over something if that's what you mean.
Why would amps not be able to exist on its own? Current is simply charged particles moving. You can for example induce a current in a wire resulting in a difference in potential in the ends of the wire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because it's complicated.</p>
<p>There are approximately two ways of killing a human with electricity:</p>
<ol>
<li>confuse the heart so it stops working</li>
<li>cause gross physical trauma via electric heating.</li>
</ol>
<p>The second would be very difficult to do without causing the first.  It would be easier to predict -- just figure out how much power it takes to heat up water to &quot;fried tissue&quot; sorts of temperatures, multiply it by how much you want to destroy, and then figure out how to do that electrically.</p>
<p>This leaves number one, which is a very tricky question.  This is because the goal is to &quot;confuse&quot; the heart.  If you hit it with a big current spike (and then leave alone), it won't necessarily kill the person -- this is basically what a defibrillator does.  It will stop and completely reset the heart, at which point there's a reasonable chance that it will start itself back up.  Also, there's a good chunk of time during a heartbeat in which the heart is more resistant to being confused, so you're best off getting it right in the vulnerable time.  Oh, and last but not least, you get a much better response from a changing pulse than a constant flow.</p>
<p>Now, how do you deliver it?  Also a tricky question.  Skin has a pretty high resistance, but that resistance changes depending on both the frequency and voltage of the incoming pulse.  Also, where does it go?  Blood is a pretty good conductor, but there's a lot of other stuff in there too.  One of the reasons why potentially risky electrical work is done one-handed is that if you touch something you shouldn't, it will mostly only flow through that hand -- not very much will detour down the arm, through the heart, and back up.  Making things more complicated, high frequency currents tend to flow along the outside of conductors -- and this includes most of a spike.  In a wire this just means only the outer surface of the wire carries current; in a person, it will be very tricky to work out.</p>
<p>Defibrillator work around these by a. using conductive gel, b. having pads placed in a specific place, c. running a pre-shock test to determine resistance and self-calibrate ahead of time, and d. trying again with more power if the first time didn't work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 5 milliamps of current across the heart can kill an average human male. </p>
<p>To put that in perspective,  the average lighting strike is approximately 30,000 amps.<br />
That is 8 orders of magnitude more current needed to kill.  But, a lot of that current doesn't go into a person during the lighting strike,  it splits off into surrounding stuff with lower comparative resistance.  Of the current that does pass into a person a fair bit gets dissipated by the resistance in fatty tissues. After that,  often enough, the path the current takes through the body does not pass directly across the heart.  This leaves a very small fraction of the current left to do the killing.  I still wouldn't recommend getting hit though. </p></div>		</li>
