			<div class="markdown"><p>To understand why sugar or salt cam act as preservatives you need to understand the mechanism behind it.  People have mentioned you &quot;take away the water&quot; but that isn't really the mechanism.  That would be drying.  The mechanism is called osmosis. This is how chemical balance is maintained in cells.  The wall between the cells slow water to come through depending on the concentration of certain chemicals uh the cell.  If there is a lot of sugar outside the cell,  the wall will bring water from inside to the other side to get the concentration to match.  In order to kill the cell the concentration difference needs to be quite high,  so you can use sugar or salt buy you'll need lots of it.  That's why sugar cubes keeps indefinitely,  but sugary food can still go bad especially after opening. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You increase amount of sugar in a contained environment to the point where there isn't enough of other things the microbes need for metabolism. The amount of sugar you would use as a preservative is much larger than the amount you would use as sweetener. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super size me was kind of a bs movie. The dude came at it trying to prove that McDonalds was a reason people got fat. It is kind of toted around as legitimate. However the creator of Super Size Me was heavly bias. Some teacher did the same experiment but limited his portion sizes to disprove Super Size Me. I believe it was sucessful. </p></div>		</li>
