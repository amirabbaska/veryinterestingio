<p>spoiler: it's the same idea, lol. just more interesting example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Centrifugal force is not an actual force. It just is Newton's third law component of centripetal force.</p>
<p>Also has nothing to do with your question actually, just thought I'd drop a cool factoid</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, it was a trick question. The liquid gets pulled down by centrifugal force regardless of being in a container or not. </p>
<p>Add: not to say anything is actually physically pulling the liquid 'centrifugal force' but inertia keeping it where it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cool video. The exact same forces are in play. As long as the turn is coordinated such that the inertia is directed down perpendicular to the x-axis of the airplane as opposed to down perpendicular to the ground then the orientation of the airplane’s x-axis relative to the ground doesn’t matter.</p></div>		</li>
