<p>Resolution is not everything. Sensor size matters too. For each sensor pixel, the bigger it is, the better it can sense light. That means that there will likely be less noise than a smaller sized sensor, especially at night.</p>

<p>This is the most important one and should be higher. Yes cinema lenses and compatibility of equipment are important, but the most important thing is capturing as much light as possible. A small sensor will make darker scenes look like noisy shit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Raw requires a lot of processing power to shoot, especially in 4k.</p>

<p>RAW actually requires less processing power because you're just putting that raw data from the sensor straight onto the card. There's no compressing it to some video format. This is why the Canon 5D would over heat unless you had Magic Lantern to record RAW.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See that's what I thought too.  I could have sworn I heard somewhere(take it with agrain of sand) that the read/write speed of the storage medium was the important factor for RAW, because it basically is just a data dump. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The read/write speed <em>is</em> an important factor because it's a lot of data that has to get written to the card. But that's a different task from compressing the raw data to, say, h.264 (and not as demanding).</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does, my wife left me for a camera with a bigger sensor. </p></div>		</li>
