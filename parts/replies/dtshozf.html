			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation.</p>
<p>My understanding is that a supercritical fluid is not as dense as the liquid form, but much denser than the gas. This being the case, the supercritical water would rise in the column, then either cool back to liquid, or violently explode into steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to emphasize my chemistry knowledge is lacking in that area. More heat would result in a slightly lower density (also marked by dotted lines in the phase diagram on the page I <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/water_phase_diagram.html" target="_blank">linked</a>). It's possible the heat and pressure could cause the density to increase due to higher salt solubility. But that would require a source of salt and I don't know if it could offset the drop in density from the heat. Maybe there's a bunch of water-soluble material leeching out of that lava. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the context - as /u/dampwindows says, in nuclear physics, critical mass refers to the mass of material required to sustain a given rate of nuclear fission, while supercritical mass is the mass required for the rate of nuclear fission to increase (in the context of nuclear weapons, by the way, the term for a rapid, exponential increase in the number of fission events (in other terms, 'it's going to blow up') is <em>prompt</em> critical). Critical mass can be changed by varying any of a number of factors - amount of fuel, shape, temperature, density, presence of a neutron reflector or a tamper.</p>
<p>But in the thermodynamic context (which I assume you're more interested in), criticality is based around the <em>critical point</em>. A supercritical fluid is any matter heated and compressed beyond the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Phase-diag2.svg/330px-Phase-diag2.svg.png" target="_blank">critical point (defined by the critical temperature and critical pressure)</a>. The critical point defines where the phase boundaries quite literally <em>end</em> - there is no more distinction between gas and liquid. A supercritical fluid can effuse through solids, like a gas, and dissolve materials, like a liquid. There is no surface tension, as there is no longer a distinction between phases. These properties are actually very important in some industrial processes - supercritical carbon dioxide is used in decaffeination because of the extreme solubility it allows, for instance. In thermodynamics, there is no such thing as a 'critical fluid', there is only the normal phases and supercritical fluid.</p>
<p>In other fields, to my knowledge, it revolves around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_\(mathematics\)" target="_blank">mathematical concept of a 'critical point'</a> - a point on a differentiable function where the derivative is 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken, critical mass is a term from nuclear physics referring to the amount of mass of a radioactive isotope you need to have sitting in a pile before it starts the nuclear fission. Further, assuming my memory and knowledge are up to snuff, a supercritical fluid/solid/gas is a chemistry term referring to when temperatures and pressures enter regions where the substance can't be identified as having a single state of matter. I don't know details, but basically it starts having a mixture of the qualities of two states of matter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ocean is a giant thermal reservoir.  Just because the high-salinity water may be too dense to cause a convective heat current, it will certainly allow a conductive heat current with the low-salinity water directly above which will readily create a convective heat current.  This will quickly cool the supercritical water as well as the lava to the point that the lava cools to extrusive igneous rock.  The supercritical water layer hypothesis is not thermodynamically plausible.  </p></div>		</li>
