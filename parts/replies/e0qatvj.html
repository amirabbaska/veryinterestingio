			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are talking about the hospital systems then its not a universal system and each region has their own system. The capital region recently bought an American system which was basically created to make bills which we don't use and not so much for utility.</p>
<p>If you are talking about the GP's system (which is different from the hospital ones and thus cannot &quot;talk&quot; with it) then i believe its a universal and fairly well liked system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even before everything was digitized we'd had the central person registry for decades, so as long as a move from one doctor to another was planned the papers our parents filled out when we were born were manually faxed ahead (along with all updates). </p>
<p>Only exception is if you make an unplanned visit to the hospital without being in immediate danger, in which case they might do the verbal equivalent, asking about relevant history, allergies, etc. Since insurance isn't relevant they don't need the lengthy written forms. </p>
<p>Or rather, the only exception was if you made an unplanned visit to the hospital. As mentioned they do have it all digitized now, and even if a lot of personnel can't find anything but the most basic info in the system, they'd have no reason to think you had your own X-rays memorized. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to Denmark on a working holiday visa last year. From my point of view, it was an absolute smash. I got my health card a week after I showed up in the country. My doctor's name and address was written on it. I could make an appointment with my doctor online. I could communicate with my doctor via secure email. I went to the hospital to have a cracked tube on my hearing aid replaced and I was in and out in half an hour, with a packet of free batteries. It was incredible. I'm from Canada and you guys are lightyears ahead of us.</p></div>		</li>
