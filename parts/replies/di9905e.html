			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it's not really accurate to say that relativity is always​ accurate either. It breaks down at very small length scales. A theory that is always correct would be a &quot;theory of everything&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Newtonian mechanics was good enough to land men on the moon, but we need relativity for GPS satellites to be accurate.</p>

<p>This was fascinating, thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To give a practical example. The momentum of a 1 kg ball moving 10 m/s is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Newton: p = mv = 1*10 = 10 kg•m/s</li>
<li>Einstein: p = mv/sqrt(1 - (v/c)^2 ) = 1*10/sqrt(1 - (10/300000000)^2)  = 10.0000000000000005 kg•m/s   </li>
