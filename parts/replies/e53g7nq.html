			<div class="markdown"><p>We love collaborating! In fact, our group is currently collaborating with other groups across Stanford in the departments of <a href="http://changlab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">dermatology</a>, <a href="https://dna-discovery.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">oncology</a>, <a href="https://ashleylab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">cardiology</a>, <a href="https://minty2.stanford.edu/wp/" target="_blank">physics</a>, applied physics, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jamesyzou/" target="_blank">computer science</a>, statistics, as well as with <a href="http://idoia.ece.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">other</a> <a href="https://www.igb.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">groups</a> across the country.</p>
<p>It’s super exciting to work with scientists from other departments and other areas of expertise, but sometimes there can be a “language barrier,” since computer scientists aren’t always up-to-date with the latest clinical studies, or biology-minded folks haven’t taken a lot of engineering courses. But moments of being lost in translation are also great opportunities to practice good science communication!</p></div>		</li>
