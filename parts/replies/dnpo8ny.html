			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunoglobulins are made by a special kind of white blood cell called a lymphocyte (specifically a B lymphocyte). I hold a master's degree in medical microbiology and immunology, so I could talk about this for days. But that is the public school version. </p>
<p>Infants have what is called a naive immune system. Their immune system isn't fully functional until they are at least walking. Let's say you meet a mean bacteria for the first time, you have cells in your body that kill that bacteria, digest the organism and present the bacterial antigen to a B lymphocyte. This process takes a long time (maybe a day). The B lymphocyte makes a immunoglobulin to recognize that bacteria so that it can be tagged for disposal much faster. The B cell is also called a memory cell. So 10 years down the road when you meet that bacteria again, you have a circulating immunoglobulin that recognizes the antigen and stimulates the production of more immunoglobulins to recognize and dispose of the bacterial invader. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: came back to apologize. While your first paragraph had a lot of lingo, you did attempt to explain it in simple words in your second paragraph. I was bitter before my breakfast and took it on you. My apologies.</p></div>		</li>
