			<div class="markdown"><p>Why do smaller animals, like dogs, get away with often violently shaking their heads? Isn't that the same danger for them? </p>
<p>Ed: I'm thinking about when dogs shake themselves dry and so on - it's a very vigorous head shake, much harder than what we do. Size-wise, elephants do it too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious follow-up question: I have frequent headaches and occasional migraines, and find that hitting myself in the head with an open palm provides momentary relief. I normally hit the top of my head, but sometimes the forehead as well. Why would this be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just speculation but the light sudden pain can temporarily distract your brain from the constant pain that is your headache.
Even if it isn't really painful your brain is like &quot;woah what's that now&quot; and that temporarily overrides the other signals.  </p>
<p>Thats why when people e.g. fall on their knee they will often instinctively press on the area right above the injury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd considered this &quot;distraction hypothesis,&quot; and think it's the most likely explanation. It's never been curative to do this, just a second of reprieve at a time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with the nerve pathways these things travel.  This could be 100% made up, but I believe pain signals travel on smaller diameter nerves and have a slow conduction.  Pressure (pushing on your knee) travels on larger nerves thus moves faster..  so you feel that before the pain gets there and it kind of interferes with the pain signals, sort of like a TENS machine. </p>
<p>Someone smarter than myself will have to confirm this. </p></div>		</li>
