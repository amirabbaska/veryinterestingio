			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR - This mainly depends on the projectile's diameter, weight, and velocity. It can be optimized in different ways, but usually 1 full twist per 10 inches will stabilize any commonly used bullet well enough for practical purposes. </p>
<p>In rifle bullets, the term &quot;sectional density&quot; refers to a bullet's weight relative to its diameter... I.e. a bullet weighing 110 grains will have a high sectional density if it's for a .243 caliber (6mm) round, because it is heavy-for-caliber; but 110 grains is very light for a .308 caliber (7.62mm), therefore giving it a low sectional density. Low sectional density = a shorter, fatter projectile. Conversely, high SD = a longer, thinner projectile, (which is more aerodynamic, and results in a higher ballistic coefficient. The higher the BC, the better the bullet performs at long ranges, all else held equal.)</p>
<p>For reference, a .30 caliber rifle bullet (7.62 mm) will commonly weigh anywhere between 123 grains, (the bullet used in AK-47,) all the way past 200 grains, (usually reserved for long-range sniping cartridges like a .300 Winchester magnum, but also for short-range hunting purposes where the bullet has to stay intact when penetrating thick skin, muscles, and bones.) </p>
<p>The heavy bullets typically don't need as high of a spin rate to stabilize as the lighter bullets do, (but again, &quot;light&quot; for a .30 cal would be &quot;heavy&quot; for a .243 caliber.) </p>
<p>This can change, however, depending on the bullet's velocity. Sticking with the popular .30 caliber, a .308 Winchester has a bullet with a diameter of 7.62mm and a case length of 51mm. So increasing the weight of the bullet from 150 gr to 165 gr decreases the velocity, because the case's gun powder capacity remains the same. But if you put the 165 gr bullet in a .300 win mag, it will actually have a higher velocity than the 150 gr out of a .308. Point being, even though you typically need less spin for a heavier bullet, you might actually be better off with more spin on it if it's traveling at very high speeds. </p>
<p>This is more detail than you'll ever really need to know though. You'll usually see twist rates ranging from 1:8 to 1:14, (meaning one full revolution per 8 or 14 inches of barrel length, respectively,) but setting the rate around 1:10 will stabilize almost any bullet weight you'll ever want to shoot. There are many other factors that combine to be much more important to accuracy and terminal performance than having the &quot;perfect&quot; spin rate. Hope that wasn't excessively boring and hard to follow</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lemme see if I can actually ELI5 this and here's a tl;dr: <strong>The bullet shape and the friction on the surface of the bullet turn it into a &quot;air drill&quot; which prevents small fluctuations from shifting it's trajectory.</strong></p>
<p>Imagine how air moves around a ball. The force is the highest at the very front of the ball and tapers off as it reaches the sides, finally reaching zero just after the apex at the sides.</p>
<p>Now imagine a box. The force is equal on the face the air is blowing against.</p>
<p>Now the bullet shape. It has the benefit of the ball where all the force is at one end and tapers off, but you get more volume to work with because of the part shaped more like the box.</p>
<p>You've got that picture of the air pushing against the point of the bullet right? How the air kinda gets shoved down the sides from the point? Now take the bullet and give it the grooves that a drill bit has, the ones that spiral up the shaft of the drill bit.</p>
<p>In the case of the drill bit, the stuff you're drilling through gets pushed up through the bit instead of being stuck down into what you're drilling into. With the bullet, because there's nothing stopping the air from moving out of the way besides more air, just the friction of the surface of the bullet can function like the grooves in a drill bit. </p>
<p>So the spinning causes the friction and air pressure to be consistent around bullet, like how a drill bit removes the friction of moving the drilled &quot;stuff&quot; by pulling it up the bit. In the case of the bullet, the force exerted by the spin and the surface friction of the bullet &quot;drills away&quot; air that would divert it's path. It takes the kinetic energy of the spin and shoves air out of the way using less force than if it tried to just punch through, like how drilling is a lot easier than trying to bash a nail into something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the spinning &quot;anti-tumble&quot; effect is caused by gyroscopic effect, not an &quot;air drill&quot;, <em>that</em> would work even in vacuum - a spinning bullet would tray to stay in the proper direction and a non-spinning bullet would start to tumble in a random direction due to even the slightest asymmetry during the firing.</p>
<p>The point is that a bullet-shape gets less air resistance than a ball if it's angled properly, but way more air resistance than a ball if it's randomly tumbling around.  You want to minimize the air resistance so that the same round would go further, faster and reach the target with more power. If you can get the bullet to spin (e.g. by rifling), it works; but if not, then a ball shape would be more efficient.</p></div>		</li>
