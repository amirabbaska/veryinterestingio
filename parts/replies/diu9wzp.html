			<div class="markdown"><p>As a medical professional, it enrages me that no one sat down and explained this to you. Please never accept not knowing what's going on inside of you and please ask questions until you understand. You deserve to know and understand this information so that you may make knowledgeable decisions about your health care. Congratulations on losing all that weight, it will do you wonders. </p></div>		</li>
