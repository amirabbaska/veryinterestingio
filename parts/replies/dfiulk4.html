<p>Basically when the spinal cord gets damaged, it is usually not a clean cut, and therefore the re-attachment fails. They will be using a very expensive, very sharp scalpel to minimize the damage to the spinal cord.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the last thread, I used a banana as the analogy because that's what was used as part of the demonstration in the gif.</p>
<p>A banana that's been sliced cleanly in the middle can have both halves line up pretty neatly.</p>
<p>If you try and twist a banana into halves, it gets crushed and mushed in the middle. </p>
<p>Even if you can get both sides separated, if you try and line them back up, you can't really line anything up because it's a mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but on a cellular level, wouldn't the neurons have to properly align?</p>
<p>It's like splicing a cable with millions upon millions of little cables inside.</p>
<p>From our perspective &quot;yep, lines up!&quot; But on a microscopic level seems like it would be pure chaos. Signals for heartbeat could be going to the Toes for all we'd know.  </p>
<p>If the head has developed sending signals down path A, then how would a foreign body used to receiving signals down path XYZ know the difference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very silly. I don't care how sharp your scalpel is -- you'd need those axons to somehow reconnect, and all reconnect to the exact same axon on the other end.</p>
<p>For comparison, in certain parts of the rat spinal cord -- and this is for the sacral cord, so at the caudal [butt end] after all your limbs axons have left -- there are &gt;250K axons. This is a big number. Huge. And this guy is saying that if we cut with a sharp enough knife, more than 250k axons (since they're going in the neck, mind, and in a human!) are going to happily mate to one another, no problem?</p>
<p>Not a chance in hell.</p>
<p>There are, depending on how you classify them, about 7ish different &quot;types&quot; of <del>neurons</del> axons (thanks /u/MuchWowScience!) in the spinal cord, and some of these neurons are different in what they are associated with, not really in morphology. In some cases, (such as Alpha Motor Neurons and Ia Sensory Neurons), morphological similar neurons -- serve as descending control and ascending sensory reception, respectively. So even if you had tiny forceps and were guessing, you could easily mix these two up.</p>
<p>There's also a million other things -- Wallerian Degeneration (axons start dying back shortly after being cut), destruction of intracellular structures that guide transport of materials down axons, the fact that everyone's Central Nervous System is generally the same but specifically very unique (we lose up to 41% of the neurons in the Mediodorsal Nucleus of the Thalamus while growing!), immune rejection, any number of things. This really isn't in the realm of even remote possibility.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Plus the spinal cord isn't just one fat nerve that just needs to reconnect.  It has many specific zones corresponding to different tracks.  Things are pretty densely packed in it.  Good luck lining them up or if even lining them up is enough.  I even think, with its complexity, that the spinal cord should be considered an extension of the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To play devil's advocate here, you may only need to get axons lined up to the proper region, not the specific axon (this is particularly true for not connecting an individual's own spine again, since organization will inherently be somewhat different). The spatial distribution of axons in the spinal cord coordinates reasonably well with their function and region, so it could at least theoretically be possible to connect with some randomness but, uh, &quot;fix it in post&quot; by relying on plasticity in the cortical and subcortical regions they end up connected to. </p>
<p>Personally, I am extremely skeptical of this proposed &quot;transplant&quot; and pretty convinced it will fail entirely, much less provide any spinal function, but it's worth considering how it <em>could</em> work for when we have at least gotten a good start on actually dealing with the problems. </p>
<p>I mean really, at this point, they're asking <em>individual cells</em> to not reject <em>parts of the same cell</em>. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Even if other functions of the donor body don't work, the likelyhood of your two examples, digestion and excretion, will work (assuming adequate oxygenated bloodflow). </p>
<p>The gastrointestinal tract is governed by the Enteric Nervous System (ENS) also sometimes called the intrinsic nervous system or the second brain. The reflexes of the ENS can occur without any central nervous system (CNS) input</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but my point was the &quot;second brain&quot; still relies on the spinal column and nerves to transmit messages to the digestive system etc. If you break the road, nothing will flow down it. It's why Christopher Reeve (of Superman fame) was confined to a wheelchair and required a portable ventilator for the rest of his life after he broke his c1 and c2 vertebrae and sustained catastrophic cord damage - he couldn't breathe on his own because the lower brain couldn't  communicate with the lungs as the pathway was broken. </p>
<p>Hope that makes sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was not his lung tissue, but his diaphragm that is somatic controlled (by will, it's a striated muscle). The autonomic nervous system (ANS) works by reflex, and can function with out direct CNS control. So yes, the pathway to the diaphragm was broken, Which meant that he couldn't breathe on his own, but his ANS and ENS should have worked relatively fine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the thing, the ENS doesn't rely on signals or reflex arches from the brain or spinal colum (CNS). There has been research that shows that even with central denervation, the digestive system still works. There are reflex arches integrated with the CNS and these will ofc be lost</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's evidence from quadriplegic patients that the body does quite a bit more for your brain than just keep it alive. Gut bacteria can potentially affect your behavior, feedback from systems definitely affects mood, the endocrine and immune systems largely originate in the body, etc. One might therefore question whether a head divested of its body could still be meaningfully called the same person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One could question that, but if the only changes are to mood then you are also asking whether you're the same person when you're grumpy as when you're happy. Or a better example would be someone who has had a fecal transplant and thus may have experienced a permanent (slight) change in moods. The truth is we all change drastically throughout life and, outside of catastrophic brain damage, consider ourselves the same person anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered this a well.  I have no medical experience, but with the proper equipment to handle nutrients in the blood, I don't see why you wouldn't be able to some time in the future.  I think one problem would be preventing infection at the sites where the blood flows in and out of the neck.  I don't know if your brain would be able to adapt to not having a body either.  Handling the lack of lungs would be a struggle, since your brain would probably still try to breathe reflexively.  Hell, with no way to know if there's oxygen in your (nonexistent) lungs, you may even feel like you're suffocating.</p></div>		</li>
