			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is an important correction to OP's post. It's not true that the death of the last male makes the species' chances of survival &quot;pretty much 0.&quot; According to the people leading the conservation project, it will not have an impact on their work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering that you pretty much only need 1 sperm, to bring the species back from extinction, one male rhino is probably enough. To say nothing of genetic diversity of course. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have eggs and sperm in storage. So they could bring the species back by putting fertilized eggs inside a different species of Rhino and produce the extinct species again. So there is a higher than 0 chance we will see them again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to put this here because it's the top comment and it says it expires tomorrow so I want as many people as possible to see the post and go watch it. This is a PBS documentary about Sudan and they go into some of the work being done to try and bring the Northern White Rhino back from the brink, and the failures they've encountered. There's even a grainy old photo of a guy doing his best to give Sudan a um... helping hand in the process.</p>
