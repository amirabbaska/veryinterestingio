TIL dogs shouldn't eat grapes. </p>
<p>I honestly couldn't believe that, I had dogs most of my life and just yesterday I saw one feeding on grapes again.  I grew up in a wine growing area and neither I, nor anyone I know, seemed to care about it.  My dogs usually ate some of the grapes around this time of the year , it's hard to prevent that,  they are everywhere. I am so confused,  why are dogs not dropping dead left and right here? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not clear why, but some dogs can eat a lot of grapes without problems and others go into renal failure from close to nothing. The problem is, you don't know it when you first get the dog. </p>
<p>Maybe in your area dogs have been eating grapes for so long that the local mutts are all of the tolerant variety because the intolerant ones dropped dead generations ago. Evolution in action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting and I also feel terrible for not knowing. I will ask some of my local wine growers and the vet if they ever had any major issues with that. It seems almost irresponsible for the farmers to simply drop the &quot;bad&quot; grapes and the pomace on the ground (like they do), if that was the case.Thanks for your insight</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I don't get it either. Before I had internet as a kid I would feed grapes to my dog to get her to do tricks. Like tons of grapes. She lived many years beyond that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently some dogs are just fine with grapes. It's baffling to me.  Every serious walk around this area would lead your dogs to grapes or pomace, it's just sitting there on the ground.  poor doggies :( </p></div>		</li>
