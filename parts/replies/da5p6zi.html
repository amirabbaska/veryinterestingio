			<div class="markdown"><p>The RedBull jump was on October 14, 2012.   Felix and the team chose to not use a drogue parachute (small parachute used for stability), for fear that it might slow him down enough so that he wouldn't beak the sound barrier.   As a result, Felix went into a spin that almost caused unconsciousness.  Using this information, the StratEx team designed a system that used a drogue parachute, that made the system very spin-resistant, since our project specifications where required that we deliver an unconscious pilot to the ground safely.  We developed a spin resistant system that worked perfectly. I didn't make any control movements at all for the first 50,000 feet, and then only a couple of minor movements after that.  I had no sensation when I crossed the speed of sound, or at the maximum speed of 822 mph.    In fact, I only started to hear the wind noise, when I was slowing down.   The sonic boom was heard by the chase crew, and was verified with GPS data after the fact.  AE</p></div>		</li>

<p>GPS for altitude? Isn't that pretty inaccurate?</p></div>		</li>
