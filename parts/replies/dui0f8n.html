<p>I did some grip work when i was younger (about 10 years ago) and was also learning to be a camera man (never finished) but the level of tech and science that goes into the lighting is just mind boggling , there are like 5 - 7 different types of standard lights alone and that not even getting into all the &quot;specialty lighting&quot;. Even a cheap quick indoor scene will have 3.</p>
<p>There is lighting just focused on the background , lighting for the side angles , lighting for foreground scene and even special lighting for peoples faces. </p>
<p>They calculate lighting for height , for skin tones ,for  time of day and side angles to make sure shadows don't interfere with set pieces or blocking.  Have special spot meters to know how its going to look on film because of the frame ratio the lighting on film can look different to the naked eye sometimes. And this was just what I know from a decade ago , can't image how much its advanced in a decade.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually now they use much more large surfaces to create soft light, whereas before, harder light was much more commonplace in cinema. This has little to do with new technology and it's more of a trend. We now find it less harsh and more beautiful to use softer light in general. Watching old movies immediately makes this obvious.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A good DP would go mediocre camera and best lights any day. Being properly exposed and get stylistic what you want (lighting wise) is more important. I would even say that I would like the best lenses and lighting before wanting the best camera. Camera technology has evolved enormously over the past 5 years, many people can't tell the difference between a 5k Blackmagic and 55k Arri Alexa (the gold standard of cinema).</p></div>		</li>

The set piece was just light unfinished wood with LEDs built into the wood. Something like 250 1000w PAR64s, 40 fresnels, 20 profiles, 6 macIII movers and 10 floods for the cyc. All for a natural look. Did look cool though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, extremely important for that polished Hollywood final look. Cinema cameras often shoot in very flat (and visually boring) tones in order to maximize their HDR. Then in post-production they are color graded, which allows for really accurate lighting to color matching, using specific hues to bring out specific emotions, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would put HDR as the least important factor here. If you control the lighting than you control the dynamic range of the scene because you set the ratio of light to dark with your lights and modifiers.  Expanded HDR is a great and convenient thing to have especially for exterior shots but the camera isn't the most important aspect of getting really great footage. Shooting with enough data to properly color grade your image is really important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely one of the most important ones, but actually because it allows you to compress the image towards the middle of the luminance scale without losing detail in the shadows and highlights. It doesn't really have anything to do with mimicking the human eye really because the whole point is to post-produce an image that is very unlike how we see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're missing the point. That is in <em>comparison</em> to video that is not a &quot;professional movie&quot; regular video shot without all that technical production looks NOTHING like how the human eye really sees and that &quot;distinctly movie look&quot; is much more like how we really see. </p>
<p>That is, we're not comparing how we really see to how professional movies look, we're comparing that &quot;distinctly movie look&quot; to amateur video with low contrast. Only one of those even closely resembles how humans see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite, actually. Shallow depth of field is more of a tool that is used selectively when it's required. If you look, the vast majority of shots in most films with have rather deep depth of field.</p>
<p>What really sells a film's &quot;cinematic look&quot; is production design and lighting. Everything in a frame is planned to look a certain way. The colour of the walls, the items on the shelf, everything. All of that is chosen because of how it works together.</p>
<p>That's why small budget films don't look as good. Because they can't. If you're shooting on a borrowed location (even your own house), you're not going to paint your walls just because it's a better colour for the film. A big film will. And when big films go on location, they will search forever until they find the perfect one and then still bring in a lot of their own stuff to enhance it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked at a hotel that was in a big budget movie. They shut down a floor, one restaurant, and some other areas for a month, changed out carpets, paint colours, art on the walls, even moved some minor walls and doorways. </p>
<p>When they were done, their contractors came back and put it back together. </p>
<p>... by put it back together I mean new carpets, not the old ones back in, of course. New light fixtures, better than the outdated ones from before. &quot;We like the art, actually.&quot; &quot;Cool, then we don't have to throw it out!&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's physically impossible for all depths of a frame to maintain the same level of sharpness organically. Therefore even when a zoom lens is set to &quot;infinite&quot; depth of field, such as when you're photographing a landscape, the peak of a mountain will have a different sharpness compared to the trees at it's base which are closer. This is not desired though. In every shot a very specific look is intended. Especially when you consider the fact every scene can cost tens of thousands of dollars in just transportation costs. With that in mind you can understand why prime lenses are used almost exclusively for movie production. The scene is not dynamic, it's scripted and deliberate as so should the lens be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the circle of confusion is less than one pixel on a digital copy, or less than the angular resolution of the eye when projected at a given distance, this doesn't matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Therefore even when a zoom lens is set to &quot;infinite&quot; depth of field...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Infinity&quot; is the focus setting at which an infinitely distant point will be in focus. This will mean in practical terms that, for example, stars in the night sky will be in perfect focus. It doesn't refer to the depth of field. Both zooms and primes have a setting for infinity focus distance.</p>
<p>A related concept that is actually to do with depth of field is the hyperfocal distance, which is the distance you set focus to in order to maximise depth of field. Given that in all practical circumstances there is a certain depth of field even when viewing an 8K print close-up, there is a non-zero depth of field.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Especially when you consider the fact every scene can cost tens of thousands of dollars in just transportation costs. With that in mind you can understand why prime lenses are used almost exclusively for movie production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So again, zoom lenses have nothing to do with depth of field. And if you are transporting 5 prime lenses instead of one zoom that is increasing your transportation (and hiring) costs, not reducing them.</p>
<p>The main advantage of a zoom lens is convenience - you can zoom to an arbitrary focal length without changing the lens. When you have a big budget for lenses, enough time to change them and aren't actually going to zoom during a shot, there's no reason to have zooms.</p>
<p>&quot;Scripted and deliberate&quot; though is really a crazy way of trying to distinguish primes from zoom lenses - is wild camera shake on a prime lens more &quot;scripted and deliberate&quot; than a slow zoom-in? I'd argue that zooms are not used as much in films because human eyes can't zoom. A zoom in a film emphasises the medium which is usually not what you want to do. And if you're not zooming while actually filming, you may as well use primes for the better quality. On the other hand if you want to achieve a specific effect, like quickly zooming in on something to emphasise a detail in a scene, or a dolly-zoom to give a sickening feeling to the audience, of course you do.</p></div>		</li>
