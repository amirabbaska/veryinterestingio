<p>Interesting!  My followup question would be, if there were an environment where this was not the case, and they really did need to capture every last photon, would you start to see autotrophs evolving to use multiple photosynthetic molecules to cover more of the spectrum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photosynthetic bacteria already have multiple photosynthetic molecules (they live in water), so yes. Plants do too, they have Anthocyanin. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin" target="_blank">Anthocyanines</a> are the reason blackberrys are black, for example. IIRC every photosynthetic molecule has some wavelenght it doesn't absorb, which means a mixture of different photosynthetic molecules isn't necessarly more effective than more of one kind, but i'm not sure aboput that one.</p>
<p>(Bacteria living deeper in the ocean loses the specialization for normal wavelenghts, so it wont happen in bacteria.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anthocyanins, however, are not used in photosynthesis.  A better example would perhaps be Carotenoids like Zeaxanthin which are part of the antenna complex for reaction centers.  Basically, they are molecules that can absorb photons and pass excited electrons to other pigments, and so on until they reach the reaction center of photosystem II.</p>
<p>To address the original question, it seems quite likely that additional parts of the spectrum would be used in a strictly photon-limited environment.  However, there are limits; longer wavelengths would have too little energy to do anything useful, so wouldn't be selected for.  Wavelengths that are too short would likely be too energetic and damaging to organic molecules.  Essentially, the greens might get 'filled in' and absorbed, but wavelengths outside infrared or ultraviolet wouldn't be useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many plants have <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss3/pigments.html" target="_blank">two types of chlorophyll molecule</a> in order to make use of different wavelengths of light. Algae, chromista, bacteria, and plenty of other organisms make use of other chlorophyll molecules (there are six total) as well as carotenoid and phycobilin molecules. In other words, plants are already using Chlorophyll A &amp; B, other critters are using C1, C2, D, F, and a whole slew of other photoreactive chemicals. It's not uncommon for a single organism to contain more than one molecule.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the whole point of absorbing light in photosynthesis is to produce H and electrons which are used in metabolic processes to create sugars, starches, and etc. This means that the amount of light that any plant (or other photosynthetic organism) can utilize is dependent on CO^2 and water uptake as well. These are likely more limiting factors than light for most organisms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of like us, we don't need all of the energy because we are limited by our metabolism for what we can do with it. If they could use all of it, chances are without a ton of energy, they would not thrive. Instead of requiring all possible energy to survive, evolutionarily it makes more sense to be able to survive off of as little as possible, if that makes sense. </p></div>		</li>

<a href="http://econoluxindustries.com/Technology/PAR%20Curve.png" target="_blank">Daylight Spectrum vs Chlorophyll</a></p>
<p>As you can see in the above graph it's largely flat throughout our perceived spectrum range.   And our eyes do a pretty good job of white balancing automatically so if we lived on Mars we would start to see light on mars as pretty white too. </p></div>		</li>
