			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding a bit on that, here in The Netherlands it broadly works like this (disclaimer: to the best of my knowledge, not a lawyer):</p>
<p>If police were to place a camera, filming say a parking lot, but without filing the proper paperwork / posting signs / etc, then the recording of someone breaking into a car may very well be considered inadmissible. As mentioned this is a way to keep law enforcement 'playing by the rules'.</p>
<p>However if a private party were to place the same camera in the same spot, the evidence would most certainly be admissible. At the same time the private party may very well face a fine for their illegal camera, but that's a separate case entirely.</p>
<p>The reason for the difference being that the private party doesn't stand to directly gain from that camera's recordings. The police on the other hand would stand to gain evidence as a reward after violating people's right to privacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how it works in the us as well.  In this email way every civil rights violation becomes legal as long as those violations are laundered through a third party.  We have massive widespread fourth amendment violations because of this, and a legal construct of manufacturing court-admissable 'evidence' based on these crimes that is euphemistically termed &quot;parallel reconstruction&quot; where entire evidence chains are falsified in order to get more convictions.</p>
<p>The problem is, those third parties have billions of dollars to gain.  We have senior senators whose businesses cater to these violations on behalf of government, because those senators can award themselves the contracts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hooked up one of my stoner buds with a nice lawyer after he got arrested with a scale and some Mary, and the lawyer apparently found something with how the cop searched him (I think they didn't make it clear he had the right to deny. Something little) he went before the judge, made some big case, and the judge ended up letting my guy go on nothing. Probably the 3rd time this guy has been straight up caught and faced no charges. </p>
<p>So, in certain scenarios, I've seen it work. Doesn't deter the cops here from being a little scandalous, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A thing to remember is the court's goal is not always a conviction. Here they may not have convicted, but everyone from the judge, to the lawyers, to the prosecutors, etc got paid. And paid big. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this is the definition of &quot;illegally obtained&quot;, in some sense.  If it's been illegally obtained, by definition, it has not been processed correctly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An example of what you say: It was recently found by the SQ (Quebec provincial police) that the SPVM (Montreal Police) had been planting evidence to silence whistleblowers on the subject of internal corruption. And that's just what the investigation publicly released, so as these things always go it's probably one of the less bad things they discovered.</p>
<p>So not only do we see cases of parallel construction (the art of inventing a false scenario whereby valid evidence that was obtained illegally becomes a 'totally legit discovery), but we see cases where parallel construction is applied to false evidence with wild abandon.</p>
<p>Just as can be expected, really: Anyone willing to obtain evidence illegally and then invent a coverup is more than happy to simply make up evidence to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted though, within reason parallel construction is legal from what I recall. If evidence is excluded for being obtained illegally it can still be included by finding an alternative means of legally obtaining the previous evidence. It is only an issue when it is used to hide systemic obtainment of illegal evidence.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thank you wikipedia for listing out the exceptions</p>
<p>The doctrine is subject to four main exceptions. The tainted evidence is admissible if:</p>
<pre><code>it was discovered in part as a result of an independent, untainted source; or

it would inevitably have been discovered despite the tainted source; or

the chain of causation between the illegal action and the tainted evidence is too attenuated; or

the search warrant was not found to be valid based on probable cause, but was executed by government agents in good faith (called the good-faith exception).</code></pre></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it's Perjury at a minimum.</p>
<p>Issue is that certain corrupt conditions such as the Investigatory Powers Act (UK, 2016), it's possible to entirely prevent the disclosure, revelation or questioning of a piece of evidence's origins. There are similar provisions in the US, as you may recall from the &quot;war on terror&quot; cases where the defense was  allowed no knowledge or access of evidence - or in some cases even the charges - against the defendant.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, even without the extra &quot;terror&quot; provisions, this nevertheless creates a climate whereby unverifiable evidence obtained through undisclosed means are used to condemn with no real certainty regarding the veracity of any involved claims.</p>
<p>In the US it falls under the &quot;fruit of the poisonous tree&quot; doctrine</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking of &quot;illegally obtained evidence&quot; in the wrong fashion here. Evidence that is excluded from court under the exclusionary rule is typically due to a good faith error or rule of evidence technicality. It happens all the time. For example, in South Carolina video evidence of a DUI arrest is typically required for prosecution (this includes the arrested subject doing field sobriety tests). Lawyers will fight to have video tossed for many reasons like the defendant walking off camera for a moment. If the judges rules the video as inadmissible because of a technicality like the example I mentioned, it's considered &quot;illegally obtained&quot; evidence. Therefore all evidence gained related to the video tests is inadmissible and the case could be dismissed. You could try to sue the arresting officer, maybe, but it would never go anywhere because there was no intent. Planting evidence or doctoring evidence is a completely different topic and anyone found doing this should most definitely be prosecuted. </p>
<p>You can literally find hundreds of examples of &quot;illegally obtained evidence&quot; where there were just procedure issues that were argued later in court. Search and seizure law is very complex and is argued and interpreted constantly. </p></div>		</li>
