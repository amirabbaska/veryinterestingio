			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemokines are used in the immune system to tell immune cells where to go. Leptin is a hormone that regulates the sensation of hunger. I don't believe leptin serves any function as a chemokine, unless I'm mistaken. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may not have worded it out properly but I meant that adipocytes release both leptin AND chemokines, though I forgot which ones (pretty hard stuff to remember as well), which is quite surprising since I thought all they do is store fat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm probably way off base here but are chemokines at all related to chemotherapy? Does the prefix chemo mean the same thing in both?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, THAT totally makes sense, since leptin binds to neuropeptide Y neurons in the arcuate nucleus in such a way as to decrease the activity of these neurons and signals to the hypothalamus which produces a feeling of satiety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, some difficulty with losing weight is linked to an environment-induced leptin insensitivity (essentially it's a feedback loop -- being fat causes you to be insensitive to leptin, and being insensitive to leptin helps you being fat). Fat people in fact have more leptin in their system than healthy-range people, but they're often far less sensitive to it, which leads to their sense of satiety not really correspond with their nutritional needs. IIRC, this <em>can</em> be reversed, and the leptin insensitivity cured, but if one sticks to a proper diet for a while. However, many experience strong hunger in the mid-stage, which is why people often give up weight-loss before they get to that point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, there is a pad of fat that helps hold your eyes in place!</p>

<p>Does this fat have some sort of restriction to keep it from growing and shrinking in times of caloric boom or bust? Or do the eyes move as ones body fat changes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is hormonal regulation of the fat distribution in our bodies, so normally the orbital fat pads wouldn't be affected by minor weight loss or gain. BUT if you were to undergo significant weight loss (ie: emaciation),  your eyes would appear sunken in!
Alternately, there can be pathological buildup or herniation of the orbital fat pads- leaving an unattractive bulge under the eyes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is regulated by hormones. Generally, we don't distribute fat evenly over the body when we ger heavier, there's a kind of priority order. And it's well known that it's different in men and women, men put a lot of fat on their bellies early while women begin by putting it on their thighs and around the hips.</p>
<p>The little pads behind the eyes may grow as a consequence of some diseases, most often hyperthyroidism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Grave's ophthalmopathy (often part of the autoimmune Grave's disease), the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor found in orbital fat is targeted by the immune system. Among other symptoms, this results in lipogenesis (the creation of fat) by preadipocytes and fibroblasts. This causes <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8f/Proptosis_and_lid_retraction_from_Graves%27_Disease.jpg" target="_blank">exophthalmos</a>, or bulging of the eyes. Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

On a related note, there are also fat pads holding your kidneys in place. In severe emaciation, these kidney fat pads deplete and your kidneys can actually fall out of place! As far as I know, this is call renal ectopia and it is a medical emergency!</p></div>		</li>
