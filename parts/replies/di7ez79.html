			<div class="markdown"><p>this is where the data we hand out to google get's scary.</p>
<p>as you seem to be fully aware of, google knows your private stuff pretty well. google also knows your mobile. and now the 'fun' stuff starts. google knows your Location based in Wi-Fi networks available basically as soon as anyone walks by with GPS enabled (eg. work Wi-Fi, left and right neighbour). depending on the number and coverage of networks this can be suprisingly accurate. (in my company building Google's estimated Location with out gps on can differentiate in which of our meetingrooms you are)</p>
<p>based on what we already established Google obviously knows the location and your Data on your work machine and when you are there.</p>
<p>Now they basically only need to put 1 and 1 together to connect those datapoints.</p>
<p>this can actually be a huge Security issue. I know some cases where huge company deals got basically leaked by personalised ads. unfortunatly I (pretty obviously) can't share the proof or the exact examples, because this kind of Information is naturally under strict NDAs.</p></div>		</li>
