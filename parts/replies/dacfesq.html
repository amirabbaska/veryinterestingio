			<div class="markdown"><p>The tax disparity here is important to clarify: there's income tax, which is what people pay out of their paychecks from working. Capital gains tax is what you pay out of gains in your investments. Capital gains rate is almost always lower than income tax rate. If Buffett's secretary buys some stock and sells it later, she'll pay the same rate Buffett does on the sale. But she doesn't have enough stock to live off the dividends or income from selling it so she pays income tax. Buffett lives off his investment income so he never pays income tax and pays capital gains. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. In the US people pay a lower tax rate on gains from investments held more than one year.</p>
<p>His overall tax burden is higher than this, although probably nobody (including Buffett himself) knows exactly how much, because the companies owned by his holding company (Berkshire Hathaway) pay tax on their income too.</p>
<p>Also note that although Buffett controls enormous wealth, he has far less personal income every year than you think. He buys companies and holds onto them forever and doesn't take much of a salary.</p>
<p>Lastly, it costs the government far less as a percent to provide services to really big entities than it does to an individual. Economies of scale and all that.</p>
<p>So although Buffett's total tax bill is vastly higher than his secretaries, yes as a percentage of income it is lower. But we don't really know by how much, and there are some good reasons for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that those dividends from stock, are funded by the corporations profits which are already subject to a high amount of taxation.  Sometimes as high as 40%.  So dividends being taxed at 15% on top of that is really a form of <em>double</em>-taxation.  </p>
<p>Corporate taxes in general just pass on the tax to people, in the form of lower wages, lower dividends, or higher prices.  Corporate taxes really just turn companies into secret tax collectors and obscure how much individuals, rich and poor, really pay to the government.</p>
<p>On a separate vein, it's worth noting that anybody with any sort of pension is generally having it funded in some way, shape, or form through stocks.  Rich people benefit the most from lower taxes there, since more of their income often comes through that avenue, but it's not like it's a conspiracy that only benefits the 1%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The others are giving you great answers about the capital gains tax, which is (as has been pointed out) why wealthier people tend to pay an overall lower tax <em>rate</em> than others. </p>
<p>That said, I don't think anyone's explained <em>why</em> the capital gains rate is substantially lower than the ordinary income rate. Generally speaking, the <em>usual</em> capital gains rate is 15% (for capital assets held longer than one year, which is true for most people). Compare that to ordinary income rates that range well above 40%. Why?</p>
<p>The most succinct answer is this: <em>it's an optional tax</em>. I only have to pay it if and when I decide to sell a capital asset. The higher the tax rate, the less willing/motivated I will be to sell the asset. And I never <em>have</em> to sell it. I could always figure out other ways of getting money out of that asset without selling it. I could always borrow against it, rent it out (in the case of real property), or do a dozen other things to avoid/mitigate the capital gains tax.</p>
<p>So imposing a higher capital gains <em>rate</em> doesn't necessarily mean that the government is going to reap more money. Indeed, as you crank the rate up, you tend to see diminishing returns as people will hold onto their investments for longer and longer. (The same is true of the income tax, albeit to a lesser degree.)</p>
<p>So the government settled on a modest figure of 15% or so. They'd rather have a 15% slice of transactions that happen regularly than, say, a 40% slice of transactions that happen infrequently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note, the 15% figure only dates back to the mid-2000s. It was higher before then. It's also worth noting that we've cut capital gains tax rates twice in the last thirty years and both were followed within five years by massive investment bubbles and crashes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we treated financial market with the same rules we apply to income or production it could not survive. If this is wow to you, then start reading about subsidies: most of what you eat and what you use to move you around, heat your house is paid partly by taxes. Oil gets HUGE subsidies as does agriculture. On the latter, it is understandable as it is FOOD they grow. but when it comes to say, oil, it was subsidized to promote fast growth but at the moment, is the only thing keeping oil cheap for you. In Europe and elsewhere in the western world, gas prices are generally 2-3x to USA (even if adjusted for general price in the country) and that is not because US is oil developing country. These subsidies go on forever and forever, it is a deep swamp indeed and also quite easy to see why lobbies are so influential and powerful: there is actual money involved, trillions of it. That is not free market, nor is it really any kind of actual well-thought out ideology or theory, it is just plain old greed. Revolving doors make this even worse again when politicians and their aids move from corporate to politics like it's just another job. Looking at Trump cabinet, it is very clear to anyone how this works as it filled with lobbyists, who ow control the exact area their lobby tried to drive forward..</p>
<p>Current president elect is going to add more government subsidies to old energy, making renewables again a thing of the future instead of now. We subsidize renewables too, globally, it is motivation route: renewables are dirt cheap compared so why would you get an oil burner. Also it has high incentive to invest in that kind of tech as there is strong base support for it, less risks involved for the manufacturer. This is how many countries have managed to upgrade their whole energy producing structure. </p>
<p>Of course, in Europe, ending the dependency on cheap gas from Russia was another factor; we need to get rid of that part of the deal and so far, it is going well, also reason why Russia invaded Crimea is part of the same story. It is all part of same cake, from US potus to US subsidies to EU and Russia and WWIII, where lowering oil prices in USA is really a weapon against Russia.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's seriously misleading. He pays a lower tax rate on his humongous income because he makes money from long-term capital gains, not because he invests in things the government approves of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And those capital gains, which are recognized as a tax subsidy by all economists and thus can be characterized as something the government approves of, is not the only tax he pays. </p>
<p>He also pays the Net Investment Income Tax, increasing his rate by 3.8% and loses portions of his personal exemption and his itemized deductions due to the Pease phaseouts. Thus, even if your unrealistic assumptions, his tax rate is approximately 26% even if he receives no salary and no flow through income from S-corporations, Partnerships, or LLCs. </p></div>		</li>
