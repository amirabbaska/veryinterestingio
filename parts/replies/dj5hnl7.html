			<div class="markdown"><p>That is also how with traits like height, the children can end up with a much different trait than their parents. For example, if you have two average-sized parents, they will both have roughly equal numbers of &quot;tall&quot; and &quot;short&quot; alleles.</p>
<p>However, due to the fact that from each of your parents half of those are selected at random to get into the zygote that will become you, you could end up with mostly &quot;tall&quot; alleles - and thus become significantly larger than your parents.</p></div>		</li>
