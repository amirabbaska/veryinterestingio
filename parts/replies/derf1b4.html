<p>Gravitational force falls of with the square of distance. So if you double the distance to the center, you cut gravitational force to 1/4 it's previous level. </p>
<p>Edit: someone can check my numbers but I think, for a cube, the Gravitational Force at the corners is 1/2 that at the faces. </p>
<p>F=GM/r^2</p>
<p>if r=1 at the center, then r=sqrt2 at the corner. </p>
<p>(Sqrt2)^2 =2</p>
<p>So G stays that same, M stays the same, r^2 doubles, so F is cut in half. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I'm a kilometer from the center of the earth, the gravitational force would be equipollent to the force 1x10^-20 meters from the center of a bowling ball? </p>
<p>If I were to bite through the exact center of a grape, would by teeth be pulled apart?</p>
<p>I'm missing something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be pretty fucking awesome! We have pretty destination to travel, some warm some cold, but we dont have anywhere that advertises &quot;hey we got half the gravity than X town&quot;</p></div>		</li>
