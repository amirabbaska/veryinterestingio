<p>That's very interesting.  I had always assumed that things were going pretty well economically but women began to get equal rights and so they started wanting careers of their own and also put up with less crap which caused divorce rates to go up which then created single mothers who <strong>HAD</strong> to work so they took up jobs wherever they could, including minimum wage jobs...and then something else happened which I'm not entirely clear about and asked it be ELI5...after which we had women in the workforce on par with men producing 80hrs of labor and for which together they were compensated the same as what they had been earlier for half that i.e. standard livelihood for a family of ~four.</p></div>		</li>
