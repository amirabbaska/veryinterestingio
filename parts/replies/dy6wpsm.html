			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the relative gravity of the objects being attracted; it's the fact that the surface they're on isn't a perfect plane. If the surface sags down (as water will tend to in a container) the objects will collect in the middle. </p>
<p>If you're talking about objects floating on a larger body of water, like a lake or river, that has more to do with the currents causing the objects to drift to similar locations than gravity. </p></div>		</li>
