<p>Long term, more practice in mental endurance will cause you to build up more neurotransmitters, giving you longer time to use those pathways.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if you're focusing on a task for a couple hours and start losing the ability to focus, you can (a) take a break to refresh your mind short term or (b) force yourself to pay attention even longer to build up your attention span?</p>
<p>Do you have a source like a research paper? Not to call bullshit but so I can understand how this was discovered. Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just what's in the back of my memories, but basically, this is learning.  Eventually, you get to where it takes very little mental effort to perform certain tasks that have been repeated many times.  Though it's not just for tasks.  Most of your neurons can do this.</p>
<p>Also, think of PTSD.  Forcing a pattern makes that pattern come up more easily.  Everything in degrees though.  Reading about death vs seeing a buddy die.  Reading about math vs working the problems.   Solving 3 problems vs 30 problems.   Etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, but disruption of the day/night mechanisms affect the switchboard portions of the brain more that the conscious thinking portions.</p>
<p>Different parts of the brain fatigue at different frequencies.  Some are over 1Hz, and others, like the hipocampus are around 0.05Hz.  So thinking pathways might need 20-60 mins to recover, but awareness and wakefulness might need 5-10 hrs.  </p>
<p>There's a lot more to sleep than neuroplasticity though, and various hormones override wakefulness patterns in the brain to enforce it.  </p>
<p>There have been people who lived years without sleeping (brain injury) and they were relatively normal, but most become non-functional within a couple of days.</p>
<p>You can force your way past limits, but</p></div>		</li>
