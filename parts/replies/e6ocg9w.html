			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can't Country B print Country A's currency (assuming they either have perfect forgeries or a valid printing machine)?</p>
<p>You say they can't &quot;because that's how currency works&quot;, but that's not really an explanation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point. It is physically possible for Country B to print Country A's currency. However, only Country A has &quot;the right&quot; to print Country A's currency. If Country B ignores this, they're violating Country A's sovereignty. It's the kind of thing you could start a war over. I'd characterize that situation not as &quot;Country B 'gives' currency to Country A&quot; and more as &quot;Country B 'steals' goods from Country A&quot;. </p>
<p>And FWIW, there wouldn't be much point. Paper money is a blip on the scale of national finance. North Korea has been known to forge US currency, and it amounts to an annoyance. To really make a difference, you'd have to do something like forge Country A's treasury bonds, and I have no idea where you'd even start with something like that. We'd be talking about taking out loans under guise of a different nation, so, like, identity theft on a national scale?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back when everyone was using gold and there was no such thing as fiat currency, country B could certainly &quot;print&quot; (mine) more gold, go to country A, and buy goods with it. What happens to country A's market when that happens? Now country A have more gold, and less goodsâ€”yet this probably hasn't inflated the value of gold, because country B now has <em>less</em> gold and <em>more</em> goods, and an active trading relationship with country A, so the market value of gold in country A should still take the potential buyers-of-gold in country B into account.</p>
<p>It'd be a bit like if each country in the Eurozone could set its own monetary policy, printing its own stock of Euros. (Except that it's a bit harder to just <em>decide</em> to mine more gold.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No-one is talking about forgery here, very few people get away with it and not on any kind of meaningful scale. The central bank of a country is the only entity with the authority to print that country's currency. If any country arround the world could print usd for example, the currency would be rendered worthless due to the massive increase in supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, when countries are involved we are typically talking about entries in central bank computers not actual printing. Shipping pallets of cash is unusual.</p>
<p>Actually, when a country &quot;prints&quot; it's own currency it is also usually just computer entries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what keeps country b from printing more of their own money to give to country a? the money leaves the country so it doesn't inflate their own currency. country a doesn't know the money was just poofed into existence, so country a shouldn't devalue their currency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point here is that country B's money has no value on its own. So printing more of country B's money is simply printing more nice-looking paper. In order to use that paper to buy goods and services, you need to find a place that will accept that paper as payment, which in this case is also country B. The money flows back to country B in the end.</p></div>		</li>
