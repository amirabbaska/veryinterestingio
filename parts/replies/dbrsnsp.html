			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it could work with one of those shot towers they used back in the day to make shotgun shot. They would drip molten lead and it would form a perfect little ball before hardening in the air and dropping solid onto the ground. They weren't too terribly tall either. You could drop a glob from height, after it reaches terminal velocity isn't it in a zero g? Then just have it be at terminal velocity for long enough to cool or maybe have it drop into water. I really wanna try this now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the lead, they just needed the outside &quot;hard enough&quot; to hold it's shape.</p>
<p>Prince Rupert's Drops are formed by rapidly cooling the glass. The water plays an important role in this rapid cooling because it conducts heat away from the glass about 24 times faster than the air would if you just dropped it from height.</p>
<p>You don't actually need the drop to be spherical to not have the weakness of the tail, you could equally get away with it being a cylinder of constant diameter as the thicker the glass is as it cools the more internal stresses are formed, ergo stronger glass.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Actually, no. Since terminal velocity is when drag and gravity forces equal out, there is zero acceleration relative to the Earth's surface, so it's the same as standing on solid ground.</p>
<p>If that doesn't make sense to you, consider a parachutist, who is falling at a slow terminal velocity due to massive drag from the parachute, and still experiencing 1g.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that would work. The glass is cooled by convection.  Which is dependent on gravity. If you put the drop in a sphere of water in zero g, the water will vaporize away from the molten glass, no longer cooling it.</p>
<p>Edit: You could use waters property of not being compressible to keep it around the drop. Like a box with a lid that fits the inside dimensions of the box and push.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah thats way too hard and requires going to space!</p>
<p>Just get some molton glass on the vomit comet plane (you know, a giant glass kiln furnace thing is just what you want on a plane, still safer than putting one in space) form the ball while in freefall, then catch it with a bucket of water as the plane levels out to avoid smacking into the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then you still have the problem of zero g = no convection. You have to force the water to stay around the molten sphere. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>take it up in a vomit comet, form the glob so it's floating as a perfect sphere, hover it over tub of water, then have the plane pull up so the glob falls into the water as a sphere.  or like the guy below said, shot tower.  but it seems like the glass has too much viscosity to do it that way.  </p>
<p>sounds like something the mythbuster would do, but they're gone now.  maybe destin could pull it off. </p></div>		</li>
