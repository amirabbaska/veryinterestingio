			<div class="markdown"><p>My ELI5 example:</p>
<p>Imagine you are a bank robber.  You've been carefully planning a bank job for weeks, because you found a suitable target in a town where the police are lazy.</p>
<p>The day before your heist, someone else robs a different bank in town.  Now, there are police EVERYWHERE and all the bank employees are extremely suspicious of everyone.  The police have put road blocks everywhere, too.  Pretty hard to rob a bank and get away under those circumstances.</p>
<p>That's kind of what happens when a healthy immune system fights off a serious infection.  The body becomes extra hostile to all foreign bodies.  Most bacteria that infect humans thrive at standard human body temperature, so the body cranks up the heat, becoming a hostile environment.  A later virus or bacteria attempting to infiltrate that body will encounter a hostile environment where the police are already patrolling the streets.</p>
<p>Why is your body not always in this heightened state to fend off diseases?  Because a fever damages your own body and your immune system can accidentally attack your own body, too.  If you unleash 500 police officers on a small town and tell them there's a terrorist there, they're going to treat everybody like a terrorist.  Shit's gonna get bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of... Allergic reactions are basically what happens when your police department is trained to fight a bunch of terrorists (serious diseases) but since your body is like the suburbs (because modern hygeine / sanitation / preventative care has made the modern world much less &quot;germ-y&quot; and dangerous to your body), your police department has nothing to do all day so they go all out and bust out the swat team every time they see some punk teenagers spraying graffiti at the gas station (aka when you come into contact with an allergen)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Allergies happen because allergens look kinda like parasites and the part of your immune system that deals with parasites doesn't have anything to do and probably hasn't seen a real parasite so it just attacks the allergen. Unfortunately for you, the antibodies responsible for fighting parasites are the best at creating inflammation. It has been shown that infecting someone with hookworms reduces the symptoms of their allergies as long as they are infected</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are sick.... YOU are weakened. The immune system is not. Unless it's aids. The reaction your body takes is because it wants to restrict the harm the infection has. If the infection overpowers the immune system that's when problems happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Basically you're weakened <em>because</em> your body is diverting power to <del>shields</del> immune system from normal systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the by, I've been on antibiotics for about the past month and a half. Yesterday I took one pill instead of three to &quot;taper down&quot;. Today, I'm counting symptoms from at least three different diseases. I'm running a fever, have a really bad hack in my throat and lungs, and am a little bit queasy. I thought it was whooping cough at first, then maybe just the flu, but a friend of mine who's an RN said it's what they call &quot;post-antibiotic withdrawal syndrome&quot;, or (adorably) PAWS, where my immune system just fell back to its normal level and is still fighting against heightened risk of disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually wrong when it comes to severe infections, the immune system does weaken after infections because the anti-inflammatory signaling meant to control the immune response takes over resulting in a augmented risk of secondary infections. </p>
<p>To add to the explanation /u/RiPont provided: A later virus or bacteria attempting to infiltrate that body will encounter a hostile environment where the police (tired and soon to take vacation time to recover) are already patrolling the streets.</p>
<p>This is a paper one of my colleagues wrote on the subject for those interested.
