			<div class="markdown"><p>Pain is different, because to the brain that's always something urgent. </p>
<p>If you smell something new, it's interesting. If you've been smelling it for the past hour, if it hasn't killed/affected you so far, you'll probably be fine staying there longer.</p>
<p>If you're missing a leg, or bleeding, no matter how long that lasts it's going to be bad for you for it to last longer. Pain is your brain's way of saying &quot;Something's wrong, do something about it!&quot;, regardless of if you are even capable of doing something about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there appears to be some distinct relationship between the perception of pain and the cerebellum, but the truth is pain is a complex sensation, with multiple sensory inputs so its difficult to pin down exactly whats what from a neurological perspective, and surprisingly, very little work has been done in this area. from an evolutionary perspective however, ignoring pain is never a good idea. Pain is motivation to action, usually, you know, take your hand off the hot plate kind of action. Or remove that damn piece of glass in the bottom of your foot, or the splinter, prevent infection yada yada</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how is life without a cerebellum? Do these people feel any differently or does the brain still somehow cancel out the stimuli that occur over and over. Can they get desensetised to anything?</p></div>		</li>
