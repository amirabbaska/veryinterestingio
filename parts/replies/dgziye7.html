			<div class="markdown"><p>The Pachelbel Rant clip is hilarious, but he kind of cheats the concept, since a lot of the songs in his medley is the same I V vi IV progression as the Axis of Awesome bit. The Canon in D progression is pretty similar, but it throws in a iii, and is longer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha Funny! Evanescence used that riff too in [Where will you go] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoKm7zkN8Uk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uoKm7zkN8Uk</a>). It was released in 2000. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similar, for sure, but not the same. And this is a good example of the topic... we naturally came up with different melodies that are similar over the same chord progression. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The melody of the Evanescence riff is the same as your riff, the Daredevil is not. Your riff goes up on the last note of every chord, the Daredevil intro continues down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! You can hear music at <a href="http://www.muchthesame.com" target="_blank">muchthesame.com</a> or just look up Much The Same on Spotify.  Survive is the album this riff was written for. Gut Shot is the most &quot;radio friendly&quot; of the songs on it if you don't just want to start with track 1.</p></div>		</li>
