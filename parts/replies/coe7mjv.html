			<div class="markdown"><p>That is fascinating, and now I'm curious to see how far the delusion would extend. If you asked them to switch on a lamp with their paralysed arm, would they think the lamp was switched on? If you asked them to play the piano with it would they hear piano notes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VS Ramachandran has done something similar to this by asking them to pick up a tray with a bunch of items on it.  The tray requires two hands to lift. The idea was to see how deep the delusion went. When you know you only have one hand, you pick the tray up from the center. The anosognosics, however, just lifted the right side of the tray with their good hand, dumping all the contents over as if they had been expecting the left hand to be helping out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did they react to that? Did they come up with a delusion to explain why that happened, or did they realize the arm was disabled?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine that it depends on &quot;where&quot; the delusion appears. Like in a computer program - if an error appears at different levels it will incorporate itself into different systems. If there is a hardware level problem then it will potentially permeate through every single level (although software might work around it). But there could also be an OS level problem - this would be apparent in that specific OS, but not in others. It could also be an application level problem. They could all manifest for the end user in the same way, but depending on where they originate could end up being there on different levels of the software stack. </p>
<p>I imagine it works in a similar way for the brain - that the delusion could appear on different fundamental levels and thus have differing effects. Eg if the delusion is that they perceive a person sitting on X chair at that moment then it wouldn't matter how you recorded or showed information about the scene - they would still perceive the person sitting there. If the delusion was, however, that their vision simply sees a person sitting there then it could be inconsistent with other senses.</p>
<p>Would something like this be a likely reason why people have experienced it differently?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, does &quot;resolved the condition&quot; mean the patient overcame some mental incapacity to move their arm and was then able to move again, or did the patient become fully aware of the fact that they were not moving their arm as they previously perceived?</p></div>		</li>
