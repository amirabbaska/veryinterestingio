<p>Similarly, humans didn't first acquire HIV from <em>eating</em> bushmeat. Rather, it was exposure to living blood and body fluids of infected simians that led to the infection. (Hunters and butchers get covered with a lot of fresh blood.)  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3367631/?report=classic" target="_blank">Nevertheless, hunting and butchering wild NHPs for food</a>, which expose humans to NHP blood and body fluids, are widespread in sub-Saharan Africa and may lead to ongoing transmission from any of the 33 species of NHP that are known to harbor their own unique SIV strains. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hunting and butchering, not &quot;eating.&quot; Otherwise everyone who ate bushmeat would be at risk of infection, and not just the hunters and butchers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.</p>
<p>Every time I think about &quot;swiss cheese brain&quot; I'm reminded of Vonnegut's description of people suffering from advanced syphilis (which also, eventually end in the same way). In the beginning of <em>Breakfast of Champions,</em> he talks about how common it was seeing a person walking down the street, who stops to wait for a light, and in those few minutes wait, they finally lose enough brain matter that they no longer have the cognitive ability to step off the curb and cross the street.</p>
<p>Swiss cheese head: not even once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though eating yourself as you've explained is not a good option for fueling ones body, from what I've read, when humans consume other humans the tissue is so similar that the person consuming the meat can get a huge amount of protein and other nutrients from it. The meat is so similar in constitution that it is very easily assimilated and turned into energy. One comparison I saw stated that for an eight ounce cow steak a human can expect to get about twenty percent protein and other nutrients, while an eight ounce human steak, one could expect to get about 80% protein and nutrients, because it is so similar on a molecular level the body can easily break it down and convert it to nutrients. As others have stated on here, you would run the risk of contracting Kuru, which is quite similar to mad cow disease, and sounds like no fun at all, but in life or death situations it may be worth it. It has been said that the donner party was able to hike out of the mountains because of the energy boost received from eating dead passengers from the crash. I certainly don't condone eating people, but if your hell bent on survival, and you've run out of other options, it might just save your life.</p></div>		</li>
