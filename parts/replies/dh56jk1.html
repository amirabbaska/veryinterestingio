			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it could. With reading, you have to imagine a good deal more about the story than you do watching a movie. That's the biggest difference in experience for me.</p>
<p>TV shows and movies can be absolutely amazing, but there's something about that imagining experience that sets reading apart for me. </p></div>		</li>

<p>TV/Film is like ordering out, someone makes it for you and you get their interpretation of those instructions. </p>
