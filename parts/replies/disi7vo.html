<p>The biggest hurdle the powers that be would have is adding Puerto Rice adds 2 senators and 4 or 5 congressmen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There would be 2 new Senate seats added, but the House is fixed at 435. Going by what was done when Alaska and Hawaii were added, PR  will get one new seat when first admitted (bringing the House temporarily to 436) then in the next Census the House will be reapportioned, returning to 435 with PR probably getting five seats.</p>
<p>And by the way, this would be a perfect time to increase the size of the House via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Rule" target="_blank">Wyoming Rule</a> where the representative-to-population ratio would be the size of the smallest entitled unit, currently Wyoming. This would result in a 545 seat House without PR, or 552 with it. Washington DC should really get a House seat as well, but no Senators since it's not a state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DC does have a congressional delegate, but it's nonvoting. It's pretty ludicrous that a population of 680,000 (greater than two states) gets zero actual representation in federal government aside from the President. It becomes even more ridiculous when you consider that Congress has ultimate control of the District, meaning they can overrule any law passed by the City Council and Mayor. DC residents literally live at the whim of Congress and have no real representation there. Which would be one thing if DC was primarily government buildings/museums/businesses/etc with no significant amount of permanent residents (kind of like Vatican City), but it's not. Over 2/3 of a million people live there.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This could work too, but it should be the whole National Mall area including the Washington Monument, the various memorials, and potentially the Smithsonian museums as well. It would work as long as there are no residences there aside from the White House.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only issue is see with that is Maryland would then be over represented in government, not officially but when most of the staff and workers on Capital Hill are citizens of Maryland their concerns will get to politicians ahead of the concerns of other states.  If my Secretary is worried about something I'll worry about it more then some dude I don't know in California.</p></div>		</li>
