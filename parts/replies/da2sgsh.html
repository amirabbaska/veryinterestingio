<p>Long distances? Kilometres (except in the prairies for the most part, as the farm roads are un-named and on a mile-based grid). </p>
<p>Short lengths? Feet and inches.</p>
<p>Temperature? Depends who you ask. There's a generational gap here, but Weather sources all use Celsius.</p>
<p>Weight? Pounds for sure. Except on your passport and driver's licence, then you're looking at cm for height and kg for weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We compare petrol prices in Pounds per litre but measure fuel economy in miles per gallon but measure CO2 emissions in grams per mile or grams per kilometre. Now THAT one confuses me.</p>
<p>As a scientist in training, it frustrates me when people don't use SI in papers. Imperial is bad, CGS is sometimes worse with obscure units. I know it's just powers of ten different, but I have to sit there and work it out (or give up and use Wolfram Alpha).</p>
<p>The comment about it being too hard to change over is a pretty poor one, because it really isn't that hard to change. If that was the case then older British people wouldn't be able to handle our decimal currency at all. I remember seeing interviews from the early 70s of elderly ladies complaining that 100 pence to the pound and nothing else is &quot;too complicated&quot;. But my parents (who grew up in the 60s) and their parents (who grew up in the 30s) were used to old money then got used to new money eventually. The confusion of changing everything to SI would only last a few years, I would imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Want to know something weird: the US uses ounces and pints and gallons to measure fluids too <em>but ours are different than yours</em>. If you get a pint of beer in the UK, you'll get 568 mL of beer. If you get a pint of something here, it's only 473 mL. In the US, beer is generally sold in bottles that contain 12 fluid ounces, which is only 355 mL or about 5/8ths of a British pint. A gallon of gas in the US is only equal to about 8/10ths of a gallon of petrol in the UK.</p>
<p>But we all use the same words for our measurements. At least our weights are the same. Except for precious metals. Then you guys use Troy ounces and we just use avipodrious ounces (1/16th of a lb).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah I think this is the real reason. The standard is kind of driven by colloquial usage, and the government has no ability to force colloquial usage one way or another. The only real way to convert to the metric system is a concetrated effort to <em>teach</em> and <em>use</em> it by everyone on a day-to-day basis, and then wait a generation. Just not worth the effort, overall. Even doing conceivable things like changing all of the speed limit signs and mile markers would be expensive and confusing for most of the population with no tangible benefit.

<p>When the UK made the switch, they made it illegal for retailers to sell things in customary units.  (I believe that there are a few exceptions, such as selling beer by the pint.)  If you go to the store and all of the things that you used to buy by pound are now sold by the kilogram, you're eventually going to cave and start using the new unit as your colloquial term.</p></div>		</li>

<p>More than that, Customary Units are <em>less</em> arbitrary.  12&quot; to the foot was for divisibility, 5280 feet to the mile seems kind of random... until you consider that it was 1000 (marching) paces.  A league is 3 miles...</p>
<p>Heck, before they were standardized and defined, everything made <em>more</em> sense; a mile along a road would be more kilometers than one through the woods, or over mountains.  </p>
<p>Similarly, a league was always <em>about</em> three miles, but that's because a league defined distance as a function of time; it's not 3 miles because we wanted a unit with numbers that were smaller by a factor of three, but because for long distances, horses and humans <em>both</em> walk at <em>about</em> three miles an hour.</p>
<p>How long would it take you to get to the next town, 62km away?  How about the one 11 leagues?   How many milliliters of coffee fit in a standard mug?  How many cups?</p>
<p>Customary units were meaningful and <em>made sense</em> in a time when high levels of precision didn't really matter.   Because that's the real distinction between the two is which is more important: precision, or usability.  </p>
<p>In the modern world of standardization and interchangeability, obviously, precision is more important, but... even with standardization of weights and measures, there's still something to be said for customary units.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The relationship that you need is that a change in temperature is equal to the heat flow into a system multiplied by its heat capacity, minus any work the system does. Boiling water does no work. There is no universal standard for &quot;room temperature&quot;, but that fact is unrelated to any specific unit system. If the question means to refer to Standard Temperature, Ambient Temperature, or Normal Temperature, or any other specific temperature, then the question can be answered. In SI, US Customary, or any other conceivable unit system, by doing literally the same things in the same order. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The number of feet in a mile, as well as other units such as the acre, were derived from the need to easily divide the unit into 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 equal whole numbers.

<p>No, they're not. If the metric system does one thing right, then it's avoiding arbitrary choices. The meter was originally derived as  from the circumference of Earth, once you have that defined, you can derive the kilogram as the mass of 1/1000th cubic meter of water, and from there you can directly get the Newton and the Joule without any other factors than unity.</p>
<p>You may say that Customary Units are more relatable, and I'll give you that (even though my own feet are more than 10% in error of the standard foot, and even differ by a slight amount...). But if anything, they are <em>not</em> less arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metric units are still plenty arbitrary.</p>
<p>The choice of using the circumference of the earth as a reference point is completely arbitrary. It's not even a particularly <em>useful</em> arbitrary choice - when we're measuring distances, it's pretty rare that what we're interested in is the proportion of the earth's circumference the distance in question constitutes. Relating it to the speed of light makes it arguably even more arbitrary: most of the time we're measuring distances, we're not interested in how many seconds (&quot;the duration of 9192631770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the caesium 133 atom&quot; - not arbitrary at all) it would take light to travel the distance in question.</p>
<p>The kilogram is a weird case. It's still technically defined as the mass of a particular cylinder of platinum/iridium that was supposed to be the mass of one liter of pure water just above the melting point. So that one is...sort of arbitrary? The choice of water is arbitrary, but at least sort of sensible since people are likely to deal with water itself often.</p>
<p>The liter itself is also pretty arbitrary, or was until pretty recently. Earlier, it was defined as the volume of a kilogram of water (as defined by that reference weight) at maximum density and standard pressure. It's better now, but I think one could pretty reasonably argue that &quot;a cube measuring one tenth of that arbitrary proportion of the earth's circumference/speed of light we talked about earlier on each side&quot; is still a pretty arbitrary basis that isn't rooted in most real-world use cases of volume.</p>
<p>The thing the metric system buys you is that the <em>relationship</em> between the different measures is not particularly arbitrary. That's extremely helpful in just about every technical field, but (1) it's not necessarily helpful in everyday life where dimensional analysis is pretty infrequent, and certainly less common a problem than having unit sizes that don't directly correspond to relevant quantities in everyday life or are harder to estimate (2) the actual root basis for the scales is still plenty arbitrary.</p>
<p>(I don't think the customary system does much better these days at providing unit sizes that are less arbitrary and more rooted in everyday use cases though.)</p></div>		</li>
