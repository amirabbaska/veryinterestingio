			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most correct answer. All of these fancy things take a lot of time and can be approximated pretty ok with shortcuts that make them viable in real time. But when you're working in animation software to create a movie, a short film, whatever.... you're generally not looking for an approximated pretty ok result. You spend days, weeks, months creating something and a few hours of render time to produce the result is very little in comparison. There are also lots of options for approximate renders so you can preview the result at less-than-perfect quality, and those options do render in real time or at least very quickly.</p></div>		</li>
