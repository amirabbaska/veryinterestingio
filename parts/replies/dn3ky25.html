<p>All nuclear decay causes loss in mass. Even alpha particle emission converts a small portion of the atoms mass into kinetic energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure.  I'm saying being &quot;burned up&quot; does nothing to destroy a single atom of plutonium.  It can burn to an oxide, it could combine to form new chemicals, but even becoming a plasma does not mean there's any less plutonium around.</p>
<p>Once it emits an alpha (which only happens through spontaneous decay and is unaffected by temperature), the mass converts to a nucleus of U-235,  so the net mass of plutonium is now reduced by one nucleus.</p>
<p>Actually pu-238 has a half-life of only 87 years, it's lost a modest fraction of its plutonium mass in the 19 yrs of its mission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand what you mean, but I wouldn't say impact does <em>nothing</em>. Plutonium-based bombs are implosion based and are driven to criticality by increasing the density. A satellite impact into a planet would certainly generate a similar high density wave in the Pu albeit in a very different geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;impact&quot; in the planet's atmosphere- or surface- won't make any substantial increase in density, even for a moment.  It will tear it apart.  Implosion bombs create a unique situation of being pressed evenly from all directions simultaneously, leaving nowhere for the mass to &quot;squirt out&quot;.</p>
<p>In fact it would &quot;hit&quot; the atmosphere, which is more of an ablation than impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that Cassini will break up in an atmosphere and so my comment doesn't apply to this specific case. </p>
<p>That said it is definitely not true that colliding something moving km/s into another solid will not &quot;make any substantial increase in density&quot;.  Even meteor impacts on Earth, atmosphere included, achieve TPa pressures. </p>
<p>So your comment that impact does nothing to radioactive materials isn't true generally, but rather specifically. </p></div>		</li>
