			<div class="markdown"><p>because you're buying gross pre packaged off the shelf oscar meyer &quot;meat&quot; The actual deli counter meat is the real deal. at least beef and turkey are. I've seen absurdly large chicken breasts on display.  The salamis are sausage, but proscuitto and other stuff is a specific cut of cured meat I believe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hate to break it to you but most deli meat is processed:  mechanically separated then joined together with binders.</p>
<p>Yes Oscar Meyer is nasty, but the other stuff isn't only slightly better. It's all bad for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because it's sliced in front of you, doesn't make it high quality.  I sell pre sliced deli meat that is better quality than a lot of bulk products out there.  I also sell pre sliced deli meat that is exactly how you described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Virtually any deli is going to have the same line up of various meat logs such as turkey logs, ham logs, and beef logs.  Essentially just sausage.  Nicer than oscar Meyer, but not by a lot.  You can find nicer stuff at real delis but plenty of them serve the same logs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, deli sliced chicken or turkey breast is definitely not reconstituted mechanically separated meat. But a lot of what is sold as sliced lunch meat in grocery stores is sectioned/formed meats, or sausage. Those lunch meats you are referring to which are slimy are so because they are a heat coagulated emulsion of animal proteins and fat. There is no connective tissue giving the meat product structure.</p>
<p>You'd probably want thin sliced turkey breast if you want a toothsome yet easy to eat sandwich that has the strongest turkey flavor. One common store brand that produces thin sliced turkey breast is Columbus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whole Foods sells store roasted turkey at their deli counter.</p>
<p>I figured it would be awesome but it's much more like Thanksgiving turkey and needs salt and mayo to even be edible.</p>
<p>Even compared to Boar's Head.</p></div>		</li>
