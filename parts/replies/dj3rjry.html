			<div class="markdown"><p>I was listening to a news report on NPR not long ago that described the after effects of a Corpus Collasotomy. Her left arm would, seemingly at random, take on a &quot;mind of its own&quot; and would strike herself, at times hard enough to bruise, completely outside of her own control. It's called Alien Hand Syndrome.</p>
<p>I think anecdotally, it was due to the surgery causing her hand to lash out when she did something she considered to be &quot;immoral,&quot; smoking cigarettes, swearing, etc. She noticed when she changed that behavior the reactions stopped.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not totally true. </p>
<p>There are localized areas of the brain that exclusively and entirely do specific functions. Wernicke's Area comes to mind - it is responsible for speech interpretation.</p>
<p>If a patient has a stroke in this particular region, they will not be able to understand speech, but they will be able to generate speech. As a result, the words they speak sound very natural, with normal syntax and rhythm, but have no meaning. Suffers of Wernicke's Aphasia (this condition) babble nonsensically, in proper-sounding English (or whatever language they speak).</p>
<p>This is one example of highly specialized brain areas - but you are right that those who undergo corpus callostomy live fairly normal lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely. The thing about gender (and racial) studies is that nobody wants to fund them. (proper research is really expensive, many factors to acount, so you need massive samples) So we dont really know much about what makes women and men different. I personally dont think that women are more creative than men, women usually express and understand feelings better than men, but men can also be very creative, i mean, as an example 95% of programmers are men.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always been of the understanding that this is mainly because men and women tend to be socialized differently and raised differently as children. I don't know the extent to which that's true, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is correct. The brains of women and men are definitely different, but both sexes use all portions of their brains more-or-less equally.</p></div>		</li>
