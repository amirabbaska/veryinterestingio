			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s a tough question, because there have been a lot of great discoveries recently, and they are all important to one area of paleontology or another. This might be an odd answer, but I think Pappochelys is a very important find:</p>

<p>Figuring out where turtles fit in the tree of life has been a longstanding issue in paleontology. Between the skeletal features related to their shells and some odd features in their skulls, this group has been the source of a lot of argument. The discovery of Pappochelys is going a long way to settle many of the differences between what fossils and DNA have been telling us. It’s an impressive, important fossil.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Small question - is it fair to say that in such a dispute between morphological and molecular data, that one should lean towards the latter?  My thinking is that convergent evolution can always explain the former.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always. Part of the problem with turtles is that they broke away from other living groups a long, long time ago. Even molecular analysis can sometimes be lead astray by what we call long-branch attraction. Basically, two groups might get artificially pulled together in an analysis because they are both so very different from everyone else in the matrix. There are ways to combat this (including fossils is one), but also remember that not even all molecular datasets agree with one another. I'm happiest when we can look at both datasets, together and separately, so we can focus more on those points of difference.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We only just figured out that it isn't, but that was another longstanding point of confusion. The whole limb girdle tilted forward, and then the shell grew out over that, but the ribs are still behind.  Here's a cool video animating the process:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a non paleontologist I'd say the new findings on spinosaurus. It's the first time a dinosaur has been shown to live at least a semi-aquatic life style. Most dinosaurs were on land,  some small carnivores had taken to the air,  but none had been aquatic.  </p>
<p>Additionally it is a big famous dinosaur,  so finding out that there was so much we didn't know opens a lot of room for questions about other species. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would take the new findings on Spinosaurus with a grain of salt. Unfortunately the new reconstruction is based on multiple individuals (maybe from different species), some from localities hundreds of miles apart. Within our field many of us seriously doubt that this reconstruction will stand for long. You can find an excellent summary here: <a href="http://www.skeletaldrawing.com/home/there-may-be-more-fishiness-in-spinosaurus9132014?rq=spinosaurus" target="_blank">http://www.skeletaldrawing.com/home/there-may-be-more-fishiness-in-spinosaurus9132014?rq=spinosaurus</a></p>
