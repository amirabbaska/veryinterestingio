			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I had a source for this, but I remember reading an article about how the top Singaporean educational brass said, &quot;We're falling behind because our students don't know how to think creatively. Go study Western educational models and import them here.&quot; So they did and when they tried to institute it it was very rote - teachers saying, &quot;OK, class, now we're going to be creative this period&quot; and students just copying exactly what the teacher did for their creativity grade.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to teach English in Japan. In my experience there is a lot of emphasis placed on <em>passing tests</em>. Less so on actually learning the information and being able to apply it to the world around you. It's my understanding other east Asian countries are similar. Japanese culture, especially, is very focused on the method vs the result. So if you happen to be a kid that doesn't learn well the way the particular subject happens to be taught your kind of screwed.</p>
<p>Anyway, that was my experience of it. They study their assess off for entrance exams, how much of the knowledge they retain and are able to use in life I'm not really sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds a lot like the American education method. If I had learned that school and education were actually for my own benefit and could be engaging, deeply satisfying things, I probably would've really enjoyed it, but instead I was just given the moral imperative of &quot;it's good, just do it,&quot; and never knew it could be anything more than that. Luckily I was a slacker and found the internet, which turned me on to self-learning and whatnot and now I really enjoy educating myself. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This all being said, I wonder if perhaps you could reverse your question to read: 'If most of the best universities in the world are in the UK and the USA, why do we think Asian countries value education more highly?' Every time I see a news story discussing the high value of education in Asia, it focusses on parental spending or hours spent studying. I'm not sure if this kind of measurement actually has a connection to what universities do and, in the case of over-studying, may actually be bad...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you've highlighted a very important point. Studying, to most people, means &quot;parents forcing kids to prepare for the future&quot;. But historically this only has a tangential relationship to learning! Hunter-gatherers probably force their kids to prepare for the future by doing rain dances to propitiate the gods. Primitive farmers force their kids to dig canals and milk cows. This kind of intergenerational control and planning can fight against education, it can encourage education, or it can <em>corrupt</em> education.</p>
<p>The unique thing in the Western world is the value that has been historically placed on free thought and the spread of ideas. China may have a very strong tradition of parents controlling their children, but they also have an equally long tradition of &quot;burning books and burying scholars&quot;. There is a strong tradition, both in the Chinese cultural sphere and in the Middle East, of persecuting infidels and apostates, and as a result many people who were willing to pursue knowledge tried to do so clandestinely and unobtrusively.</p>
<p>The historical situation in South Asia, I'm less familiar with. I know there were bitter religious disputes and many destroyed research centers; and even in the present day, there is a high degree of censorship (for example the book <em>The Hindus</em>, the main historical account of Hinduism in the rest of the world, was pulped there).</p>
<p>In the West there has been, despite anything, a pretty strong tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of thought. This may go back to the historical liberties of Greek and Roman citizens; the apostolic glorification of martyrdom in the same of telling the truth; the religious disunity of Europe, which led both to lots of wars and lots of appreciation of the benefits of toleration; and the political disunity, which made princes happy to snap up brilliant foreigners who were gagged by their own people.</p>
<p>So ultimately the reason why European universities are so respected is precisely because they <em>weren't</em> tailored to meet the economic interests of students' parents. They were focused on the pure pursuit of knowledge as a way of life. Collectively they have known more years of freedom of thought than any other educational system on earth, most countries have made their greatest contributions when their universities had the greatest freedom, and anglophone universities have produced the best research largely because their professors have suffered the least political interference.</p></div>		</li>
