			<p>I have a related question and maybe you are one who could answer it. Could there have ever been a deeper ocean trench than the Mariana's trench? What is the theoretical limit on how deep an ocean trench could be?</p>		</li>

			<p>This might be a bit simple, but I would imagine it have to depend on the angle of subduction due to resistance of the overriding plate, plus the depth at which the plate melts. I could ask one of my professors about this if you are interested?<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Subduction will not be an issue as the plates will be moving apart. Trenches such as the Mariana trench, plates moving away from each other at the bottom of the sea, will be deeper than the trenches at subduction zones. </p>		</li>

			<p>You're totally wrong here. In the Mariana trench, the Pacific plate is being subducted under the Mariana plate. If they were pulling apart, magma would come up and there would be an underwater mountain range there, much like the mid-Atlantic range.</p>		</li>

			<p>Theres a lot to take into account with subduction zones, and I don't want to get into it for fear of messing it up. So here's a paper that my professor gave us in 2nd year geophysics: <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/~rjstern/pdfs/SubductionZonesRoG.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.utdallas.edu/~rjstern/pdfs/SubductionZonesRoG.pdf</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Okay, follow-up question that I've asked /r/geology without a satisfactory answer.  <br><br>In Colorado, there are zero mountains above 14,500', but there are around a thousand between 13,000' and 14,500'.  That seems like a very abrupt cutoff considering the different ranges and peaks have very different orogenies, from the relatively recent Sangre de Cristos (~5 million years old) to other peaks of the Laramide Orogeny (~80 million years ago).  <br><br>Any guesses as to which of the factors you list are most at play? </p>		</li>

			<p>The short answer is no. The Rockies, and many other generally inactive, yet rugged mountain ranges are weird. The origin of the high topography of the Rockies has been variably attributed to a purely isostatic response to erosion related to the destruction of the orogenic plateau (likely similar to the modern day Tibetan plateau) that once existed to the west of the Rockies, uplift driven by some sort of deeper dynamic processes (mantle upwelling, etc), magmatic inflation, large variability in rock strengths/resistance to erosion, large climatic changes, or some combination of all or mixtures of those factors. As for the exact control on peak height, I don't have a good answer. I've never seen any papers on glacial activity being a driving factor behind the elevations within the Rockies, but that doesn't mean it didn't potentially play a role (I work on primarily, young active mountain ranges, so the Rockies and similar, old and mostly dead mountain ranges, while interesting, are a bit more out of my expertise). </p>		</li>

			<p>So is it fair, as a layman, to understand that geologists don't precisely know why the rockies exist?  That was something I'd roughly taken away from my undergrad geology classes.<br><br>Also, given that the Sangres are (according to wikipedia at least) only 5 million years old, are they not considered a young range?  <br><br>Anyway, all this stuff is really cool to me, and I regret not continuing my path into geology.  </p>		</li>

			<p>It is fair to say that <em>this</em> geologist doesn't really know if the community has settled on a single cause for the maintenance of the high topography of the Rockies. We know a great deal about the original deformation events which created the Rockies (e.g. the Laramide orogeny), but the most recent event was ~80 million years ago, so the continued presence of high topography is an interesting issue. Doing some quick poking around on the Sangre de Cristos, the current manifestation of them appear to be related to extensional faulting, while the rocks exposed in the core of the range mostly record the history of convergent deformation that is largely responsible for the rest of the Rockies. So, their youngness is related to this relatively more recent extensional deformation.<br><br>Like any science, geology is relatively specialized. I have spent the better part of ten years studying active convergent deformation in eastern europe / central asia so asking me in depth questions about old deformation in the western u.s. and the topography associated with it is a little like going to an ear nose and throat doctor and asking them to listen to your heart. I can provide some info because of general training and keeping up on literature that seems interesting, and I probably could provide a detailed answer but it would require a lot more reading and digging than I currently have the time for, but ultimately, my inability to diagnose your problem should not be misconstrued as the inability of the proper specialist to do so.</p>		</li>

			<p>Do we know what the max altitude of the Rockies were? I do a lot of climbing there, I'm just wondering if like 50m years ago was this mountain a 1000m higher?</p>		</li>

			<p>I wish I'd read your comment first, or at least before I commented on that other thread! This makes a lot of sense. As a structural engineer, the isostasy limit seems to be analogous, at least in some ways, to a foundation sitting on a weak clayey soil. The main factors that would come into play would be the flexural strength and rigidity of the &quot;foundation&quot;, the elasticity of the layers underneath (analogous to the clay), and the size and shape of the mountain range.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for your informative response.  I wanted to find out more about the &quot;glacial buzzsaw&quot; and among other things I found <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2010/09/16/new-findings-cut-through-glacial-buzzsaw-theory" target="_blank">this news article</a> (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v467/n7313/abs/nature09365.html" target="_blank">Nature paper</a>), which seems to show that in at least one area on Earth (the Patagonian Andes), glaciers can actually help a mountain grow rather than limit its height. <br><br>What do you think?</p>		</li>

			<p>It is certainly an interesting idea and they have some relatively compelling evidence to support their hypothesis. Intuitively it also makes a fair bit of sense. The key issue comes down to the extent to which a glacier moves/flows. Unsurprisingly, for a glacier to erode it needs to move with respect to the rocks it overlies, a completely static glacier won't really erode much. The internal dynamics of a glacier depends on the climate of the region in which it is formed, so basically, if an area is cold enough throughout the year so as to keep the glacier(s) mostly immobile, than a glacier ceases to be an efficient erosion mechanism. The presence of the glacier (and the climate necessary to maintain it) also means you don't really have erosion by rivers, which is the usual workhorse for eroding mountains, so you now have high topography which is essentially being protected by the glaciers. <br><br>While Thomson et al present a lot of convincing evidence for the Patagonian Andes, I think the big question is how common is this scenario in the geologic record and what are the conditions necessary to develop this situation. Similar high latitude and tectonically active areas still appear to be heavily influenced by glacial activity (a case example is the St. Elias range in Alaska) so there needs to be some combination of latitute, altitude, and local climate dynamics that conspire to make glaciers a constructive force in terms of topography. <br><br>TL;DR - Convincing argument for this particular region, but likely the exception rather than the rule.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I thought that the mountains that once made up the range that is now the Appalachians was significantly taller than everest? Any truth to this? </p>		</li>
