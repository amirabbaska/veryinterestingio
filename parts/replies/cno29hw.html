			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a related question and maybe you are one who could answer it. Could there have ever been a deeper ocean trench than the Mariana's trench? What is the theoretical limit on how deep an ocean trench could be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might be a bit simple, but I would imagine it have to depend on the angle of subduction due to resistance of the overriding plate, plus the depth at which the plate melts. I could ask one of my professors about this if you are interested?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Subduction will not be an issue as the plates will be moving apart. Trenches such as the Mariana trench, plates moving away from each other at the bottom of the sea, will be deeper than the trenches at subduction zones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theres a lot to take into account with subduction zones, and I don't want to get into it for fear of messing it up. So here's a paper that my professor gave us in 2nd year geophysics: <a href="https://www.utdallas.edu/~rjstern/pdfs/SubductionZonesRoG.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.utdallas.edu/~rjstern/pdfs/SubductionZonesRoG.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, follow-up question that I've asked /r/geology without a satisfactory answer.  </p>
<p>In Colorado, there are zero mountains above 14,500', but there are around a thousand between 13,000' and 14,500'.  That seems like a very abrupt cutoff considering the different ranges and peaks have very different orogenies, from the relatively recent Sangre de Cristos (~5 million years old) to other peaks of the Laramide Orogeny (~80 million years ago).  </p>
<p>Any guesses as to which of the factors you list are most at play? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no. The Rockies, and many other generally inactive, yet rugged mountain ranges are weird. The origin of the high topography of the Rockies has been variably attributed to a purely isostatic response to erosion related to the destruction of the orogenic plateau (likely similar to the modern day Tibetan plateau) that once existed to the west of the Rockies, uplift driven by some sort of deeper dynamic processes (mantle upwelling, etc), magmatic inflation, large variability in rock strengths/resistance to erosion, large climatic changes, or some combination of all or mixtures of those factors. As for the exact control on peak height, I don't have a good answer. I've never seen any papers on glacial activity being a driving factor behind the elevations within the Rockies, but that doesn't mean it didn't potentially play a role (I work on primarily, young active mountain ranges, so the Rockies and similar, old and mostly dead mountain ranges, while interesting, are a bit more out of my expertise). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it fair, as a layman, to understand that geologists don't precisely know why the rockies exist?  That was something I'd roughly taken away from my undergrad geology classes.</p>
<p>Also, given that the Sangres are (according to wikipedia at least) only 5 million years old, are they not considered a young range?  </p>
<p>Anyway, all this stuff is really cool to me, and I regret not continuing my path into geology.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do we know what the max altitude of the Rockies were? I do a lot of climbing there, I'm just wondering if like 50m years ago was this mountain a 1000m higher?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I'd read your comment first, or at least before I commented on that other thread! This makes a lot of sense. As a structural engineer, the isostasy limit seems to be analogous, at least in some ways, to a foundation sitting on a weak clayey soil. The main factors that would come into play would be the flexural strength and rigidity of the &quot;foundation&quot;, the elasticity of the layers underneath (analogous to the clay), and the size and shape of the mountain range.</p></div>		</li>
