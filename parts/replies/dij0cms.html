			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same answer I received when asking my friends to describe MDMA. They just couldn't. I'd ask what drug they could compare it to. They couldn't name one. Then I tried it and fully understood what they meant. Now I'll have people ask me those questions and I can't for the life of me do it justice by spitting words. It's just a...feeling. You'll know when you feel it and that's really the only way you'll ever understand. I know it's argued whether or not MDMA is a psychedelic itself but you still get that magic feeling you can't explain. I wouldn't say ego death though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, the feeling of MDMA can be pretty accurately replicated without drugs. I've felt very similar after intense meditation retreats, or religious camps when I was a teen. The feeling of love for everyone and everything can be cultivated sober. It may not endure as long, but you can pull it up. </p>
<p>I can't say the same for LSD. No amount of meditation has unlocked my thought process that way, at least so far. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine. I've never personally taken LSD although I've been exposed to it many times through my friends where I've been a tripsitter. I suppose meditation can very much replicate some of those feelings from MDMA. Would you say the same for a pretty high dose of it though? I just like the idea that MDMA can give it to you all at once and in such a short time frame.</p></div>		</li>
