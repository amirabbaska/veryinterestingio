			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it does help. I have ADHD as well, I find that sleeping around 6-7 hours at night and going for a just under 2 hour nap in the afternoon works pretty well if my work roster allows for it. You just have to work out what length of nap works well for you because of the sleep inertia thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except with Polyphasic sleep you can become a virtual narcoleptic.  When I was sleeping twice a day (3-4 hr stretches) it got to a point where I'd often start to nod off at work or while driving, particularly if I hadn't slept well.  A short 1-2hr nap to refresh after dinner followed by a long sleep has worked out much better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah..</p>
<p>I was pretty much on call for a taxi service for a year and got used to sleeping in 3-4 hour bursts.</p>
<p>2 years later I still go to sleep at 11-12 and wake up at 5 unable to go back to sleep frequently :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really what's referred to today as polyphasic sleep, though. Today the term is typically used to describe a sleep schedule where a person sleeps less at night and then breaks the rest of the day up evenly. What's described in that article is sleeping for 3-4 hours, being up for 1-2 hours, then sleeping for 3-4 hours again. You're still sleeping for the recommended 7-9 hours with a short break in the middle unlike modern polyphasic sleep where the goal is to sleep for fewer total hours and spread them over the day.</p></div>		</li>
