			<div class="markdown"><p>During orgasm, an individual will experience an increase in chemicals in the brain known as &quot;Endorphins&quot;. These chemicals are the body's natural morphine. The body can also produce endorphins in response to intense physical exercise. Endorphin release varies from person to person, as do its effects. A &quot;runners high&quot; (second wind) is attributed to endorphin release: it numbs the feeling of being tired. Too much Endorphin release typically causes heroin like affects on the brain. If you feel awake after an orgasm, it's likely due to your body not producing enough endorphins or your body is disposed to respond atypically to the endorphins. Hence the &quot;runners high&quot; feeling (energized) after sex. <a href="http://www.everydayhealth.com/endorphins/guide/" target="_blank">http://www.everydayhealth.com/endorphins/guide/</a></p>
