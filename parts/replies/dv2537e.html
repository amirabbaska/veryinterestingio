			<div class="markdown"><p>Bleach <em>will</em> kill Clostridium difficile</p>
<p>It's endospores <em>may</em> survive such a treatment, it's very effective against them, but the 99,9% figure doesn't apply. There's also the problem that bleach can't (at least, shouldn't) be topically used. Prevention and good practices remain the best defense against endospores.  </p>
<p>However, the amount of C. difficile endospores that survive bleaching are low enough that your immune system should handle the rest in all but the most immunodepressed cases, your supervisor is right</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A little bit of both. C. Diff is gram positive and an obligate anarobe, so it dies when exposed to air and is pretty easy to kill. The SPORES however take a long time to kill in bleach so if you aren’t careful some may survive. Autoclaving is the most popular method to sterilize non temperature and non pressure sensitive equipment because it uses steam above 100 centigrade and pressure of over 15 psi above atmosphere</p>
<p>OP just asked for some kinds of germs that wouldn’t necessarily be killed after a dip in bleach (or that was my interpretation) not a full technical answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used bleach and dispatch (stabilized bleach) to kill sporulated bacteria in our lab. The procedure still called for a 30 minute treatment to ensure the bacteria died. I'm not aware of anything that will instantly kill sporulated bacteria. </p></div>		</li>
