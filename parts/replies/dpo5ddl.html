			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked at JPL as an intern 2 or 3 years ago and was about to mention MSL and M2020. An important thing to note is that hardware/software changes come from lessons learned during the first iteration. Just because it was successful the first time doesn't mean there aren't improvement to be made (looking at you MSL wheels)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually a stress analyst at my current job and I save loads of time from combing through old reports to see what the other engineers considered critical areas. Also, knowing areas of failure despite high factors of safety are also important. This is why engineers are pack rats!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For interplanetary stuff, NASA uses the Deep Space Network (DSN) which is basically a network of antennas strategically placed around the world so that spacecraft are always in the field of view of the network. Communication is scheduled so that various missions can communicate back to earth in their designated timeslots. </p>
<p>You can get more details and some diagrams etc here:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely software in general. There is a lot of software that's been tweaked and reused for decades. Especially for stuff like GNC and communications that don't change a whole lot in needs and functions from mission to mission. </p>
<p>Hardware wise, they use a lot of the same rugged boards and busses that are way older than you'd expect. I was always amazed that with how much our computing capabilities have grown, we still used 10-15 year old cpu boards and busses and stuff. </p>
<p>But when you consider that they have a dozen+ missions with that hardware reliably being blasted into the vacuum of space and performing it's vital functions for mission critical systems, often far exceeding mission success criteria, it starts to make sense!</p></div>		</li>
