			<div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to this, this release in neurotransmitters happens because of natural selection, in that the majority of people who weren't predisposed to this chemical reaction generally mistreated thier babies to the point of them dying. People who were naturally born with a sense of protection over their offspring kept them healthy and safe enough so that this &quot;feature&quot; could be passed down to future generations, reinforcing it over the course of human evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is (as far as we know) a good theory, but I'd like to clarify Jonny's answer a bit and say &quot;neurotransmitters like oxytocin, which <em>are</em> released...&quot;.  I don't think he was doing this, but in general people tend to ascribe far too much to oxytocin: it's the cocktail of chemicals that makes us act the way we do, not any one specific neurotransmitter (most of which are used for a variety of purposes).</p>

<p>Because human babies are practically fetuses compared to most other mammals. Other mammals birth what would be toddlers to us.</p>
<p>One (speculated) reasons for this is that our heads/brains grow too big, so we need to exit the womb earlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard it was largely impacted by humans walking upright, so hips became narrower and now are not wide enough, so the babies have to be born smaller.</p>
<p>I don't remember where I heard this from though... Just sounds logical to me.</p></div>		</li>
