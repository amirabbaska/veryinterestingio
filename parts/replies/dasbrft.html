<p>Hardly a reliable citation but it's something. I mean in comparison to other primates we have a bit more yeah. Orangutans are at about 17% bodyfat while hunter gatherer humans are around 13%+- like 4or 5%. Gorillas are at about 8% for males and the rest of the primates are lower.</p>
<p>Yeah we have some extra fat storage over most of our primate cousins but it shouldn't be as much as many people are carrying around today!</p></div>		</li>
