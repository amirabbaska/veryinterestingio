			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called placental abruption and I had one during my son's birth. I was induced so I was already in the hospital. The obstetrician told me if we hadn't been literally feet from an operating room that my son would have died and I probably would have bled to death.</p>
<p>The neonatologists told us there was a high probability of physical and mental handicaps. We basically had to wait and see because they didn't know how long he had actually been without oxygen.</p>
<p>He just turned two and is a normal, smart, active little boy with no long-term effects. We were lucky, most cases like ours don't end up so well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to say. Always depends how long the person has been without air; in this case: how long was the kid already dead in the womb.      The doc (neonatal specialist) who came with us said it could be anything from &quot;gonna be a Nobel price winner&quot; to &quot;only mashed potatoes&quot; (though it's more likely on the somewhat to heavily damaged side of the spectrum).<br />
On the other hand: They had a similar case two years ago. Kid turned out okay and the mom regularly sends pictures. Admittedly, everyone was surprised there was such a positive development. </p></div>		</li>
