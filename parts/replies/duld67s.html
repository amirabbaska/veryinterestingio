			<div class="markdown"><p>In most cases it's not efficient to have more than two threads per core. To go on with the paint analogy: instead of one octopus switching between different colors for each of his arms, it's often more efficient to just use multiple humans with each their own color. The octopus would need all paint buckets with him and can only paint one place of the room, whereas each human could just take his bucket and walk around wherever that color is needed. </p></div>		</li>
