			<div class="markdown"><p>That's NOT so obviously true. Consider that whales are capable of diving rather deeply, and their ribcage has to have the strength not to be crushed by water pressure at depth. Now, some of that strength can be held by bones, but there must be some pretty powerful musculature to make it work, considering that there must be rib muscles and diaphragm muscles in order to inhale and exhale - it cannot be simply a rigid container.</p></div>		</li>
