			<div class="markdown"><p>By far not as spectacular as the Taiwanese one, but I once visited a similar place in the US: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_Flame_Falls" target="_blank"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal\_Flame\_Falls" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal\_Flame\_Falls</a></a></p>
<p>But according to wikipedia, it is not naturally lit.</p>
<p>I am sure there are many similar places around, but the one in Taiwan looks huge!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also a place called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1FvsMOX8iA" target="_blank">Darvaza Gas Crater</a> (AKA The Door to Hell) in Turkmenistan. It's partially man made, in the sense that they lit the collapsed crater in a natural gas field on fire initially to control burn off, but it's been burning since 1971.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Turkey, in the region of Olympos, Antalya, there is a place called Chimera (Yanarta≈ü, which literally means Burning Stone). You can see the same occurences here. And there are multiple mythologic stories about this place if you are curious to dig it.</p>
<p>Here is a photo I found by googling...
