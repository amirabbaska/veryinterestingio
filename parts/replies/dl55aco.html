			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if the part about less oxygen able to absorb into the ocean is true. From what I've learned, the amount of gas absorbed into a liquid is directly related to the partial pressure of the gas above the liquid and the surface area of the exposure. More CO2 is being absorbed by the ocean because we're increasing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. I guess now that I think about it, that could have an effect on the oxygen being absorbed but it's been a while since I've worked with Henry and Raoult's laws</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Henry's law states that the partial pressure of gas are proportional to the amount absorbed at a particular (i.e unchanging) temperature. When the temperature changes, you also have to take into account the dynamic equilibrium between the gas and liquid phases. Higher temperatures shift the equilibrium towards the gas phase (thermodynamics as well as Le Ch√¢tliers principle)</p></div>		</li>
