			<div class="markdown"><p>they also may ban people previously already detected hacking in waves, because then it's almost impossible for the hacker to know what action he did caused him to get detected. </p>
<p>let's use the example of team fortress 2 and valve, since i'm pretty experienced with the game and its anti-cheat system.</p>
<p>if a person uses lmaobox <em>(a well-known tf2 hacking program)</em> on tf2, and gets banned by VAC <em>(valve anti-cheat, an automatic cheat detector for games)</em> right after he activates his <em>&quot;see through walls&quot;</em> hack, then he will be aware that specific hack is detectable by VAC.</p>
<p>he then may potentially report this to the developers of lmaobox, or will just make a new steam account and continue hacking, just while refraining from activating the detectable hack.</p>
<p>but, since valve intentionally delays the VAC ban from a couple hours to a couple days, the detected hack will not be known to the hacker, and he can't report it to the hack maker or continue hacking safely.</p>
<p>they will detect that someone has used a hack on the game, but not ban him. they will wait for a very large amount of hackers to be detected and marked, and then all in one day they will ban potentially thousands to a million hackers at once; all without any of them having a clue what got them caught.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense, but what if someone uses just one hack, meaning that no matter the ban delay the user will know what hack is detectible anyway?</p></div>		</li>

<p>When the problem goes public then they have to deal with it, resulting in a large number of vans.</p></div>		</li>
