			<div class="markdown"><p>The bear mortality rate is rather impressive, but does seem to make sense as well.  Because bears are typically on the tops of the respective food chains, predaation is a non-issue for hibernation.  Bears also have regulated and more strict hunting seasons, so human predation during their hibernation period is also a non-issue.  Furthermore there are no known diseases that have a heavy impact on bear hibernation.  All of this, coupled with the fact that bears become so freakin' anal about eating leading up to their nap, I can see why they don't have much of a mortality risk during their sleepy time.  Bears absolutely gorge themselves on food leading up to hibernation.  They just eat and eat and eat and eat, getting sooooo fat for it.  The only starvation risk they would have for hibernation would be if food was scarce leading up to it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Outside of this, some bears exhibit alterations in skeletal muscle protein balance during winter anorexia. Lohuis et al. did a study that concluded that bears appear to retain muscle integrity throughout winter dormancy, despite the obvious risks for skeletal muscle atrophy and protein loss. <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S109649590700053X" target="_blank">Source</a>. Tinker et al. did a study prior to the Lohuis study that concluded that, while lactating females do use some protein in conjunction with fat catabolism, the protein use is moderate. <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/515429?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">Source</a>. In all, bears exhibit unique physiological hibernation strategies that many other hibernating species do not and this contributes to their successful wintering. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember studying this back in grad school. Bears' cells when they enter hibernation elicit a very strange anti-inflammatory/healing molecular pathway. Point being: a bear that enters hibernation with nasty wounds will heal without having any scars (which would occur if they weren't hibernating)</p>
<p>This same pathway(s) protect the bear from muscular dystrophy and muscle loss. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Driving up for skiing in West Virginia a few year ago for an over new years long weekend, we saw a cabin with five! count'em five dead bears hanging up from tree limb. Kind of freaked out because at first they looked like human bodies hanging from nooses.  I guess the hunter was bleeding them out and cleaning the offal out of the carcasses; but my thought was &quot;It's the middle of winter, wouldn't those bears have been hibernating?&quot;. Is it legal to hunt and kill a hibernating bear?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk the hibernation schedule, but according to this quick google search: <a href="http://www.wvdnr.gov/Regulations/hunting_hrBearArchFire.shtm" target="_blank">http://www.wvdnr.gov/Regulations/hunting_hrBearArchFire.shtm</a>  West Virginia has a split bear hunting season from September- November, and December 8-31.  I didn't read any rules regarding killing a hibernating bear, but that sounds utterly pointless/ bad sport.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Figured I could chime in for some insects: while I have no figures sitting with me (because I'm actually at a field station conducting summer bumblebee research!) and the data is sparse, it's worth stating that insect mortality during periods of diapause can sometimes be very high. However, it's hard to say as it's extremely difficult to monitor these species naturally while &quot;hibernating&quot;. </p>
<p>For bumblebees and other bees that undergo some type of diapause (most), overwinter mortality is based off of fat content and temperature swings. People expect it is very high mortality, but afaik, there's no direct data on this. </p>
<p>What is my point in telling you there's basically no data for these species? I guess I'm trying to say for most species (since insects, you know), the data is not there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how knowledgeable you are about it, but does the mortality rate of hibernation follow the trends of a species' reproductive strategy?</p>
<p>ie R strategists would tend to hive higher mortality rates while K strategists would have lower mortality rates?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>R strategists reproduce quickly, tend to have a high infant mortality, and reach sexual maturity quickly. The classic example of this strategy would be rabbits.</p>
<p>K strategists are the opposite; they reproduce slowly, tend to have low infant mortality, and have a long period before reaching sexual maturity. These animals also tend to be large. Humans are a great example of K strategy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine that hibernation is more or less reserved for K strategists as they have the lifespans to fit in hibernation but I would also like to know if this applies to pioneer species or not as they are pretty much all r strategists.

</blockquote>
<p>I would argue that diapause is a form of hibernation. At least, they are both more extreme than mere torpor.  Mosquitos often go through a diapause to survive winter as larvae, and they are most definitely on the r end of the k-r continuum.</p></div>		</li>
