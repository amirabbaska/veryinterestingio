			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm also a scientist and this is all exceptionally well said. I will add that some road blocks are insurmountable for other financial reasons. Take for instance human oxytocin studies for autistic children. </p>
<p>We had a test years ago that showed results, so everyone obviously wants to move forward to the next stage of testing. That's when the logistics set in and we try to come up with the best way to do this. get the approval, Find the subjects, source the drug, in that order. </p>
<p>We had to bring 100's of autistic children to several sites across the United States and begin preliminary interviews. Some met the criteria (were willing to not start any other alternative treatments, not commit to any new novel ABA, etc.. </p>
<p>Then we go about sourcing the Oxytocin. Well because of a small initial success with a 6 subject sample, the drug companies suddenly all want to patent Oxytocin for autism (keep in mind this is a very common drug known widely as Pitocin and is used to induce labor).</p>
<p>Because of this reach for money we were held up for 2 years before we could even source the drug. Guess what happened to the poor kids and families of said kids on the spectrum. Their lives changed and were no longer available for a 6 month hiatus from their lives.</p>
<p>So the interviews had to start again. This is an extreme example, but one I was involved in and this is just one small instance of many many hold ups we endured after initial testing and a huge press release about how great Oxytocin would be for Autism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemical Engineer here. If a drug gets through the testing mentioned and gets the funding it deserves, it then has to be massed produced. Chemists, or discoverers, of a drug typically do so on a small scale in labs. They collect data about the reactions, the mechanisms, and a list of byproducts that have been created while trying to synthesize a particular compound. Chemical engineers must then take that data, and us it to scale up production. Scaling up may not be cost effective for a many different reasons, but a great/life saving drug may not be cost effective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemical / Automation Engineer here, work in Biotech industry. </p>
<p>Not only does the technology developed in the lab need to be scaled up (tech transfer), it needs to be automated to be made efficiently.  Just because a process has been scaled up does not mean it will be produced efficiently. If the production system is poorly thought out or implemented, you risk product quality, yield, time, what all ultimately means more money. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Reproducibility in science is not very sexy. Because our scientific culture generally rewards innovation over cautiousness, replicating a study conducted by others will not get a researcher a publication in a high-end journal, a splashy headline in a newspaper, or a large funding grant from the government. Only an estimated <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/reproduce-or-bust-bringing-reproducibility-back-to-center-stage/" target="_blank">0.15% of all published results are direct replications of previous studies.</a>&quot;</p>

<li>Back in the 1960s, a sugar industry executive wrote fat checks to a group of Harvard researchers so that they’d downplay the links between sugar and heart disease in a prominent medical journal—and the researchers did it, according to historical documents reported in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine.
One of those Harvard researchers went on to become the head of nutrition at the United States Department of Agriculture, where he set the stage for the federal government’s current dietary guidelines. <a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/sugar-industry-bought-off-scientists-skewed-dietary-guidelines-for-decades/" target="_blank">All in all, the corrupted researchers and skewed scientific literature successfully helped draw attention away from the health risks of sweets and shift the blame solely to fats—for nearly five decades. The low-fat, high-sugar diets that health experts subsequently encouraged are now seen as a main driver of the current obesity epidemic.</a> </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a major problem that expands beyond the scope of just academia but also into industry.</p>
<p>Most biotech companies' R&amp;D staff rely on existing research and published papers to serve as foundation of the commercial products and tools that are being sold to the academic researchers. No companies out there would research stuff from scratch obviously. So when I have my scientists spend countless hours trying to develop a project and unable to reproduce assays described from a paper, and then trying to tweak this and that, only to waste 3-6 months of precious time... you can be sure that if and when we do finally have a successful product, we need to factor those costs into the price.</p>
<p>So to have academic scientists complaining that a $500 commercial assay kit is &quot;too expensive&quot; and asking for 40% level discounts, and then throwing a fit when rejected, is quite naive. Now you know why...so please ensure your papers are reproducible because otherwise you'd be just shooting yourself (and your fellow scientists) in the foot in more ways than one.</p>
<p>And let's be real here, to have a feasible commercially viable product that actually functions is R&amp;D'd at a way higher stringency than just trying to reproduce something in a lab setting for the purpose of putting out a publication. So to have academic papers that are full of BS really gets to me, especially when we cannot get a functional product within deadline due to being misled by a questionable paper. This means it affects our anticipated cashflow, and increases risk of retaining employees simply due to the fact we spend so much money and time on a dead-end research. The livelihood of many people really depend on papers with integrity.</p>
<p>EDIT: This is also a reason why some crappy small biotech companies have useless or non-working products. They have little to no R&amp;D, and they develop an assay based on a unreproducible paper with little to no QC or reproducibility check. Then they wait until customer feedback is provided for them to either fix, improve, or discontinue the product, in order to save initial R&amp;D costs because wading through a sea of unreproducible papers and verifying them in a commercially viable setting is VERY COSTLY.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way my lab dealt with this was to have the undergrad (me) replicate everything.  I worked in graphene lab for three years before I dropped out for health reasons, and my primary roles were replication, CVD growth, and automation, in that order.  From my experience, we could only replicate about a third of the papers we had the budget and tools to test.  Weeding out all of the null results that way helped us build the lab up quite quickly - when I began, we didn't even have our own lab space, but we were putting out 2-3 papers a year (usually in nature) by the time I left.  And that was even with our strict internal rule that we couldn't publish anything without showing it was true for at least 6 samples from two different batches of graphene (not that the second rule was much of a burden - I had a very consistent automated CVD process set up before I left). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, while you might be able to discover something new (maybe some effect that could help make batteries with higher energy densities), it may be something that turns out to not be practical (for example, prohibitively high cost in serial production, only works in certain environments, etc.) to actually implement. So you might've found something, but you rely on advances in other fields to actually make it work in the &quot;real world&quot; (maybe advances in nano-scale manufacturing so that large scale production becomes financially feasible). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This highlights the general public's lack of understanding in the difference between science and engineering. Discovering something new about the world is an amazing feat. It advances our knowledge. But that doesn't mean practical results.</p>
<p>Consider the &quot;metallic hydrogen&quot; report. It has <em>potential</em> to change the world. But so far there's a single report of a study with poor controls and a sample measuring ... micrograms? That's a far cry from building <em>reliable</em>, <em>affordable</em> rockets powered by the stuff. Or airframes. Or whatever. Engineering is what takes the research from the lab to useful application. And it's not always worthwhile.</p></div>		</li>
