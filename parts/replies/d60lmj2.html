			<p>It's been a while since I studied this in university but it's basically because sharks are special; they have high concentrations of urea in their bodies that helps regulate the osmotic pressure in their body fluids. Since going from fresh water to salt water changes the osmotic pressure of the water by changing the concentration of sodium and chloride ions, most fish take on too much sodium and die, or don't and lose too much water and get dehydrated and then die. Vice versa for salt water to fresh water. But sharks have urea, which stays at constant levels in their bodies (the pores in their gills and kidneys do not leak urea like they leak sodium) and can this safely regulate their sodium without taking on or losing too much water. The details of this are not eli5 and require a high level of biology knowledge, most of which I have forgotten. But this is the general gist. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong though. </p>		</li>

			<p>They explained it on shark week this year, the bull shark can quickly adapt its kidneys so that when it hits fresh water it literally pees constantly to expelled the fresh water at a rate fast enough to prevent itself from dying. Or something like that.  I was pretty unimpressed by the episode so i didn't remember details but I'm sure you could find it on YouTube. The episode has some goofy guy that reminds me of charlie day running around trying to find out if sharks are scared of alligators in rivers. <br><br>Edit: for a fuckboi</p>		</li>

			<p>Those ones are constantly sucking in air and farting the appropriate amount out to maintain the right chemical balance inside. The mass farting creates the tornado that carries them around. </p>		</li>

			<p>Also, when massive amounts of sharks group up in a single tornado, their farts can dramatically increase the overall speed of the tornado. </p>		</li>

			<p>Both freshwater and saltwater tornado sharks have roughly the same concentration of tornado in their blood. This is accomplished by saltwater tornado sharks having a biology that rapidly expels tornados allowing them to fly, while freshwater tornado sharks don't have that adaptation.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>I was in Davenport,Iowa around 15 years ago and there was a news paper article on the wall of a sporting goods store about a shark that was caught by commercial fisherman in the Mississippi River many years ago before all the locks were put in the river. Over 1,000 miles from the gulf of Mexico.</p>		</li>

			<p>I've only kept freshwater fish, but I have some basic knowledge of saltwater. Is pH and other mineral content a big factor as well for strictly fresh or saltwater fish? I know brackish water fish can tolerate various levels of salinity and pH, and often do better in a varied environment.</p>		</li>

			<p>If they are wild caught it can be very important, but if they've been domestically bred for decades they've mostly adapted (well, more like the ones who couldn't handle it died off while the rest kept breeding). That said, they still tend to be healthiest and live longest in the correct environment which includes ph, gh, kh, temp, amount of light, amount of cover, oxygen levels, amount of flow, cleanliness of water, type of food, etc. </p>		</li>

			<p>I know many salt water species are wild caught, which has kept me away from starting a tank. I'm pretty familiar with the care and maintenance, but like I said I've only had strictly freshwater for a number of years.<br><br>I know water quality in general is a big concern, in my area both nitrites and nitrates are very high, as well as pH being slightly high. It was always difficult when I had smaller tanks to maintain the best water quality.</p>		</li>

			<p>If you have high nitrates in your tapwater you might as well invest in a ro/di unit (or a denitrator, but for the price might as well just get ro). I think they're only like $60-100 for a cheap one for personal use. Also consider testing again, some places only have nitrates in their tapwater at certain times of the year due to local farming or runoff.  </p>		</li>

			<p>pH tends to vary more in freshwater...seawater the world over is the same pH.  But some freshwater fish are quite sensitive to that sort of thing.<br><br>Really it's sharp changes in pH that are most harmful. </p>		</li>

			<p>What exactly makes it die when it got too much sodium?</p>		</li>

			<p>Google Tonicity for a more in depth explanation.. Basically, when in an environment with too much sodium, the cells take in more sodium and get rid of water to try to make the inside and outside an equal concentration, this quickly dehydrates cells and kills them. <br><br>On the other hand, a salt water fish in fresh water has too much sodium inside, so the cells take in lots of water and will literally explode like an overfilled water balloon.</p>		</li>
