			<p>It's been a while since I studied this in university but it's basically because sharks are special; they have high concentrations of urea in their bodies that helps regulate the osmotic pressure in their body fluids. Since going from fresh water to salt water changes the osmotic pressure of the water by changing the concentration of sodium and chloride ions, most fish take on too much sodium and die, or don't and lose too much water and get dehydrated and then die. Vice versa for salt water to fresh water. But sharks have urea, which stays at constant levels in their bodies (the pores in their gills and kidneys do not leak urea like they leak sodium) and can this safely regulate their sodium without taking on or losing too much water. The details of this are not eli5 and require a high level of biology knowledge, most of which I have forgotten. But this is the general gist. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong though. </p>		</li>

			<p>They explained it on shark week this year, the bull shark can quickly adapt its kidneys so that when it hits fresh water it literally pees constantly to expelled the fresh water at a rate fast enough to prevent itself from dying. Or something like that.  I was pretty unimpressed by the episode so i didn't remember details but I'm sure you could find it on YouTube. The episode has some goofy guy that reminds me of charlie day running around trying to find out if sharks are scared of alligators in rivers. <br><br>Edit: for a fuckboi</p>		</li>

			<p>If they are wild caught it can be very important, but if they've been domestically bred for decades they've mostly adapted (well, more like the ones who couldn't handle it died off while the rest kept breeding). That said, they still tend to be healthiest and live longest in the correct environment which includes ph, gh, kh, temp, amount of light, amount of cover, oxygen levels, amount of flow, cleanliness of water, type of food, etc. </p>		</li>

			<p>If you have high nitrates in your tapwater you might as well invest in a ro/di unit (or a denitrator, but for the price might as well just get ro). I think they're only like $60-100 for a cheap one for personal use. Also consider testing again, some places only have nitrates in their tapwater at certain times of the year due to local farming or runoff.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Google Tonicity for a more in depth explanation.. Basically, when in an environment with too much sodium, the cells take in more sodium and get rid of water to try to make the inside and outside an equal concentration, this quickly dehydrates cells and kills them. <br><br>On the other hand, a salt water fish in fresh water has too much sodium inside, so the cells take in lots of water and will literally explode like an overfilled water balloon.</p>		</li>

			<p>Though to add on to this most freshwater fish can tolerate a certain level of salt (and it tends to actually be beneficial for them). Of course there are exceptions to this. Scaleless fish such as loaches and many cats like pleco's and cories do not handle salt very well.</p>		</li>

			<p>Huh. I was reading through the examples and learned that the Baltic Sea is not only brackish, but the salt water flowing in from the North Sea sinks below the fresh water coming from inland rivers, creating this layered environment. The freshwater has low enough salinity that fish like pike can survive in it, while the deeper saltwater is salty enough that cod live there. TIL. </p>		</li>

			<p>If I'm remembering my class right, I think it's more due to exhaustion. They travel a long way to spawn and just use all their energy getting to the spawning area.

			<p>Nope, they die because they invest all their energy into egg/sperm production and the actual migration itself leaving very little energy left for basic maintenance of their immune and osmoregulatory systems, they die from exhaustion/disease essentially. </p>		</li>

			<p>freshwater fish have little butt holes to keep water flow as limited as possible, the more water flow the more salt drain on its body.  salt water fish have huge butt holes so they can push the salt water out as quickly as possible.<br><br>that was the way my high school marine biology teacher taught it.<br><br>salmon or other anadromous fish can be born with a small hole and then have it get larger as they mature, but the hole won't get smaller again so they can't stop their salt loss when they go back up river, and that's why the meat gets really bad if you catch them too far up steam.</p>		</li>
