			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I studied this in university but it's basically because sharks are special; they have high concentrations of urea in their bodies that helps regulate the osmotic pressure in their body fluids. Since going from fresh water to salt water changes the osmotic pressure of the water by changing the concentration of sodium and chloride ions, most fish take on too much sodium and die, or don't and lose too much water and get dehydrated and then die. Vice versa for salt water to fresh water. But sharks have urea, which stays at constant levels in their bodies (the pores in their gills and kidneys do not leak urea like they leak sodium) and can this safely regulate their sodium without taking on or losing too much water. The details of this are not eli5 and require a high level of biology knowledge, most of which I have forgotten. But this is the general gist. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a support group for us? The only thing I can remember from an entire Honours Undergrad is that barnacles have really big dicks and parrotfish sleep in a bubble of their own snot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They explained it on shark week this year, the bull shark can quickly adapt its kidneys so that when it hits fresh water it literally pees constantly to expelled the fresh water at a rate fast enough to prevent itself from dying. Or something like that.  I was pretty unimpressed by the episode so i didn't remember details but I'm sure you could find it on YouTube. The episode has some goofy guy that reminds me of charlie day running around trying to find out if sharks are scared of alligators in rivers. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was in Davenport,Iowa around 15 years ago and there was a news paper article on the wall of a sporting goods store about a shark that was caught by commercial fisherman in the Mississippi River many years ago before all the locks were put in the river. Over 1,000 miles from the gulf of Mexico.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only once they have gone through smoltification,  salmon hatch out in freshwater and are physiologically adapted to excrete large amounts of freshwater and very little salt, they then go through a process during spring where the &quot;pumps&quot; on the gills that keep the salt in reverse the flow and now work to keep salt out and freshwater in (smoltification), they are now ready to head to sea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that why they die when they go back up the river to lay their eggs? Or is it unrelated, and they only had up there when they're about to die? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>freshwater fish have little butt holes to keep water flow as limited as possible, the more water flow the more salt drain on its body.  salt water fish have huge butt holes so they can push the salt water out as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>that was the way my high school marine biology teacher taught it.</p>
<p>salmon or other anadromous fish can be born with a small hole and then have it get larger as they mature, but the hole won't get smaller again so they can't stop their salt loss when they go back up river, and that's why the meat gets really bad if you catch them too far up steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though to add on to this most freshwater fish can tolerate a certain level of salt (and it tends to actually be beneficial for them). Of course there are exceptions to this. Scaleless fish such as loaches and many cats like pleco's and cories do not handle salt very well.</p></div>		</li>
