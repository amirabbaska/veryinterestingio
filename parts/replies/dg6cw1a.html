<p>It's always been explained to me with debts and stuff, but I'm gonna use this analogy from now on!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a good explanation, and here's an example from an old French comedy group called &quot;Les Nuls&quot; : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vIIK7fQ8fQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vIIK7fQ8fQ</a></p>
<p>The first 3 minutes they perform backwards : they talk backwards, walk backwards etc. Then the last 3 minutes they play the record in reverse and it starts to make sense (if you speak French).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An alternate version that cuts out the idea of playing with recordings (which in my mind obfuscates the issue): a car is on a road that goes east-west. The car facing east is the positive direction and traveling east is positive velocity, traveling and facing west is negative. The car being in (forward) drive is positive, in reverse is negative. Then consider the combinations of (facing east or west)*(being in forward drive or reverse) on (traveling east or west).</p></div>		</li>
