			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a while reading about this the other day, so now I must share this sad quote from wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, lobsters are not immortal. Lobsters grow by moulting which requires a lot of energy, and the larger the shell the more energy is required.[20] Eventually, the lobster will die from exhaustion during a moult.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tortoises have an interesting physiology, they have invested considerable biological energy into protecting themselves (i.e., shell). The marginal cost of maintaining that shell for another breeding season is low relative to the potential turn around another cohort.</p>
<p>There are many evolutionary strategies in which long life is effective.  Think of it this way, MacDonalds won the burger race by being the low cost leader. Five guys also had a great strategy by offering a diffentiated product. They are both making burgers, but they are doing it in very different ways.</p>
<p>A Tortoise is like five guys: Huge investment in shell, also, let's just get huge so almost nothing can swallow us whole or bite us. That way I can have cohort after cohort of babies.</p>
<p>Another long lived organism is cod. Since cod grow every year, their reproductive organs also grow. A 5 year old may produce 20,000 eggs but a 40-50 year old cod will produce millions of eggs each year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting point about cod reproduction, and it seems to me like it might be partially related to the collapse of the cod fisheries - if older, larger fish are better able to reproduce, then constantly fishing them would exert a huge downwards pressure on their population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Few predators and the ability to reproduce throughout their life span. This means more offspring and more of them sharing those genes. Also it's important to note that &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is more like &quot;survival of the good enough &quot;. The dodo bird is a great example of how this works. The dodo wasn't particularly fast, strong, or smart it simply was good enough for the conditiona of the environment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Humans have more learned behaviors than most other species.  Having a longer youth and longer parental lifespans allows this to be better passed on to the next generation.  So there is an evolutionary advantage to living longer for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Faster generation times speed evolution and adaptation.  There are finite resources in the environment.  If the parents live longer they are competing with their offspring for those resources.  If the parents live long and stay healthy they can outcompete the younger populations even though the younger populations may have more genetically fit individuals.  Also, only the individuals best suited for that exact environment would survive, so diversity would be lost.  This would cause evolutionary stagnation which could lead to extinction if the environment changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why we spend so much time developing is because our brains are so large in comparison to our bodies. If we came out nearly fully developed like other animals (deer, cows, etc.) then the female would not survive to take care of the child because our heads would be far too large for a vaginal birth. We spend so much time developing outside of the womb in lieu of doing it inside.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If humans live longer that a comparable species, it must be because of an increase in fitness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that not all traits are adaptive. While I agree that it is very plausible that longevity was selected for in humans, we shouldn't state that this with 100% certainty. This may seem a bit nitpicky, but there are already a number of misconceptions about evolution in the public, including that all traits were selected for.</p></div>		</li>
