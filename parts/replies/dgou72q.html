			<div class="markdown"><p>If the completely 100% die I take it of my list after about a year.  If the seemingly stay in alpha 'forever' (looking at you 7d2d)... then so be it.  They are stopping me from buying other alpha stuff.</p>
<p>Those other alpha games will just have to actually release for me to buy it.    </p></div>		</li>
