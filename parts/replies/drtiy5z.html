			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it is possible for identical twins (twins born through a process where a single fertilized egg splits into two) to be born with different genders in the presence of genetic defects.  If the gene determining gender is xxy, when the egg splits it is possible to have one xx and one xy egg after the fact.</p>
<p>This is absurdly rare, but it is possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By semantic definition they may be identical twins, but they wouldn't be what we mean when we say <em>identical</em>, right? Their DNA would differ since they only share the 'middle' x gene. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The idea of that identical twins are genetically identical is old and not valid. Modern DNA technology finds mutations and differences between &quot;identical&quot; twins. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By this definition no twins are truly identical. Even identical twins have different DNA since retrotransposons begin inserting themselves randomly throughout the genome even in the womb and they do so independently in each twin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sex chromosomes make up only 1 of 23 pairs that make up a person's genes. So what you actually mean to say is, they'd share every gene except for that one X and one Y chromosome.  They'd be very close to identical in every other way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I am aware, this is not possible and has not been documented to occur.  When a fertilized egg with a trisomy (such as XXY (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klinefelter_syndrome" target="_blank">Klinefelter Syndrome</a>)) splits, both resulting embryos would also have the same trisomy.  This is evident by the fact that a number of identical twins have been <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4444776/" target="_blank">documented</a> to both have trisomies 21, 18, 13, and indeed, XXY (Klinefelter Syndrome).</p>
<p>EDIT: TLDR; it's never happened, but maybe not strictly impossible to have monozygotic twins of opposite gender.  Upon further searching, there are EXCEEDINGLY <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18627064" target="_blank">rare examples</a> of identical twins in which one inherited a trisomy and one did not, due to some combination of abnormal chromosomal separation, nondisjunction, recombination, trisomic rescue, etc.  So, while a fertilized egg with a trisomy generally splits to become two fetuses both with a trisomy, it is possible for one to exhibit the trisomy and one to not.  Importantly for our question at hand, however, if the fertilized egg had an XXY karyotype and there was an equivalent series of events that produced one twin with XXY and another with XX or XY, the first twin would still be infertile (XXY, Klinefelter syndrome produces sterile males).  I suppose it is possible (though certainly never documented, given that identical twins with XXY have only been observed a handful of times) that BOTH embryos could undergo trisomic rescue following splitting of the fertilized egg, with one fetus losing a Y chromosome and the other losing an X chromosome, producing (mostly) identical twins of opposite gender.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46. Normally, each parent contributes a gamete (egg or sperm) which contains 23 chromosomes (one half of each pair). Identical twins are both the same genetic sex, so you can only get either two eggs or two sperm from a set of identical twins, not one of each. They're doing interesting things with using different sorts of genetic source material in donor eggs and using two sperm looks attainable from here but, as far as I know, has not yet been done. You could make a full clone by using a non-gamete cell that already had all 46 chromosomes from one of the twins, but that makes the second twin irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's been done, iirc. There have been sets of identical twins that have married, at least.</p>
<p>Edit: i found an <a href="https://www.oddee.com/item_97898.aspx" target="_blank">oddee</a> article (yes i know, but the first picture is worth it) that lists a few identical twin couples. Turns out the children of identical twins are genetic siblings to each other rather than cousins, as they come from parents with identical sets of DNA.</p></div>		</li>
