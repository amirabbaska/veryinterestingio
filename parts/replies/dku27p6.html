			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah being as I work in the city and live in a rural area, I love the winter nights when I get home and its already dark, and when I get out of the car I always look up if its clear and see where the constellations are. Usually I can see the dippers and Orion without a problem.</p>
<p>Sad that future generations may not be able to see them as they get dimmer and dimmer.... if we are even around at all. Ancient civilizations must have seen quite the light show overhead at night. Makes me jealous sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't let the city hold you back!  I live in Phoenix and it was kind of nice for stargazing and I got quite into it during high school.  The neat thing is in the city, EVERYTHING you can see is something important.  Want to find a constellation?  BAM - it's those eight stars right there.  </p>
<p>From my back yard with a pair of $30 binoculars I could see Andromeda, the moons of Jupiter, Orion's nebula, meteor showers, etc.  There's a ton of fun you can still have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key is to get dark adapted. If you're in the city find some place that has no direct view of any street lights. It takes up to 30 minutes for your eyes to fully adapt to darkness so try to stay out for a long time and you'll see more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember being a kid, pressing my face up against the car window to gaze at the stars while on a road trip.  We're from the city so I didn't get too great of a view often.</p>
<p>I was looking at Orion when I saw....what was that?  A smudge?  But when I looked right at it it would disappear.</p>
<p>I told my mother about it and got the usual &quot;yes dear, that's nice&quot;.  &quot;No, mom, for reals, there's like a smudge in the sky.  It's not like a regular star, I don't know what it is!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;uh huh&quot;</p>
<p>So I got out a piece of paper and drew where it was in the sky so I could try to figure it out later.  I drew <a href="http://www.itstactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Orion-Taurus-Pleiades.jpg" target="_blank">Orion, and the belt kind of pointed towards it.</a>.  Later I went to the library (pre-internet days, kids!) and found a star chart and realized I had discovered <a href="http://astronomer.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/m45-pleiades.jpg" target="_blank">the Pleiades</a>.  I felt like a god damned explorer.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sucks that your mom shut you down like that. I often feel like I under appreciate I was born with science-loving parents. Spent many many hours outside on many occasions looking through telescopes with my dad while I was growing up. Pleiades when viewed in a dark area is really impressive because you can actually see the dust clouds around it like you can see in that high resolution telescope shot. You can see the clouds with your naked eyes if it's dark enough. It gives a &quot;fuzz&quot; to the image that's unlike most other things in the sky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, but to give some more detail on the interesting biology of our eyes:</p>
<p>The center of your retina is called the fovea, and it's what does most of the work of seeing details. The fovea covers 2% of your field of vision, but about 50% of your visual cortex in your brain is devoted to interpreting information from it. If you hold your arm straight out with two fingers up and look at your fingertips, that's about the field that the fovea covers. </p>
<p>Your eyes have 2 basic types of cells for turning light into signals your brain can process, rod cells and cone cells. Both work through photoreactive pigments that chemically change when exposed to light. Cone cells have pigments that react to red, green, or blue light, and they're also more sensitive to fine detail and movement than rod cells. The fovea is densely packed with cone cells and has no rod cells at all. Rod cells can't detect colors or as much detail as cone cells, but they are sensitive to much lower levels of light. Rods are distributed over the rest of your retina. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another interesting tidbit about the eye's structure is the blind spots that we all have due to the connection locus of the optic nerve.</p>
<p>Eyes are really fantastic things. It is really an impressive piece of biology!</p></div>		</li>
