<p>Funny you should mention that. It does! Or rather, it assists the moon in making larger tides.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key to consider isn't the magnitude of the force but the amount that it changes from one side of the planet to the other. </p>
<p>The tidal forces from a small object (e.g. the ISS) are negligable because it doesn't produce much gravity.  The tidal forces from a distant object (e.g. the center of the Milky Way) are negligable because the diameter of Earth is tiny compared to the distance. </p>
<p>The moon has the best combination of mass and proximity. It's tiny compared to the sun, but it's far, far closer. The proximity both increases the magnitude of the gravitational forces and increases how relevant the diameter of Earth is. The moon is only about 30 Earth diameters away. </p>
<p>The sun is still relevant to tides because it is so much more massive, but it's almost 12,000 Earth diameters away so it doesn't have as much of an effect: there's more gravity from the sun overall, but it's more consistent from the near side of the planet to the far side. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity follows the inverse square law. However if the effect of the sun/moon's gravity were uniform across the earth then it would not product any tides (because everything would accelerate by the same amount in the same direction).</p>
<p>What matters is how the sun/moon's gravity differs from one point on the earth to another. This is the difference between 1/r^2 and 1/(r+d)^2, where d is small compared to r. To first order this means that tidal effects follow an inverse cube (as opposed to square) law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, what?  I thought the moon made the tides, not the sun.  Logically that would mean the moon exerts far greater gravitational influence on the earth than the sun does?  I'm not saying you're wrong here, I'm just honestly confused by your statement.  Could you explain what you mean further?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun pulls much more evenly since it's so far away. The tides are caused by a difference in pull rather than the absolute strength.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the problem is the differential. Because the Sun is so far, its effect on the further point on the planet (the midnight distance) is pretty equal to its effect on the closest point (the noon distance). The Moon creates tides because it's closer, meaning that the force it exerts on the opposite side is weaker than the one it exerts on the planet, which is weaker than the one it exerts on the close side. If the Sun's influence was that great, the planet would have become tidally locked by now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa.... I just thought this one out.  Objects on the far side of the Earth from the Sun would be heavier (on Earth) since the Sun is pulling it towards the Sun, <em>through</em> the Earth?  And then those same objects would be lighter on Earth during the day since the Sun is pulling them away from the Earth?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the Earth were not orbiting the sun, and somehow held in place with a big stick or something (and the Sun wasn’t rotating), then this would be true.  However, since Earth is a free-floating body, <em>it’s</em> getting accelerated by the Sun’s gravity just like you are, and so the Sun’s influence on how “heavy” you are relative to the Earth’s surface depends only on the <em>difference</em> in the Sun’s gravity you feel in the near vs far sides of the Earth — that is, the tidal effect.</p>
<p>Edit: so actually the Sun only contributes to you being <em>lighter</em> on the Earth than if there were no Sun around.  You’ll be lightest due to the Sun at both Noon <em>and</em> midnight. At 6am/pm, it will have no net influence on your Earth weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're looking for an easy way to lose weight I have a more efficient method; move to the equator.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At the equator the rotation of the earth generates a centrifugal force (apparently pushing you outwards), making your measured weight less.</p>
</li>
<li>This same effect causes the equator to bulge outwards meaning you are further away from the Earth's centre, and thus gravity is slightly weaker.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'd still recommend dieting though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've vastly overestimated the effect. </p>
<p>The moon doesn't just have an effect on the concrete block. It also has an effect on Earth. Your approach is like computing the gravitational force Earth exerts on astronauts in the ISS. That force is substantial but doesn't lead to any apparent gravity because it affects the astronauts and the spacecraft alike. To appropriately compute tidal forces you have to investigate how gravitational forces affect the two objects (ISS/astronauts, or Earth/concrete brick) differently. </p>
<p>The center of Earth is about 384,000 km away. The closest and farthest points from the moon (both high tides) are about 6,300 km (radius of the earth). nearer and farther. </p>
<p>To find the net apparent effect on the concrete block we need to compare the force at 384,000 km to the force at 390,300 km.</p>
<p>Plugging in the same givens you used I got 0.000 001 065 Newtons (1 micronewton, or about 1/1000 the value you got). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are 100% correct.  I went with the very quick and easy calculation purely to try and demonstrate just how small an impact the moon's gravity has on objects here on Earth.  If we wanted to be more accurate we would have to use your method (comparing the difference between being on one side vs the other) which results in an even smaller value.</p>
<p>I probably should have added in a line stating that my calculations were purely to get a sense of scale for how little gravity affects objects on Earth, not useful for trying to calculate real world effectiveness since the actual change in force is not as simple as &quot;the moon pulls this hard on it&quot;.  My goal was purely to present a scale of the moon's gravitational effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd the gravity of the moon were non-negligible, wouldn't it still have a net zero effect? Like it would effectively be setting earth's gravitational acceleration to &gt;9.8?</p></div>		</li>
