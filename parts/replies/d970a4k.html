			<div class="markdown"><p>This is sadly one of the biggest misunderstandings about behavioral health: in contrast with more &quot;conventional&quot; medicine, it's about <em>effect and impact</em> rather than <em>cause and source.</em></p>
<p>You define a broken leg by observing that a bone is fractured or discontinuous. You define trauma by it getting in the way of living a normal life.</p>
<p>The factors involved in mental health are humbling in their number, complexity, and both inter- and intra-individual variability. One person might be seemingly unaffected by an experience that's crippling for most everyone else, and then that same person might be profoundly affected by something that's fairly benign to the majority of people. You really can't guess at what's going to lead to what aside from correlative patterns reinforced through genetics and environmental influences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That it's more difficult to identify cause and effect in mental health doesn't imply that mental health is not or should not be chiefly concerned with identifying cause and effect. You are forced to work with correlation a lot of the time, but causality is still always the goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Treatment is the goal. Causality matters <strong>ONLY</strong> when it leads to theory that can change the outcomes. I'm not sure what you just read, but what I just read was that your attempts at prediction would be foiled by combinatorial explosion/ ignorance. If you can't prevent, then causality is almost irrelevant. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What the field defines as trauma, currently, is anything that causes an individual to experience fear for their safety or life, or the safety/life of a loved one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You define trauma by it getting in the way of living a normal life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which one of you is correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General rule of thumb for psychological disorders is that whatever bizarre behavior that is occurring does so with such great intensity or frequency that it impacts the person's daily life in a negative way (think job loss, significant change in disciplinary action at school, changes in personality). I think between the two of them a good definition of a trauma disorder would be fear for one's safety/life with such frequency or severity that it affects their daily life (such as going into survival mode so frequently during the day that they can't hold down a job). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fear for safety or life that gets in the way of living a normal life. One is about defining what it is, the other describes the scope. If it doesn't get in the way of living a normal life, it's not trauma in the clinical sense, is it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow up, have you seen any documentation/articles where an individual was seeking psychological treatment for something that happened to him/her in a dream? I'm referring to a single, fictional dream event as opposed to recurring nightmares that were based on something that happened to the individual in real life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I am a practicing clinician.  I do have a couple of clients that have sought services for being <em>re</em>-traumatized by events in their dreams.  One client in particular has dreams that are not nightmares wherein he relives his trauma, but they remind him of his trauma and it causes his symptoms to flare up.</p>
<p>However, the dreams didn't cause his trauma to begin with, they only exacerbate his existing trauma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is interesting becasue I've often wondered whether dreams are fully derived from real events or if a unique experience can be created in a dream.  If dreams involve processing existing memories then I assume it's closer to the former where the emotional impact from a dream is just reliving a variation of an emotion from IRL, not creating a novel emotion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about something like hypnagogic hallucinations? They would be technically considered a dream (I think) and I could see them being quite traumatic. Speaking as a person with Narcolepsy that went undiagnosed for years and suffered through seeing giant spiders and demonic children from it, but I understand that anecdotal evidence isn't scientific evidence so I figured I'd ask. </p></div>		</li>
