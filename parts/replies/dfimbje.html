			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! This one is a bit more specific, but is cringing over a memory you had of something embarrassing in your past different than the type of cringing you do when you imagine something scary, dangerous, or disastrous happening? (An example would be when you are driving and suddenly imagine getting into a bad accident?) </p>
<p>How do these two different types of situations illicit such a similar physiological response? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most effective treatments for thought cringe is to actively think about the memory in its entirety. I suffer from this as well, like everyone, and I guarantee you that what ever you have done, people have done worse and more embarrassing things. Also, remember that human behavior is situationally specific in its entirety. If you have done something embarrassing it does not mean you are always that way. </p></div>		</li>
