			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, the problem has never been immeduately running out. It's that the U.S. has had a massive stockpile of helium since well before we had many particularly great uses for it. It's easily the largest stockpile on earth by orders of magnitude. But the government has ordered what amounts to a clearance sale to do away with the cost of storage on such larhe scales, and this sale has flooded the market and thereby artificially depressed prices.</p>
<p>The result is that once the stock is gone price will skyrocket, not only because the cheap sourve is gone, but because that one cheap source was effectively the <em>only</em> source for decades.</p>
<p>To give a bad analogy, imagine if walmart began selling car tires for a dollar a piece. Like, way below market value. Over the course of a few years, every other tires store would be driven out of business and nobody would have any reason to enter the market. Now imagine that one day you show up to walmart looking to buy tires and they just tell you &quot;Sorry. We sold the last of them a few months ago. We don't do tires anymore. You'll have to find another supplier.&quot; Only, all the tire stores are long gone.</p>
<p>Sure, we still know how to make tires, and in time somebody will fill that gap in the market, but for a little while there's going to be a huge problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>do you have any further reading on this? when did they start selling? and how much? seems that if the amount is truly ungodly and they want out fast, they should just <em>sell the stockpile</em> and let a holding company unwind it.  </p>
<p>edit: here is a good wired article  <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/07/feds-created-helium-problem-thats-screwing-science/" target="_blank">https://www.wired.com/2015/07/feds-created-helium-problem-thats-screwing-science/</a>  and a good investopedia article <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/12/helium.asp" target="_blank">http://www.investopedia.com/articles/fundamental-analysis/12/helium.asp</a></p>
<p>the analogy of selling tires for a buck (virtually nothing) is not quite on. Helium from the reserve was first sold (starting in 1996) for 25% <em>above market value</em> but given that demand worldwide surged during the tech boom, that legally mandated price was quickly outstripped by demand.  By 2010 they started raising the price but it did discourage private investment in more expensive refining techniques (needed to truly keep up with demand).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except that people will see the end of Big Helium coming and can start ramping up. </p>
<p>There will be a lot of money in being the first one to sell from another source, which means there will be competition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want a great, similar example that's happening now -- look at oil prices, and the Russian economy. </p>
<p>The Middle East is a huge producer / supplier of oil. Russia is a smaller producer, comparatively, but oil sales basically are the backbone of the Russian economy. </p>
<p>With the current civil war in Syria, some people decided to start selling their oil reserves for super cheap, to liquidize their assets in order to fund their war. The rest of the Middle East wasn't effected very much -- they produce so much, and have so much in reserve, and have so much money already, that they can also sell it for cheap, without feeling a huge effect. </p>
<p>However, Russia cannot afford to sell their oil that cheap. Oil is more difficult for Russia to produce, raising production costs, and they have fewer customers. They're the &quot;smaller tire shop&quot;, in your example. Russia's economy is feeling the burn right now. Their currency is at an all-time low, and their economy is slowly crashing. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the US, all we see are cheaper fuel prices. A few years ago, petrol was $3 per gallon, and now it's down to around $2 per gallon. We (the end customer) think it's great, and aren't worried about the consequences behind the scene, because our end product is super cheap. Imagine the consumers in your example -- they won't care about the problems behind the scene, because they're currently buying tires at $1 per tire. </p>
<p>Eventually, though, the Syrian war will end. The rebels will no longer need to fire-sell fuel, so they will stop. The rest of the Middle East will follow, and sell for regular, higher prices. Russia might be able to pull themselves through (i.e. The smaller tire shop might have survived), but all the end consumer is going to see is rising fuel prices. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are, or at least were, regional commercial shortages. This just meant that getting helium for balloons and whatnot was difficult. I don't know anybody in welding, science, etc... that was affected by the shortage. A couple years ago I found out while I was building a balloon based airphoto system for shits and giggles. I was in Atlantic Canada and could not source even a small tank. A welder friend laughed when I explained my predicament and gave me a one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember a couple years ago all the flower shops in my area couldn't get any helium. So I used the helium at the lab I work at to fill balloons. I went to buy balloons and had to argue with the lady at the flower shop about letting me purchase them. She said she couldn't sell them because they didn't have helium. I said I didn't care, I had my own. The glare she gave me a was impressive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A LOT of things are over-hyped by the media.
Every time I make that statement I always end up getting a ton of downvotes, people think the media can say no wrong.</p>
<p>But the media has one priority, tell stories that catch people's attention. What sounds more interesting? We're running out of helium we need to consider our usage!
Or &quot;our current supplies of helium will dimish 100 years from now&quot;. </p>
<p>Most people would rather hear a doomsday scenario. Not a 'in 100 years from now we're going to get slapped on the wrist' scenario.</p>
<p>They also convey their messages in a way to gain public favor to whatever side they want to see supported.
Rich people can just pay them off to promote a certain message that isn't necessarily true.</p>
<p>That's all over-generalized, but really I guess I'd like to say, if looking for facts, don't look to the news, look on various websites that aren't blogs. </p>
<p>The real proof is in the pudding, not the flashy labels on the box it comes in.   </p>
<p>But I think what it also boils down to is under-researched material. Too many people try to present information before gathering all the data first</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope.  CNN and MSNBC will happily lose viewership rather than spread information that doesn't cater to their Northeast political bubble ideology.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Never bank on human progress as your only plan for dealing with resource shortages.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, we were working on getting to the Moon.  Even the most pessimistic predictions put humans on Mars well before now, yet we aren't even close.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, it was assumed that all software would have been replaced with something better long before 2000, yet the Y2K bug still required millions of man-hours programming patches.  Much of that patched software is <em>still</em> running today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's my turn to be peeved though. Don't use Mars as a measurement of progress. I don't even think NASA <em>wants</em> to go to Mars. It's just the only way they'll get funding. What value is there in putting a man on Mars? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my mind, the goal of space flight is the same as the goal of sailing expeditions in previous centuries: discovery, research, and human survival/expansion.  I firmly believe we've become stagnant in this, but that's true of most human endeavors that aren't immediately profitable (space mining would take many years and billions of dollars up front, but could yield trillions).</p>
<p>The expectation that we would be colonizing other planets by now is relevant to the comment I was replying to.  Assuming that we are going to be space mining by 2100 might seem reasonable right now, but in the 1960s it seemed reasonable that we'd have humans on Mars by now as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It is long-term planning.</p>
<p>We WILL eventually consume all the resources on Earth.  There is no question; the resources are finite but we keep reproducing.</p>
<p>So we need to figure out how to get to other planets, which have resources.  Mars may not have everything we need, but it is the closest place to us.  You have to crawl before you can walk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems to me that is a little cavalier. I mean, we have a limited supply for the rest of humanities time on earth. That could be a long time. Like, a really long time.</p>
<p>And why we will probably find new alternatives to helium, surely we will also find new uses for such a crazy useful element.</p>
<p>It makes me a little sad that your post is top as it seems like it would encourage non-risk based behaviour.  I think people call this the problem of future accounting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not cavalier. It <em>really</em> isn't.</p>
<p>We're limited by the earth's core cooling down, in many respects. We mine Helium because it's easiest to capture underground. It's down there from the normal radioactive decay of the material in the crust and mantle. We <em>can't</em> run out of Helium until we run out of radioactive material - and the earth is <em>huge</em>. A <em>lot</em> of that rock is at least slightly radioactive.</p>
<p>That Helium will, eventually, migrate up to the crust, and through it (or be simply generated in the crust), and we just need to find pockets where it pools. Right now we've got it easy with natural gas and oil pockets, but it's all over the earth.</p></div>		</li>
