			<div class="markdown"><p>Anything is &quot;testable&quot; though not necessarily in a scientifically rigorous fashion.</p>
<p>All you need to do is develop a hypothesis about an event and then wait to see if that hypothesis turns out to be right or wrong.</p>
<p>However, because this hypothesis was based around a real-world event rather than something performed in a lab it can only be done once with the exact same set of circumstances.  </p>
<p>So, for instance, you can hypothesize that Candidate A will win an election and then wait to see if you are right or wrong but you can never replicate that exact same election nor can you modify just one or two variables to see what effect doing so has on the outcome.</p>
<p>To get around this, you can use thing like polls or focus groups but those are unreliable in their own ways.</p>
<p>Another way would be to look at case studies, which is often how political scientists like to study an issue.  So we might ask &quot;Are sanction effective in changing the behavior of a nation?&quot;  And we can look at numerous historical examples and attempt to draw conclusions.  But, again, we can't draw any firm conclusions because we can't re-run those case studies.  </p>
<p>So, in a strict sense of the term, you <em>can</em> test a hypothesis but it would in no way be scientific.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can test more rigorously with models, which are able to run the same events more than once identically. The fitted model then makes unique, characteristic predictions which you can look for in real life, and back and forth.</p>
<p>It's still ideal to use experiments with that too, but this is a more and more popular means of doing science the more we delve into extremely complicated, heavily feedback looped dynamical systems and such in modern research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of testable (read: falsifiable) things in political science! Political science is a social science, so the comment below is a bit disingenuous to say that it is not scientifically rigorous, though if you don't believe in social science then that's a whole other thing I suppose. If you're american, the election seems to be the most pertinent thing at the moment so I'll talk about that briefly. In social science, you can either perform case studies, which look in-depth at few events, or analytical testing which uses wide ranges of data to come to conclusions. Say you want to understand whether a certain party controlling the white house for longer makes it more likely that they will hold it in the future. For a case study, you might want to look at the republican dominance in the late 20th century and see how clinton bucked the trend. You might look at campaign strategy, opinion polls of clinton and bush 41, general trends in the electorate. (clinton's southern strategy is fascinating) in a more analytical study, you might look at incumbency in general and how long that might have an advantage for, and how voter preferences change. out of this kind of study came the time-for-change model which is a staple in electoral theory and, at the outset of this election, gave a 2/3 chance to ANY republican presidential candidate who ran. I wish I could give better examples, but I hope this gives some insight into that.</p>
<p>It is true that IRL it's hard to disentangle the various factors and noise that comes from the messiness of real life, but dismissing this as impossible brushes away a lot of amazing research.</p>
<p>There are also some other &quot;laws&quot; (more like statistical norms) that exist in political science. For example, Duverger's law states that any governmental system that is first-past-the-post, i.e. winner takes all, will converge into a two party system. this is practically an eventuality in any FPTP system. </p>
<p>let me know if I can help any further, I wrote this out pretty quickly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;Laws&quot; you mention seem to be the most interesting. I would imagine that these involve things that almost seem to follow naturally from the setup of a system and would then let you understand the rules necessary to game that system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! that kind of thing tends towards game theory and behavioural economics though, not as much political science when you get deep into it</p></div>		</li>
