			<div class="markdown"><p>If, for a very simplified analogy, you imagine light being tiny, bouncy balls which hit and bounce off of things. Then imagine that the balls that bounce into your eye allow you to see the thing they've bounced off of.</p>
<p>Now imagine the sun is shooting these 'light balls' in all directions and some of those go onto the earth and hit a triceratops and then those balls reflect in all directions off the triceratops (making reflections in the water, bouncing off vegetation etc) and then some bounce into the sky. To a creature flying over the top, when those balls go into the bird's eye, it can see the triceratops.</p>
<p>Then those balls fly out in all directions into space. As they fly out further, they spread more and more and more.</p>
<p>When you set up a telescope, some of the balls go into the telescope and eventually into your eye. You can see it as those balls are gathered by the lens and focused onto one point - your eye. The fewer balls that go into your eye, the fainter the image will be. Maybe you only get a couple of balls from that triceratops. That's going to make it really hard to see.</p>
<p>Ergo, further out, fewer photons, less of an image, bigger lens required to gather the photons onto a focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, the number of photons doesn't seem to be a huge limit here (unless I've got my numbers wrong).</p>
<p>Suppose we've got our 4.4 light year lens (gravitational lens?) set up to collect light from our distant dinosaurs. The sun puts out about 1 kW/m^2 at the Earth's position. The dinosaur reflects some of that -- let's say it's got a 30% albedo (frustratingly, the internet doesn't seem to know what the albedo of a lizard is). A largish dinosaur might present a surface to the observer of 300 m^2 or so, so that's 100 kW of light energy being emitted.</p>
<p>At a distance of 65 million light years, that's 4.21x10^-44 W/m^2 of radiation. Now, that sounds miniscule, but over the surface area of a 4.4 light year lens, it amounts to 5.2x10^-11 W at the detector. If it were all green light (I mean, it's a dinosaur, right? :)), that's more than 100 million green photons from the dinosaur hitting our detector every second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the Voyager 1 is about 17 light hours away, so if it were to snap a detailed photo of Earth somehow, it would be capturing light from 17 hours ago.  </p>
<p>However, it would take at least 17 hours to send a command to the spacecraft to take the photo since the transmission speed can not exceed the speed of light (meaning that by the time the Voyager 1 receives to request to &quot;take a picture of yesterday&quot;, the light bouncing off of Earth now would have also traveled at least greater than or equal to the transmitted command, so it would actually be taking a picture of now or after.)  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that this spacecraft was launched in 1977 (38 years ago), took advantage of planetary gravity assist, reached a max speed of 38,610mph/62,136kmh, and it is just now 17 light <em>hours</em> away. Even at those ridiculous speeds, it was still only traveling at an average speed of:  </p>
<p>17 / (38 <em> 365 </em> 24) = 17 / 332880 = 0.00005107 times the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To see something the size of a triceratops yesterday, you'd need a lens <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%281+light+day+%2F+length+of+triceratops%29+*+1.22+*+500+nm" target="_blank">1.8x10^6 meters in diameter</a>. That's about half the diameter of the moon.</p>
<p>(You can adjust the first two values in that equation to change the distance and resolution, if you want to know what it would take to see different objects at different points in the past)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need precisely known spacing, how precise that spacing needs to be is dependent on the wavelength you're looking at.  They have considered giant arrays of little telescope satellites but maintaining the precise spacing is a significant challenge right now.</p>
<p>In theory though, yes a giant ass telescope array could work if you can maintain spacing to within nanometers over light years, though you'd need to account for the expansion of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know why, but this made me laugh. Definitely falls under the category of &quot;unusual engineering problems&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it really need to be that precise? Say they were deployed in a section of space that was empty and they maintained alignment via mutual neutral gravity (like Lagrange points, perhaps with some anchor stars providing the gravity to balance the outer edges of the array), could that be precise enough? If there's a degree of fluctuation, but you could guarantee that they'd come into precise alignment on a reliable period, that should be sufficient to snap a few Dino pics, yeah?</p></div>		</li>
