			<div class="markdown"><p>There were studies done that showed magnesium - the main component of Epsom Salts - can be absorbed through the skin, although the mechanism for it wasn't understood. There's also some evidence to suggest that magnesium relieved muscle soreness. The connection is tenuous but it's there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of what is absorbed is magnesium but the other part that is  absorbed is the Sulfate and it ends up converting to MSM, which has some evidence for helping with lessening joint pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The arguments in the article don't really make sense. </p>
<p>He cites two different studies, both of which have different problems that make them unreliable for the question at hand.</p>
<p>And these two sentences seem to contradict each other:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The delivery system — lotion — could be quite different than soaking in
water with dissolved magnesium sulfate. But I agree it’s pretty good
evidence that absorption is minimal or nil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then he just continues the article with the underlying bias that the magnesium doesn't cross the skin barrier, when he should have more objectively stated that it was unknown based on the evidence.</p>
<p>Worse still, even though he acknowledges the flaws in the cream study earlier, he appears to ignore this at later points in the article for the purpose of forcing across the overall tone, whereas there are any number of reasons that magnesium in a lipid cream suspension may behave very differently at the skin barrier compared to an Epsom salt solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Israeli soldiers can smear on magnesium rich cream without the slightest effect on
their blood levels of magnesium. That’s pretty damning.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll have to see if I can find the study to cite, but I believe there are still issues to be resolved concerning accurately measuring magnesium content within the body. Something like 96% of magnesium is located within cells, therefore magnesium concentration within the blood has been shown to be an unreliable measurement of meganesium concentrations within the body. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meh. The burden of proof is still upon those who believe epsom salts have an effect on &quot;relaxation&quot; (beyond the placebo effect).</p>
<p>Studies that weakly discredit the idea just make that burden of proof slightly harder to achieve. They don't in any way discredit the null hypothesis (magnesium salts have no effect).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That is more of an observable fact.  If it crossed the skin barrier, people who swam in fresh water would become magnesium deficient.  One could imagine some mechanism of active transport that worked in one direction, but the primary osmotic barrier of the skin is dead cells, no active transport is possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Magnesium levels in blood are very tightly controlle
d.  Of 19 subjects, all except 3 showed a rise in
magnesium concentrations in plas
ma, though this was small in some
cases.&quot;</p>
