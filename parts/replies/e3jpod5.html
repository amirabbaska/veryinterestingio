			<div class="markdown"><p>Another species that was once extinct in the wild is the Przewalski’s wild horse of Mongolia and China. The last true wild horse, this species is now critically endangered thanks to captive breeding in reserves across Asia. The horses have yet of a chance to survive in the wild by breeding. Also the scimitar horned oryx, which formerly ranged across the Sahara before nearly being hunted to extinction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it would technically be extirpation, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinct_in_the_wild" target="_blank">extinct in the wild</a> or EW is also an actual designation of the IUCN Red List. It wasn't just that they were gone from a specific area, all living California condors (which is a species, not just condors that happen to be in California) were captured in order to keep them from going extinct. Another example of this would be Przewalski's horse, where the entirety of the current population is descended from 9 horses captured in 1945.</p></div>		</li>
