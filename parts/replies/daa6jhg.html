			<div class="markdown"><p>Facetime is implemented on a closed/proprietary ecosystem with known hardware - which means they have a much simpler set of constraints to deal with.  They generally know if they can get the data through, the other side can decode it.</p>
<p>Skype can run on a huge variety of hardware, which means they can either do a lot in software to keep the code simple (but limited by processing speed), or they can add lots of optimizations to take advantage of the different hardware (fast, but complex to maintain).  Additionally - since the two sides of the conversation can have such different hardware, Skype has to negotiate what will work best for both - i.e. the least common denominator.  </p>
<p>Skype theoretically should be able to have the same quality as Facetime, but the engineering to do so (cost to keep updated) is astronomically higher - so it's likely compromises are made to provide a &quot;good enough&quot; experience with a reasonable engineering effort.  </p>
<p>There are also licensing costs associated with supporting different codecs (the software that encodes/decodes video) - Apple can build the cost of the codecs into the purchase of the device, Skype can't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's also worth pointing out (without adding much complexity) that if there is a network problem, the best way to deal with it is by reducing video quality (resolution, frame rate, or both).  It uses the most data, and is also the part that our brains can &quot;fix&quot; on their own: a choppy pixelated image can still be recognized, but choppy audio is very difficult to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skype has a hierarchy for data transmission quality of service. Audio is the highest priority, then video, then app / desktop sharing. </p>
<p>Skype also has multiple codex that are ideal for certain network health (fast stable, fast unreliable, slow stable, slow unreliable). When network health jumps between these, that is when you start to see differences in quality during a call. People pixelate or you get choppy or chipmunks in audio. </p>
<p>Since skype was designed to transverse the internet, quality of service isn't guaranteed and all packets are treated equally unlike a private network. </p>
<p>For fast networks it can send more data. For reliable ones it can send data without redundancy. </p>
<p>Slow networks means Skype has to reduce data so quality is then impacted. </p>
<p>Unreliable networks mean the same data is out across multiple packets along with some &quot;guess work&quot; from the client. This results in less data to be sent as well as unnaturally sounding audio. </p>
<p>So if a stable network, the data could be AB in the first packet and CD in the second packet and then EF then GH</p>
<p>But an unreliable network it might look be AB then BC then CD then DE then EF then FG and then finally GH. </p>
<p>If the CD packet is lost (or is delivered too late) no big deal if there is redundancy. Without redundancy (or if too many are lost) the client takes a guess based on the wave and will estimate what was there. That's when it sounds tinny or robotic. </p>
<p>But as you can see, redundancy takes more data to send and also has to reduced the quality to make room for the extra data. </p>
<p>Toss in Skype for Business you start to get server side tools and options along with some other gotchas (3 point calls home run back to the server) but similar situations with network health. </p>
<p>My XBone Kinect 2 has a really good camera with skype. I'd say it's on par with FaceTime but I don't have a 60inch Mac to compare. </p>
<p>I am not an expert in FaceTime but I assume it has something similar. But has a smaller hardware set to support. So I would venture to guess its optimized for the latest 2 or 3 hardware releases. </p></div>		</li>
