			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard an amusing story that in the 1980s, diplomats from Iran and Iraq became really good friends with the UN representative from Ireland, who would facilitate talks between the two.  Ireland temporarily sat between the two in the UN while they were at war.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of the line from Yes Prime Minister when Bernard is arranging the funeral: &quot;No, we can't have alphabetical seating in the Abbey. You'd have Iraq and Iran next to each other. Plus Israel and Jordan all sitting in the same pew. We'd be in danger of starting World War III. I know Ireland begins with an 'I' but no! Ireland doesn't make it any better; Ireland doesn't make anything any better.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
