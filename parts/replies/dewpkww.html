			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoa, what a fake-out with the suggestion of therapy and then the switch to &quot;therapists are scam artists.&quot;  Sounds like she was (is?) super ambivalent about therapy.  Sorry you had to deal with that lack of support.
The loss of taste analogy is a good one.  Especially because people find it hard to understand why I'm not excited to try their suggestions (which I'm sure would work great for someone who is just a little sad).  &quot;Add spice to my food.  Yeah, thanks.&quot;  :-)
I may take you up on your offer sometime.  Really appreciate it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was shocked. She seemed like she really wanted to get me help, and then was seriously angry when I accepted. She's.... a very complicated human. Growing up with them was rough. </p>
<p>I liked the lack of taste analogy because when I'm in one of my depressive spells, I have to force myself to get out of bed. Showering is a struggle. Eating and drinking are too. I figured it worked because you have to force yourself to do things to keep yourself alive. Adding spice works for all of two seconds, if you're lucky. </p>
<p>I mean it. If you need someone to talk to, and want anonymity, it may take me a bit, but I'll get back to you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother is very &quot;complicated&quot; too.  She berated me into telling her that I had had suicidal thoughts, and then screamed at me for &quot;caring more about this kitchen&quot; than my own mental health, whatever that was supposed to mean.  Family history (I'm adopted) confirms that my depression is definitely biological, but growing up in a difficult environment does have its effects, doesn't it?!</p>
<p>I get that you mean your offer &amp; appreciate it.  Cheers!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. That's a great way to put it. I had a similar experience with growing up religious and being told the Lord would fix it all. That was actually the primary point for me stepping away and eventually leaving the church. Decades of trying to live up to its standards to be worthy to be &quot;healed&quot; still left me eating those bland potatoes no matter what I did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Luckily, I got out long before you did. I'm 23 and essentially left home at 18 and did my own thing. My problems aren't better, but the people I surround myself with are, and that helps sometimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your situation with your step-mom reminds me of the situation I had with my own mom.</p>
<p>I knew I had depression when I was a teenager. I tried talking to school counselors who told me they weren't that kind of counselor. I tried getting books at the library about it, but my mom told me to take them back. </p>
<p>The answer was always that I just needed to pray and rely on the Lord.</p>
<p>After I confessed to her that I was feeling suicidal, I was enrolled in some Christian therapy stuff and sent off to every single back-to-back Christian youth retreat she could sign me up for.</p>
<p>Sometimes it helped. Sometimes the camps were scary and I came home feeling a lot worse. Eventually I confessed to my parents that I just didn't believe in any of it at all anymore and they kicked me out of the house.</p>
<p>That was 10 years ago. I'm still surviving, but man did that mess me up. </p>
<p>I'm glad you're hanging in there and powering through it. </p></div>		</li>
