			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading in the book Salt: A World History, by Mark Kurlansky, that the precursor of soy sauce was basically fish sauce much like the one they use in Thailand and Vietnam today. They gradually replaced some of the fish with soy and finally got rid of the fish altogether. Wheat I think is not necessary, but probably adding it was found to result in a better tasting sauce.</p>
<p>The question then becomes how was fish sauce discovered. But I would imagine the discovery is pretty natural given enough time: someone tried to preserve fish with salt, but didn't use enough salt to prevent fermentation. What resulted was still quite salty and as salt probably was expensive/rare, they used some of the &quot;sauce&quot; for example in a soup and found the flavour to be pleasant.</p></div>		</li>
