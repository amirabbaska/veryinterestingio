			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a condition called Gilbert's Syndrome where the liver inefficiently processes a biproduct of red cell breakdown called bilirubin. It's yellow in color and gets passed with bile into your intestines where it mixes into your stool. I know this because I have it and occasionally when I drink too much my stool comes out tan as a pair of khakis.</p>

<p>Another good example are those sugar cookies with the blue frosting that turns your poop green. Other pigments are probally denatured by digestion or drowned out by the deep brown.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the colors are vitamins or pre-vitamins, for example lutein (yellow in corn), zeaxanthin (a yellow-green), lycopene (tomato-red) and other carotenes (orange in carrots). They are taken up and stored for use in different organs, where they do their job )mostly protection) and broken down. </p>
<p>Carotenes are fat soluble and stored in fat. If you eat too many carrots and papayas, your fat turns very orange, and you can see the color through the thinner skin in your hands, for example. Lutein and zeaxanthin are used in the eyes, they protect from blue light. </p>
<p>The color of a compound is determined by the chemical structure. many colored compounds have many &quot;rings&quot; and double bonds. The energy of light gets trapped in those rings and create color (this is not completely right, but the easiest way to explain for non-chemist, I think). If a damaging radical (a high energy thingy, like light) damages these rings, they break apart. They loose their color. But better they break the color-compounds than they break something important, like DNA or structural proteins that cannot be repaired. </p></div>		</li>
