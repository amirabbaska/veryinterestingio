			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a flight attendant for many years and lost count the amount of times people would ask us for a ginger ale to help settle their stomach. </p>
<p>The ginger ale we had on board had zero ginger in it. Just artificial ginger flavour. </p>
<p>For a while i tried pointing it out, but then i just stopped saying it and hoped it might work as a placebo instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ginger root powder pills works like a charm to alleviate motion sickness. If I recall rightly, Mythbusters tested a bunch of stuff purported to suppress motion sickness (Grant Imahara gets it bad) and ginger was found to be the most effective as well.</p>
<p>Whenever I play computer games nowadays, I take a couple of ginger root pills beforehand, otherwise I'll get sick within minutes and have to lie down.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in my teens, I could play all sorts of games without wanting to puke my guts out. Then slowly, in my late 20's, FPSs started to make me sick very quickly. Now in my mid 30's, any games in any genre with a narrow FOV or fast-moving graphics is a one-way autobahn to puke-fest. Without ginger pills, there's no way I can play anything for more than 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Most recent game I tried (a week ago or so) without popping ginger pills was Valkyria Chronicles. Even that gave me a major dizzy spell after a short while.</p>
<p>(Additional info: I'm using a GTX 970 with a V-Sync monitor. I'll probably try a G-Sync or FreeSync on my next upgrade).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went on a cruise a few years ago with my mom and kids. My mom swore up, down and sideways that the 'old wives tale' was pickled ginger for motion sickness, not candied. She preceded to eat a whole 3 Oz container and couldn't figure out why she was still sick.
Just a fun anecdote about dumb parents from a strangeredditor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just normal raw ginger root works as well, and it's probably much cheaper, especially considering, that you need like ginger of a size of an ant for several hours. I was badly carsick in both cars, buses and sometimes even trains,  but it does wonders. I just take off the peel in a small area, and usually use my (I know, so barbaric) my nails to grab off a bit, and keep on chewing it as long as I can (minutes) before swallowing.</p>
<p>You can probably buy a tiny ginger root for a dollar or half (or whatever currency), and it can last a family a whole trip, since you really need just a little, it is really damn strong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on a cruise and we used a homeopathic patch that we placed behind our ears instead of Dramamine and it worked real well. The patch lasted for 3 days and I didn't feel sea sick at all. I know it worked because I tried going without it and I felt really sick and I eventually gave in. Anybody knows the active ingredient on those things? </p>
<p>Edit: MQ&reg; Motion Sickness Patch,10 Count/Box <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S9FSLTU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_.026yb907ZRBD" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00S9FSLTU/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_.026yb907ZRBD</a></p>
<p>This is the product I believe. As you can see the ingredients are full of herbal stuff. Why are people downvoting? I'm only recounting my experience with the product. People are so fucking sensitive.People act like I claimed it cures cancer </p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: It wasn't homeopathic, it's herbal. Might work, might not. It seems to be more than just water with a bunch of random things diluted to nothing in it though.</p></div>		</li>
