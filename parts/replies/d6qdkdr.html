			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but given that any colour is derived from light, and black is the absence of that, is black a colour or just an absence? It's a pedantic question, but scientifically is it a colour?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>black objects are objects that tend to absorb all visible wavelengths of light.</p>
<p>red objects are objects that tend to absorb all wavelengths but red, or at least absorb enough of other colors to make it reflect mainly red.</p>
<p>but neither refer to photons per se, they refer to how certain objects interact with incoming photons to produce outgoing photons.</p>
<p>i'm not sure if there's a consensus on what &quot;color&quot; &quot;scientifically&quot; means.</p>
<p>there's no such thing as &quot;black light&quot; (barring the colloquial usage of blacklight as UV-dominant light), but there certainly are black objects. non-visible light is simply that, non-visible light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the physical sciences the concept of &quot;color&quot; isn't as useful as the concept of wavelength and frequency - color is a human concept imposed on an inhuman universe.</p>
<p>&quot;Scientifically&quot; the question you're asking can't really be answered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on context, but black can certainly be a color. We don't use colors to <em>directly</em> describe the wavelengths of photons reflected off a surface. We use colors to describe the sensory output this results in when it reaches the human eye. And in that context, we perceive the absence of anything in particular as a distinct color - black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, space isn't black. Space has no physical properties at all. The blackness you see is simply your eyes failing to perceive any visible wavelengths; the absence of color.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;color&quot; is usually defined as the perception of wavelength, so all of those &quot;invisible&quot; photons don't really count, either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point! I think Colour was defined by perception (what the human eye sees). It was only later discovered that it is a product of radiation. But the meaning of the word hasn't changed right?</p>
<p>I mean, is Infra-red a colour?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm writing a new answer here because my old one was wrong. The dominant contribution to COB is normal starlight at relatively low redshifts of z&lt;1. That there is more red says more about the types of stars being created than it says about expansion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This figure <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~pg3e14/nakshatra/cb.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> (from <a href="http://www.southampton.ac.uk/~pg3e14/nakshatra/nakshatra.html" target="_blank">this page</a>) puts all the backgrounds onto one image to see easier. As you pointed out for the figures in your links, this one is adding up photon power, not photon number, so even if the line was flat there are vastly more CMB photons than other ones.</p></div>		</li>
