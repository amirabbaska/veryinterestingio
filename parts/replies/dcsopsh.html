<p>Isn't this a direct result of the positive-flow principle? If we measured electron flow, we would have a &quot;left hand rule&quot; instead of the right-hand-rule, and positive rotation around electrical fields would be the other way around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before the electron was discovered, people assumed that positive charged particles moved around the circuit to the negative terminal. </p>
<p>We now know that the charge is carried by electrons flowing from the negative terminal to the positive terminal.</p>
<p>So there are two conventions: <em>Electron</em> flow and <em>Conventional Current</em> flow.</p>
<p>I'll tell you this much. As an electronics technician, I really don't care what way the electrons are flowing, all I care about is if myself or the load is going to get poked. Consider why is there over current protection on inputs? Because the current flows in. Could you imagine fusing the negative side of a device because you know electrons are flowing up? That would destroy an entire circuit. </p>
<p>So in the real world, we follow conventional current. On a scientific level in the lab, worry about the electron flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong.</p>
<p>The negatives are the moving charges <em>in metals</em>.   And only in solid metals at that.    For example, currents in battery acid are proton-flows.   And whenever you yourself get shocked, no electrons flowed through your flesh (it was +Na and -Cl ions mostly, plus +K ions, and other stuff.)   The same is true of the ground: it's salt or acid conductivity.  No electrons.</p>
<p>If we look at all the electric currents in the natural environment, we don't find metals, so we don't find electron-flows.  In brains and nerves, in ground-currents, all involve ion-flows.   (Well, the plasma currents such as lightning bolts are electron flows for the most part, with ionized air molecules contributing far less to the total amperes.)</p>
<p>&quot;Electricity is electrons&quot; is one of those lies-to-children.   It's much like believing that atoms are tiny little solar systems.  Trouble is, most technicians and even a few engineers aren't aware of the common situations with proton flows, ion flows, etc.   Embarassing!  There are even textbook-authors with this &quot;electrons&quot; misconception!   It's like finding a whole small community of professional chemists who never got past fourth grade, and still have no concept of electron orbitals, and who will angrily argue that atoms really are just like the tiny solar systems taught in grade-school.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the nice thing about electronics, new stuff gets added, but the existing stuff stays valid.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Electronics" target="_blank">The Art of Electronics</a> 2nd edition came out in 1989 and is often referred to as the bible of electronics and is still relevant in many ways, even after the 3rd edition came out in 2015.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charges in semiconductors are often thought of in terms of &quot;holes&quot;, which are positively charged atoms that electrons can &quot;fall into&quot;.  So when an electron jumps from one atom to the next it is convenient to describe this as a &quot;hole&quot; moving from one place to another.  But as far as I know, the positive charges (protons) never actually move in a semiconductor, any more than they move in a regular conductor.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I am wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right. Holes are pseudo-particles. They don't physically exist, but mathematically it's equivalent and easier to work with than having to keep track of every electron moving in the opposite direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons (within the context of semiconductor physics) are also quasiparticles, though.  Their dynamics are governed by an effective mass which is related to the material they're in as well as the population of other electrons within that material.  Neither electrons nor holes (as used with effective mass in a semiconductor) actually exist.  But as you say it's a convenient mathematical model of very complex behavior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find water analogies easier to wrap my head around while I'm learning about this in physics right now. Water being electrons and the flow of them being controlled by the resistance of the &quot;pipe&quot; and resistance being a combination of material in the pipe and the diameter. Also, have to think of electrons flowing from negative to positive by remembering the negative particles repel each other and are attracted to positive. </p>
<p>I'm wayyy too new to be teaching anyone, but I can help with analogies that helped me to understand concepts :-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well ... it's complicated.  Neither electrons nor holes behave within a semiconductor like free-space electrons.  This is where the concept of &quot;effective mass&quot; comes into play.  In both cases we have abstractions describing the state populations.  In all cases it's electrons switching between states but in fact whether we're talking about &quot;electrons&quot; or &quot;holes&quot; we're actually talking about quasiparticles with an effective mass which describe very complex physics that depend on exactly which states are populated and how/why.  So when talking about electrons and holes in a semiconductor it's not really sensible to talk about either one as the &quot;real&quot; thing moving; both are abstractions described by the population-dependent effective masses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is very confusing for me in regards to welding. the positive lead is always considered the &quot;stinger&quot; and is VERY well insulated, as opposed to the negative lead, which is a bare metal clamp that can be touched at any time, even when the unit is on (with an AC only arc welder).   </p>
<p>with DC welding units, you can choose which direction the arc moves. jumping from negative to positive, or positive to negative (which obviously has a bit of an effect on how the metal melts/weld is formed).</p>
<p>i have touched the stinger through a thin glove on my AC unit. i could actually feel the electrical field running through my hand, and sort of searching or a good ground, if you will. </p>
<p>why is this not so with the negative lead?</p>
<p>*edit: it would make sense that the DC unit probably just switches the wires of the leads with a switch at the box, instead of actually making the arc jump from negative to positive somehow</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In normal AC, there's no such thing as a positive or negative lead.  There's only hot and neutral/ground.  Exact same thing as household wiring.</p>
<p>With DC, if you're switching anything it's which side is positive, not which way current flows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a case where our mislabeling of the terminals has caused trouble? Ie is there a case where we say &quot;okay I know this is the positive, but we actually need the negative here because we mislabeled electricity&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Careful, this doesn't have to be true. In household AC, the neutral is essentially ground, and the other hot wire goes + and - 177Vp-p. It doesn't have to be this way, like for center tapped transformers. You could have AC where the wires swap voltages, and both are 80V away from a ground. </p>
<p>With DC you most certainly are chasing which way conventional current flows, the same as switching a AA battery backwards</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In an AC welder, the &quot;Positive&quot; lead isn't actually positive in the strictest sense. Instead, what's likely going on is that your &quot;negative&quot; lead is wired to Neutral which is in turn wired to ground (though by code only at the service entrance). As such, there won't be much of a voltage difference between the negative lead and the earth, or you, or your workpiece.</p>
<p>From what I have read, though, is that arc welders are usually setup such that the system runs at a fairly high voltage initially so that it can strike the arc, but once the arc is established the voltage drops dramatically as the work of welding is actually done by the current flowing through the system, not the voltage. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>this is true. the intensity of the arc is controlled through the amperage of the discharge. arc welders have a dial indicating amperage, and you can turn it up and down. most common steel welds need about 70-90 amps for a good weld.</p>
<p>mine dials all the way up to 250, which would be used for something big thick and structural</p></div>		</li>
