<p>the flag of Scotland isn't 'superior' to St. Patrick's cross (or vice versa)</p>

<p>Actually, this isn't true: St Andrew's cross is above St Patrick's cross in the upper hoist canton, which is the more honorable (and therefore &quot;superior&quot;) position. This was deliberate: it reflects the fact that of the two countries, Scotland is the more senior member of the Union.</p></div>		</li>
