			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in my early fifties and am embarking on a second degree, in mathematics. One reason is professional (an interest in data science and analytics). The second reason is that mathematics is a dragon I feel I need to slay. </p>
<p>As you alluded to in your post, during my high school and my first go around in college, I focused solely on what I call the mechanics...getting things to add up....getting the line straight on a graph. It's no surprise that I found math boring and painful. </p>
<p>This time around, I find myself naturally curious as to the &quot;why&quot;. It makes learning a lot easier. </p>
<p>I'm currently working my way through Analytic Geometry and Trig, with an eye toward &quot;The Beast&quot; (Calculus) next month. Your post was the most accurate and succinct explanation of the &quot;why&quot; as I've seen. Thanks for taking the time to write it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a current data scientist I want to caution against getting a math degree if your only reason to pursue it is to get into the field. You don't need to be a mathematician to do predictive modeling and calculus really isn't terribly important to anything I do on a daily basis (maybe derivates but that's it). It's much more about learning tools and languages and adding complexity as needed. </p>
<p>Not saying this why you're doing it, but if it is it could be worth taking a step back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any advice for those trying to get into the field? I am about to graduate with a B.S in CS with a Data Science Specialization. I work in a bioinformatics lab developing software for interactive visualizations. I know R and Python. I feel like companies won't even look at me because I don't have at least a master's. Are entry level data science positions a thing? Thanks for your time!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a degree in math and work in data science. I love my degree, but something more applicable would be statistics, or applied math. Senior level topics, such a abstract algebra and topology, are hard as fuck, but you'll never use them. If you can, focus on probability and stochastic processes, or topics that are useful for the business world and not just research, do that.</p></div>		</li>

It may be that in most data analysis jobs that you won't use algebra or topology, but having those tools is certainly better than not having them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The calculus of how fast things change is called differential calculus, and the calculus of adding up lots of little things is called integral calculus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fuck me. It never occurred to me to consider why they were called &quot;differentiation&quot; and &quot;integration&quot;.... One is about the study of tiny differences, one is the study of integrating tiny things into a whole. Makes <em>so</em> much more intuitive sense now.</p>
<p>I guess that's what comes from just being taught the string of operations you need to perform by rote, and not the underlying concepts. Probably points to my teachers not <em>really</em> having understood it themselves...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that's what comes from not using it after you have been taught it.</p>
<p>Everyone is taught math the same way and there is nothing wrong with learning it by rote. These are very complicated subjects you must learn in a short amount of time and very few people actually are able to understand it in that short amount of time so the only way to pass is by memorizing.</p>
<p>The real understanding comes from using them over and over again later and the problem comes from people learning it then never using it again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your broader point about time constraints / different abilities; although I've been finding that the rote system has had some shortcomings that are only being filled in now by other teachers, ie not by my own practice. </p>
<p>One example would be the concept of the unit circle, and how it applies to trig; something never explained to me, yet drastically changed my understanding of the subject.</p>
<p>I was just given a list of identities, but never really given the greater context for them - even proofs were just applying the rules in the most abstract way possible, with no real understanding of <em>why</em> I was doing these things.</p>
<p>For me, that context has made those rote facts &quot;stick&quot;. I understand why the rules are what they are much better now, so it's that much easier to understand how to approach a problem. </p>
<p>The rise of animated visual media has also been a huge boon - being able to visualise geometric concepts in has made a huge difference.</p>
<p>You're entirely right that understanding comes with practice. But applying rules without thought <em>isn't</em> practice, and that's what I was taught to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but the important part isn't that you can take the derivative or integral of some crazy equation. That is just mechanics and most high level mathematicians would struggle with using some of the more advanced integration techniques (unless they teach calculus and use it regularly).</p>
<p>The point is you remember the concept of a derivative. It is the rate of change of something. You remember things about integrals. It's the &quot;opposite&quot; of a derivative (but with that pesky C). It's the area under a line. That sort of stuff.</p>
<p>Also, most importantly, you remember the <em>idea</em> of applying algorithms and developing logical steps to solve problems. This is &quot;real math&quot; and what you are learning when you finally get to some sort of class that focuses on proofs instead of applying an algorithm to a problem (which probably won't start until roughly junior level math classes in college).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably why they teach mostly proof based math in my university. Aside from the regular level calculus course, which is only partially proofs, everything else is proof based. I'm not a math whiz, so the idea terrified me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know! This is what I always think as I now read about math. I also remember never really knowing what the application of math was. So I learned how to do the equations and graphic and such, but it was always some abstract concept and not what I thought of as solving a real world problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really don't understand this attitude. Even if most people don't use calculus on a day-to-day basis, don't you feel that it is important to have a basic understanding  of how things work? </p>
<p>Calculus is the basis of innumerable technological advances over the past few hundred years. If you never teach it, who will be able to continue those advances?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because you don't remember it doesn't mean it was time wasted.</p>
<p>Learning this trained your brain, made it more comfortable at doing abstract stuff, which later helped you do other things. Yes, even today, you are probably still benefiting from this early learning.</p></div>		</li>
