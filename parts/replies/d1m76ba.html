			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  The set of numbers that &quot;looks&quot; random is much, much bigger than the set of numbers that &quot;looks&quot; ordered.  So it in many real ways it IS less likely that an ordered sequence will be chosen than a &quot;random&quot; one.  But every individual ordered sequence is just as likely as every individual &quot;random&quot; sequence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking about counting numbers, which start with 1-2-3-4-5. And the fact that it starts there and continues in that order is anything but random.</p>
<p>If you were picking colors or locations in space, or slices of a donut, or anything that didn't already have a defined order over it, you'd probably eliminate most of that bias easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any specific ordered sequence like that has to be (much!) more unlikely than any other equal length unordered sequence, though.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that an ordered sequence is less likely than some single semi-random sequence, but now we're picking one sequence out of the many possible which is always going to be very unlikely.<br />
What I'm saying doesn't even depend on the sequence being ordered... people just look at the ordered ones because of our proclivity to pick out patterns, but any one particular sequence is always going to less likely to occur than all others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was my thought too. Couldn't we look at past winning numbers and determine that an ordered sequence like that is less likely to be randomly selected than an unordered sequence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but while the winning ticket is very very very likely to be &quot;unordered&quot; looking, the subset of possible tickets which look unordered is huge, while the subset of tickets that seem &quot;ordered&quot; is small. You aren't picking all ordered vs all unordered, you are picking 1 single ticket within one of those two groups.</p>
<p>Each individual ticket within that huge subset has an equal probability of being picked as 1-2-3-4-5-6.</p>
<p>So lets say the set of 5 possible numbers 1-20 has 3.2 million combinations (allows repeat numbers. The subset of tickets that appear &quot;very ordered&quot; such as (1-2-3-4-5) or (13-13-13-13-13) has about 10,000 numbers. The subset of unordered, &quot;random&quot; appearing numbers has the other 3,190,000 numbers in it.</p>
<p>So there is a 99.7% chance that the winning ticket looks &quot;unordered&quot; or &quot;random&quot;.</p>
<p>However, each unordered ticket has only a 1/3,190,000 of being right GIVEN that the winning ticket is unordered. In total that means only a 1/3,200,000 chance of being right, as is immediately obvious. </p>
<p>While an ordered ticket has a 1/10,000 chance of being right given that the winning ticket is ordered, which only happens ~0.3% of the time, which gives us a total chance of 1/3,200,000 chance of winning.</p>
<p>This is pretty obvious stuff, but that is why I called it a grouping problem. People say &quot;The winning ticket is almost never an ordered group of numbers.&quot; as a reason to pick an unordered looking ticket. But you aren't JUST picking &quot;ordered vs unordered&quot; you are picking a specific sequence within one of those groups, which removes any advantage you have choosing a random looking sequence.</p>
<p>It is as if people think they were &quot;closer&quot; to winning if they had 32-6-11-67-3 and the winning number was 31-22-44-28-51 than they are if they had picked 1-2-3-4-5-6, despite that absolutely not being true. Imagine if they said &quot;at least mine was a random sequence just like the winning ticket&quot;. It sounds silly, but that is what people are doing in their head.</p></div>		</li>
