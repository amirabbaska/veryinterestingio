<p>The main problems is its oxide, which melts at a significantly higher temperature than the base metal and forms instantly in air. making it super easy to over heat the base metal into a liquid while it appears solid due to the thin oxide holding keeping the shape. then once the oxide breaks the base metal pours out onto the floor. </p>

<p>So this is the reason why the oxidation is key.</p>
<p>And the other thing seems to be the high heat conductivity. </p></div>		</li>
