			<div class="markdown"><p>I read in a book about genetic differences, that there are two genes involved in smelling it: one gene controls whether the odor is produced, and one controls whether you can smell it. So everyone can have any combo of those genes being &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;, thus maybe smelling it or not, and also producing the odor or not.</p></div>		</li>
