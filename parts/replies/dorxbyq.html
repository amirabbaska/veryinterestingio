<p>There are thousands. Which genes specifica did you look at and which regulatory pathways did you look at?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait... so a hair shaft is actually a tall stack of interlinked dead &quot;hair cells&quot;, like a very tall stack of pancakes glued together? I always thought it was an extruded, always-had-been-inert substance, similar (in concept) to fingernails. At least, that's how I <em>thought</em> fingernails formed, but now I'm not sure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you elaborate more on how the cells are formed and bound together?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, fingernails are formed in a similar manner. Cells elongate and flatten and fill themselves with keratin, which is the hard, binding substance OP mentioned. It just looks like a single inert substance because of that binding together. </p></div>		</li>

<p>So in a sense the cells 'fossilize' themselves? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but hair, skin and nails are all made up of a protein called keratin. When lotions promise to &quot;revive&quot; your hair/nails/skin they're essentially just coating it in keratin until it grows out healthy again.</p>
<p>It's considered dead because there is no blood going to it and no  nerve endings. That's why it doesn't hurt when it gets cut.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not op, but just wanted to piggy back on it.</p>
<p>“Stacked like a pancake” would be an over simplification, yes similar, the hair follicle produces keratin/hair cells at the base and as more gets “grown” the rest get pushed out. How ever the difference with nail beds os that hair follicles have the three stages: anagen, catagenn, and telagen. Or for simplicity: active phase, rest phase, and death phase. </p>
<p>During the active phase hair is growing normally as you’re accustomed to, and this phase is what ultimately defines your maximum length of hair and the reason why not everyone can just grow super long to their lower back hair even after 5 years of not cutting your hair. And this part is genetics you get the maximum length of hair life has given you, thats it</p>
<p>The next phase, the resting phase is what happens after the active phase, here the hair will remain in the follicle for a certain duration of time (again determined by genetics, however could be manipulated, ill add a comment about this later) the hair remains in the follicle but doesnt grow any further anymore here.</p>
<p>Lastly the death phase, this is when your hair strands fall out of the follicles and the cycle starts all over again with a new strand of hair growing from it.</p>
<p>Now the important thing to note from these 3 stages is that all your hair follicles are not synced with each other, all of your hair is at different stages, and thats why you dont just go bald as soon as the death phase occurs. When you shower or through out the day you’ll notice random stands fall out, those are the follicles that happened to be in the death phase. All of your hair follicles are growing or resting at their own pace. </p>
<p>So now for a fun fact on how Rogain works: how it works is they prolong the resting phase indefinitely so that you can have the “maximum” length and fullness of your head of hair without the follicles entering death phase and the hair falling out. However because of this if you ever stop using rogain, depending on how long you have been using rogain all your follicles will have synced up with each other in the resting phase, so they will all enter the death phase as soon aa rogain is not applied and you instantly go bald.</p>
<p>Now on to a different part of your question on straight hair/wavy/curly and what causes it. This is actually the “shape” of the follicle that causes this. A person with near perfect circle exit and the “straight” bulb as the follicle will have straight hair (think asian silky straight hair). But if the “exit hole” of the follicle were more oval in shape or “squished circle” is when you start getting more wavy or frizzy hair. When the actual “bulb” of the hair follicle instead of going straight down into the scalp, starts to curve is when you start getting curls in your hair, and the more extreme the bulb is curved the curlier the hair becomes. Think of the follicle shaped almost like a fishhook inside the scalp and the hair that grows out of it will be like the afrocentric hair see. So depending on the degree of “bend” in the follicle will determine your curl pattern.</p>
<p>Last fun fact: forcibly pulling out your hair outside of the “death phase” can easily damage the follicle shape causing the next hair to grow “wirey”. This is why many people who has early onset of white hair that started plucked them all out have more pronounced, unruly, wirey white hair growing that doesnt look like the rest of the hair.</p>
<p>I tried to keep this as eli5 as i could. If i missed anything or have questions let me know. </p>
<p>Source: im a professional hair dresser and believe it or not they teach you all this shit in cosmology school. Im probably one of the very few who paid enough attention to remember all of this though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Molecular Genetics and Cell Biology (I was attempting to understand the how the genes that make the skin what it is are controlled)
2) Hope it's okay to pass this - would lead right to me! :)
3) Went into medicine - now I'm a doc and do cancer research on skin cancer.  Trying to understand how the genes that make skin what it is are messed up in cancer.  It might sound strange, but understand how hair forms can tell us a lot about how cancer forms (just another pathway for cells go down... what that's not nearly so beautiful as hair!)</p></div>		</li>
