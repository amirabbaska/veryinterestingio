I totally agree with the propagation issue. Even small movements of the phone can have dramatic effects on the signal. If you can move the phone back and forth between good signal and bad signal just by moving it a couple of feet this is the reason. </p>
<p>Otherwise it can be because of cell breathing and the near-far effect. In CDMA all phones use the same frequency within a cell. Thus they will &quot;talk in each others mouths&quot;. This is no problem normally as the cell will ask the handsets to transmit with different power. If you are further away your handset will be asked to transmit with more power than closer handsets. Thus at the base station, all signals will be at the same level. And as they are &quot;speaking with different languages&quot; or codes the base station can distinguish between the signals.</p>
<p>If you are on the edge of a cell your phone will be transmitting with its maximum power to reach the base station. Now another user is stating to use data between you and the base station (near-far). This will cause more interference and suddenly your phone cannot &quot;shout loud enough&quot; (transmit with enough power) for the base station to hear it. Thus you will drop from the cell (The cell is breathing out). Ie the effective size of the cell has been decreased. You will then change to change to another cell or technology or lose coverage. </p>

<p>Dead zones in your house are likely to be cause by multipath interference however as signals bounce around they destructively cancel in certain areas. Moving your phone can make this effect much more pronounced.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is there any tool a non-technical person can use to evaluate this? Are the hot and dead spacers relatively stable or, for instance, is a steel saucepot on the stove likely to have a noticeable effect (I.e. sensitive dependence)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your steel pot? No. A big ol' steel truck? Yes. Radio waves are energy propagated from a transmitter, and are commonplace in everything technological. (Propagate is a fancy term meaning 'travel'; cars drive, ships sail, radio waves propagate.) Dead spots can appear in your home for a multitude of reasons. The first could be the structure of your home - many walls composed of different or dense materials could interfere with the propagation of a signal into a particular space. Another could be the frequency of the transmitting radio wave. Different frequencies and different bands are used for different purposes, because they have different characteristics. Lower-frequency bands (VLF, LF, for example) are used for long-range military communications because those bands' physical wavelengths are longer and can literally go around large geographical features like mountains. The downside is that very little data can be sent on those waves. High-frequency bands (VHF, UHF, SHF, for example) <em>can</em> send massive amounts of data efficiently over relatively short distances, but are more susceptible to interference by man-made or natural objects, including the weather. Cell phones operate in the UHF, which is governed by line-of-sight (sorta) rules. The third possibility is the way the wave is propagated; it could be being transmitted in such a manner that it passes through an outer wall easily, but is weakened and simply reflects off of an inner wall, not providing access in the space beyond. </p>
<p>There are most certainly ways that you can detect whether you have dead spots in your home. You've more than likely already noticed them! Use a laptop or a cell phone (for Wi-Fi and Cell Signals, respectively) and try to load a webpage or download something. If it's a cell signal, there's not much you can do about it except buy a booster from online (they work like routers, and boost the signal). But if it's a Wi-Fi aignal, go back to your router or MODEM and adjust one of the antennae to point directly at the space in question. If you absolutely must have a signal in that space, move the router or MODEM into that room, or closer to it. </p>
<p>I hope I answered your question!</p></div>		</li>
