			<div class="markdown"><p>More details. The thing about these storms is that the ocean is a large place. The rainfall is also pulling that moisture from the ocean so the salinity does not change much at all locally. Temp is also minimally affected. Really the action in the atmosphere doesn't translate well to under the water. The big 30ft waves you see in hurricanes are often the result of the winds blowing over long distances with no bottom to interfere with the wave formation. In those conditions, what does a fish care if the water moves 5-10ft? There is nothing to reference to so would it even know it was moving?</p>
<p>The big impact would be when the waves crash into the bottom and reefs. That is when you see the waves breaking on the surface. The bottom interferes with the wave base and the water gets pushed upward. When this happens, the detritus is thrown all around, corals break off and scatter, and general reef chaos and destruction will take place. Like I said before though, this is good for the overall health of the reef since those coral fragments are still alive and can grow somewhere else. This is how many species propagate when they can not move on their own.</p>
<p>The largest impact of all though is right on the shore line where rainwater drains into the ocean. This will affect the salinity and the water temp. This is also where life had evolved to survive these conditions. Fish and crustaceans will retreat to deeper water during the storm and stay there until conditions improve. The ones that stay are used to these conditions and thrive on the lack of predators or competition. With the runoff, also comes food. This provides many opportunities for sea creatures to get a mean do whatever their instincts say is most critical at the moment.</p>
<p>Overall people crave stability, but nature thrives on chaos. When a tree falls in the forest bugs and mushrooms eat the tree, animals use it for shelter/cover, and new plants rush to fill in that gap and take in all the light they can. The ocean is no different. Chaos and destruction brings new opportunity. Humans are the only ones so invested in long term structures and such. As long as the entire ecosystem is not threatened then nature bounces back, more often than not better than before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waves extend to a depth dependent on wave <em>length</em>, not height. The rule of thumb is that below half of a wavelength effects are negligible. Particle motion has decayed to 4% of the surface value by this point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a pretty steep transition too for shorter wavelengths.  I was scuba diving near Cancun and there were very uncomfortable 6-8' waves on the surface (we should not have gone in).  When rising up at the end of the dive, there was a point near the surface where my feet were completely still but my head (closer to the surface) was being pulled hard back and forth.  Getting on the boat was quite the challenge as the ladder was moving up and down very quickly.</p>
<p>The near shore environment has to be more susceptible to storm damage than off shore.   </p></div>		</li>
