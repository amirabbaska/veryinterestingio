			<div class="markdown"><p>I bet those resins are harder to deal with than super glue, but most people wouldn't expect that. I've synthesised an epoxide resin and stuff like that the lab in uni, it's just really hard to handle if you slightly mess up the temperature etc. Most students literally destroyed the flask, because there was no other way to get their product out haha</p>
<p>What is your educational background and do you like your job? As a chem student I always feel like lots of jobs sound like there is a lot of routine and it's basically every day the same, but from my last summer job I know that sometimes a job is completely different from what I've imagined. So I would just love to hear what you do or what a typical job the company would be like.<br />
Is the focus of your work something like process engineering or do you need to know a lot about polymer chemistry?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I studied three years at a private academy in Sweden and wether I like my job or not depends on if my boss has touched anything in the controlroom recently. The guy is either entirely clueless or sadistic. I enjoy it very much otherwise.</p>
<p>The job itself is just fine. It'll vary from facility to facility, but as we run batches with very specific recipes we're smothered with routines. However, a batch can vary wildly from the other. </p>
<p>For example, one batch called 5027X is very laid back, 90% of the work is from the controlroom. Lots of hot coco/coffee &amp; shittalking with the crew whilst  a 3909L will keep you running all night long. Nothing is allowed to go wrong as many of our reactions are violently exothermic (another big reason why we keep our reactors below 0.3x atmos-pressure, so that the boiling point is kept low).</p>
<p>Knowledge about polymer chemistry is very helpful but it's not necessary. In my position it's more important to know which kinds of pumps you can rund dry safely &amp; which ones will implode if you run it dry. The majority of the work-essentiam knowledge is taught on-site, and this goes for almost every facility I can think of.</p></div>		</li>
