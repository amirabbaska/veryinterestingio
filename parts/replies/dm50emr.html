			<div class="markdown"><p>one of my moms favorite stories to tell about me is the time she let me walk around our small neighborhood. everyone in the neighborhood knew about my 3 year old self, and was protective of me, so she felt fine letting me wander around. I walked around for a bit, until I found what I considered to be two treasures. I ran back to her, one clutched in each hand, holding them both up high. my prizes. I ran up to her, grinning, and revealed them. I had a dog turd in each hand. she pretended to be incredibly proud of me and my precious findings. she later told me she went back into the house, called her best friend and they laughed together for hours. not my proudest babyhood moment, but I still think it's really sweet that she prided me on my dog shit prizes </p></div>		</li>

<p>When my son was about 18 months I sat on this chair at my dad's place and my son couldn't contain himself. He was grinning from ear to ear, so proud of himself. So I looked under that chair and found a massive cache of toys and half eaten biscuits.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's truly bizarre. Was it only biscuits? No other food? How often does your father make biscuits? Why did he allow your son to leave the dining area with them? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biscuits are the only food which a child that age is allowed to crawl around with. The normal food he eats at the table stays there. I think its a good survival strategy for young humans to cache food. I bet young chimpanzees and monkeys do the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly the reason that is given in a textbook that I am reading for one of my classes. Children devote a lot of energy to making other people regard what they are regarding. Whether it is nonverbal (pointing, handing an object to you) or verbal, it creates a shared experience.</p></div>		</li>
