			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting point, but you can sort of draw the opposite conclusion. Our bodies prioritize removal and/or destruction of pathogens to the point where it jeopardizes our own survival because it is to our advantage as a species. The reason your immune system can kill you is because it is makes sense for it to be 'too effective' and prevent the pathogen from spreading. Although, viruses have taken advantage of this as well. </p>
<p>edit: One more thing. It is actually not a good thing; for a virus, that it kills its host. Like a fire that burns too quickly, illnesses that kill too quickly are less likely to survive in the long run. That is why the viruses that actually do kill quickly are not usually endemic to our species. They evolved to exist without harming their specific host too much; but when the same virus (bird flu, swine flu) infects people, some scary shit can happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hep C, for instance. Totally random &quot;incubation&quot; time. You can carry it all your life or contract it and die within months. The carriers are the reason it's so prevalent.</p>
<p>That, and the decision to share needles. You ~can~ contract it through intercourse, but almost every case I run into is due to risky IV drug use behaviors.</p>
<p>For those addicted to IV drugs, I sympathize, and the best advice I can give is NEVER share needles. Someday hopefully you'll kick the habit. Though possible, it's much harder to kick Hep C out. Harvoni is the new breakthrough treatment. Taking the full course = about $100,000.</p></div>		</li>
