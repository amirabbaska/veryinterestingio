			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, was going to say that it probably cost more than $2.50 for that individual chicken, but less than $2.5 million for a million chickens due to economy of scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chickens are an inexpensive animal. If an individual bird looks like it is going to cost more than the rest it will probably be discarded at the farm. </p>
<p>To have a vet look at a chicken will cost more than it is worth per pound. Something like a cow or pig, on the other hand, you might have a vet check over and give it some drugs to keep alive making some animals cost slightly more to raise than the rest. </p>
<p>But a chicken, if you have to stop and calculate if it's financially worth it to save his life, then it isn't. </p></div>		</li>
