			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this same problem. Super frustrating to have cold feet for 8+ hours until getting home. I do the slip off the shoe thing when I can, but generally, I'm very physically uncomfortable because of it--feet like ice. :/</p>
<p>It didn't hit me until my mid 20s. A combination of work stress and too much coffee (over the years) to the point that the least bit of caffeine or anxiety sets it off.</p>
<p>I worked at a coffee shop immediately after college (where I got free espresso throughout the day) for a while, so that probably didn't help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have ice feet all day at work. I keep slipper socks under my desk so I can change into them. I have been using a heating blanket just on my feet at night with no socks and it's wonderful. Also I put them in as hot as I can take it water sometimes and it warms my feet and everything up super quick! Let them air dry after. Also even just continually  wiggling my toes can help a little bit too. Kinda interesting I also didn't have thing prob till around 25. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you tried moisturising your feet? Try heavy creams like whipped Shea butter or thick Nivea creams. I no longer have sweaty or smelly feet since I do that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My feet have never really smelled, but I make sure they stay clean and dry. It is important to make sure the skin on your feet can breathe too so keeping them soft is also important. I don't use lotions for that but if it works for you, great. Pedicures work wonders for that too I'm told. May try one this year. </p></div>		</li>
