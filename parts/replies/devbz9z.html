			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you mixing in creamer? Steve Mould made a video about how that happens with drinks like hot chocolate because it's actually a suspension/emulsion and mixing changes the density distribution which in turn changes the pitch when you tap the mug. </p>
<p>Try mixing it, pulling your spoon out and continually taping the rim of the mug. If it works properly, you should be able to hear the pitch of the mug change as your drink stratifies again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An extremely good but extremely difficult question.</p>
<p>A splash is a very complicated type of flow, we can't write down an equation that dictates how a liquid will splash just like we can't predict turbulent flow. What we instead do is rely on numerical models that predict general behaviours and we link these general behaviours to fundamental characteristics of the system. In this fashion we build empirical rather than analytical models of a system.</p>
<p>Viscosity (and in this case surface tension to some extent) changes with temperature and also heavily dictates the behaviour of a liquid when it &quot;splashes&quot;. It is one of these fundamental characteristics. If I build a numerical model for liquid splashing then viscosity will be one of my key parameters that changing it effects the behaviour.</p>
<p>Someone might be able to give a nice explanation of what changing the viscosity does but I can't. I can picture it as different sized droplets, different air void sizes, different turbulent scale lengths  as being more typical for certain viscosities. Something along those lines anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about actual pitch and vorticity/chaotic stuff, but the viscosity will affect the timbre of a sound in at least one simple way.  A more viscous liquid will tend to make a &quot;purer&quot; sound due to energy loss being concentrated more in certain scales.  Taking it to the extreme, an extremely viscous fluid hitting a surface will act almost like a solid, and the sound it makes will sound more like two objects.  This will tend to create a sound with a few fundamentals, and then overtone harmonics.  Similar to how hitting a hard, thick surface like a steel plate creates a pure, ringing tone.</p>
<p>A less viscous fluid will be more like hitting a cymbal.  Cymbals are so thin that they bounce all over the place in a large number of different ways, exposing the nonlinearity of the stress-strain curve.  This causes them to have a much more &quot;static-y&quot; sound.  Less viscous fluids break up chaotically, and sound will be distributed much more randomly and evenly in pitch.  Various parts of the fluids will be moving and interacting at very different speeds.  In a more viscous fluid, different parts of the fluid will be closer in velocity, and will make more similar sounds.</p>
<p>Edit: Actually, the relationship between pitch and vorticity is relatively straightforward too.  More viscous fluids will resist intense vortices, which are concentrations of movement.  By definition a viscous fluid is one that diffuses movement into the fluid as a whole.  This means a more viscous fluid will have wider vortices than a less viscous fluid, and a lower pitch.  </p>
<p>I just tested it and the pitch did indeed drop when I turned the water from hot to cold.  Sounded like maybe a quarter octave?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm. Okay. But why would the change in the speed of sound make the water sound any different? Perhaps you're hearing some sort of frequency change between the two temperatures of water?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the real actor are the air bubbles in the fluid - those account for the sound modified by what you mention - found several years ago the paper&amp;simulation looking for cheap procedural methods to generate sound. It's also easily illustrated by thinking of carbonated water - same temperature but different sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am sure the metal clinking in the mug has a lot more to do with the ceramic and metal heating up than the fluid.  As these heat their modulus of elasticity (stiffness) goes down , lowering their natural frequency. The noise you hear is the two structures responding at their natural frequencies.</p>
<p>The change in the sound of water in pipes is the viscosity changing which changes how vortices are formed and shed as the water races through the pipes and around bends</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a plausible enough sounding answer to the question of why water sounds different when it's hot. That doesn't answer why something with a different viscosity sounds different. If you had two liquids with identical densities and different viscosity, would they sound different?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Almost right.</p>
<p>It changes the speed at which sound waves travel through the air i.e the speed of sound. The air is heated right above the water.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above, I have seen a mathematical simulation of this during my physics undergrad.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I find it weird that you'd say that the answer is mundane. Why dispel the mystique of everyday physics? Perhaps I am easily enamoured, but being able to observe, measure, and predict various &quot;mundane&quot; phenomena in the world around us is amazing! These are the things that our modern understanding of the world and how it works are founded upon!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. The answer's only mundane if you make it so. If you say it's because of viscosity and then define viscosity, of course that's boring! It's the &quot;how&quot; not the &quot;what&quot; that's interesting, so explain the physics!</p></div>		</li>
