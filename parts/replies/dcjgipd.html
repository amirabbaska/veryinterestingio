			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer the first question: synthetic cells &quot;talk&quot; to natural cells via chemical signals, mostly small molecules. </p>
<p>This is relatively new field still, two years ago there was a transformative paper showing how synthetic cells can interact with bacteria, effectively &quot;translating&quot; a chemical signal from the environment into a signal that bacteria can act on <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms5012" target="_blank">link</a>
Similar principle can be applied to eavesdropping on wuorum sensing bacteria using emulsion-encapsulated synthetic cells: <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2016/ib/c5ib00301f#!divAbstract" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<p>Nobody have (yet) shown efficient interfacing with mammalian cells. We are working on it, but for many reasons it's hard. For one, lipid liposomes tend to merge with cell membranes, so our synthetic cells fuse before they get a chance to do anything useful. </p>
<p>We, and other groups, are pursuing this mostly because we want to be able to use the programmability and ease of design of synthetic cells to read out signals from natural cells (pick up disease markers, etc.) and/or deliver drugs - so, all applications of communication via small molecules.</p>
<p>Mr_Stitch already replied the organ question.
I can add that I know of people trying to design synthetic cells to do simple &quot;chemical factory&quot; cells - including some human ones, but nothing as complicated as a full organ, with vasculature and different cell types. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you replace the <em>function</em> of an organ if not the organ itself? For example, thin sheets of insulin producing cells, or thyroxine producing cells, or something like that? Presumably encased in some sort of plastic that won't provoke an immune response, but that is permeable enough to let oxygen and nutrients (and the desired enzymes or hormones) pass through?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that's basically where insulin pumps are headed. They now have insulin pumps that are combined with glucose monitoring devices. So the pump gets continuous feedback as to the blood glucose levels, and doses accordingly (i.e. inject insulin to bring blood glucose levels down). </p>
<p>Now to be a truly &quot;artificial&quot; pancreas, you would also want to be able to inject glucagon, which is the other hormone the pancreas releases (and which causes liver to release glucose (i.e. bring levels back up if they are low)). And people are working on that as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would the artificial &quot;organ&quot; receive feed back? Someone with diabetes doesn't just need insulin, they need it at specific times. I think it's just a complicated issue and modeling after our own organs is probably easier than redesigning them</p>
<p>I could actually see this working in someone with kidney failure where most work happens because of concentration gradients but idk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I currently work in a tissue engineering lab. To answer your second question: unlikely.</p>
<p>The current main problem that researchers are facing in building organs is vascularization. Cells usually need to be within 50 um of a vessel in order to have nutrients and oxygen properly diffuse to them. It's easy to do 2D tissue culture (a few cell layers thick at most) since the media can penetrate through, but creating actual 3D organs remains a huge obstacle currently. That's why synthetic ears (cartilage) and corneas have been created so far, because these organs don't need to be well vascularized.</p>
<p>That's why I'm unsure if synthetic cells would help much, because cell programming is hard enough and so building them bottom-up into mature, functioning cells would be very much so. In a lot of tissue engineering labs we rather rework cell signaling pathways i.e. upregulating certain pathways to achieve our goals. For instance we may use vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to help create new blood vessels in our tissue constructs. On that note too stem cells, both embryonic and induced-pluripotent (though embryonic tend to work better), are artificially differentiated through reworking cell-fate pathways that mimic developmental biology. </p>
<p>If you have more questions feel free to ask! I'm currently on mobile so I can't really link sources, but hopefully later I can link to some review articles on the topic! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Teeth aren't really a type of tissue since it's not living exactly. Though I'm not an expert on this side of tissue engineering since my projects focus on the liver!
