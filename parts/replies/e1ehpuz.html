			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there really a significant difference between an infection and an inflammatory process brought on by over colonization of normal flora? The immune system reacts the same way. I used that language to simplify things. </p>
<p>The first sentence of the abstract you linked uses the phrase “opportunistic pathogen” to describe p acnes. That’s exactly what I was referring to in my post. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is becoming increasingly clear that the inflammatory lesions in acne and rosacea may be more the result of inflammatory dysregulation rather than infection. The bacteria may play a role, but this is a secondary role and not a primary role. To claim that acne is an infectious disease or the result of an infection has not been considered correct for a very long time. BTW, the organism is now &quot;C. Acnes&quot; and not &quot;P. acnes.&quot; This phenomenon of reclassification has occurred many times in my career.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response! Very interesting and it makes sense; isn’t it the product of bacterial digestion (lipids) not the bacteria themselves that causes the disease? In my head I kind of equated this with a toxin (a la C diff), but it doesn’t have to be the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true that there're bacteria on our skin and sebum at all time. The problem is when our pores are blocked with dirt or dead skin cells, sebum would be trapped in our follicle and build up pressure to the point where it cracks the follicle's wall, bacteria then slip through those crack and trigger the inflammatory response. So technically it's an infection. Edit: Exceed sebum production also cause follicle crack, like from using too many harsh products on your face which dehydrate the skin and your skin trying to compensate and pumping out sebum too fast.</p>
<p>This is a little unrelated but Isotretinoin like Accutane should be the very last resort after all the other treatment <strong>combined</strong> fail, that is: use <strong>mild</strong> cleansers to clean dirt and extra sebum, mild chemical exfoliants every few days to clean dead skin cells (prevent follicle blockage), toner and moisturizer to hydrate your skin and keep it hydrated (also regulate your natural sebum production), drink enough water, and most importantly a healthy diet with little to no dairy and rich in vitamins C, E, A, basically more fruit and veggies. If you have patches of ance on shoulders or side of your faces, 100% physical rubbing is causing it, could be texture of the fabric you contact with or the chemical in detergent you use. Finally stress hormones from work or people around you, or from you focus too much on your ance problem.</p>
<p>You can try all kind of medicines but without addressing the above ance would never go away for good. You can drop off some products after your face is cleared and see what you can get away with, but keep a good diet. If you're lucky and meet a good dermatologist, they would tell you this otherwise you get to play topical and oral acne medicines bingo with your wallet.</p>
<p>Tl/dr: Acne medicines only isn't enough to cure and prevent ance.</p>
<p>Edit 2: More details.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main purpose of toner is to quickly hydrate your skin, then moisturizer contains occlusives is like a seal to prevent that moisture from evaporating (maybe not be the right word) into the environment. Toner can also contain other useful nutrients depend on what your goal is.</p>
<p>Basically, it like fresh sebum with extra benefits and it tell your skin &quot;Hey all nice and moist, stop making more sebum&quot;. Also some ingredients in toner can also be found in moisturizer and vise versa, so if your skin is not dehydrated toner is not necessary, but moisturizer is a much.</p>
<p>To easily distinct the two, toner has a watery texture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diary doesn't directly cause acne, <del>but as we all know a large percent of the population is lactose intolerant to some degree, which causes inflammation and worsens your acne problem. Some people mistake that because they don't feel immediate upset bowel after consuming dairy, they're completely lactose tolerant.</del> But if you cut down on dairy for a few months and not seeing any improvement at all, you can always just eat dairy again, but by that time you may no longer crave dairy that much.</p>
<p>Edit: I wasn't feeling confident in this answer so I tried to find studies I had read but couldn't, perhaps my memory is wrong. <strong>But</strong> cut down dairy intake does help reduce acne (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21335995" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21335995</a>). Also, yogurt and cheese seem to have a lot less impact on ance compare to milk.</p></div>		</li>
