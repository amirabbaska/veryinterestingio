			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my question could be restated this way:</p>
<p>For a given vaccine, and for a given &quot;flavor&quot; of flu virus, the effectiveness is X - measured at peak potency (T0 + two weeks). But is there data that shows how effectiveness evolves in time before the peak is reached?</p>
<p>Sure, I understand that the whole process is inherently a statistical measurement, it's not a simple yea or nay.</p>
<p>Related: is antibody titer a good proxy for how effective the vaccine is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The WHO lists a hemagglutination inhibition (standard assay to measure neutralizing potential of antibodies to the virus) titer of 40 to be protective. Basically, if your blood sera was diluted 1 to 40 and can still block influenza virus then you are considered protected to these standards. </p></div>		</li>
