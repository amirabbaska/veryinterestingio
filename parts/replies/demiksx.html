<p>It is difficult to do that when Wilileaks can only output things that are leaked to them, and that just so happens to be anti-democratic information for years of an election. </p>
<p>Don't let your partisan duplicities get in the way of realizing that patterns + agendas regarding the releasing of cold hard facts are also worthy of scrutiny.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Jullian Assange placed himself in a corner when he explcitly admitted that they did have GOP material but didn't feel a necessity to relese it because most of the stuff was trivial and mundane while on the other hand dumping all the contents they had on the DNC regardless of whether there was any juicy bits or mundane bits.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You were spot on for so long, then you went partisan.
If you think the Democrats are any less corrupt than the Republicans, I've got some bad news for you...</p></div>		</li>
