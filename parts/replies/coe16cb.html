			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the yellow color of French vanilla ice cream comes from egg yolks. French vanilla ice cream is a custard based ice cream which gives it a richer texture but also a slightly eggy taste. If you compare it to old fashioned vanilla or vanilla bean ice cream, you'll notice that they are either plain white or white flecked with tiny brown bits of vanilla bean. Vanilla extract is really so strongly flavored that it doesn't take more than a tiny bit to make a flavorful ice cream, so it doesn't impact the color of the end product very much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went to the store 2 days ago to buy vanilla ice cream because it was on sale. I looked to see the difference between the ingredients and nutrition facts of both french and natural vanilla ice cream. They were the exact same, so I bought both to compare. Both were great :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While we're at it, can someone explain to me why in North America everything that is vanilla-flavored seems to be &quot;French vanilla&quot;-flavored? Being French it's weird because in France I've never seen anything mentioning &quot;la vanille fran√ßaise&quot;, it's just... vanille.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pro-tip: never put pure vanillin on your tongue to taste it. It burns. Literally. Most  flavors are caused by acids, and artificial flavors are highly concentrated, making them pretty potent acids.</p>
<p>Source: I did this to myself (for science!) when interning in the R&amp;D labs of a large snack company. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to be that guy (oh who am I kidding, I love it) but vanillin is actually an aldehyde with a neutral pH.  Like cocoa though, it would taste really strong and bitter in its unsweetened form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's probably more that the receptors that respond to vanillin are multi-modal, and may transduce the presence of vanillin into the sensation of heat. I don't think vanillin itself is acidic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a moderately strong dark pigment, actually.  It doesn't take much vanilla in something to stain plastic enough so it's hard to get get off.  If there's enough vanilla in something to taste of it strongly, it's enough to significantly discolor it.  I expect &quot;vanilla is white&quot; meme is almost entirely due to comparison with chocolate, which is much darker.</p></div>		</li>
