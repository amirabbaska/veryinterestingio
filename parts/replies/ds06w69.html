<p>There are two kinds of foreign aid: Tied and untied.</p>
<p>Tied aid is money that is given away but comes with conditions, such as the money must be used to purchase certain goods from a particular source. </p>
<p>Most of American aid (and much of other countries’ aid) is of this type and it amounts to indirect foreign investment. </p>
<p>Untied aid, obviously, is aid that comes with no strings attached. While much, much rarer, it does exist. Sorry, I don’t have any data to back this up.</p>
<p>Basic International Relations stuff. It is based in Realpolitik, where aid helps keep one faction of government friendly to the donor country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard people from countries receiving &quot;humanitarian aid&quot; complain, justifiably, because finished products are commonly sent as non-military aid, which destroys local industries because it's impossible to price their products low enough to compete with free. The destruction of local industries leads to more poverty, which leads to a dependence on further aid...</p>
<p>Now that's not to say that all aid is bad - actually just sending money instead promotes local industries by giving people the ability to start businesses to fulfill needs that they see people have in their area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that also come from &quot;private aid&quot;, not necessarily governmental project. Foreign Aid is a very complex, diverse matter. </p>
<p>For &quot;private involvement&quot;: For example if you donate clothing and shoes in my central-european country to charity, it gets collected by charity. But their storages are full, so they give  (sell?) the stuff on to commercial people. Who then distribute it in bulk to african countries, where the stuff ends up on markets. The local industries have no chance at all to compete with the cheap used clothing from the rich nations and go broke. </p>
<p>Also pay attention to those collection boxes: There are those from charitly, like the Red Cross, but a lot of them are also direct from private companies who do not even advertise with &quot;charity&quot; anymore. Those are direct-to-export. </p>
<p>It is a catastrophe: Our clothing is made for cheap in Asian countries, some rich company makes big wins by paying little and selling for high (or they are cheap and selling in bulk; no, that bargain 5$ dress cannot actually get the poor folks who make them 12 hours or day paid properly), the items get used for a season or two, then donated and shipped off to Africa to ruin any chance for local industries. </p>
<p>You can do a lot of harm with foreign aid if done wrong, and this does not even touch &quot;Build up a resistance group to help the current politcial agenda vs. someone you currently do not like&quot; (everyone does that). And even if done right (humanitarian, developing) it is a vastly complex issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point.</p>
<p>I like that idea of sending money, although you have to be careful with that too. Money can be used in <em>whatever way the receiver sees fit</em>. Some of the poorest places on earth are run by the most corrupt governments on earth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some of those places are <em>kept</em> poor by those corrupt governments. And by other governments (like our own) that aren't supposed to be corrupt. </p></div>		</li>
