			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, such things are perfectly possible. However, the base only affects the representation of a number. Rationality (or irrationality) is a property of the number that is independent of the base.</p>
<p>1337 (base 10) is a rational number no matter whether you write it in base 10, binary (base 2) or base pi. Pi is irrational regardless of how you write it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't understand. If we have a Base-π system, then π is just what we call &quot;1&quot;. Surely it's just arbitrary what we define as irrational and rational, and we could as well have flipped everything? No??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not &quot;pi-based&quot; but base-pi.<br />
So, most people will use base-10 (decimal) to represent numbers, which means that each place you move left is 10x more and there are 10 unique digits to use in each place (0-9).<br />
Another common numerical base is base-2 (binary) in which each place to the left is 2x more than the previous one (2^(n)) and there are two unique digits for each place (0-1).<br />
Many programmers will be familiar with base-2 and base-16 (hexadecimal). In hexadecimal each place is 16x more than the last (16^(n)), and there are 16 unique digits to use in each place (0-9,A-F).<br />
The below table shows different numbers in each base:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Decimal</th>
<th>Binary</th>
<th>Hex</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>10</td>
<td>1010</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>16</td>
<td>10000</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>174</td>
<td>1010 1110</td>
<td>AE</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<hr />
<p>Compounding these rules, we can design a theoretical base-pi, let's call it pinary for the sake of the pun. Our pinary counting system will have each place would be pi^(n) and there would be pi unique digits for each place. We'll just ignore the glaring problem with pi unique digits for each place not making sense and just jump to how to represent pi in this number system: <strong>10</strong>. Any rational numbers aside from 1,2,3 are pretty much impossible to represent in this number system so it's an exercise in futility... But it makes writing pi easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A pi-based number system would be one where each number is expressed as a multiple or fraction of pi.</p>
<p>However, in a base-pi number system, you can't express <em>any whole number</em> rationally.</p></div>		</li>
