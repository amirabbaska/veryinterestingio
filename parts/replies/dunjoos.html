			<div class="markdown"><p>The original SCRAM story is based on Chicago Pile 1.  Many versions exist about the origin of acronym SCRAM or Safety Control Rod Axe Man.  The first one is that a graduate student would use an axe to cut the rope that held a control rod if the reaction went out of control.  The second one is that the electrician who wired the control circuitry wrote SCRAM on the circuit that actuated the control rods.  The final one is that the group of scientist that worked on Chicago Pile 1 came up with the story in a bar.  I like the first but the second and third stories are probably closer to the truth.   </p></div>		</li>
