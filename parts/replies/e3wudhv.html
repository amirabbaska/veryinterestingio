			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern phones have a built in bluelight filter.  On iOS/Mac it's called Night Shift, on Android it's called Night Light, and Windows it's called Night Light too.</p>
<p>If you're on an Android without it built in an alternative that's the next best thing is Red Moon or cf.lumen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s also f.lux which can be installed on both PC and Mac. I’ve had it on my laptop for years, not necessarily for sleep purposes but to avoid the strain on my eyes in a darker room setting. </p></div>		</li>

<p>On Android I’d recommend Twilight, it’s completely free, has lots of features.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just got back from a weeklong camping trip. I find it funny how much technology screws with our natural sleep patterns. How quickly we change our sleep schedule without lighting &amp; television. </p>
<p>By the 3rd day through the rest of the trip we were up with the sun &amp; exhausted a little before sundown even though we spent most of the day relaxing &amp; lounging around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always need 2 days. The first night I can't fall asleep because it's too quiet /nature noisy. The 2nd night, I'm exhausted and collapse. Day 3 I'm up early, refreshed and ready to get back home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so true! I also experienced this the last time I went camping. It was so strange how tired I got once it got dark and I was just sitting in front of the fire. I ended up going to bed around 10pm and then waking up naturally at 7am. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Slept very well most nights despite sleeping on a cheap queen air mattress instead of a relatively expensive king sized adjustable bed.</p></div>		</li>
