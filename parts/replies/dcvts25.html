			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be really superficial to say that the strong force does it. What the strong force does that it physically holds the nucleus together and is responsible for the existence of the nuclei. What makes it stable that it is in a local energy minima, meaning, any option of decay (alpha or any kind of beta) would need extra energy. Think of it: even unstable nuclei are held together by the strong nuclear force.</p>
<p>An average nucleus does not have that much energy as they need to transform to a higher energy state through any kind of decay, and when it does, it usually releases it in the form of a gamma-photon (higher energy photon than those in X-ray). Thus, changing from a lower energy state to a higher (e.g. from N14 to C14) it will be pretty much impossible, therefore we say those nuclei are stable, since <em>every possibility to change they can count on, require orders of magniture more energy, than they have</em>. </p>
<p>The inability to change - what the nuclei with the higher energy have - makes them stable. Meanwhile those with higher energy state are highly likely to change through decay, thus generating a 'flow' from their original state in the form of decay to their final form. Sometimes these 'flows' are really long, known as decay chains - beginning with an unstable nucleus, it transforms through multiple steps to reach its final form (no Dragon-Ball reference here :D). </p>
<p><em>Summary.</em> Strong nuclear force is responsible for the existence of nuclei, being in local energy minima is responsible for being stable. Being unstable means highly likely to transform with basically zero chance to transform back, thus creating decay chains that end with stable nuclei. </p>
