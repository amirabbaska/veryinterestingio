			<div class="markdown"><p>Cranberries are pretty resilient!  The can handle long periods of flooding, which can happening naturally.  They were there before we starting cultivating them and will be there after we stop!  In bog areas that were abandoned 50+ years ago, they persisted in the forests.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What an interesting, random subject!  I know of numerous abandoned cranberry bogs in the eastern upper peninsula of Michigan. Some have been out of use nearly 100 years, and still are readily identifiable, even producing some wild cranberries when the season is right!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting about Michigan!  I suppose the different climates and soils are why the sites might be different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cranberries aren't trees.  Instead they grow on small vines, with little leaves, very low to the ground.  They won't start growing in flood conditions because ultimately they need sunlight to establish.  Once established they are very resilient to flooding for long periods of time.</p>
<p>Thanks for your question!</p></div>		</li>
