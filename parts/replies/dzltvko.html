			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, so they pack fresh tuna up and then heat the entire can to crazy temperatures? That makes sense. Obviously (?) things like protein and fat will remain, but does that mean that something like canned carrots will lose most of their nutritional value, in terms of vitamins? Or does this heating process kill only the live bacteria without degrading the micronutrients in food? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, pasteurization is a main way to sterilize the contents of the can, though there may be other options in some cases. Some acidic foods don't need high temperature processing because they naturally kill bacteria just from the pH.</p>
<p>You may want to read something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning" target="_blank">Wikipedia's article on Canning</a> for more information, as I'm by no means an expert on the subject. There are also lots of guides on how to can foods yourself (usually in glass jars), as it's not that hard to do (for some foods anyway).</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A 1997 study found that canned fruits and vegetables are as rich with dietary fiber and vitamins as the same corresponding fresh or frozen foods, and in some cases the canned products are richer than their fresh or frozen counterparts.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/recercar Most canned fish is cooked twice.  It's first gutted and frozen then brought to a processor unless it's taken fresh to a processor (less common, more expensive).  They then cook it whole.  Once cooked they bone it filet it and then cut it depending on the type.  It can be in big chunks, small shreds, one whole piece into a can depending on the brand.  Then they cook it again in the can to pasteurize it.  Fish is likely cooked twice to make it easy to bone and cut/flake/shred/whatever before canning.  It's much harder to debone raw fish.  Cooked fish (and cooked meat in general) slides off the bones easily.  Fish that is packed with water, oil or sauce is always double cooked.  Albacore is white tuna, skipjack is light tuna.  Skipjack is smaller and therefore doesn't eat as much and thus doesn't eat as much mercury. Plus most commercially fished albacore is older.  Pole caught is younger because the young feed more at the surface than the older ones which are net caught.  Bigger and older sea creatures always have more mercury.   All that said you can find once cooked tuna in the can, the key word is &quot;cooked in its own juices&quot; because they pack the raw tuna into a can, close it and pasteurize it.  These brands are often pole or troll caught which is more sustainable.  Wild Planet is one brand that is made this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You use different heats &amp; times for different foods.</p>
<p><a href="http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/publications_usda.html" target="_blank">USDA guidelines for home canning say</a> that carrots need 25min and fish needs 100min.  Commercial production is going to be slightly different but comparable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not very close actually. Commercial canning uses much higher temperature for much shorter times.</p>
<p>Milk can be pasteurized at 140 for 20 min, or 300 something for 3 seconds. The ultra high temp process is far superior in terms of stabilizing the milk for long storage, and changes the protein less because it doesn't have time to change. Crazy but true. </p>
<p>I know less about the process of canning commercially, but it is significantly hotter than a home pressure cooker, which gets to 250 or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it put in hot? That way once it's sealed and it begins to cool the lid pops in which tells you it's unopened. Heating it after wouldn't have the same effect. It could also cause the can to explode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's 'hot pack' method and is mostly used in things like jam and jellies.  In most meats the can is sealed and then cooked.  That way you get a pressure cooker effect as well.</p></div>		</li>
