			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate, a regular sheet of printer paper is approximately 0.1 mm thick (0.0001 meters).</p>
<p>So a sheet of paper folded 103 times is approximately 10^27 meters thick. The estimated size of the observable universe is 8.8x10^26 meters, meaning the folded paper would (theoretically) be around 13% larger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be possible to do this if you started with a piece of paper that was so much wider than the universe that even once you folded it it half 103 times it was still many orders of magnitude wider than the universe.</p>
<p>I guess this is stretching the philosophical grey area in the definitions of &quot;physically impossible&quot; and / or &quot;technically possible&quot; :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not even then.  At some point the thickness of the layers of paper at the fold would be too much thicker than the thickness of the paper itself. The sheet would either tear, or you’re no longer bending it in half, but rather mashing it together. The next fold after that is really just mashing stuff and not folding at all.</p>
<p>This is a property of the thickness of the paper, not the area of it.  It’s where you get the “you can’t fold a sheet of paper more than X times in half” stuff.  How many times depends on the material, but regardless of material, even an atom-thick sheet would not be “folding” at the end of 103 folds. </p>
<p>Or think of it like this: the final fold stretches the outer layer across the entire universe and the inner layer also has to be mushed in between a universe-thick number of layers at the same time, and they are the same material. No substance of any sort real or theoretical can stretch that much without tearing.  If you <em>could</em> stretch—separate individual atoms—of a material that much, you’ve described something that can’t be broken: I can split it as far as theoretically possible and it will never be “broken”. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming the sheet of paper in question was typical A4 printer paper, that translates to about 53 MILLION light- years. </p>
<p>So, yeah, pretty far...</p></div>		</li>
