			<div class="markdown"><p>Salt was the number 1 method of meat and vegetable preservation.</p>
<p>Pickling vegetables requires brine and salting meat extracts the moisture from them and allows them to last a long time.</p>
<p>In a world before refrigeration and before industrialized canned foods, the only way to have a varied diet of different foods is to do whatever you can to preserve. Only a few things can keep for a long time in unprocessed form (like rice, beans, and tubers). </p>
<p>Lastly, using salt to preserve food was an absolute necessity for warfare. The logistics of feeding an army was no simple matter. Pre-industrial wars were a logistical nightmare, with years-long sieges and massive supply lines over rough unpaved terrain using horses/mules/camels to transport food at a grindingly slow pace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention, it's straight up necessary for life. There's a reason it tastes good - salt is a requirement for many biological functions, and your instincts needed to be sure you'd get as much of this crucial-yet-scarce resource as possible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>salt was only used later since it was very cheap.</p>
<p>so salt is wortless and not at all essential to support life. period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pepper was a large part of the Roman spice trade. For centuries having salt and pepper on your table was a sign of wealth, mainly because they were relatively hard to come by. </p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that salt, for a variety of reasons, is an essential part of any mammal's diet. </p>
<p>the wikipedia entry for both is an interesting read</p></div>		</li>
