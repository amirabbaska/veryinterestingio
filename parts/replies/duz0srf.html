			<div class="markdown"><p>There were originally 20 equations. The four 'Maxwell's Equations' we know today were actually formulated by Oliver Heaviside from 12 of these original equations, using operational (vector) calculus, that Heaviside also first developed. Here are a few of Heaviside's other major contributions to physics and engineering:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1880 - Researched the skin effect in telegraph transmission lines, and in same year, patented the coaxial cable, an invention that is vital to our modern world, finding use in areas such as internet and network connections, digital audio and cable TV signals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1880-87 - Developed the operational calculus, giving a method of solving differential equations by direct solution as algebraic equations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1884 - Using his newly-devoloped calculus, Heaviside recast Maxwell's mathematical analysis from its original cumbersome form into its modern vector terminology, thereby reducing twelve of the original twenty equations in twenty unknowns down to the four differential equations in two unknowns we now know as Maxwell's equations. The four re-formulated Maxwell's equations describe the nature of electric charges (both static and moving), magnetic fields, and the relationship between the two, namely electromagnetic fields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1885 - Independently discovered the Poynting vector, defined as the rate of energy transfer per unit area of an electromagnetic field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1885-88 - Invented the Heaviside step function and employed it to model the current in an electric circuit. He was also the first to use its derivative, the unit impulse function, now usually known as the Dirac delta function. During this time, Heaviside also coined a number of terms describing electromagnetic phenomena, many still in use today, such as conductance, impedance and permeability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1888-89 - Calculated the deformations of electric and magnetic fields surrounding a moving charge, as well as the effects of it entering a denser medium. This included a prediction of Cherenkov radiation, only experimentally discovered 60 years later, and inspired his friend George FitzGerald to suggest what now is known as the Lorentz–FitzGerald (length) contraction, which became an integral part of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1889 - First published a correct derivation of the magnetic force on a moving charged particle, which, along with the electric component, forms what is now called the Lorentz Force. The same year, he started working on the concept of electromagnetic mass. Heaviside treated this as material mass, capable of producing the same effects, laying the foundation for Einstein's discovery of the equaivalence between mass and all forms of energy, not just electromagnetic, immortalized by his most famous equation, E = mc².</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1893 - Discusses the possibility of gravitational waves, using the analogy between the inverse-square law in gravitation and electricity, a full 25 years before Einstein's paper on this subject.</p>
</li>
<li>1902 - Advanced the idea that the Earth's uppermost atmosphere contains an ionized layer known as the ionosphere; in this regard, he predicted the existence of what later was dubbed the Kennelly–Heaviside layer of the ionosphere. Heaviside's theory explained the means by which radio signals are transmitted around the Earth's curvature. The existence of the ionosphere was experimentally confirmed in 1924 by Edward Victor Appleton, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1947.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a giant mess, just involved archaic notation, leading to lots of repetition when demonstrating vector transformation. Then came William Rowan Hamilton nearly 90 years later and flipped the delta symbol upside down, reformulating classical (Newtonian) mechanics and making the math analogous to Maxwell's description of electromagnetism. This also made Maxwell's equations much tidier, making it easier to read the logic and observe its beauty. 75 years later, Hamilton is immortalized in Schrodinger's equation as an H with a fancy hat. Today, we get to reddit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't true. Hamilton died ~20 years before Maxwell died. The first formulation of electromagnetism used quaternions - Hamilton's discovery. </p>
<p>It was Oliver Heaviside who introduced the 'modern' vector calculus operator nabla, and reformulated electromagnetism to the way we know today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading once that matrix mechanics had significant advantages over wave mechanics, but wave mechanics was later adopted because people were far more familiar with the math and physics of waves (e.g. classical field theory). My general understanding is that the physical interpretation of matrix vs. wave mechanics differ greatly, but I don't understand it enough to talk about it in detail. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you're exactly right about the wave part. It's already something engineers and physicists are well versed in so it's more natural. The problem is, philosophically, there has been a lot of debate over exactly how to understand the wave approach works for reality. This gets you into stuff like the Copenhagen Interpretation (Heisenberg and Bohr) and Many Worlds hypotheses, but it really stems back to these mathematical formulations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ~10 minutes of Googling told me that the big deal was the noncommutative algebra of matrix mechanics and how non-intuitive that was for the physics community to accept at the time. This was supposedly resolved when Max Born suggested that the wave function of the Schrodinger equation represents the probability to find an electron at the specified time and place, rather than representing the moving electron itself. </p>
<p>Not being a physicist, I can't comment on the equivalence of matrix mechanics vs. wave mechanics vs. path integrals or whatever other hypotheses there are to describe reality, but I can't help but feel there was a missed opportunity with matrix mechanics. Feels like if it were accepted sooner and developed further, there could've been more breakthroughs with quantum theory. Is this fair? Or is a concern that results from an incomplete understanding of the maths/hypotheses/theories? </p></div>		</li>
