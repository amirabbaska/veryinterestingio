			<p>Who you know does help, but what you know helps more.  Think about it, would you personally rather know someone and not have the ability to do a job or not know anyone but are extremely capable for the job?  If you do not know someone in your field.  Network.  Market yourself.  If you are good, you will get the job and professional growth opportunities.   </p>		</li>
