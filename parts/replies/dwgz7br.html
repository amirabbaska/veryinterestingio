			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not rock, it’s still clay.   What you’re seeing is a fill material in the imprint.  The imprint doesn’t necessarily have to be buried, but often are in archaeological scenarios as top-soil or other sediment layers over the earlier layers creating stratigraphy.</p>
<p>If you create a hole in any surface, and then refill it, there’s evidence of this activity as the soil within the hole is disturbed and disrupted whereas the “natural” surroundings maintain their original composition.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the key that I did not understand, thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your explanation, but isn't it more just compressing the clay? I understand that digging and refilling a hole would show evidence of the disturbance. But isn't this different? </p>
<p>Or have l overthought this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sedimentary rocks are made through two processes: compaction and cementation. In the study you referenced, the clay was actually not a rock--it was only compacted by the weight of the overlying sediment. While it was certainly firm, you could excavate it with a shovel pretty easily. Cementation occurs when groundwater flows slowly through sediment. Changes in the amount of dissolved gases or by interaction between the chemistry of the water and the minerals that compose the sediment causes some change in the system (pH or Eh typically). This causes new minerals will precipitate from the ions in the groundwater (and from those dissolved from minerals nearby). Common cements are calcite, hematite, clays (newly formed clays, not the ones originally deposited) and silica (similar to quartz). The depth at which this occurs depends on the chemical composition of the groundwater, how variable the pH and redox states are along the flowpath, and the variation in temperature with depth in the Earth (geothermal gradient)--typically it begins within about a kilometer of Earth's surface and really gets going after about 1.5-2.0 km. But other types of sediments (limestones) recrystallize almost immediately and turn into rock at or near Earth's surface.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Bolivia there are Dinosaur tracks preserved that way. The tracks were laid down in mud which was then buried in volcanic ash. The mudstone is hard and resists weathering, where the fossilized volcanic ash turns to soft clay when exposed to water. The result is lots of well preserved prints.</p>
<p>I think there are some hominid foot prints in persevered similarly. (Actually thinking I think those are in an ash layer, later covered. then exposed)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On scales of thousands of years, there are a number of ways to get information on the age of a deposit. By testing many of them and finding them in agreement, scientists can be reasonably sure of their calculations. The composition of sediment deposition can vary between seasons and years. In some cases, reading the differences in the layers of sediment can be used like tree rings. Occasionally, sudden depositions of sediment due to flooding can be clearly seen. Because tree rings can be used to determine precipitation rates, by comparing tree rings from local trees, scientists can associate years with higher precipitation with larger layers in the sediment, which can be used to form a measuring stick.</p>
<p>Often, pollen or leaves can be trapped in sediment. These can be carbon dated accurately (carbon dating works best on scales of thousands of years). Carbon dating works by measuring the ratio of isotopes of carbon 14, 13 and 12. Carbon 12 is the lightest, followed by 13 and then 14. As a result, organisms are able to incorporate carbon 12 more easily than 13 which in turn is easier to use than carbon 14. Because carbon is constantly cycling through living organisms, the ratio of 12:13 and 13:14 will remain constant throughout their lives. As soon as life functions cease, the carbon isotopes are locked in place, and can only change by natural radio decay. Because the decay of these isotopes is very well understood, we can work backwards to determine how long the organism has been dead. Difficulties arise in predicting what the atmospheric ratios between the isotopes were at the time the organism died, but the margin of error introduced by this isn't very high.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All natural carbon isotopes are incorporated in organism at more or less the same speed regardless of abundance, but only one is radioactive (14C). It is formed in our atmosphere by bombardment of solar particles, so is replenished at a somewhat steady rate. However, when an organism dies, it no longer can replenish the 14C and it will diminish over time through nuclear decay while the ratio 12C and 13C remains equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a number of different ways this can be determined, but primarily it's by dating surrounding materials.</p>
<p>If the footprint is in mud, there's likely animal/plant remains located nearby which can be carbon dated.  Occasionally a footprint would be preserved because of an ashfall from a volcano. In that case, we can date the eruption to determine that the footprint must have occurred about the same time.</p>
<p>There are other kinds of radiometric dating besides &quot;carbon dating&quot; which can be used to determine ages at different ranges.  There are also other dating techniques for much much older samples.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other replies to your question are generally correct, but do not provide an answer for this specific study.</p>
<p>From the article in question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the base of the true track impression, directly under the track fill, pieces of preserved wood were recovered. Two of these were radiocarbon dated, resulting in age estimates of 13,169–13,095 cal BP (11,295 ± 30 14C BP—UCIAMS142561) and 13,317–13,241 cal BP (11,435 ± 30 14C BP–UCIAMS 149779).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See u/nikstick22's answer for details of carbon dating. Because MacLaren et al. dated wood that underlies the footprints, the age is a maximum estimate for the timing of the seaside stroll.</p>
<p>tl;dr: They used C dating on wood under the footprints.</p></div>		</li>
