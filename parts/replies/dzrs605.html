<p>The gasoline-air mixture, starting at the spark plug, has to burn quickly enough to mostly burn when it is most mechanically advantageous, and when the chamber pressure and temperature are best suited for the burn...but not too quickly, or the chamber pressure and temperature gets too hot and you melt holes in things (detonation is essentially spontaneous combustion of the entire mixture due to adiabatic compression exceeding the ignition energy requirement of the mixture. Temperature skyrockets because all of the energy of the fuel is being released at once.)</p>
<p>Too cold and you get one kind of emissions; too hot and you get another.</p>
<p>Catalytic converters are designed for this, and in fact <em>need</em> variation to work properly. Google &quot;three way catalytic converter&quot; to read more. This is why people who remove catalytic converters from their cars are jerks - no matter how much they protest about how &quot;good&quot; their &quot;well maintained&quot; engine runs. Ditto for jerks who disconnect the crankcase breather recirculation system (tldr: a small amount of combustion gasses escape through the rings sealing the piston to the cylinder wall. These gasses are collected and put back into the air entering the engine. This is because these gasses are MASSIVELY more polluting than what comes out of the tailpipe.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern catalytic converters have virtually zero performance penalty and the engine is probably even designed for the backpressure of the cat.</p>
<p>PCVs are commonly vented to atmosphere because the gasses contain oil mist and vapors that condense on the intake system. I've heard various nonsense excuses ranging from &quot;that lowers the octane&quot; (nonsense because the amount of mist and gasses is miniscule compare the amount of air the engine ingests) to leaving a residue on stuff (which only matters for the throttle. Which can be difficult to get to for cleaning, but rarely needs to be done more than every few years.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PCV's are generally neutral in terms of engine performance (no benefit or drawback), no idea why someone would just disconnect it.</p></div>		</li>
