			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually killed my last microwave by running it empty for 10 minutes because muscle memory made me set it to cook instead of the timer function. There are several thermal safety cutoffs in the microwave that protect it from continuing to operate if it overheats, but they don't always protect the magnetron. The new unit I replaced it with senses if there isn't enough return loss in the cavity and won't start cooking if it is empty or you put too much metal in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the newer microwaves are definitely trying to correct for the unfortunately common user errors such as microwaving metal, and on empty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is another big factor: the magnetron resonate at one precise frequency. It can be seen like a bell. How can you make a bell ring at another frequency? You would have to change it's shape.</p>
<p>The magnetron is simmilar, the shape of it cause it to electrically oscillate, creating the microwave.</p>
<p>There would be another way to generate it, with a wider band antenna, and a 1.5kW transmitter, with an oscillator that change the frequency a bit. Now you would get to change the frequency, but the extra complexity and flexibility cause other issues: part of the signal would not get out by the antenna, but bounce back into the transmitter, because the antenna is not a perfect match for most of the frequency range. This result into like 1kW going to your food, and 500W wasted as heat inside the amplifier due to the mismatch. There is ways to mitigate this by adding more complicated things.</p>
<p>And now your microwave doubled in size, is less powerfull, cost 10 times the price, break if no food is inside or not enought.</p>
<p>And chance is that after all that, all what it will do is cook even less well, because the microwave frequency they chosen is what heat water the best. The other frequency will do 'something'. Maybe it will be the flour in your pizza that will be heated first now? And making if even more meh...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Varying the frequency would not be practical, as the slice of the frequency band that would be considered ‘microwaves’ is actually really narrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is true that varying the frequency would not be practical, but not for the reasons stated. &quot;Microwaves&quot; are defined as radio frequencies between 300 MHz (a wave length of 100 cm) and 300 GHz (0.1 cm).  The usual frequency for microwave ovens is 2.45 GHz which is a wavelength of around 12cm or 4.8 inches - pretty close to the estimate above. And the part about the relative size of the waves, compared to the gaps in the shielding is also reasonable, but would apply equally to any radio frequency below a certain limit.</p>
<p>The design of the magnetron itself is the primary reason for the fixed frequency. The physical shape and size of the device determine the frequency it generates, so varying the frequency would require a much more complex and expensive means of generating the high-powered radio waves.</p>
<p>This frequency was also chosen because it was available for uses such as this in all parts of the world. (See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7pbqxi/why_dont_microwave_ovens_vary_their_frequency_to/dsgcxtv/" target="_blank">my other comment in this thread</a> for more about that.)</p></div>		</li>
