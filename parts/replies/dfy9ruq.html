			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think sea level fluctuations are very important in this case. Sea level fluctuations are a lot more important when considering islands that would be connected to a larger mainland during low sea levels (e.g. Indonesia during low sea levels is a massive extension of the Asian mainland called &quot;Sunda&quot;, allowing Leopards/Rhinos/Elephants to colonize these islands).</p>
<p>Isolated oceanic volcanic islands are only marginally larger during low sea levels, as their gradient is very steep compared to continental shelves. It just doesn't make a huge difference. If two islands are 500 miles apart, and they gain about 2 miles in diameter, that makes little difference as far as aiding dispersion.</p>
<p>That's the reason these isolated islands are overwhelmingly dominated by birds (stray migrants) and reptiles (good candidates for vegetation raft dispersal), with limited mammals.</p></div>		</li>
