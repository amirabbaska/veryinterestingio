			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you <em>sure</em> about that? Or do you just assume looking directly at it will make it clearer, so therefore that's all you've done? Cause to be fair, when looking at things in the light, obviously you want to look directly at them or they're aren't clear. You don't read a book by looking at the line below the one you're reading.</p>
<p>But try it out tonight. Take note of a faint star cluster you see in your peripheral, and then look directly at it and take a quick mental note of how fuzzy the stars are, then look <em>just</em> off to the side at a darker area and wait a sec for your brain to get used to the fact that your trying to look at something you're not looking at. See if the image actually turns out to be clearer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Next time you're in a very dark room, i.e. dark enough that it takes you a minute or two until your eyes can see anything, try looking directly at something and then looking slightly to the side of it. Notice that it gets a bit brighter (or at least it stands out more that <em>something</em> is there) when you're not looking directly at it.</p>
<p>This is because your peripheral vision isn't meant for visual acquity nor color differentiation, it's meant to be trigger-happy for detection of sudden motion or changes in patterns under dim or bright conditions.</p>
<p>Notice also that you don't see color at all in these dark-environment cases, since your cone cells are not getting enough differential activation for your brain to map a color. While it may subconsciously &quot;fill in&quot; things whose color you know or can presume (to some extent), notice that you can't consciously tell colors apart under very dim light. </p></div>		</li>
