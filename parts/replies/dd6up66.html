			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the human exploration of Mars architectures I have see suggest that the astronauts live in a lava tube or under some regolith or &quot;mars dirt&quot;.  Just about a year ago the NASA Chief medical officer stated publicly that &quot;there are no no known &quot;showstoppers&quot; for a human mission to Mars&quot; including radiation.  This involved using all that has been learned for countermeasure plus increasing the level of tolerable risk from about 3% to â‰ˆ10%</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know if side facing windows (such as a settlement built into a cliff face with rock above) would work but it seems plausible that the net radiation dose would be kept low and you'd still get some windows.</p>
<p>Another alternative would be to store your water in the cieling.  Few feet of water is just as good as dirt but lets some sunlight through.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This would have the added benefit of adding (some) weight to your roof, making large(er) domes more practical as that will help to counteract the pressure of the atmosphere inside, reducing the tension on the structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A magnetic field won't be as important as some might think + it's possible to create a man made one. We would need to hide underground until we've created a atmosphere similar to earth in mars, after that, the higher temperature, and therefore water vapour in the air will give us a decent protection against radiation. And we don't really need a magnetic field to shield our atmosphere from solar flares, as the time it takes to strip away our newly created atmosphere is on the order of thousands of years.</p></div>		</li>
