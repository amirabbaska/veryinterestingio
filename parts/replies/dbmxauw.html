			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Principal, reading this breaks my heart.   I'm assuming public school here, as I don't know your situation, but your statement &quot;Suspension is absolutely the right thing for them to do when my son is out of control&quot;  may be true to some extent, but it also ABSOLUTELY comes with a responsbility for them to back that up with whatever support your child needs to succeed and continue in school.     Additionally, again, assuming public school, if he is a special needs kid, please be aware of your rights under IDEA.   I'm not a lawyer, but if he is not 'officially' special needs, you still have rights and the school has responsibilities if you suspect it.   I do apologize if I'm assuming too much, or if you've already gone through these steps, but as a kindergartner parent, I'd be really surprised.  You are more than welcome to PM me more if I can help you advocate for your kid or answer questions from my perspective.   This situation, if true as it reads, can be much, much better for both of you.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot for your support and input!  </p>
<p>First I want to say that I have the utmost respect for the teachers and staff that have been working with my son this year.  They have worked really hard to adapt to my son's needs and routinely go out of their way to help him.  I first met with their team in March to plan for his entry into kindergarten, and we've met almost every month since school started.  My son officially qualified for special education services in November, and started spending about 3 hours a day in the special education classroom learning social skills and recognizing and safely responding to emotions.  He has made progress, and I 100% believe that progress has come from the support of his teachers.</p>
<p>The school has worked with us to develop methods to de-escalate my son, and have constantly tweaked their plan for educating and supporting him.  They are absolutely holding up their end of the bargain.  Sometimes my boy just gets too angry too quickly and the staff just can't reel him in.  When they have no choice they send him home.  It's difficult for all of us when that happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds a lot like me when I was a kid, and I now officially have been diagnosed with Autism Level 1, which is probably more popularly known as Aspergers even though it's no longer in the DSM.</p>
<p>For me, and possibly your son, it was a matter of needing to feel safe and having no refuge from mainstream school's need to control my every move, then punishing me when I was unable to conform. I didn't freak out until I already knew I was &quot;in trouble&quot; for being different or even agitated by my much sneakier classmates. I can honestly say it was always the worst having a teacher trying to physically restrain me on top of everything else. It was way, way too threatening to me. Even to this day, I don't like hugs from more than five specific people, because I now have an ingrained mistrust of others' desire for violent (from my perspective) control over me.</p>
<p>What my mom, psychologist, neurologist, school advocate, and principal eventually developed was a for me to go to a designated nook in a room away from typical student activity that had a beanbag chair and a few books (provided by my parents) with the understanding that I was to go there when I felt scared or no longer able to behave the way my teachers wanted me to (stressed). I was told that my teachers could check on me, but they could not make me leave my nook if I didn't feel I was ready. I felt safe, and my teachers would know where I'd gone (I used to escape the actual school grounds), and they could check to be sure that I was safe and not a threat to others (the common fear, but I was never one to attack others without provocation) without grabbing at me or any, as you put it, wrangling.</p>
<p>I honestly don't remember much about the nook, but it was a part of my life once. The only thing I specifically remember is reading a book about a dog when my teacher came to me, said they were changing activities, and asked me if I wanted to rejoin. I remember telling her yes, even though I'd always said no before. She seemed surprised, but looking back on it, I didn't know how to say that I didn't implicitly trust all adults like most children seem to do, and they always broke what fragile rapport we might have had early on due to their demands for obedience and then physical force when I was too stressed to comply. My saying yes that day signified that I was at least willing to trust her a little since I had somewhere to go if she broke it.</p>
<p>Your son is about four or five years younger than I was before the solution I got was developed, but it was a lifesaver for me. While identifying emotions and developing coping skills is all well and good, we only learn when we feel safe enough to do so from people we trust. Those are the two things I was missing in school, maybe consider that for your son, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is a federal regulation or state regulation, but didn't the principal you replied to with this comment say that once identified as a student with special needs they cannot send him home more than ten days a year? </p>
<p>Honestly I don't feel like they are doing everything they need to do to keep him in school, learning to deal with these emotions. My nephew is autistic, and he is in a special needs classroom. He has excelled academically but most of the social situations of a traditional classroom trigger too many emotions for him and he begins to act out. </p>
<p>Last year they tried to integrate him into a (sorry for the lack of a better phrase) &quot;normal&quot; 4th grade classroom for math. The problem was this was the time when all the other kids had just returned from band, PE, chorus, or whatever throughout the week and were very rowdy. After 4-5 of tantrums and seriously acting out he had the maturity to say to his teachers, this is too much for me to handle, I can't take all the noise and commotion. And they stepped him back. </p>
<p>I get it, every situation is different. But my nephew (in public school, and not a particularly rich one at that) is in a classroom with 4 other students, a main teacher, and each child with their own individual teachers aid. As he continues to progress through school, he will be integrated into larger and larger groups, learning to deal with all the stimuli associated with those larger social activities. Eventually, he will break free from the teachers aid and hopefully go through high school unassisted. If your son needs to be placed into a smaller classroom with his own 1 on 1 aid, then that's what he needs and the school needs to accommodate that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a paraprofessional with teaching certification and have worked many years in structured resource rooms with children that have similar issues to your son's. I think what the school principal wrote is great, and it's wonderful that you have confidence in your child's school.  It really does sound like the scool isn't paying enough attention  to the unintended reward of suspension. Please just be aware that there is a huge problem with public schools (especially small, underfunded ones) not recommending outplacement or additional services because of lack of money. If you request a service, the school can't say they won't provide it due to lack of funds (supposedly the districts are reimbursed by the state but the funds often fall short) but you can bet they may not be volunteering services that may be helpful. I've been told on a number of occasions not to speak to parents about services that may help due to lack of funding.  Several research visits to the department of education website may be useful, if you haven't done that already. Have strength, Dad, and faith that your son will develop the tools he needs with lots of love and support. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, if he was identified as special needs, the district would need to do what's called a &quot;manifestation determination&quot; meaning, the school cannot pull a student out of the classroom for more than 10 days in the whole school year.  Find the special ed teacher and go to the &quot;Student Study Team&quot; if your school has one.  It's typically a monthly meeting where the teachers, admin and school psych brainstorm about challenging students and often talk about whether a referral for testing for special ed services is appropriate.  Parents can be involved and this is often a good time to get the ear of the school psych, who can be a great resource.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, take this with a grain of salt, because these guidelines change from state to state in the U.S. (where I am) and I have no idea how things are handling outside of my country.</p>
<p>It depends on the school in my state. They are legally required to hire someone who is capable of teaching kids with certain learning and behavioral disabilities. However, if someone is not already employed for that purpose in the school (no previous need), as a parent, you have to jump through so many hoops to prove obligation. Just 2 years ago I was the liaison for a child in this situation. It took 2 years to get it sorted. She was diagnosed by 3 private medical officials, and underwent 5 testing situations and 3 examinations by LD professionals in the schools district. I still regularly have to check that her legal rights are being met by the new LD professional at the school. If the school is unfamiliar with what needs to be done, it can be hell establishing it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My boy is in the special needs classroom in a good district. He has 4 aides in the classroom on top of the normal teacher. He has anger issues as the biggest problem. He gets the most amount of support a school district can afford, yet still becomes enough of a problem through hitting and throwing things. He's 8, and we've been trying to curb it for a few years now. We've done everything in our power aside from horse tranquilizers, and he is on a few meds, without any real diagnosis. It helps, but he's still a problem.
I get what you're saying to the other poster, its always been a push of mine that he needs to be handled and kept in school by any means possible. But some kids the school just cannot handle when they're causing physical harm. I know the other poster didn't mention it but it is the case for me, and the principle and aides are fucking amazing. But there is a line that even an 8yr old can cross. While we don't really know where or why it is happening, but the kid lashes out and most schools can't take the liability, which is understandable.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you be able to find a speech therapist or psychologist for him? It may sound weird to look for a speech therapist even if he doesn't have issues with language, but speech therapists actually work with kids with socialization difficulties as well. I've volunteered under a speech therapist for a while before, and there was a 7-year-old boy who came in that had almost the exact same issues as how you described your son. The speech therapist worked with him on those difficulties. I wasn't able to see the end result with what happened with him, but I know that speech therapy really helped a lot of other kids with extreme social difficulties.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for sharing your thoughts.  My son has worked with the school's speech therapist as part of his admission to the special ed program.  My son did extremely well on all the speech therapist's tests.  He has no trouble with speaking or reading, and has no trouble with sentence structure.  He just doesn't know the right things to say.  Our school's speech therapist doesn't seem to focus on social issues (unfortunately) and felt that he had nothing to provide to my son.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's disappointing. I'm sorry to hear that. I'd personally recommend you to look around for a speech therapist that does focus on social difficulties as well. There's a growing push in language development psychology that treats social language (pragmatics) with just as much importance as language structure and grammar.  I think that a good speech therapist that  worked on social difficulties would be very beneficial for your son, but I also know how hard it might be to find one. Help in treating your son's social difficulties <em>does</em> exist out there, though, and I hope things work out for you!</p>
<p>EDIT: A child psychologist might be able to help, too, if you can find one. They could focus on helping your son work on his coping strategies, and possibly help him learn what to say in certain social situations. I'm not entirely sure if this is offered for children, but I'm going off the fact that they do this a lot for adults, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can't recommend this more. My aunt is a speech therapist and yes while they DO work on speech issues....they are phenomenal behaviorists as well. I grew up in her household and have watched many of children learn the social skills they needed to adjust and thrive among their families and classmates. Consider getting a personal speech therapist, the type that work over many districts and schools with students individually. They have the tools and know how to help you in ways many would find unbelievable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I teach at a private school that works with a lot of kids like yours. Some kids just aren't cut out for the public school system. Honestly id say your best options are 1) a small school that specializes in Sp. Needs kids, 2) an occupational therapist, or 3) homeschooling. There's a lot of resources out there as far as researching your options. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your thoughts.  We have looked into alternative schooling, but it would be VERY difficult to make that work.  My son has a twin brother with no special needs at all.  Having them in separate schools or trying to afford private school for both of them would be beyond our capability.  We cannot afford homeschooling, and I don't believe my wife or I are truly up to the task.  Christmas vacation has reminded me how incredibly patient and strong teachers are!</p></div>		</li>

<p>charter schools are free and i guaruntee there are multiple near you. </p>
<p>this is not about convenience its about your son's long term health as a human being. if schooling does not go right, you could be left with a human who is unable to function as an independent adult.</p></div>		</li>
