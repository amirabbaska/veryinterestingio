			<div class="markdown"><p>This is quite wrong on several points. </p>
<p>First, the &quot;pixel&quot; idea is misleading. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_units" target="_blank">Planck scale</a> is the scale at which we expect the standard model to break down because quantum gravity (which we do not yet understand) is expected to dominate. So, if we are tempted to say it's a pixel of anything, we can maybe be justified in saying it's a pixel of our model, not &quot;reality&quot;.</p>
<p>Second, frequency is continuous. So is energy. Any number (including 0.00000000001 away from any other) is possible in a general sense, and it is only when you have a particular constraint within a system that certain energies or frequencies are not allowed. An easy example is how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSIw5SgUirg" target="_blank">guitar strings</a> vibrate with a discrete number of peaks/troughs, because the ends are constrained (pinned down). &quot;Discreteness&quot; is most of what we mean when we say a system is &quot;quantized&quot;, where the &quot;quantum&quot; in &quot;quantum mechanics&quot; comes from. A quantum in a discrete system (like the guitar strings) is the fundamental unit (frequency, in this case). </p>
<p>The quantum in the blackbody system is the photon. It is not the frequency, or the energy, but the number of &quot;packets&quot; of electromagnetic energy that are emitted. There are a countable (but huge!) number of photons, and energy (at any, continuous, frequency) only being allowed to emit in discrete packets is what avoids the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe" target="_blank">ultraviolet catastrophe</a>, which was Planck's goal. </p>
<p>This is significant, because it means the total energy of a laser beam (laser = very well defined frequency) is an n<em>h</em>f, where n = an integer, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency. But it has no bearing about which frequencies are allowed. Just the relation between number of photons, their frequency, and the energy of the whole beam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try again!</p>
<p>/u/ReshKayden 's comment was talking about the light coming off of a hot object (a &quot;black body&quot;). Think: a hot stove turning red as it heats up. They explained Planck's theory in terms of &quot;minimum resolution&quot; of frequencies (colors) coming out. The basic idea of the &quot;resolution&quot; is the same as the difference between integers (1,2,3...) and all numbers (1, 1.00000000001, and all of the numbers in between, etc.). Integers are &quot;discrete&quot;, and all possible numbers are &quot;continuous&quot; (there are an infinite number of them place infinitely close together).</p>
<p>Where they got it wrong was about which part of the light coming out of the stove that was discrete. They said it was the frequency, or energy (which are proportional to each other). But it isn't. It's the number of photons that is discrete. Just like you can't have 1.05 cows, you can't have 1.05 photons. They come in discrete numbers: 1,2,3,... 100 trillion, etc. But each individual photon can have any random frequency.</p>
<p>And as for the pixel idea, they were describing reality as if space and time were a grid, with sizes of the Planck length and Planck time. This is not an interpretation of the Planck scale that has any support, to my knowledge. The usefulness of Planck units is that it tells us a guess at around when our best theories probably won't work anymore (like black holes). Writing our equations in Planck units also helps get rid of the anthropocentric nature of normal units, as explained in the wikipedia link in my original comment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But if you allow frequencies to be defined infinitely close to one another, and it emits at &quot;all&quot; frequencies, doesn't that mean it emits an infinite amount of energy? After all, you could always define another frequency .00000000000000000001 between the last two you defined and say it emits at that too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sounds like something Zeno would argue. What about infinitesimally small amounts of energy? The probability of getting any chosen number from a continuous random variable is 0, but the total probabilities still sum to 1. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why I love science.  Just when I thought the comment above had completely blown my mind, this blew it all over again.</p>
<p>So what I'm guessing is that the data Planck measured suggested mathematically that as the limit of increments of frequency approached zero, the limit of increments of energy did not approach zero.  So instead there was a limit /= zero, of increments of frequency, and any ranges of frequency smaller than that would paradoxically emit negative energy.  Or something like that.</p>
<p>EDIT: this doesn't seem to be a correct summary after further reading.  But I don't understand the mathematics of radiation enough to be able to understand Planck's theory.  But basically, he couldn't predict the energy emitted by a black body within a certain frequency range without an extra constant thrown in the equation, and that constant predicts the smallest unit of energy, and by dimensional relation, the smallest value for every scientific unit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well... I suppose you're kind of in the right area, but what it all was was about was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe" target="_blank">ultraviolet catastrophe</a>. </p>
<p>There were basically two descriptions of a black body, one was based on known properties of light and empirical facts, resulting in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93Jeans_law" target="_blank">Rayleigh-Jean's law</a>, unfortunately it predicted an infinite energy output, which clearly is impossible. It also didn't agree with experiments for short wavelengths.</p>
<p>Another description, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien_approximation" target="_blank">Wien's law</a>, was motivated by basic thermodynamics. It was therefore somewhat better behaved in the sense that it emitted finite amounts of energy, but it also didn't agree with experiments for long wavelengths.</p>
<p>Now as far as I can tell Planck's law, even though it turned out to be correct, was initially just a way of interpolating between the two descriptions so it worked well at both ends.</p>
<p>What people later realised is that if you use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">Boltzmann distribution</a> like Wien did, but only allow wavelengths a distance 'h' apart, then you end up with Planck's law (try it some time it's quite a neat derivation).</p>
<p>Edit: Note this doesn't imply that only a discrete set of wavelengths are allowed. However inside a harmonic oscillator the energy levels are separated by some multiple of Planck's constant, which explains why matter (with bound electrons) follow Planck's law.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what I was wondering. That's like saying a square of 1 meters squared can be divided into smaller squares that also have area (say 4 squares of .25 meters squared for instance) but that it can't allow it to be divided indefinitely into smaller squares that have area because then you could have infinite squares with infinite total area... No, that's not how you calculus, Planck.</p>
<p>I mean if experimentation shows that there is such a constant, then there probably is. But the logic behind his hypothesis seems really flawed to me. Seems more of a lucky guess than an educated one.</p>
<p>Incidentally I'd love some more info on the experiments that were used to confirm and measure the constant if anyone has any good references.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Nope. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultraviolet_catastrophe" target="_blank">myth of the ultraviolet catastrophe</a>. Planck hadn't concerned himself with that failure of classical physics.</p>
<p>His model <em>resolved</em> the problem of the ultraviolet catastrophe, but that wasn't his starting point or motivation at all. In fact, it was only discovered later on that his model resolved the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, he actually used discrete packets out of desperation </p>
<p>At first Planck considered that quantisation was only &quot;a purely formal assumption ... actually I did not think much about it...&quot;</p>
