			<div class="markdown"><p>But couldn't a bot just do exactly what a human does when it comes to moving a mouse and clicking? I mean it's silly to assume that a bot would click instantly, or that it would click right in the middle of the checkbox. Things can be randomized, or real human clicks could be recorded and played back with slight modifications each time. I don't believe that this would be so difficult to emulate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. It's just one of many checks. It's like asking a programmer in an interview to write a simple program. Doesn't mean they didn't just memorize a few lines of code, but it'll catch enough fakes to potentially be worth it.</p>
<p>By catching it here, they can avoid a complex and expensive database call to analyze this user profiles history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think mouse movements form part of it at all. It's nothing to do with the behaviour of the user on the browser side. When you get the checkbox instead of a captcha, Google has already verified you by your browser fingerprint. </p>
<p>If Google can't verify you, they'll show the captcha instead of the checkbox. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cant a bot just press tab a few times till you land on the capchta button and hit enter? Thats why I do sometimes when its not the picture captcha or the writing captcha.</p></div>		</li>
