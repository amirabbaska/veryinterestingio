			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be LN's &quot;protocol&quot;, but reality it is not. I worked for a company that used LN and while our HQ or something may have had a locking file, but no other location (definitely not ours) did. Data security was so lax that an IT worker accidentally wiped out the entire network for a few days and showed the nightly backups hadn't been working for about 6 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't doubt that at all, but when I say data security I mean it mainly in the old school way. Ideally, you write down your sensitive personally identifiable information (full name, DOB, SSN) on a consent form, the HR person enters it into the background check website, then locks it away in a file cabinet and no one else can get their hands on it unless authorized to access those files. If they print out any of your information it is intended to only be kept in a locked file cabinet as well. </p></div>		</li>

I use LN to order police reports, find out what carrier insures a vehicle, but mostly to obtain the (Medicare) info that I need in order to pay medical bills (full legal name, DOB, gender, SSN) on your behalf. <inset rant here about knuckleheads who refuse to provide such info when asked> </p>
<p>Also, unauthorized searches here get you so fired so fast. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can second otterish - I work for one of the three biggest auto insurance companies in the USA and handle injury claims for them (attorneys/medical bill settlements.) We use it for police reports, to find hit and run drivers without a police report (license plate search,) and to confirm when someone says they have no medical history before we settle an injury claim, typically.</p>
<p>Any unauthorized use will get you fired immediately. Accessing private data without a business <em>need</em> at my company will get you fired without a prior warning. Technically, yes, I could find data and use it for nefarious purposes, but the tracking systems on our computers would out me and I'd get fired within days of accessing the material. </p></div>		</li>

<p>but wait, I already gave you all the information you need in this manner when my insurance company contacted you, we have all already given all of this info, why do you need to obtain it again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually keeps your rates down. Every insurance claim you make whether it's a car accident or hail damage to your roof gets reported to Lexis through a product they have called CLUE. </p>
<p>The insurers buy access to the CLUE data so they can give rates based on your claims history.</p>
<p>If they didn't do this then someone could file a claim every year and get new insurance after the claim is filed. This person would be creating a lot of expenses for the insurer and the insurer would have to make up the costs by charging the rest of us more.</p>
<p>By sharing the claims history that person would be charged more after making claims so the insurer wouldn't have to charge you more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They pay to see it. Lexis Nexis aggregates public information on you, like property ownership history, previous addresses, arrest/criminal history, etc. They aggregated this data without nefarious intent, but to make money as well.  They sell this data to companies who agree to be responsible with the way they use it.  The reason for the credentialing process is to make sure the data is used for legal purposes (legitimate marketing, background checks, etc) versus illegitimateâ€‹ (spam, identity theft, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, the passwords to get into the site have to meet the highest standards also, and you could lose your account and face legal repercussions if you let someone use it or don't obtain consent for the people you're searching. Your mom would probably have to call tech support every 30 days when her password expired.</p></div>		</li>
