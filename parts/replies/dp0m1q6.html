			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this info and link. I'm curious, and you may not know, but about how long would it take something like Friedrich Bessel's 1838 work to become more widely known to nonscientists, particularly in the US at that time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly have no idea how long the information would take to travel. </p>
<p>Passenger vessels were taking around half a month at that point to cross the Atlantic. So assume 20 days at minimum for information to get from a desk in England to a desk in New England and start spreading. </p>
<p>No airplanes or telegraph transatlantic as far as I know at that point.</p>
<p>However, as it suggests in the link, this wasn't a sudden idea. The idea that our sun and other stars are the same had been scientifically supported for generations by the 1830s. Plenty of time for correspondence of all the details (except for solid distance calculations) before Dick wrote anything. </p>
<p>Hence my suggestion that he wasn't just going with the evidence in his early volumes, he was either ignorant, which is reasonable for the times, or his writings had less than purely scientific goals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured it would be a long shot and I can probably figure it out but thought I'd ask in the off chance you knew such random details. ;) Seriously,  thank you.</p></div>		</li>
