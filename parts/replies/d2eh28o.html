			<div class="markdown"><p>Well like I said, KCl is a salt substitute and would enhance flavor similarly.  The other salts, namely the heavier anions (Br and I) impart other, bitter flavors as well, so you would not want to put them on your food.  Also, I'm pretty sure they might be slightly toxic.  But don't quote me on that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the sensors that detect sweetness only work in the presence of salt (ideally with sodium salts, but some salts with potassium and lithium work as well). That's at least why salt enhances sweet flavors (like salted caramel) -- the full range of sweet-sensors are only active in the presence of salt.</p>
<p>Salt also enhances umami flavor, but not for the same reason. Taste receptors that bind the amino acid, L-glutamic acid (and to a lesser extent L-aspartic acid), as well as certain 5'-ribonucleotides (IMP and GMP) are responsible for perceiving this flavor. These receptors are only fully activated by the salts of those amino acids (i.e. L-glutamate and L-aspartate) or in the presents of salt (i.e. salt needs to be around for their full activation). That's why MSG (monosodium glutamate) and MKG (monopotassium glutamate) are common food additives in savory dishes. </p>
<p>Similarly, 5'-ribonucleotide salts (like disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate) are common food additives as they also enhance activation of these receptors compared to their activation by IMP or GMP alone. Dipotassium guanylate and dipotassium inosinate are also used as food additives for the same reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this what you are tasting when you lick certain parts on a chunk of potash? </p>
<p>It is, isn't it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I, and others around me when I was a kid, had chunks of potash because of where we lived, and there are different types of flavour and saltiness depending on the colour you lick.</p>
<p>Some parts kind of sting your tongue, and some are just like intensely salty.</p>
<p>I realise how weird this sounds, but if you are a kid in potash country, almost everyone has some kicking around, and everyone knows where the sting-y and the best salty parts are.</p></div>		</li>
