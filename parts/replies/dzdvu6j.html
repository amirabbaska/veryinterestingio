			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that is only for C-corp.   And S-corp doesn't technically pay income tax, it's share holders do.  Whatever taxable income an S-corp makes showas up on the personal Incomw tax returns of the share holders, divided up based on how many shares each holds.</p>
<p>But once your corporation is grossing over a certain amount each year it is better to be a C-copr and pay the double tax, it ends up being less in the long run.   So S-copr is really only pratical for small business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I assumed the question was based on C-Corps because they’re the only form that’s taxed at the corporate level. And S-Corps are not just only <em>practical</em> for small businesses - it’s a form of corporation that’s only <em>allowed</em> if there are less than 101 shareholders. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Figured I would add some clarification for people.</p>
<p>And didn't know about the 101 shareholders.   I was under the impression all corporation start as a C-corp and then you elect to be taxed as an S-corp.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a good rule of thumb. C vs S depends on numerous factors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our share of our main business is owned by the trustee of our family trust which is not an individual... The trustee that holds the shares for the trust is a company with no employees.</p>
<p>Individuals tax does get paid eventually (less franking credits) but only after the dividend and then the discretionary distribution. </p>
<p>Tldr; companies can also be groups of companies rather than groups of people. </p>
<p>Ps. Australian here - for context. </p></div>		</li>
