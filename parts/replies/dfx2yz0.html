			<div class="markdown"><p>Conversely i met a guy who has that tattooed on his leg, i complimented it and mentioned pulsars and Voyager, he had no clue what i was talking about... which was the weirdest thing as why did he have it tattooed if he didn't understand the significance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be extremely unlikely. A neutron star is spinning because the star from which it collapsed was spinning (conversation of angular momentum). So you'd need for either that main sequence star to have not been spinning (also extremely unlikely) or for something to have cancelled the neutron star's angular momentum (very difficult).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be like water not forming a whirlpool as it goes down your drain. The mass of the star collapsing inwards is like the water flowing downwards. In both cases the potential energy is naturally converted into rotational energy.</p></div>		</li>
