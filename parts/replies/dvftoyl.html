			<div class="markdown"><p>The relativity of frames of reference only work if they are not accelerating with respect to each other. The frame of reference in which the object is stationary is rotating and by definition, is always accelerating, and hence relativity doesn't really apply here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your sort of hinting at the fact that no absolute VELOCITY exists. You are correct. Your velocity depends on your frame of reference. This isn't the case with acceleration. Acceleration of an object will be the same from all reference points unless that reference is itself accelerating. (I avoided the terminology inertial and non-inertial but, this is where they would apply). You might think; &quot;oh but now we have the same problem! We don't know who's accelerating and who's not, is it you, or me, or both!&quot;. But that's where Newton's Second Law comes in. We can calculate an objects acceleration by looking at the forces acting upon it. If I know that no forces are acting upon me and for some reason it seems if I am accelerating in comparison to something else, but that something else has a force acting on it...then I know IT'S the one accelerating. If I know more about this force acting on this something else, I can calculate the inertia of  the object and me by observing it over a period of time. Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reference frames only cancel out for linear motion. If you and an object are both hurtling through space at 10,000 m/s, but are completely parallel, you will seem to be totally still relative to each other.</p>
<p>Rotation, however, means you're perpendicular to the axis of rotation, so you're constantly being thrown &quot;away&quot; from it.</p></div>		</li>
