<p>I was about to answer the question the same way. I was sure someone had already said this, but everyone had gone of in all directions that were mostly or all misleading and/or wrong.</p>
<p>Scar tissue is not living tissue. Think of it as like the exoskeleton of insects.  It was secreted by a living cell, but is not itself alive. It's like the silk/web spun by a spider. It's been secreted to &quot;fill up and hold that &quot;hole&quot; that was there shut.   Your skin and organs are full of collagen fibers to give &quot;framework&quot; to them.   If you've heard of facial fillers, used in cosmetic dermatology some of those fillers are made of collagen or a synthetic compound to mimic it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a scar that you'd like to get rid of, see a dermatologist. There different types of scars/scar tissue. The appearance of some can be improved (at least partially).  Aconsult with a dermatologist or plastic surgeon will give you some answers and potential options to improve the scar. </p></div>		</li>
