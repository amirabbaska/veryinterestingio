<p>In this case it just happens to work out this way but I can guarantee you this wasnt designed into the remote for that reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not disagreeing, but I'll elaborate - the thread seemed to be overlooking the fact that it was a very good design solution.  My point should have been that cheap didn't equate to poor quality in this case.   And, yes, cost is probably the main reason they are used. </p>
<p>And when I said great design, although I didn't say so, I was definitely also thinking of the cost factor as being part of that great design.</p>
<p>I'm an electronic technician and for over 30 years, I've been repairing a diverse range of both domestic and commercial / scientific equipment and it's remarkable that the design of those membrane switches has been essentially unchanged since they first appeared in equipment.  And the reliability was there from day one.</p></div>		</li>
