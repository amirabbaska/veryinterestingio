			<div class="markdown"><p>With a background in cognitive neuroscience, just want to add a perspective that might satisfy OP's need for a 'biology' perspective (see tag): </p>
<p>The brain is such an interesting thing. You can look at it purely from a functional perspective, and purely from a biological/physical perspective. For a long time, these were separated in their scientific endeavours, and only since a few decades they're moving together.</p>
<p>A key insight is how its <em>physical/biological</em> structure and its <em>function/information</em> relate to eachother. </p>
<p>Beliefs, just like everything else in the brain, can be seen as representations of what is 'out' there - elsewhere in the brain, body, or world. This allows us to meaningfully respond and process the myriad of signals coming into our brain through our senses.</p>
<p>Now we don't 'sense' abstract beliefs like those on morality, politics, or identity. The amazing beauty of the brain allow us to somehow derive these from the basic physical signals, and even if these beliefs concern the abstract, they are still grounded in something physical in our brain. </p>
<p>The point is, everything mental has a physical basis; some neural structure. Even more importantly, these neural structures are all interconnected, just like the concepts they correspond to. In addition, independently they all have a certain 'survival instinct' - their biological nature still demands an energetic efficiency.</p>
<p>This right here is the biological equivalent of the phenomena explained by /u/codece . In the following, with &quot;beliefs&quot; I mean &quot;neural basis of beliefs&quot;:</p>
<p>Beliefs emerge in the brain because experience demanded its existence to make sense of the world. In turn, they also help make sense for other beliefs you have, when they are meaningfully related: <strong>a set of beliefs acts as an explanatory framework for other related beliefs.</strong> This is just by design; how else do these beliefs stay stable despite the biological noise? The less reliably beliefs can 'tune' themselves based on the external reality, the more they depend on the internal beliefs that relate to it. </p>
<p>In addition, it is not only the interdependence of <em>beliefs</em>, but also the way they're connected and influence <strong>identity</strong> and other emotional attitudes. Beliefs are not just about the world, but also about your identity. And our identity and all the things it consists of and depends on, all by design lead to resistance whenever it's threatened. Identity connects us with our social environment, ego drives motivation and resolves internal conflict, the self is the central framework that binds experience. It's not just philosophy, it's a physical reality. </p>
<p>This is the basis of dogma and power of indoctrination and propaganda. For any belief, you can theoretically manipulate the strength by fostering the surrounding beliefs that support it, and the opposite for any incongruent beliefs.</p>
<p>The modern politicization and emotional weighting of important issues, the echo chambers and filter bubbles created by algorithms and for-profit information and media organisations, all  heavily exacerbate this to the point that it's a major driver of societal division. Even worse, few see the impact it has on society, and few are trying to solve this. It's difficult to see the cause of these problems as our environment, rather than some scapegoat like foreign forces, corporations, and governments. </p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong>  </p>
<p>The neurobiological basis of beliefs, and their interdependence in the self-organizing brain, lead to a vulnerability to developing dogmas and disproportional resistance to change in beliefs, especially if tied to identity/ego. </p>
<p>The current state of our information-media landscape only makes this worse as seen in filter bubbles and echo chambers, making the world too small to develop healthily balanced belief systems.</p>
<p><em>just realized it's eli5 so:</em><br />
<strong>ELI5 TL;DR</strong><br />
Beliefs are like the parts of a little society in your brain. Naturally, just like people, communities, and companies, all the beliefs and the groups of beliefs, want to survive as they are, because they depend on eachother to survive all the difficulties thrown at them by the world and each other. </p>
<p>It takes a lot to change what 'seems' to already 'work', and the bigger the required change, the more energy and effort it takes to 'convince' the brain to execute that change. </p>
<p>In the challenge of these beliefs, all the challenged beliefs are engaged in some kind of discussion. Just like in real life - if the change doesn't happen, it's like a victory, and the status quo is strengthened.</p>
<p>*edit:
If this resonated with you, and/or want to do something about it, please consider checking out our charity foundation: <a href="https://www.ananas.org.uk" target="_blank">Ananas</a> or our <a href="https://reddit.com/r/anacoin" target="_blank">subreddit</a>, to learn more about our vision on today's societal issues and what we can do against it. </p>
<p>We're a growing organisation with an ambitious mission, and welcome all the feedback, thoughts, and contributions that can help us further. Later this year we will be focusing on getting people together to address this problem - because it's unlikely to come from the government or for-profit organisations, and the issue is too important to leave to chance!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As long as we're talking about the backfire effect, I think it's worth mentioning that the finding of its existence from the 2010 study <a href="http://djflynn.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/elusive-backfire-effect-wood-porter.pdf" target="_blank">has failed to replicate multiple times</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The present paper presents results from four experiments in which we enrolled more than 8,100 subjects and tested 36 issues of potential backfire. Across all experiments, we found only one issue capable of triggering backfire: whether WMD were found in Iraq in 2003. Even this limited case was susceptible to a survey item effect; when presented with a less elaborate survey item, we found no WMD factual backfire. Comparably elaborate items were incapable of instilling backfire in questions other than WMD. Evidence of factual backfire is far more tenuous than prior research suggests. By and large, citizens heed factual information, even when such information challenges their partisan and ideological commitments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are various other cognitive biases that may account for people refusing to change their beliefs, but the backfire effect in particular is unlikely to be one of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep now everything is on equal footing, the NY Times and Huff Post are of equal validity because I can just choose to see one as fake news over the other. It will be a race to the bottom. That's why I advocate finding a news source that is at least slightly opposed to your own political beliefs but still is decent quality and supporting it. I can't stand half the stuff written by people of my own political beliefs because it doesn't require me to think at all. Its like a big circle jerk of &quot;yes i'm right&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard a convincing argument from a grad student at Syracuse that &quot;free media&quot; that is supported by ads is a huge factor in the deteriorating news quality. Basically the companies are only concerned about clicks and ad revenue, so they have to push stories that will gain those things; typically sensational or confirming the viewers' beliefs. </p>
<p>He argued that news sources would most likely become more factual and less sensational if they were subscription based instead, since the company doesn't have to worry about sensationalist titles to gain clicks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unrelated to faith, but I currently work not in my home country. I live in Germany, but work in the french part of Luxembourg.</p>
<p>Something I noticed about me, I am getting more German, I never thought of myself as &quot;German&quot;, but being in a very french &quot;world&quot; I notice that I start to see myself as German and really hold on to this in an environment, where everybody speaks french. Like I fear losing it my own identity. I realized this the first time when I started to pronounce certain words french. not German. </p>
<p>I think this is something quite similar. If you consider your belief as part of your identity and somebody tries to change this identity. you hold on tight not to lose it. Evidence, Reason all dont work here. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Case in point, I say &quot;fakin' hell!&quot;  Far too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this when I lived in Australia. The Aussies never fail to point out your British-ness and the way we pronounce words differently. My accent is fairly non-descript anyway. Most people wouldn't really be able to tell where I'm from except 'south'.</p>
<p>Consequently my language changed and I started sounding like an archetypal British army officer of WW2 era!!!</p>
<p>I'd use words and phrases like 'crikey' , 'righto' and 'come on chaps'. I became more and more British sounding. It was very strange. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister learnt a bit about child psychology when she was at uni. Humans crave stability, children and adults, and anything that messes with our comfortable stability, whether that's opinions or environment we rebel against it cause it makes us uncomfortable. It's like when you go on holiday but after a while you long to be home, or the rituals you do daily, when someone messes with your comfortable 'truths' so you have to question yourself you don't like it.</p></div>		</li>
