			<div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone know why above the 10 Kbar mark the water starts turning back to ice as I always learned that water at 4 degrees C was the most dense form of water which is why the oceans are at that temperature at their deepest point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not correct.  For <strong>fresh water</strong> the maximum density is at 4°C but for <strong>salt water</strong> that unique density quirk of water no longer exists and the maximum density is at the phase transition from liquid to solid;  the dissolved salts depress the freezing point of seawater to -1.9223°C for typical 3.5% salinity and sea surface pressure. The densest waters formed in the ocean are around Antarctica and in the Northern North Atlantic.  In regions which are forming sea ice, the surface water must be cooled to the freezing point of -1.9°C. This creates the densest waters on the ocean and they sink and spill into the deep ocean circulation.  By the time this cold water descends to the abyss, it has entrained and mixed with surrounding waters so its temperature increases a bit from the surface freezing temperature. </p>
<p>The  coldest deep waters of the waters of the world ocean are those which are created in the ice-formation regions of Antarctica. Formation of sea ice requires huge losses of heat from the ocean to the atmosphere.  The waters surrounding Antarctica are the coldest seas of the world. They are also relatively fresh compared to the North Atlantic deep water formation sites. The dense water created by the heat loss to atmosphere sinks to the deep ocean and forms the Antarctic Bottom Water which is coldest at about -0.8 °C. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It never occurred to me before but why aren't the oceans way colder down so deep? On the surface it obviously gets much colder in the winter.  Is it the water pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funfact: it's called freezing point depression, and is a function of the ion concentration in the water. </p>
<p>This will also increase the temperature needed to make the liquid boil! Salt water will take longer to boil, but when it boils it will have a temperature higher then 100 degrees Celsius! Your potatoes would therefore take shorter time if boiled in salted water then not salted water! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a different form of ice than the form of ice we know, which can be denser than water. It only exists in extreme situations such that it states, and it's more comparable to say we are forcing atoms together with so much force that the result should be reffered to as a solid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this form of ice cold? <del>Things under pressure are normally hotter than not, right?</del> <em>Seems this is the act of compression I am thinking of. Sorry.</em> </p>
<p>Also, if you smashed water into this ice, would it change back to water immediately after releasing the pressure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much agreeing with the other response, but here's the wiki article that explains all the different phases of ice and their different characteristics.  Basically when ice is formed by intense pressure it doesn't expand like normal ice does because it takes on a different crystal structure</p>
