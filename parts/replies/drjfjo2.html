<p>however, there are theories that predict their existence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's an important distinction to be clarified here.</p>
<p>Theories like Kaluza-Klein do not &quot;predict&quot; the presence of extra dimensions (spatial or otherwise). What they instead do is start from the assumption that there are additional spatial dimensions, with this assumption then used as a basis to calculate the physical consequences of such extra dimensions.</p>
<p>That is, the extra dimensions are inserted into a given theory &quot;by hand&quot;, with the theory then developed to allow experimentally observable effects/properties to be predicted. If those predictions (i) deviate from the equivalent predictions made in conventional 3+1 dimensional spacetime, and (ii) agree with experimental measurements, then this provides support for - but not necessarily explicit confirmation of - the presence of extra dimensions.</p>
<p>This is then distinct from being a prediction of the presence of extra dimensions. For example, different theories having different numbers of dimensions could, in principle, provide the same predictions for certain measurable effects/properties, so that agreement with experimental data alone might not enable the &quot;correct&quot; number of dimensions to be identified on the basis of any two given such theories.</p>
<p>The fundamental distinction lies in the interpretation of physical models: it is important to bear in mind that theory generally develops phenomenologically, as a series of more and more &quot;exact&quot; descriptions of a given physical system with the aim being to have predictions be consistent with as much experimental data as possible. However, such consistency does not unambiguously imply that the axioms and/or assumptions that underpin a given theory are objectively &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;true&quot;.</p>
<p>I like this think of it in terms that theoretical physics gives us a set of tools that can - when interpreted within the proper context/limitations of the model(s) under consideration - describe &quot;how&quot; physical systems behave, but do not tell us, on the most fundamental level, &quot;why&quot; they behave in such a manner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point, actually, and thanks for clearing it up for other people</p>
<p>It’s important to note for others reading the thread that KK Theory isn’t necessarily a theory of a fifth dimension, but rather a UFT of gravitation and EM created around the idea of a 5th dimension </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain what you mean by a &quot;small&quot; dimension? It sounds like you're implying that this dimension only exists at the microscopic level. But that doesn't make sense to me -- a 2D plane can be infinitely large, just like a 3D volume can be infinitely large. Are you saying there could be spatial dimensions that can't be larger than a certain size?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i only just learned of this (independently of this post) while researching in relation to this question, and i was very happy to see that someone else posted it and is in agreement with what i am finding! i hadn't dug into string theory since highschool/ over a decade ago, and want to know of any good sources to get updated on the current~ coincidence in science is a good indicator that there is more to learn beneath the surface. has there been any further development in agreement with known phenomena based on Kaluza's work and foundations? Einstein seemed in support enough. </p>
<p>on a tangent, is there any known collaboration between Kaluza, Einstein, and the elderly Tesla?  </p></div>		</li>
