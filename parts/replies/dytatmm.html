			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes that stuff gets hashed before it goes into the database, but a lot less often than passwords</p>
<p>that's why it's a good idea for sites using that kind of stuff for password recovery to just generate a 2nd and 3rd password in your password manager for those recovery questions</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do something similar, but use nonsensical answers.</p>
<p>Something like &quot;What's your favourite food?&quot; &quot;Dishwasher&quot;</p>
<p>It's easier to tell a rep that than a long randomly generated password.  I use different values for each site and keep them in the notes section of keepass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. Passwords are (ideally) salted and hashed using <code>bcrypt</code> before being saved in the database. So your password of <code>hunter2</code> is going to be saved as <code>$2a$10$McoLsaOVdO9yCt0a8RVL0Os7ZXc3yORXQACR0e6K7NLZHZRa3f8Fq</code> or something and it's 'irrerversiable' for all intents and purposes.</p>
<p>Your security question is stored in plaintext because the customer service agent needs to be able to verify it's the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there then other passwords that would also be saved as the same string of characters? Because it would seem like every input having a different output is easier to crack, but at the same time, two different entries potentially unlocking the same password would be an issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's really being used as a second level password that can be used to reset the primary password, and you only have one mother with a maiden name (most do I'd imagine), then if the database gets leaked and shared, your account is effectively unsecured.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dr. Pearlman. </p>
<p>I once asked him if he had a cafeteria. He didn't. I was disappointed that I would not be getting a snack from the hospital vending machine. </p>
<p>My mom worked in a hospital, and whenever we visited her at work, we went to the cafeteria and got a snack from the vending machines. My baby logic went something like this: </p>
<p>Hospitals have cafeterias.<br />
Doctors work in hospitals.<br />
Therefore, doctors have cafeterias.</p></div>		</li>
