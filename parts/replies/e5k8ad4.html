			<div class="markdown"><p>You've built up an invigorating routine based around coffee in the morning. You have become so ingrained in that behavioural pattern that you have essentially conditioned yourself to perk up so strongly that it works on placebo alone since you've got such a tolerance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. I would think that it wotld have to be blind. Ex: your wife makes decaf without telling you. </p>
<p>Also the taste would likely have to be the same for it to have any chance of working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>L-Theanine is remarkable for its ability to neutralize the anxiety and depression that caffeine causes.</p>
<p>/r/nootropics goes into this in depth, but it is 100% legitimate.  Since I started taking L-Theanine with caffeine (and occasionally during caffeine breaks), the usual caffeine-induced anxiety has been virtually nil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even at just two cups each morning? Hmmmm... Evening coffees are a rarity for me (just a restaurant thing) but I’ve always been that way. I used to find it odd that some folks couldn’t even have a coffee in the afternoon for fear of being up all night</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean I rarely drink coffee and when I do it really wakes me up. Like, I can’t have more than one a day and that’s coffee with a lot of milk. </p>
<p>So yeah depending on your perspective 2-3 is a lot. I guess you don’t lose anything if you try to stop drinking for a bit to lower your tolerance. </p></div>		</li>
