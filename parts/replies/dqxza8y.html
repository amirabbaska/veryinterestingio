<p>I get how an Iris constructs or expands for different light conditions, does the ear have a similar function for loud and quiet situations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_reflex" target="_blank">Acoustic reflex.</a></p>
<p>In your ear there's the eardrum, connected to a bunch of bones, which then connect to the cochlear (the thing that converts sound to electrical signals). There's muscles attached to the bones, which can pull on them. When this happens, the eardrum gets pulled too, making it stiffer and less responsive to sound. The part of the cochlear that the bones touch also tightens, with the same result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whenever it's super quiet and I turn on a sink the sound of the water always makes the inside of my ears &quot;twitch&quot;. It sounds and feels pretty funny, I bet its just this reflex being over-active that causes it. A lot of my reflexes are over-active so it wouldn't surprise me</p></div>		</li>
