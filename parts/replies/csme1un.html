			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with much of this, but I don't really see it as <em>always</em> being a relic of an older style of language.  I think that it almost strictly due the noun that is <em>actually</em> being referred to, even if it was dropped from the sentence because it was clear from context (and doing this wouldn't necessarily be conscious, but more of a naturally-developed convention).</p>
<p>I think the clearest support that I can give for the idea are the sentences &quot;he was in a show&quot; and &quot;he was on a show&quot;.  The first example implies that it was a live show/performance, whereäs the latter example would never be said for a live performance; it refers to the show being projected onto a screen.  The sentence &quot;he was in a movie&quot; refers to the events contained with<em>in</em> the movie, bound by its beginning and its end, which is the same concept as a book.  It totally would <em>not</em> be strange <em>at all</em> to say &quot;he was <em>in</em> a show <em>on TV</em>&quot;, which makes me feel like the in/on convention for TV is a shortened version of &quot;it was on (the TV screen, displaying) a show&quot; or an adapted/reärranged version of &quot;he was <em>in</em> <strong>a show</strong> <strong>on</strong> <em>the TV (screen)</em>&quot;, with the italic text being deleted and the order of &quot;a show&quot; and &quot;on&quot; being reversed.</p>
<p>We drop words (especially nouns) all the time, so I don't think it's an unreasonable proposal.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;English&quot; or &quot;French&quot; or &quot;Spanish&quot; are considered nouns now, but I think that's only because we've dropped the noun &quot;language&quot; or &quot;people&quot; for so long, as it's usually clear from context.  You wouldn't say &quot;it is dog&quot; because &quot;dog&quot; is a noun (i.e., without an article: a/the), but you can say &quot;it is English&quot; to refer to something originating from England, as &quot;English&quot; is an adjective, just like &quot;good&quot;, for which you can say &quot;it is good&quot;.</li>
<li>In more modern example, it's not uncommon to drop &quot;sauce&quot;, like &quot;Eww, this rice is gross.  What's all over it — sweet and sour?&quot;</li>
<li>We drop nouns whenever we can really get away with it, especially if it's already been prompted, like in a question:  &quot;Which sauce would be better: fish (sauce) or barbecue?&quot;.  Neither fish nor barbecues are sauces; <em>fish sauce</em> and <em>barbecue sauce</em> are sauces, but we drop the &quot;sauce&quot; because it's not necessary to say it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back on our original topic, the actual noun can be explicitly mentioned.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>I read it <em>in</em> <strong>a book</strong>.</li>
<li>She's a character <em>in</em> <strong>the story</strong>.</li>
<li>I don't know who starred <em>in</em> <strong>that play</strong>.</li>
<li>He wasn't <em>in</em> <strong>that movie</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a name of a show or movie is used, the name is only the title of the work, so we are essentially dropping the noun &quot;show&quot; or &quot;script/story&quot; and imply which noun we're dropping by our choice of preposition.  In other words, you can say either <em>in</em> or <em>on</em>, depending on whether you're referring to one's appearance occurring with<em>in</em> the boundaries of the show (the beginning and the ending), or instead referring to what is seen <em>on</em> the screen when the show is being displayed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why isn't Isaiah Washington in Grey's Anatomy anymore?</li>
<li>Why isn't Isaiah Washington on Grey's Anatomy anymore?</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are perfectly acceptable sentences, and the overall meaning is the same, but the use of in/on <em>might</em> give a clue as to what the person who asked was thinking (or why the person asked, or how they view the show).</p>
<p>We can also use it to help differentiate a TV show from a book, if that option is available (though not always unambiguously):</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is your favourite character on <em>Game of Thrones</em>? (definitely the TV show)</li>
<li>Who is your favourite character in <em>Game of Thrones</em>? (could be either)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of our general convention of &quot;in = play/movie; on = TV&quot;, I think we don't think of the meaning and whether or not it makes sense.  If someone is a voice actor, they're not visible; they're heard.  They're therefore not projected <em>on</em>to anything, but if our convention is now less about the meaning and more about commonly-heard word choice, then if &quot;<strong>actor</strong>&quot; + &quot;<strong>on</strong>&quot; = (television), then we're probably thinking &quot;Billy West is a voice <strong>actor</strong> <strong><em>on</em></strong> <em>Futurama</em>&quot;, choosing &quot;on&quot; because it fits our formula.</p>
<p>The last bit of support that I have for this is what <em>other</em> words we use when referring to someone in a TV show.  We'll probably be more like to use &quot;on<em> in simple sentences referring directly to the show, like &quot;The phenomenal Kate Mulgrew is <strong>on</strong> </em>Star Trek: Voyager<em>&quot;, although &quot;in&quot; would certainly work.  The more words that we put between &quot;is&quot; and &quot;</em>Star Trek: Voyager<em>&quot; that still directly refer to her occurrence, the more we may tend to choose &quot;in&quot;.  &quot;The phenomenal Kate Mulgrew&quot; is <strong>in</strong> every episode of </em>Star Trek: Voyager<em>&quot;: choosing &quot;on&quot; seems less likely to be said, but if chosen, emphasises her appearance rather than her casting.  &quot;</em>Seven of Nine<em> was first seen <strong>in</strong> the fourth season of </em>Star Trek: Voyager*&quot;: we would almost always choose &quot;in&quot;.</p>
<p>From the above examples, it seems like the more separation we get between the conjugated verb (e.g., &quot;is&quot;) and the particular show (or simply &quot;TV&quot;), the more likely we seem to be to choose the contextually-appropriate preposition, and not one that comes from our simplified convention.  When the sentence structure deviates from the convention's formula, we're probably not using the convention at all, and instead form a unique sentence with appropriate words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great point.  If you think about it you do say &quot;I saw that actor on the big screen&quot; which is referring to a movie, but we say on instead of in because you are talking about the actual movie screen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because a movie is a construct.  We would say &quot;on film&quot; in place.  Consider other examples:</p>
<p>&quot;In a book&quot; and &quot;on paper&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In a presentation&quot; and &quot;on a slide&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In a movie&quot; and &quot;on film&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perfect! exactly,thank you I wasn't sure how to say it. Now if you could explain &quot;construct&quot; is. Oh, and what would &quot;on film&quot; be (not a construct but a...)? English may not be my best written language, esp. grammar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also refers to two different things. When you say you saw a person ON tv, you are describing the place that you saw that person -- they were displayed on the TV. When you say you saw them IN the theater, you are describing where you physically were when you saw that person -- you were in the theater.</p>
<p>Likewise, when referring to classic stage theater, you might either say &quot;I saw the actor on stage&quot; or you might say &quot;I saw the actor in theater.&quot; The first describes where they were in relation to you, and the second describes where you were in relation to them. But the meaning is understood to be the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is correct. We say &quot;he's on this TV show&quot; because it's recurring/ongoing. That's why we we also say &quot;on this radio station&quot;. We use &quot;in&quot; if we're referring to something specific like &quot;he's in this episode&quot; or &quot;in this movie&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To throw a wrench into this, when we talk about the TV Series, we don't use &quot;on&quot;.  In other words &quot;<em>David Duchovny starred in the X-files</em>&quot; but when we talk about a past episode we sometimes use &quot;on.&quot;  To continue with this example &quot;<em>I saw David Duchovny on  the X-files last night</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this still fits into the &quot;recurring/ongoing&quot; part of the definition. Seeing him &quot;on the X-Files last night&quot; was part of a recurring event, where as &quot;he starred in the X-Files&quot; refers to the series as a collection of information, not an event.</p></div>		</li>

<p>David Duchovny was on The X-Files</p>
<p>If I said David Duchovny was in The X-Files, it implies The X-Files to be a single thing, not a recurring series.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a similar discussion with non-English speakers about semantics - why do we get <em>on</em> a bus but <em>in</em> a car etc.</p>
<p>The conclusion we came to was compatible with your suggestion. With the exception of &quot;on a bike&quot; (a more literal &quot;on top of&quot; than other transports), you get &quot;on&quot; a plane, train, bus, ferry and most transports where you are joining a recurring/ongoing journey. You get &quot;in&quot; taxis, cars and other transports where the passenger determines a singular destination.</p>
<p>It's worth conceding that actors appear &quot;in&quot; a stage play which may have prompted people to use the term for the early days of cinema. This would add weight to TV and radio using device-centric etymology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't necessarily work. In British English, we often say 'programme' rather than 'show', and it's definitely 'in a programme', despite its recurring nature.</p></div>		</li>
