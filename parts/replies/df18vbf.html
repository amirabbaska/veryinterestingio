<p>This is from snellen's clinical anatomy textbook. Will post more details when I'm at a real computer. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagine an arch, and then take any two points on it; the path between those points on the arch will just be a smaller one, and so if you imagine force being exerted there it would be able to bend slightly towards flat and absorb some of that force.</p>
<p>Considering an arched foot: if you step on uneven ground, the portions between those points will be able to bend slightly and absorb. If it was flat but the ground wasn't, a flat foot would be no better.</p>
<p>The simplest counterproposal is that a flat foot would just bend slightly to be concave. The point of the arch, though, is that both sides are connected by tendons and held in that arch under tension. Rather than the bones and flesh actually bending much, a muscle tenses and absorbs the stress elsewhere, keeping the foot's integrity.</p>
<p>If you extend this to running, it's possible to absorb some impact from the foot striking the ground and then spring from that in a more efficient motion. Tendon/muscle stretched along a flat foot wouldn't be able to do this as effectively.</p>
<p>And I've digressed too far. Have a nice day!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a horrible analogy. </p>
<p>Bridges are meant to be stable and non moving. </p>
<p>Human feet are used to move a person around. </p>
<p>TL;DR: The arch in the foot is caused by &quot;springs&quot; to dampen and optimize human movement, not to fully distribute the forces of static standing. </p>
<p>When you hike on rugged terrain, you traverse using the ball of your foot and toes more than the entire foot. </p>
<p>When you run, the flex of the arch, ankle, and knee acts as cushions, unless you wear modern shoes with highly dampened heels. Also, many people run using just the tips of their feet and do so just fine. </p>
<p>When you walk, the muscle in the arch also acts as a spring during locomotion (along with a plethora of other muscles). </p>
<p>Lastly, when standing, the arch itself doesn't do anything. Your heels bear most of the weight while the front of the feet stabilize the stance, which can be done without an arch. </p>
<p>Long story short, humans have foot arches, monkeys don't: we both can stand on two just two feet but only one of us can do some long distance running. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A stronger bridge would actually be a wall with no gap beneath it, not an arch.  The strain would be across all points equally.</p>
<p>With an arch, you're taking all the pressure and distributing it unevenly - by sending it to the two ends.  This is great for bridges where you can concentrate all the energy into strong, lode bearing columns.</p>
<p>Standing still on a flat surface, what would be the point of sending all the weight of your body onto a smaller surface area?  There isn't one.  That's like claiming it's less strain to stand on tiptoes than to kneel.  The larger surface area is actually better for handling pressure.</p>
<p>Your analogy is actually terrible because it's completely wrong in what it's claiming, and actually makes no mention of the point of the foot's arch - minimizing shock while walking.</p>
<p>Flat feet standing still would be actually much stronger than an arch.  But because we walk around, and run, it'd be a bad plan because it'd be worse at keeping the rest of our body from being jounced around.</p>
<p>But yes, if you're going to make a stone bridge with a gap underneath, an arch is much better than two pillars and a perpendicular horizontal stretch.</p></div>		</li>
