			<div class="markdown"><p>For orbiting spacecraft - yeah - there is hope from launch ‘We’ll get an extra couple of years out of this....what’s our LV mass margin...squeeze a bit more hydrazine in there’.  But this is different....</p>
<p>So yes - there was conservative assumptions in this - <a href="https://trs.jpl.nasa.gov/bitstream/handle/2014/11979/02-0732.pdf" target="_blank">but the best understanding of the spacecraft, and Mars, put it at 90-100 sols</a></p>
<p>Even the PI in interviews has said If you had tied him down at launch, given him truth serum and asked....he’d have said 120, maybe I’d everything goes perfect 180 sols.</p>
<p>But not coming up on 5,000.</p></div>		</li>
