			<div class="markdown"><p>The needed a backend video delivery system for traditional cable service too, so needing to store and serve the data isn't new,  but they don't need to connect ethernet to the customers.  Their infrastructure are all outsourced  They don't event touch their own servers,   they outsource that too -- Amazon Web Services is amazingly cost efficient</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to look at the point of them bypassing the last mile of the infrastructure is to imagine if every traditional and mobile ISP in the world was able to simultaneously and permanently refuse to deliver Netflix to their customers, but for whatever reason Netflix wanted to continue as a company.</p>
<p>Suddenly, next to the cable box in your neighborhood, there would be a Netflix box. In addition to the cable line running into your house, you'd need a technician to come out and install a Netflix line. (Either that, or they'd have to go the satellite dish route.)</p>
<p>I don't even think that would actually be enough. I'm just making this up, so my technical details could be incorrect but: computers, TVs, and phones are currently only designed to watch Netflix via the same ethernet/WiFi/radio as the rest of your internet. Modems/routers would need to start adding a &quot;Netflix in&quot; port, to be able to distribute the Netflix signal seamlessly alongside the rest of the ethernet/WiFi. If they wanted Netflix to continue to work on mobiles phones when they weren't connected to WiFi, I don't even know what they'd need to do. Get manufacturers to start adding &quot;Netflix&quot; radio receivers to phones, and build their own Netflix radio towers across the entire world?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Netflix viewers watch one billion hours of video per week, its 3gb per hour, if they were on a default AWS package (which of course they are not), that would come to 618,043,626 per month. </p>
<p>Of course Netflix doesn't use AWS to host their content because that would be insane, they have their own CDN and infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>
