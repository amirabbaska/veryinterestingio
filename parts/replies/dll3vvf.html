			<div class="markdown"><p>The memory is a distributed pattern of neuronal activation. If you remember a rose you smelled in England last year with your girlfriend, the areas of your brain devoted to those sensations and concepts will become electrically active. The electrical activation of a neuron occurs when its membrane voltage rises. The rising voltage is caused by the movement of sodium ions into the cell. There will be chemical communication between neurons if the voltage changes enough to fire an action potential. </p>
<p>Some areas of your brain (including the hippocampus) take input from all of the other areas of the brain (like those sensory and concept devoted areas). The summation of those values is what you experience as a memory. Short-term memories work a little differently, but the basic principles above, are still true for them as well. </p>
<p>Sorry, not an official neuroscientist, just a cell biologist, so some things may be better explained by an expert. </p></div>		</li>
