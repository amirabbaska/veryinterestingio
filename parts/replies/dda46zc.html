<p>I'm no expert in this (but am married to someone who is!), so I've heard the ELI5 on it and can relay.  The RAS monitors your senses when you sleep - not just external stimuli, but temperature and other sensations (like having to go to the bathroom). When any of those stimuli start to suggest problems, the RAS kicks off a cascade of other brain-stem activity that wakes you up. How quickly you wake depends on how far out of normal those input stimuli are: a sudden loud noise represents an emergency, and your brain pulls out all the stops to get you up and moving in a hurry.</p>
<p>This system depends on other parts of your brain to learn which stimuli are worth waking for. The absence of a stimuli can trigger it (sudden silence in a usually noisy environment), and common loud noises (horns, sirens, and garbage trucks in the city) will eventually get ignored. You can also learn to be far more sensitive to certain things: parents of young children usually wake very quickly to unusual noises or changes in the environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sudden unexpected noises, sensations, and strong scents/smells.</p>
<p>I've got one event in mind, that will stick with me, for the rest of my life.</p>
<p>So, it's a Friday, after a long day out, I come home, my Dad is just behind me, we chat, it's a good chat, but he always lectures me(I miss that the most), he often smoked, and drank wine, beer, or whiskey, just to add clarity.</p>
<p>We both go in the house, sit in front of the TV, my mum has just made dinner, my dad complains that it's really salty, but it's not.</p>
<p>Moving on, we all go to bed, then hours later, while still asleep, my heart rate jumps, adrenaline is pumped, and I feel a bit sick, then I wake up, and I hear my mum, and sister, crying, and saying &quot;noooo&quot;... I walk to my mum's room, and see my dad, as still as can be... he never moved again... due to a clot in his brain.</p>
<p>It's fine if this is removed, because it may not belong here, but I had to share this, because it's been nearly 3 years, and I still wake up, expecting to see my dad, even though I moved out... as I said, it's fine this is removed, because at least you saw it, and felt something, and hopefully you'll question your life decisions, and maybe the next time you smoke, or drink, you'll ask yourself, &quot;Do I really want to do this?&quot;, &quot;Do I need these?&quot;, &quot;What if I had children, and I suddenly die, because I couldn't give up smoking, or drank less?&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
