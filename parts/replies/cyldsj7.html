<p>This is incorrect. This is not attentional blink. For two major reasons: </p>
<p>1) attentional blink is a temporal phenomenon about attention deployed to one spatial location. There are some extensions to attentional blink to include spatial-temporal features (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698902001293" target="_blank">example</a>). But I am unsure how in these temporal-spatial extensions this phenomenon would apply</p>
<p>2) Attentional blink is about selecting/finding stimuli of interest amongst a lot of distracting stimuli (not necessarily repeating stimuli). Reading is more spatial attention than selective attention (perhaps someone can argue that the selecting of a &quot;word&quot; when reading is selective attention - but applying this form of selective attention to the type used in attentional blink is still a stretch). If this was attentional blink, you would always miss every 2nd word in everything you read.</p>
<p>This is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_blindness" target="_blank">repetition blindness</a> (other examples of blindness include: change blindness, choice blindness &lt;- both interesting!) where we are unable to detect a repeated stimuli. This case of &quot;the the&quot; is a linguitistic form/semantic level selection of repetition blindness (i.e. their can be more &quot;low level&quot; perceptual selections that occur prior to &quot;higher levels&quot; (semantics)), and I don't know if (psycho)linguistics have their own term for this (they probably do). If it was attentional blink, it would work work for nearly all words. </p>
<p>While repetition blindness and attentional blink are quite similar each other - they are still different phenomena.  </p>
<p><strong>EDIT Below is ELI5 version</strong></p>
<p>Attentional blink is something different than this. What is attentional blink? The brain needs time to process stuff. Let's say there are three &quot;parts&quot; of the brain: perceptual (take in information), interpreting (analyze information) and motion (do stuff - we don't need motion for this explanation, but I mentioned it for completeness). When we see something it requires both perception and interpretation.</p>
<p>In attentional blink, the perceptual parts of the brain take in information about one spot in the world for a moment in time (up to 150 ms) - which they then give to the interpreting parts. The perceptual parts of the brain always take in new information. But these perceptual parts do not give the interpreting parts any more information (for about 300 ms) because the interpreting parts are busy with what they have been given. They don't want any more information. This means the brain can miss information in the world because we do not interpret it. We do not think we see it because the interpreting parts of the brain were already busy and does not take the new information from the perceptual parts. That is why we say that this is a &quot;blink&quot;. </p>
<p>Why is &quot;the the&quot; example not attentional blink? If the eyes move to a new spot, the interpreting parts of the brain now want this information and are no longer busy. When we read, each word is important in the sense that it is &quot;given&quot; to the interpreting parts by the perceptual parts. (Side note: if the perceptual areas see something emotional during the &quot;blink&quot;, this is also given to the interpreting parts)</p>
<p>So what is this &quot;the the&quot; thing? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repetition_blindness" target="_blank">repetition blindness</a>. It is kind of like attentional blink but different. The interpreting parts of the brain get the information from the perceptual parts the brain, but it ignores information that is repeated because the langauge-interpreting parts of the brain have said it is not important. Another type of blindness is change blindness where it can be hard to see one difference when everything else is identical. <a href="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/se367/10/presentation_local/Change%20Blindness_files/plane.gif" target="_blank">If you would like a go at change blindness 5 years olds like this stuff.^(Warning for flashing image.)</a> Here the interpreting parts of the brain are saying these two images are the same. Despite there being one big difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But attentional blink is about &quot;attending&quot; to a stimulus, not attending to the same stimulus. If it was attentional blink, we would miss every second word we read (assuming a saccade (eye movement) ever 250ms).</p>
<p>Think of attentional blink as the brain having a sampling rate. After every sample (150ms), it needs to process this and will not attend to anything else. </p>
<p>However moving to a new spatial location or having &quot;important&quot; stimuli (such as emotionally charged stimuli) can nullify the &quot;blink&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. </p>
<p>That's what repetition blindness does.</p>
<p>Especially with easy to process and/or uninteresting information.</p>
<p>As humans, we get bored reading it, so we want it it to be over quickly. Therefore we begin to read faster, which in turn increases the likely hood of repetition blindness occurring. </p>
<p>For example, I bet you didn't originally realize I did it in this comment too. </p></div>		</li>
