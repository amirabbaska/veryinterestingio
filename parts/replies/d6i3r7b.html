Being on an opposite schedule than their owners in house cats at least seems like it could be detrimental to other areas too like concentration. I guess just wondering if anyone has any research on feline sleep patterns? Would be interesting to see what effect putting felines on our sleep schedule would be like? Morally questionable, but I could see it effecting their brain structure dramatically, including areas like vision</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway...</p>
<p>&quot;The prevailing modern view of neuroscience, for which there is extensive experimental evidence, is that clinically relevant psychiatric conditions have at their source a primary dysfunction of neuronal systems. Given that disruptive neuronal activity can disrupt both human and animal behaviour animal models can be [and have been] developed...&quot; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC167198/#!po=3.41981" target="_blank">Source</a> </p>
<p>Disorders have animal models for studying, psychiatric disorders may be the most heavily modelled in fact (Geyer MA, Markou A. Animal models of psychiatric disorders. In: Bloom FE, Kupfer DJ, editors. Psychopharmacology: the fourth generation of progress. New York: Raven Press; 1995. p. 787-97. [Ref list]) </p>
<p>Schizophrenia is the only psychiatric disorder that does not have a great animal whole-syndrome model. Rather they would use animal models to study a specific symptom or drug interaction. From what Ive read, this has more to do with the fact that schizophrenia is such a complex and poorly understood disorder with a wide array of symptoms that may or may not affect each individual. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone pursuing their Masters in Psychology with an undergrad focus in both Psych and Biology, I can support your comment.</p>
<p>Our current understanding of mental disorders is one of biological dysfunction. The brain &quot;doesn't work right&quot;, whether that be the increased presence or relative absence of receptor sites for neurochemicals, physiological malformations, or specific trauma.</p>
<p>A couple interesting examples?
Addiction: Drugs cause a massive increase in neurochemicals that signal for pleasure and happiness in the brain (literally make you feel good). Well, the brain wants to maintain a balance, so it starts shutting down receptors - places for those neurochemicals to attach and tell the brain that it's time to feel good. This is why addicts have to chase larger highs, and why sobriety is actually physically painful for them. They literally hurt because their brain doesn't receive compensatory feel-good sensations - it can't, it doesn't have enough places to receive the appropriate dose from natural level of neurochemicals. </p>
<p>Physiological Differences: Studies in rats and later correlated in human autopsies found that individuals that were under stress their whole lives (abusive homes, homelessness, war-torn countries, etc) had literally different brain structures. The structures in the brain responsible for responding in a survival-like, fight/aggression way grew larger than normal/average, while the structure in the brain responsible for emotional processing did not reach average/normal size. Those individuals tended to have a history of increased aggressiveness, though not necessarily violence (in humans, anyway). Stress hormones are a hell of a thing.</p>
<p>Also, you are correct, our understanding of shizophrenia is...well, not. It has components of several disorders, has a couple of really odd interactions between physiology and mental state, and just enough &quot;makes sense&quot; and &quot;...wtf?&quot; to stay outside of our understanding. A neat example? Individuals with auditory hallucinations, for instance, show activation in the regions of the brain responsible for receiving auditory input, translating that, and processing the information into recognized speech. They <em>literally</em> hear something that we can't detect the existence of. The folks who figure out the shizotypal disorder set will win a Nobel, I imagine.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it well understood what the differences are between physically hearing something through the ears, imagining that I've heard something, being prompted into thinking about hearing something (e.g. Reading dialogue in a book that you're engrossed in), and talking to myself in my head as I work out a problem?</p>
<p>I imagine the second one is difficult to test, but the last two should lend themselves pretty easily as research questions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is crazy, though. I have strong feelings about the ethics of such experiments, even though I understand the importance of them for advances in Medicine. These are all such terrible diseases and the fact that we can study them in other animals mean that we get to recreate all this emotional pain even if they are &quot;just rats&quot;: they will feel it just strongly in their own ways.</p>
<p>Things get even harder when we see some neuro/psychological tests in primates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is sort of a mixture of two paradigms in neurobiological psychiatry research; there is a test (more of an antidepressant screening tool than a &quot;depression test&quot;) that involves briefly putting rats/mice in a container of water and observing both the latency to and duration of immobility (when they &quot;give up&quot; on swimming/escaping, and float). There is less immobility with antidepressant treatment, which is why the primary purpose of the test is to screen putative antidepressants. The &quot;constant environmental stress&quot; part is likely referring to one or more of the paradigms we use to model or induce depressive-like behavior, such as the chronic unpredictable mild stress model, in which the mouse/rat is subjected randomly to environmental stressors for several weeks, and afterward some of their behaviors appear to be similar to some symptoms of depression seen in humans (for example, decreased preference for sucrose mimicking anhedonia in human depressed patients).</p>

<p>I'd argue that all psychiatric disorders are complex and (relatively) poorly understood, with a wide array of symptoms that may or may not affect each individual, but more definitively I'd suggest that no psychiatric disorder has a great animal whole-syndrome model, partially for reasons I outlined <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4xrxyn/is_the_prevalence_of_mental_disorders_in_humans/d6ieuqa" target="_blank">here</a>. The chronic unpredictable mild stress model for depression probably comes closest, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This post commits an extremely common error when discussing psychiatrically related dysfunction in animals; conflating &quot;disorders&quot; with modelling endophenotypes.</p>
<p>We have not observed &quot;anxiety disorders&quot; or other psychiatric diseases occurring in animals*, induced or otherwise, because disorders have very specific definitions and criteria, many of which could not be met by mice in a chronic mild stress model, for example.</p>
<p>As someone that works with both human depression and animal models of depression, I would suggest that what we CAN observe is the induction of very specific behaviors which we believe might MODEL certain symptoms of depression. For example, altered social behavior, &quot;learned helplessness/behavioral despair&quot;, anhedonia, etc.</p>
<p>However, these behaviors often lack face validity; decreased preference for sugar doesn't actually bear much resemblance to depressed humans losing pleasure in previously enjoyed activities, and increased immobility in a forced swimming test doesn't really (at least to modern neuropsychiatry researchers) mimic helplessness or hopelessness in depressed humans. Where these behaviors ARE accepted as valid, however, is in their predictive validity; these tend to be reversed by antidepressant treatment, and that's almost entirely the reason they're studied.</p>
<p>Basically, we cannot say that animals experience &quot;mental disorders&quot;*, for specific classification reasons. This isn't a pedantic distinction; the criteria for mental disorders being so specific is ridiculously important, and has reflected the changing attitudes of modern psychiatry. We can induce some behaviors which kind of look like some of the symptoms of depression/anxiety/whatever, but they're just individual endophenotypes insufficient for a diagnosis, and they only bear a minimal &quot;face validity&quot; relationship  to human psychiatric symptoms.</p>
<p>*One possible exception would be non-human primates: there's been some really interesting work here, including a really fascinating paper by Tarique Perera, it's open access here: <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017600" target="_blank">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0017600</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Nevertheless, without anthropomorphizing non-humans, how would one define animal mental disorders?</p></div>		</li>
