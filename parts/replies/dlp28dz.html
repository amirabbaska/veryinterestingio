			<div class="markdown"><p>In my country (argentina) 99% of the houses have bidets. I believe about half the population uses them (and defend their usefulness to the death) and the other half doesn't use them.</p>
<p>From what I've heard, all it takes to convince someone to start using the bidet is asking the person to wipe normally, and then use a moist baby towel to see just how clean you where with just the paper.</p>
<p>Apparently, the amount of poop that remains smeared on the skin is rather large.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess it'll be &quot;relatively large&quot;, not &quot;rather&quot; large. I'm getting into semantics a bit, but what I mean is &quot;relative&quot; to someone who uses just wipes or just a bidet. But considering the amount of bacteria on your face and hands <em>all day long</em>, the small amount of faecal matter contained safely between your buttocks is not my biggest concern.</p>
<p>#</p>
<p>I seem to recall Mythbusters doing a test with toothbrushes. They ended up with faecal matter on a 'control' set of toothbrushes they kept under glass in a different room. So we're probably fooling ourselves if we think bidets are making a massive difference.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, sorry, english is not my main language.</p>
<p>The point is that the amount left over after a normal wipe is enough to surprise some people into using the bidet from then on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American here and I wish bidets were the norm. I wipe until nothing then wipe with a baby wipe thrown into a lidded bin. I definitely recommend this method to other bidetless people. Also, despite not having much of anything on them, freq throw out bin contents just in case.  </p></div>		</li>
