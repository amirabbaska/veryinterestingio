			<div class="markdown"><p>Be careful. &quot;Weight increases twice as quickly as strength&quot; isn't quite right. If you enlarge something with a linear scale factor of 3, then its volume increases by a factor of 27 while its cross-sectional area increases by a factor of 9. Notice 27/9 = 3, and not 2. So &quot;Weight increases three times more quickly than strength&quot; in this case. </p></div>		</li>
