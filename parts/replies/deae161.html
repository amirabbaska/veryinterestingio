<p>Federally backed student loans are an explicit exception to discharge within the Bankruptcy Code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think that really answers the OP's question. The exemption from bankruptcy was just a byproduct of the fact that the government decided that it wanted to make funding available for college. They had to modify the bankruptcy rules because it would be way to easy for students to take advantage of the standard bankruptcy law. &quot;Just finished my degree, I have 120k in debt, no assets, and no income. I guess I'm bankrupt. Clear all that debt off my record and I'll put off getting a mortgage or a car loan for 7 years.&quot;</p>
<p>If they decided that it was in the public interest to give six figure business loans to kids fresh out of high school with no collateral, no assets, and no established credit, they could easily just change the law to make those loans exempt from being discharged in bankruptcy too.</p>
<p>The real answer is that they think that on a large scale, it is more beneficial and practical to invest in helping people get an education. Starting a business could be great for some people, and terrible for others, and it is really hard to tell which category people will fall into. Going to an accredited school is a more known quantity. They can reasonably process millions of applications per year and they have a good idea of what they are getting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your premise, and maybe I look at the issue to closely to provide OP with a more general, policy based answer. I do think, perhaps rather cynically, that the driving factor behind why the Feds hand out student loans like candy is because of their non-dischargeable status, but I could have blinders on from working in the field. I would like to believe in what you're saying that there is a social investment that we realize more than tangible return on through federal student loans as compared to businesses which may benefit a few, but not necessarily anyone really, but my faith is not what it once was in society. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But remember, the government is also the one who decided that they are non-dischargable. It wasn't that student loans just randomly became non-discharable on their own and the government responded. </p>
<p>There is a clear order to how this all came about. The government decided they wanted to provide loans for education and then changed the bankruptcy laws to accommodate. </p>
<p>Everything the government does has to have some degree of &quot;social investment&quot;. There is no reason for them to get into the business loan game without some sort of greater social purpose either. </p>
<p>But my points are not purely about altruism. It is mostly just about practicality. A college education is a known quantity and they have a pretty good idea of how you will be able to pay back that loan over time.</p>
<p>They could make business loans non discharable too, but if you give an 18 year old a 100k business loan and his company goes under, regardless of what the bankruptcy laws are, if the kid is 19 years old with no education, his ability to pay back that loan probably isn't very great. You can't get blood from a stone. </p></div>		</li>
