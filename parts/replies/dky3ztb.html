			<div class="markdown"><p>That association is at least grounded in the text. The Book of Revelation refers to Satan as a dragon and &quot;the ancient serpent,&quot; which serves as the ground for that connection. Lucifer as Satan is just a straight up refusal to acknowledge what the text says.
Isaiah: &quot;This is a prophecy about a Babylonian king.&quot;
Bozos through history: &quot;This obviously has nothing to do with Babylon and everything to do with highly speculative demonology.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, though that is a bit of a retcon. It's ancient people doing what modern people are doing with the Babylon reference. </p>
<p>Genesis 3 is pretty clear that the serpent is some mortal creature. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>14 So the Lord God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this,</p>
<p>“Cursed are you above all livestock<br />
and all wild animals!<br />
You will crawl on your belly<br />
and you will eat dust<br />
all the days of your life.<br />
15 And I will put enmity<br />
between you and the woman,<br />
and between your offspring and hers;<br />
he will crush your head,<br />
and you will strike his heel.”  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it shows that by the time of Revelations' writing plenty of people had forgotten or never learned that the Adversary/Hinderer was an angel or angels on task by God.  </p>
<p>It's frustrating as an atheist to sit and read the stuff and be unable to have a conversation with a believer because if they did read the book, the version they read is so convoluted from the original that it's lost some or most of it's meaning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Revelations came way later so if you're looking at it as someone that doesn't view that as the word of a god then it's a retcon. Genesis doesn't imply anything like that about the serpent.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's important to bear in mind because there are so many misconceptions about Satan</p>

<p>Is there somewhere I can see a list about popular misconceptions about Satan? I've read one or two but I'm quite interested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The figure in Job is a specific being, and far more a prosecutor than a tempter; of course, names can easily be reapplied to others as metaphors. (Heck, if I'd been able tow rite my s screenplay, I would have had the older detective say their perp &quot;thinks he's Satan, but he isn't.&quot;)</p></div>		</li>
