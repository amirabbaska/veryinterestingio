			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you've hit the nail on the head. I feel exactly the same way about my dogs. I love them and can't imagine life without them, and yet I feel guilty because no matter how much I do for them, their lives are still pretty constrained and unnatural. My approach is to try to think about the day from their perspective and to give them as much freedom as I can to just be dogs. So, I take them to off-leash areas as much as I can; I let them eat goose poop, even though I think it is pretty gross; when we walk on leash, I try to let them lead and set the pace; etc. Cats are harder for me to reconcile.... I do have a cat, but once she passes away I will not get another. I think cats need freedom to roam outside, but I also recognize that they kill wildlife and are exposed to some danger, so it also seems bad to let them out. Although I have kept many other kinds of pets (when my daughter was young), I wouldn't do so now, after researching my book Run, Spot, Run. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats my attitude with my cats. They live their whole lives with me in a rather small house, so if my cat wants to go in and out of the house all day, whom am I to stop her? I would hate to be cooped up all day. </p></div>		</li>
