			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, for deep sky objects such as nebulae or galaxies a long exposure is taken and multiple exposures are stacked.  An equatorial mount will compensate for the rotation of the earth and may be sufficient for an exposure of 5-7 seconds. But in order to get longer exposures you need a second scope as well as a second camera if the main camera is DSLR and not a CCD which would track and image. The second camera uses the second scope to track a star in the fov and send micro adjustments to the motor of the mount to keep the star locked in place. Most images taken by astrophotographers are around 5 minute exposures but stacked until 2-30 hours of total exposure is achieved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see any response that actually said why not, so here are a couple reasons:</p>
<p>1) Detectors have saturation limits. You can think of pixels as buckets collecting light (really, they collect electrons), and these can fill up, and even spill over into other buckets. The brightest stars can saturate detectors in minutes.</p>
<p>2) There are high-energy particles moving around in space, called 'cosmic rays'. When these hit the detector, they cause electrons to move into the buckets, causing bright spots. Since where they hit on the detector is random, they'll be in different places on different exposures (unlike starlight), so you can stack multiple exposures to get rid of these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you don't need to apply any such corrections The data was taken roughly at the same time and the motion of the solar system will make no difference on those scales. The telescope however didn't take each exposure pointing in exactly the same point on the sky however, some sub-exposures were rotated others were offset. The rolls are necessary as HST has to roll such that the solar panels are illuminated. The offsets improve the data quality.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What?  SLR is a shutter type (single-lense reflex), and CCD is an image sensor type (Charge-Coupled Device).  A DSLR camera can have either a CCD or MOS (Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he is trying to say is that the cameras used for tracking is basically &quot;webcams&quot; with CCD sensors. Those can also be used to capture the images, but if you're using a DSLR for capturing, you also need a CCD-&quot;webcam&quot; for tracking.</p>
<p>Edit: BTW, SLR isn't a shutter type, an SLR can have either a barn door shutter or a central shutter. I'd say that SLR is a type of camera body. </p>
<p>Edit again: when I wrote barn door shutter above, I really was thinking of curtain shutters. Barn door shutters are usually used in conjunction with central shutters. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty remarkable that stars are throwing out so many photons that we can see them at all at this distance. They're not sending a targeted laser blast a few square arcseconds wide directly at us, they're radiating light in all directions, and they're <em>still</em> bright enough to see!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Space isn't a perfect vacuum and there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_(astronomy\)" target="_blank">interstellar extinction</a> from dust and gas that the light passes through and sometimes gets absorbed or scattered by.  Extinction is far less important though than the simple <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/isql.html" target="_blank">inverse square law</a> which makes brightness drop off as the photons spread out, and which is why a light bulb 2 metres away from your eye looks a quarter as bright as a lightbulb 1 metre away from your eye.</p></div>		</li>
