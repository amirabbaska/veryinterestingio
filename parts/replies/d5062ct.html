			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't done the math on it, but if so, it would be slight.  They don't get close enough to each other to directly influence each other (for reference, the two moons of Saturn are very small - less than 100 km radius each, compared to our moon's ~1800 km radius; yet the closest they get to each other is about one and a half times the distance between the Earth and the moon - ~600,000 km vs. ~390,000 km.  The moon has <strong>FAR</strong> more influence on Earth than these two satellites of Saturn have on each other.</p></div>		</li>
