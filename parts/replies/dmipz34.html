			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's a neat idea.</p>
<p>Here (in the USA) the only reason I would see to use a paid ATM is if I were traveling and didn't have a national bank.</p>
<p>Many people here prefer to use their local bank that only has 2 locations, than something that has locations everywhere.</p>
<p>Feels safer to some.</p>
<p>So for all the banks to get in on this together, it would be millions of banks, I imagine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They tried to do it here in the 90s.  I forget exactly but one bank started charging and they literally lost like 20% of their customers within a few months or so and reverted it.  No bank has tried to do it since.</p></div>		</li>
