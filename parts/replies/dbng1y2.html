			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said is correct, but here are two interesting things to note as well: </p>
<p>First, captchas aren't there to make it <em>impossible</em> to overcome - that is not possible to do. It's to make it <em>difficult</em> for a bot, i.e. to either make it impossible for it to do at all by itself or only very slowly. This is to make it impossible for a bot to e.g. try a password 1000 times per second, or to let it log in automatically without the help of a human.</p>
<p>Secondly - one must also know that the images used in Google captchas - where you e.g. have to push every image that has a street sign on it - are made completely automatically as well. We have algorithms that can detect practically everything on images. But while Google has massive serverfarms, the average hacker doesn't have similar resources, especially not if it's only about a stupid thing like hacking into a random board or something (to risky to expose such resources for to little gain).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, a lot of those google captchas aren't fully automatically generated, they're shown to users that pick, and when enough people pick the same things, then it becomes a right answer that gets used in the future. Google actually trains their neural network projects off those results (at least in some cases).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd go as far as to claim this is even the main purpose of the whole system. Before the current checkbox solution, it was used to digitalise books. </p>
<p>Back then (as most likely remember), you were tasked to write two different random words. However, only one of the words were validated, since Google actually didn't know the answer to the other one.</p>
<p>They are probably still doing something similar with the current system.</p></div>		</li>

A Selenium bot that utilises an image-detection algorithm (that say uses google), could get around these things.</p></div>		</li>

<p>1.50$ per 1000 solved captchas is cheap enough for most applications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yep, I've done it a few times. basically, the best way to do it is to load up an incognito session of Chrome, navigate <em>directly</em> to a login page or something that has reCAPTCHA, and make only one very fast mouse movement to click in the center of the reCAPTCHA box.  or, instead of using the mouse to hit the box, hit tab a bunch of times to focus on it and then hit space or something to trigger it. They really dislike that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough that wouldn't work. It would record that the mouse travelled the entire way to the box, as opposed to instantly moving from 0 to 100 skipping 1-99. Google would just think you're 1337 not a bot</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting but also confusing, because I used recaptcha on a Tablet PC running a normal Windows 10. When using the mouse this makes total sense, but I can also use the touchscreen, and then I don't have mouse movement but &quot;snap&quot; to the checkbox. Any idea why that still works? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sure - when you access a site via a tablet, it says so in the user-agent string, which is just a string of info that each browser sends to each page it requests so that you can tell what resolution the screen is, if the person is on mobile/desktop, etc.  This information is typically used to make sure that the right version of the site is delivered to people on mobile vs people on web.</p>
<p>so, when you go to a page with reCAPTCHA on a tablet (let's just say an ipad), the user agent looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mozilla/5.0 (iPad; U; CPU OS 4_3 like Mac OS X; da-dk) AppleWebKit/533.17.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/5.0.2 Mobile/8F190 Safari/6533.18.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>note the <em>iPad</em> part of that.  When reCAPTCHA browsers see that string, they pull different kinds of info and execute different kinds of tests.  Also, note that when you press the checkbox with your finger, you probably don't hit the <em>exact</em> proper coordinate of the center of the checkbox (like a bot might) - there's some error.  Even if you code a bot to factor in some error, reCAPTCHA is machine learning - essentially, a fancy way of saying that if 10k people beat it using the exact same method, the algo is going to learn that people using that method are actually probably robots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't a great answer to the original question.  The original question was about Windows 10 PC's, which come in all shapes and sizes, including a tablet form factor.  For instance, I'm using a Dell XPS 15 Laptop, and it also has a touchscreen. My uiser Agent while using Chrome is:</p>
<pre><code>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/55.0.2883.87 Safari/537.36    </code></pre>
<p>So the only information that is has is the fact that i'm running 64 bit Windows 10.</p>
<p>The real answer is a combination of the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Touch events are handled differently from mouse events</li>
<li><em>how</em> the button was clicked is just one of many things the reCaptcha is looking for (Local browser history, timing, IP address reputation).</li>
<li>There are still such thing as &quot;suspicious&quot; touch events.  Did every touch event on the page happen <em>exactly</em> in the center of every centrol?  Was the time difference between &quot;Touch Start&quot; and &quot;Touch End&quot; <em>exactly</em> the same every time?</li>
</ol></div>		</li>
