<p>Needless to say, my napkin mathematics completely agrees with your assessment. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a great way of describing how small the apparent viewing angle is, thanks for that!  I think the disconnect for me has always been that despite this, you can still see a star with the naked eye.  I guess the obvious take away is that they're really bright... So if we could maintain the temperature of a speck of dust at the temperature of a star, would it be visable at 4 miles distance?</p></div>		</li>
