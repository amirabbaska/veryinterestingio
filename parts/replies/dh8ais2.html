<p>I actually was talking to my Grama about an hour ago and I had asked her since we last spoke if she had drank any, and thankfully she had not. </p>
<p>I think it was just more of a just-in-case situation as to why she was thinking about drinking it. I know she has acid reflux and esophagus problems but she manages it. </p></div>		</li>
