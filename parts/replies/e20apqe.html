So you'd need to eat about 14 and a half Big Macs to get the same amount of sodium as 1 litre of sea water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it has less to do with the recommended intake and more so that the high salt concentration disturbs the osmolarity of our gut.  As a result you'll feel sicker; either vomiting because your body senses something is wrong or come down with diarrhea accompanied by dehydration because the high osmolarity in your gut lumen pulls water out of your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tip: if you have trouble with big words, just think of them as blanks, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it has less to do with the recommended intake and more so that the high salt concentration disturbs the ______ gut.  As a result you'll feel sicker; either vomiting because your body senses something is wrong or come down with diarrhea accompanied by dehydration because the high _______ in your gut ____ pulls water out of your body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now read the text and let your mind fill in the blanks. More often than not you'll get what those big words mean just from the context!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, the main problem is at the kidneys. I don't remember the exact numbers off hand, but the maximum concentration the kidneys can generate is still more dilute than salt water. So no matter how much excess salt they try to eliminate, you end up losing more water than salt. </p>
<p>Some animals (notably cats) have longer loops of henle and can actually hydrate themselves with salt water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. For every gram of salt they try to get out of you, they have to use some amount of water, and sea water is higher concentrated. So if you drink 1 l sea water, the kidneys had to use 1.5 (example number) liters of water to expel the salt</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think his point was to say the recommended intake directly affected what we can eat but just as a benchmark to demonstrate how absurdly salty salt water is.  It’s so salty that 5g of of sodium, which is a large intake for an entire day even for someone who likes salty food, would be contained in about 1 coke can worth of salt water. That demonstrates both your point and why we’ve developed a taste system that finds that amount of salinity revoltingly salty. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That means since there are about 14 grams of sodium in one liter, then one 8 ounce glass of seawater has 3.5 grams of sodium.</p>
<p>That is 3500 mg of sodium which is equal to the amount of sodium in one Noodles and Co. Spicy Korean Beef Noodles (3220 mg sodium) regular sized bowl:</p>

<p>Our fast foods have way too much sodium. Salt is not just sodium but still that's a pretty interesting comparison. </p></div>		</li>
