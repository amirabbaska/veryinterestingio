			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a loan servicing company who is the lienholder for several million mortgages. </p>
<p>I can see any person on record's SSN phone number, address, current employer on record (which is usually kept up to date), monthly income, etc.</p>
<p>It wasn't a hard job to get, and it would be easy to get past the company's data monitoring ability if so desired. It's pretty lax. </p>
<p>There's a reason SSNs shouldn't be identifying numbers. I don't have their birth certificates or license usually, but still. It's enough info.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm trying to decide if I should pay for a background check. Please offer your opinion.</p>
<p>My good friend found many many many sexual texts to and from her husband. Of course it devastated her. But her skank husband has now convinced her that his behavior was caused by a medical condition. He joined 3 swingers clubs and ran a sex den out of their rental income property. She has been paying into their joint bank account for 11 years but is not on the home title. This list goes on..</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the &quot;ladies&quot; he was setting told my friend that he has been married 5 times. She refuses to believe it, but I want to investigate it on her behalf. I have only his name, age, address, son and daughters name (and wife. Of course).</p>
<p>Can I find out how many times Mr.Skank has been married? </p>
<p>Thank you for any insight.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've come across this a ton, mostly the former. I even had one case where a customer's name was shortened on his State-ID, so it only pulled info for that name and LexisNexis couldn't auto-generate any good questions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother and I have the same name, so it's possible that that is part of the multi-layer problem, but I have no evidence of that yet. I do get a mortgage question alot, and that may be a question for her and not me. The questions that I KNOW I've failed have often had to do with my license plate number (usually when that car is at work with my spouse and I have no access to the info), whether I opened this or that credit card account in 2007 or 2008 (I can never remember this stuff), and where my ss card was issued (figured that one out after guessing a bunch... both my parents are dead so I couldnt ask them and we moved a lot). There must be more that I miss and don't know that I'm missing, because I get locked out almost universally and have to go through hours of bullshit to resolve each one. Sometimes, the customer service line will resort to the questions too, and then I fail those as well, causing them to hang up on me when they decide I&quot;m not who I say I am. </p>
<p>I'm just resigned to getting fucked by data aggregation and Foucauldian population management techniques. It breaks my soul, actually. </p>
<p>Edit to say that I feel very angry about this all actually.</p></div>		</li>
