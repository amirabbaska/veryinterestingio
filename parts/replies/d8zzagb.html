			<p>Glass Mountain has great obsidian, and it's huge! 100 cubic km! Also, most of the intracaldera rhyolites (within Long Valley) are nice quality too. The Inyo chain obsidians aren't as nice (all within the context of knapping / making obsidian tools)</p>		</li>

			<p>I climbed up onto Obsidian Dome just west of that. It was steep and treacherous and the lava rock/obsidian boulders were super loose. If one is not careful, it's proabaly pretty easy to accidentally topple one onto yourself. Probably not the smartest thing I've ever done...</p>		</li>

			<p>Be careful where you take from! Some of that obsidian is protected.</p>		</li>
