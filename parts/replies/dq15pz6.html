			<div class="markdown"><p>The wiki page indicates it's related to the Arctic Ringed Seal, and those guys have an enormous distribution that covers the top bit of all of the continents. So it might seem more likely that they'd come from the north to the south...</p>
<p>...except historical climate change could have factored into that seal's distribution as well.</p>
<p>So without pinpointing when they arrived through fossils or other means, it's kind of hard to tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article the guy above your comment posted has this bit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All in all, the Arctic origins hypothesis better fits the data and is the favoured hypothesis of recent authors (Deméré et al. 2003, Palo &amp; Väinölä 2006). However, this isn’t the end of the debate. The degree of genetic divergence found amongst living phocines suggests – based on molecular clock inferences (which are always controversial and problematic) – that Baikal seals and other phocines diverged around 4 million years ago, during the late Pliocene</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not have time to read right now (my AHDH kicked in after enormous amount of caffeine I already consumed this morning) but you... feel free to read on.</p>
<p>EDIT. Fine, I will read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In other words, if the genetic data is accurate, then the evolution of Baikal seals pre-dates the key event that is supposed to explain their distribution: the development of immense Siberian lakes connected both to the Arctic Ocean and to Lake Baikal</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For now the most interesting question seems to be not &quot;why phosines (love this new word, sounds like a cool new trigonometric function) are in Baikal, but, rather, why they are not in other big, or even Great, lakes&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A river doesn't necessarily allow animals to convey themselves upstream.</p>
<p>If there are cataracts, rapids, or even strong currents, seals would not be able to easily traverse them. Flowing water has tremendous power, particularly when shallow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt one seal migrated the length of a river, could it not have happened over generations? </p>
<p>If they have been there for centuries then they could migrated over generations following food sources. The whole Angara river could have been home for colonies that died off due to environmental changes or when migrating humans saw them as a food source,  leaving only the large group in Bikal.</p>
<p>Think of the discoveies that are being made in the Brazilian jungle of a large primative culture that died off suddenly when the first conquistadors arrived. We use to believe that no large populations ever existed in the Amazon, but the proof is showing that the amazon was not much of a jungle a thousand years ago and that some peoples lived and cultivated the land, building large mound works.</p>
