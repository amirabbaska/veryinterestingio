			<div class="markdown"><p>Maillard reactions do contribute to some browning, but only at high temperatures (I believe above 150 C). I think OP is asking why raw meat (red) turns brown when cooked, which occurs independently of Maillard browning. This is why boiled beef still turns brown even though temperatures are well below those necessary for Maillard browning. </p>
<p>Meat color is a function of the oxidative state of myoglobin in the tissue. Briefly, myoglobin is bound to oxygen and appears red, but when cooked it loses an electron and appears brown. &quot;Red meats&quot; like beef and lamb (also, interestingly, tuna) contain a lot of myoglobin whereas chicken and turkey contain much less (hence not being red when raw).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Completely different set of reactions! The pigment that gives pink color is always there in crustaceans, but is bound to proteins that block the color. When cooked, the proteins denature and the pigment (a type of carotenoid) is no longer bound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently it is because the cooking process destroys the pigments in the flesh except for the pink/red ones </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The Maillard reaction is a caramelization reaction on the sugars in the meat. As the sugars caramelize this helps to tenderize the meat by leaving space for the heat to penetrate deeper in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Caramelization and maillard browning are different. Caramelization is solely for sugars (like caramelizing sweetened condensed milk) and maillard browning includes sugars and proteins breaking down and forming new compounds, such as in toast. It's usually a misnomer to say that you're caramelizing meat.</p>
<p>At least that is what I learned in my food science course, my teacher was adamant about the distinction. </p></div>		</li>
