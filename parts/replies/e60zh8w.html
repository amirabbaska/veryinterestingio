			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible for a limit to exist in a function as a direct replacement - frequently that will make a limit easy to find. And actually, there are some instances (usually a step function) in which the limit will equal one thing but the actual value in the function equals something else.</p>
<p>For instance, in the function f(x) = x, if you were to take the limit of the function as x approaches 2, the answer would be 2, which is the same value as f(2).</p>
<p>But let's say you have a function that indicates that if x=2, f(x) = 3, otherwise f(x) = x. If you were to take the limit of f(x) as x approaches 2, the answer will still be 2 (as x get closer and closer to 2, f(x) is still getting closer and closer to 2), but the actual value of f(2) is 3.</p>
<p>This becomes very useful in determining things like where actual values aren't possible, for instance if f(x) results in you having to divide by zero. And that's kind of where the entire basis of calculus comes from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah back in school this problem was approached by describing a frog on a football field who could hop half the remaining distance down the field.  In that case he will never reach the end of the field, but obviously human speed doesn't halve every time we get half way to our destination and obviously in practice we can reach our destinations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, the truth is that it's a false narrative placed on a problem.</p>
<p>There's absolutely nothing restricting us to moving only half the distance to our destination. Achilles could easily catch the turtle. </p>
<p>Also, due to our size and the infinitely shrinking values, there's a point where you're literally measuring the size of an electron, and then half that. And then half that. And then half that. As a human, moving that amount - and only that amount - is impossible.</p>
<p>Though, most of what we know of Zeno is through Aristotle. So I wonder if it's a case of intentional misrepresentation.</p></div>		</li>
