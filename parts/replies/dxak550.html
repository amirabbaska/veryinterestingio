			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, hardware manufacturers often patch their drivers to fix certain crashes in games. Hardware is so variable nowadays that an average game dev just can't support it all. So then the baton is passed to the hardware manufacturer to hotfix it in the driver.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an old PC that I still use for gaming with a gtx 560. It started struggling on GTA 5 at medium graphics, but with the 'optimized' driver I get a solid 40 FPS, up to around 55 in some scenes. So it's more than playable and I'm amazed that nvidia encourage us to keep using older hardware like that rather than forcing an upgrade. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah you’ll notice this when there’s releases of new big games. Like far cry 5 came out last week along with a driver update for NVidia</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also ensures that new hardware manufacturers have a hard time. Good luck developing your drivers, so that you fix all the bugs for all major games released in the last 10 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Case in point: FFXV had some issues when it first released on PC with some AMD cards. New video card drivers were then released in the coming days/weeks that fixed a lot of the issues. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very important to note that &quot;games&quot; aren't built as one continuous stretch but many, many small pieces and then assembled around the last part of development.  You can divide them into mechanics (code), graphics, and story, then subdivide them from there with some parts sharing aspects of others.</p>
<p>If you were to build a table, you don't assemble the pieces of wood first then cut them to size; you draw up a design of what dimensions each part should be, then you cut them to size, and finally in the last step you fit it all together.  </p>
<p>You don't need to be able to run the entire game until it approaches launch; to test hairworks all you have to do is be able to run a simulation of it, not even at max FPS.  In fact, most graphics models start off with insane levels of detail, where the original model might define polygons in nanometers, whereas when they get into the actual game the polygon count is adjusted comparative to how important it is in the game world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of this, the final product isn't made from the start. That beautiful hair physics took a programmer, an artist, and a tech artist hundreds of iterations over several months or years. Sometimes what you try doesn't work because it's ugly, sometimes it doesn't work because it's a beautiful slideshow. In both cases you learn things that you can draw on closer to release to touch it up to now-modern technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.  I would argue this is the bigger point, because something like hairworks would have been designed by itself.  They would have had an instance of just a head with some hair on it.  No backgrounds at all.  </p>
<p>It's weird how people think it's this self-contained unit too, since nothing else is in life.  You don't assemble pieces of wood together then shape them, you design, shape and finally piece them together last.  It's not like you're carving a table from one continuous piece of wood.  Cars aren't 3D printed out, each part is fabricated then assembled.  A car overall can be complicated to understand but each individual section can be explained with ease.  </p></div>		</li>
