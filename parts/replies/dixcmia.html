			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably it is the whole part. There's a Creationist argument that feathers couldn't evolve, because they're useless until flight is achieved. </p>
<p>That argument ignores the fact that, until about 2000 A.D., the very finest insulation material available on planet Earth was baby bird down feathers.</p>
<p>Feathers almost certainly evolved to conserve heat, not to enable flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that while the feather is growing, it has a blood supply. If your pet bird breaks a feather which is still vascular, it's time to get out the needle-nosed pliers and yank the broken feather so the bird doesn't lose too much blood.</p>
<p>After the blood supply dries up, feathers are easier to detach. Which is why a cat trying to catch a bird often ends up with a paw full of feathers.</p></div>		</li>
