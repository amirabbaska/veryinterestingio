			<div class="markdown"><p>There's various books and stuff on the subject. A great place to start is 'What Every Body is Saying' by Joe Navarro. Highly recommend; it will change the way you see the world and interact with people, and if you're like me, make you aware of your more standoffish body language and tendencies </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recommend the 'definitive book of body language' -by Pease,  or 'intimate behavior' or 'people watching' - by Desmond Morris. </p>
<p>Amazing stuff. Full of interesting things that you never notice. like why do mothers rock their babies? because it simulates the motion in the womb while the mother was walking around while pregnant. I was most amazed about how literally some sayings are. Like 'pain in the neck' if you ask someone a favor they don't want to do it, often they will rub the back of their neck...like they have a <em>pain in their neck</em>. lol that Pease book is excellent. </p>
<p>be forewarned though, somethings you can't 'unsee'.  gnome sayin'? Reading body language has it's advantages and disadvantages. </p></div>		</li>
