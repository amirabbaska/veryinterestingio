			<div class="markdown"><p>But the example you gave is area specific. Other coral reefs around the world are still affected by ocean acidification.</p>
<p>&quot;While the findings are compelling, they don't necessarily spark hope for other corals around the world that appear to be suffering fromÂ human-induced ocean acidification.&quot; From your article </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's terrifying that this is the only comment that mentions ocean acidification. It's astounding how ignorant most people are of even the basic facts of climate science.</p>
<p>The real ELI5 should be:</p>
<ul>
<li>burning lots of fuel releases carbon in the air</li>
<li>carbon in the air ends up in the ocean</li>
<li>carbon in the ocean makes the ocean acidic like soda</li>
<li>acidic water makes it hard for coral to grow skeletons</li>
<li>just like soda hurts your teeth, acidic oceans hurt coral</li>
