			<div class="markdown"><p>A person gets a jobs saves for a house, spends decades paying it off, saves for retirement, stops working and then lives off their savings. So, ideally, the older you get the more money you have on hand. If you retire at 60 and hope to live to 80 then on the day you retire you have 20 years worth of money to replace your income.</p>
<p>Very few businesses have more than 6 months worth of revenue available. Even big ones. This surprises a lot of people but if Wal-Mart stopped selling stuff tomorrow and had zero revenue they have about a weeks worth of revenue of cash in the bank. That's right. Wal-Mart has half a paycheck in cash savings. If they sold all their stores, warehouses, every truck etc they have less than 6 months worth of revenue. Why? Because they have better uses for the money.</p>
<p>When a business makes money (after expenses i.e. profit) they spend it on things like: </p>
<ul>
<li>investing back in the business to make more money next year.</li>
<li>paying down debt</li>
<li>giving money back to the people who own the company (shareholders) via share buyback or dividend</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, unlike a person, companies don't retire so they don't really save up big nest eggs. They hope to live forever.</p>
<p>They do buy houses though, i.e. massive purchases they can't afford to pay upfront so they borrow money. For example if Wal-Mart wanted to build 4 new warehouses this year they wouldn't have the money in cash so they'd have to borrow it. </p>
<p>They don't go to Bank of America like you or I. They have complex lending needs to they need complex banks. That's where something like a Wall Street bank comes in. They do banking that isn't familiar to average people so it's hard to relate to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more to that first sentence as well: </p>
<p><em>A person gets a jobs saves for a house, spends decades paying it off, saves for retirement, stops working and then lives off their savings.</em></p>
<p>Wall Street is a massive employer so they give people jobs, they are banks so they lend people money to buy houses, they are insurance companies so they insure houses and cars, they are the pension funds that allow people to save for retirement and invest it on their behalf, and they are the term deposit and savings accounts that allow people to spend what they earn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;It's complicated&quot; isn't really an explanation. Can you elaborate why they can't borrow from a typical bank like for most loans? What are their needs exactly for this to not be possible? Are they in a better position because of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Businesses sometimes rely on investment firms for capital when they need to grow.  In order to keep paying employees and stay afloat, it usually comes down to either pulling out an expensive business loan or selling part of the company to a firm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are necessary so you can have roads and bridges (municipal bonds). Companies that offer you all of that shit you dont need but you want anyway at cheap prices (stocks and corporate bonds). Houses you cant afford but want anyway (banks, mortgages). Etc. Etc. Wall street is a place where people come for money to either build things people need (roads bridges etc) or for companies. And the other side is investors (people who are willing to put in their capital for a return). Literally everything you have is made possible by wall street. The reason why we can live so comfortably and have all of the things we have but dont deserve is because of wall street. </p></div>		</li>
