			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably something like this...Son, Penises get hard when the body releases a special molecule into the bloodstream called a vasodilator. These special molecules travel to the penis and cause it to get hard. To do this, they let blood to move from the bloodstream into the tissue of the penis. Filling it up the penis like a water balloon. Now to keep the penis hard, the body prevents too much blood from leaving the penis by blocking its drains. After orgasm, the body opens the drains and the blood escapes back into the bloodstream and the penis deflates. However, the part of the penis (the tissue) that was filled up by the blood is all stretched out. So when blood starts to flow back in, it already has had a warm up! Also, some of the special molecules (the vasodilators) are still around after an hour and help open up passages between the bloodstream and penis even more. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She’d probably disagree with the idea. But I think sexual education, even for children, is really important so they can start to understand their bodies, boundaries, and learn to be comfortable in them.
I remember teaching sexual education during a public health rotation and my instructor was there grading me. One of the boys in the class asked how to deal with unwanted/unexpected boners so in front of my female instructor I shared all my strategies for dealing with unwanted boners along with some funny personal stories to normalize the experience for the class.
I didn’t receive much feedback on that lecture apart from ‘great job XD’.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's more of a misconception than anything. Viagra isn't going to cause you to get hard staring at a wall (unless that's your thing), it just makes it easier to obtain/maintain an erection while aroused. I've taken Viagra and Cialis before (I don't have ED) without issue. Obviously everyone has different and there of course have been a few news stories about it, but those are extreme outliers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is because Viagra stops the breakdown of a chemical that is there only when you get aroused.  I believe it’s cGMP. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apart from maximizing your health (exercise and hydration), not that I’m aware of. Viagra shouldn’t make you hard for more than a few hours. And you can always start with a really small dose and then find a good balance. I’d talk to your Doctor if you think you’d benefit from viagra. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viagra doesn't give you a giant cock.  It give you a cock that's hard enough to fuck with and keeps it that way, whether you want it to be or not.  If you can manage to get off, you still will be hard until it wears off, which can be unpleasant.</p>
<p>Also, it's pretty rare for a woman to want to get fucked for the hours of hard-on Viagra gives a guy.  Stuff starts to get raw and unpleasant and boring unless you're on some good drugs (which means the &quot;raw and unpleasant&quot; stuff becomes reality the next morning).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is an important point. Porn definitely gives young men an extremely skewed view of what having sex is really like. Most women, from my somewhat limited experience, would much prefer an intimate 5-10 minutes than a 2 hour slogfest filled with ridiculous positions and over exaggerated sexual name calling. </p></div>		</li>
