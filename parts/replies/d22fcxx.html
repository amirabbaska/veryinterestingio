			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked into a bunch of recognition studies when doing my static vs dynamic attractiveness studies and the human brain is very impressive. One study took video and highly distorted the lighting and contrast, but people could recognize the people (both famous and known to them) easily if played in real time or slightly sped up. The effect was lost in reverse and in serial photos of the same distorted video sequence. </p></div>		</li>
