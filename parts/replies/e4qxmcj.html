			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, clouds are not gas. Clouds occur when the water in the air condenses on dust particulates, gaseous water is transparent. IIRC if you had a planet with a 100% clean dust free atmosphere clouds would not occur. (someone please correct me if I am wrong, I did one meteorology class in school)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We would still have regions of higher humidity where we have clouds now. As air can hold different amounts of water at different temperatures it would also still rain under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>Still, weather would be very different. Water droplets as we know them are statistically incredibly unlikly without some kind of solid particle to form around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it would rain, that requires sublimation .. though not 100% solid on that. Just my thoughts..
I think it would be pretty much in a permanent state of 100% RH and water both condensing and evaporating on all surfaces continuously, if temperature drops everything gets wetter.</p></div>		</li>
