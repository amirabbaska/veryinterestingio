			<div class="markdown"><p>On that last point. Pilots are trained to trust their instruments absolutely, if they are unsure of their attitude at night or in bad weather.</p>
<p>Your senses can very easily be confused or deceived. This ends up with a pilot thinking he's pointed up, down, or in a bank, when he is in fact doing none of those things. The reverse is also possible.</p>
<p>If at this point, the pilot ignores his instruments, which would tell him his actual attitude, and relies on his flawed sensory inputs, he can very easily take a safely flying airplane and place it in a very dangerous position. He could exacerbate a gentle climb and stall the plane, initiate a dive into the ground in an attempt to counter a perceived climb, or he could roll the plane significantly in order to cancel out a perceived roll. All of these maneuvers can, if continued for long enough, cause a plane to stop flying.</p>
<p>Looking down at the artificial horizon in the cockpit will give a pilot a visual reference point that displays the planes attitude and allows the pilot to safely fly the plane, even if he was disoriented.  The artificial horizon also allows the brain to recalibrate itself and helps the brain to ignore false sensory inputs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me during pilot training. Your inner ear can &quot;reset&quot; to a non-level attitude so that it treats it as though it were level. You then perceive yaw, pitch, and roll based on this internal idea of &quot;level.&quot; I would have bet any amount of money my instruments were lying to me. Good thing I was with an instructor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is how those &quot;trick&quot; houses at older amusement parks, the ones where water flowed uphill and balls rolled in counterintuitive directions, work.</p>
<p>the floor of the whole exhibit is tilted, with each room a bit more than the last. the exhibit looks like a rickety old shotgun shack, so one would expect a bit of warpage on the floorboards and the walls, and usually a long tale about how it's been abandoned due to haunting, or gravitational anomalies, or ufos, or something else.</p>
<p>the story is actually a part of the trick: the first room is a slightly tilted waiting room, where everyone packs in and waits about ten minutes for the tour to start. usually, there is a carefully aligned sign that's slightly difficult to read in this room. while you are in here, your senses readjust, and you stop noticing the slight tilt.</p>
<p>the second room is a slightly more tilted, and a tour guide talks at you and tells you spookey stories until your senses realign with this more tilted reality.</p>
<p>the third room is still yet more tilted (or tilted back a notch, i don't remember), but by this time, you don't notice. it's tilted enough that the guide can drop a pen on the floor and it'll look like it's rolling uphill, and other weird effects. the first instrumentation is correct (the uphill water or pen or ball is actually flowing downhill, like an artificial horizon), but because your senses have been renormalized, and there is a <strong>strong</strong> natural urge to believe your senses, you see counterintuitive phenomena.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like another person in this thread, during flight training I was taught that if you cannot see the horizon outside, trust your instruments absolutely because your inner ear will (not &quot;might&quot;) lie to you. Case in point: one time while training my inner ear was so disoriented I thought we were flying nose down, tilted 30 degrees to the left, while in fact we were flat and level.</p>
<p>It's also why its good to carry a backup system, and to compare your instruments against each other, because even your instruments can lie. (For example, if your attitude indicator shows you as level, but your altitude indicator is winding downwards and your vertical speed indicator is showing you're going down, chances are you're probably going down.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worst case scenario: if all your instrumentation failed, could you use something like a glass of water to roughly judge if you were flying level?

He wasn't certified to fly by instruments alone yet he took off in a storm and crashed five miles from the runway.</p>

<p>If I remember correctly, he was not qualified to fly IFR, and pretty much rolled the aircraft into the sea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The standard thing to refer to here is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXzYZjpoz_E" target="_blank">&quot;178 Seconds to Live&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>The basis of this is allegedly a study conducted in 1991, often cited from the University of Illinois, in which VFR pilots were placed in instrument meteorological conditions in a simulator. All pilots in the study eventually made errors which in a real aircraft would have had a fatal outcome. The average time to this point is said to have been 178 seconds.</p></div>		</li>

<a href="https://youtu.be/-P_S4m1vfR8" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/-P_S4m1vfR8</a><br />
Above is a video of a commercial helicopter pilot attempting to fly without his eyesight, only relying on inner ear, etc, like you would at night. He doesn't try anything fancy, only to keep flying level &amp; straight.
Spoiler: it does not go well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I took flying lessons, my instructor made that point several times. Once at night he had me close my eyes and turn my head to the right, then he put the plane into a series of simple maneuvers, such as banking, climbing and descending. Then he said, open your eyes and when you're ready tell me &quot;I've got the airplane.&quot; When I did,  I only saw stars overhead, and nothing else to convince me we were in anything other than straight and level flight. </p>
<p>In actuality, the plane was pointed due north with a slight bank to the left. I saw no lights on the ground. we were near the coast just inland of Fort Lauderdale, Florida. All of the visible lighting in that area is on the coast. Both the ocean to the east and the Everglades to the left looked pitch black. I was looking outside the plane, not at the instruments, and my instructor knew that. After 30 or 45 seconds, we were headed almost due south.  That's when I finally saw the lights of Miami, and the horizon at about a 15° angle. he did that a few other times and other circumstances, the same goal: to convince me not to trust my eyes and my inner ear. </p></div>		</li>
