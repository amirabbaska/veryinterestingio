			<div class="markdown"><p>Forever.</p>
<p>So how long are they actually kept? It depends. Here in Canada, there's been court cases that show Bell and Rogers don't keep them on purpose (meaning they may stay around for a while but that's just a byproduct of software), but Telus keeps all of them with no indication they ever delete them.</p>
<p>In the US, I have no idea but it's such a small amount of data they can stay around effectively forever without an issue and who knows, maybe under the old Patriot Act they're all stored regardless?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on your phone settings. You can change it to be shorter, but the default is set at 48 hours before it expires.</p>
<p>EDIT: The default varies drastically. Cell providers usually impose their own limit, but theoretically you could set it to many months. Look up SMS Validity Period for more details.</p></div>		</li>
