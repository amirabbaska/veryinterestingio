			<div class="markdown"><p>Dying things black was actually very difficult a long time ago. I don't know when Germany got their colours and I'm too lazy to look it up, but I just read up on dyes recently for no reason  whatsoever. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Producing fast black in the Middle Ages was a complicated process involving multiple dyeings with woad or indigo followed by mordanting, but at the dawn of Early Modern period, a new and superior method of dyeing black dye reached Europe via Spanish conquests in the New World. </p>
