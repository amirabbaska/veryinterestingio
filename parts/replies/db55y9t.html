<p>High inflation is bad and governments will do all they can to fight this -- even purposely causing a recession -- but zero inflation, or even falling prices (deflation) are not good either. If prices are falling, that is a sign that the economy is depressed.</p>

<p>i don't know about you but my laptop didn't cost me 20 trillion dollars. I'm pretty sure prices have come down since the ENIAC days. </p>
<p>It seems if enough of the economy experiences such increases is efficiency and productivity that prices can go down faster then the monetary base goes up, and that might not be a bad thing, or a sign that the economy is depressed.</p>
<p>I think your argument is missing some very critical information to make any sense at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They measure inflation across a large basket of goods.  I actually don't know how they decide when to rotate technological change into that basket of goods.  That's a good question.  The price of an ENIAC was not considered when they were measuring inflation in the late 40s.</p>
<p>I stand by my other statement, though.  The only time countries experience falling prices across the entire economy are during times of economic depression.  The 1930s.  Japan in the 90s.  Lower prices sound nice on the surface, but they usually go in hand with lower wages.  Lower wages increases the burden of already existing debt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you show this or is it conjecture? Also, if central banks are targeting a specific inflation rate, couldn't it be true that the only reason you see deflation during depressions is because the central bank lost their grip on reality?</p>
<p>It would seem you might be putting the cart before the horse with that logic.</p></div>		</li>
