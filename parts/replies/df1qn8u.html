<p>On the other hand, they bought their house for about 1/10th of what it's worth now...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The crazy low interest rate is not accurate. The rate was around 6% most of the time and spiked several times, once over 18%. The reason houses were so cheap is the fed was keeping rates high to combat inflation. The high rates kept people from going out and buying new homes with a new mortgage because they would need to refi. If less people are buying houses the price falls and that's why the average house cost about 80k in the 70s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people made this point. Yes, interest rates were high in the 60s, 70s and 80s. But guess who were still buying and refinancing homes in the 90s and 00s? Baby Boomers. Guess who was setting the public policy that lead to the low rates? Boomers.</p>
<p>Did some Greatest Generation and Silent Generation and even GenXers benefit too? Absolutely. But purely in terms of demographics, this was a move largely directed by and benefiting Boomers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this is from the top few rich from the baby boomers, but pretty much all of them think they're the bee's knees. They may not have caused all the problems, but they don't even acknowledge them as problems. It makes people pretty angry when the young generation's hard work is disregarded as laziness when we aren't as successful as they were. I mean they literally got paid more $, not even accounting for inflation, than we get now. Well at least for blue collar jobs and some others. Not necessarily CEO positions</p></div>		</li>

<p>Exactly this. As a Millenial (or GenX I'm not sure. I was born in 84), this drives me nuts. My parents aren't bad about this themselves. They're kind of lower middle class and we didn't have a ton of money growing up but we had what we needed and a little more. They did encourage this idea that if you go to college, work hard and don't be lazy you can have everything you ever wanted. That was how I thought life was going to be as a kid and created a very rude awakening by the time I got to college and had to work 40+ hours and try to juggle full time schooling.</p>
<p>My fiance's parents on the other hand, while pushing the same idea that hard work equals whatever you want in life, also refuses to acknowledge that our generation has problems they didn't have to deal with. They were working during a time where new industries and jobs were being created left and right and even the lowest of positions paid a decent wage. Now the markets are flooded but they act like you just have to go apply and accept whatever job you want as if there isn't competition or something. They are upper middle class and make pretty damn good money and act like it's pennies and expect me (at 33y/o) to be president of a bank or something because &quot;when they were my age they already had a big ass house, 2 kids, saving for their college, no debt, blablahblah.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't blame them for causing the problems but it annoys me to no end that they refuse to even acknowledge that things are vastly different. I bust my ass and work harder and more than they ever had to just to squeak by and they act like I'm a lazy ass because I'm not in a better position by now.</p></div>		</li>

They can stay materialistic narcissists - maybe you should thank them that their daughter didn't turn out the same way :) Humans are so simple sometimes: its easy for them to disregard all context and information and just live in a world were they are better than you and everyone around them. It helps them sleep.</p>

<p>You're a Millennial, like me (85 here) but it is interesting to be at the very start of the Millennial generation, as the beginning and end of it (has it ended?) offered vastly different upbringings.  I have a sibling about 11 years younger than me that grew up in a far different world than I remember.  The 80s kids are the last to remember 'outside' being a viable play location, a world without internet access and cell phones, etc.  Hell, I took my high school graduation photos with a wind up disposable camera...laughable these days.  I also managed to get into the workforce before the jobs apparently dried up, so I thankfully don't know much about that post college struggle you hear so much about.</p>
<p>As a result, I don't tend to relate much with the Millennial generation stereotype and have wondered if X makes a more fitting label, though I imagine Xers would feel the same about me and the world I grew up in compared to theirs.  I think the Millennial generation still has the most wild changes between start and end though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True.  Lower rates, but VASTLY inflated prices is more accurate.  </p>
<p>Not to mention that the housing industry is so focused on building new $500,000+ homes for the boomers to buy after selling their house that was bought for 10k and sold for 600k, that there's a severe shortage of housing out there that is small, sensible, and NOT hideously expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Addressed above in another comment. Interest rates were higher in the 60s, 70s and 80s, but Boomers were still buying and selling homes in the 90s and 00s.
