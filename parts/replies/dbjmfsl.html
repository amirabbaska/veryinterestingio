Why not make an unlimited plan on a medium price, and sweep the market because of the high demand? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Bingo. </p>

<p>Some ISPs have done this, but in most countries, there is too little competition, so it's more economically viable for ISPs to do the same as each other and fuck over the customer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Exactly.</p>
<p>Everyone here telling you that it's because of infrastructure limitations has swallowed the technical-sounding bullshit of telecom companies because it seems like a reasonable answer to someone who doesn't know it's a straight up lie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the &quot;medium&quot; price is arbitrary.</p>
<p>Single parent? $40 a month is limit.</p>
<p>Double professional income with no kids? $150 is reasonable</p>
<p>Teen with first job and wants phone? $80 kinda hurts, but ok.</p>
<p>I'm near wifi 97% of the time, between work, home, and friends/family. The only time I use data is to look up store/restaurant hours, phone, menu while on the way, so my plan is 2 GB and only use about 800mb a month, but the next smallest plan is 500mb for like $5 cheaper, I'll rather have a &quot;big&quot; cushion for my usage. I know when I lived in a place without wifi I was easily going 15+ gigs a month.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Customers will agree to pay more for <em>more</em> data, and will agree to pay less for data. Your argument applies to the situation without sufficient competition or regulation prohibiting arbitrary restrictions like data caps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do respond after a while. It's not an overnight transfer. People aren't instantly aware, not by a long shot. </p>
<p>I don't recall which countries - perhaps Romania? - but there are countries where, without legal obligation, data caps aren't common even on mobile, and the unlimited subscriptions are the popular ones.</p>
<p>And they will be anywhere else, but ISPs don't want to offer them because it makes them less money and more costs if they actually have to provide what users pay for. Instead, without proper competition - especially rampant in the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand - you get shitty data caps, even on landline connections. </p></div>		</li>
