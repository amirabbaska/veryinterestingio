			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, sure, but ecosystems are more than the sum of their parts. </p>
<p>People can and do cultivate them, but it is time consuming, think waiting years or decades for the fungus and tree to intergrow to the point that the fungus can fruit at all.</p>
<p>Fungi are fickle, difficult to study, and poorly understood, and the science of cultivation has yet to produce commercially viable mycorrhizal mushroom techniques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have said,  it would theoretically be possible,  but at that point it is more expensive and time consuming than the current process of finding wild ones.   Besides,  those selling truffles and other rare mushrooms probably wouldn't want the supply and demand scale to suddenly shift.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating!   Is this true with Ramps found in the Appalachian mountains?   Being from the area they are only available in the spring and for such a short period of time.  They are growing in popularity and pricey at fine dining establishments.   You also have to get to them early because the wildlife will eat them up. </p></div>		</li>
