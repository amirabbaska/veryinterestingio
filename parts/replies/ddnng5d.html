			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say simpler version of this. Also, I think when you say an empty ovum fusing with 2 sperm, that it could be 46XX, XY, or YY, depending on what copies the sperm were carrying. In a complete HM, it is irrelevant though, since as you said, the maternal gamete carries factors which allow the initiation of fetal development. Do both complete and partial hm lead to placentation?  I wonder what it is about a third copy of DNA that makes the fetus unviable. I guess the regulation of expression is just too out of whack? </p></div>		</li>
