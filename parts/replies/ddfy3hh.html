			<div class="markdown"><p>The best thing you can do by far is to volunteer in a research laboratory while you’re earning your degree. I started volunteering in a DNA repair laboratory while I was earning my degree in biochemistry my junior year. It doesn’t even necessarily matter whether you’re working in a “genetics” lab. One of the best graduate students in my year worked in an entomology lab while she was in undergrad. The important thing is to get research experience.</p>
<p>The favorite part of my job is actually writing. My job in science policy involves a lot of writing, and I love it!</p>
<p>In genetics, biochemistry, or any other field, you’ll be reading articles that use a lot of colors in the figures. I’m colorblind, so trying to interpret those pictures can be next to impossible sometimes. That’s the least favorite part of my job.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise I had about research when I got into it was how much overlap there is with different fields. I’ve worked in a vision research laboratory that had cell biologists, biochemists, geneticists, neuroscientists, medical doctors, and engineers. If you go into science, you can take your knowledge and experience in places I couldn’t even imagine when I first got into it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually currently a genetics graduate student who majored in genetics for undergrad. I second the research lab. I actually recommend getting in sooner rather than later. I joined freshman year and stuck with the same lab and managed to get a publication as an undergraduate. Admittedly my entire first semester was spent feeding fish, but I voluntarily attended lab meetings and show enthusiasm and shortly after I was given tasks, once completed, I was given tasks that would require more responsibility. </p>
<p>The topic of the lab isn't as important as the geneticist suggested. Genetics in itself is so applicable to so many different fields that, in time, you'd be able to put your own genetic twist to things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask how you got involved with the lab? </p>
<p>I feel dumb asking this as an undergrad, but I genuinely don't know where to find/create opportunities like this. I'd love to feed fish :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, you basically have to stalk whatever professor you're interested in working with. You send them emails, if that doesn't work you show up to their office, if that doesn't work, you camp outside of their office. Eventually you'll catch them (make sure to always be courteous and respectful of their time) and you can ask for a position. Talk them up first, ask them about their research. Ask them a question about it (even if it seems dumb), it'll show you're paying attention and interested. Then ask them if you can volunteer and/or apply for a payed position. If they don't have anything available, ask them to name other professors who might be interested. </p>
<p>Having a resume isn't needed, but it's nice if they're busy and ask you to come back later or if you ask them to keep you in mind for another professor. </p>
<p>I know it sounds odd and unprofessional, but this is just kind of how the system works. </p></div>		</li>
