			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the most accurate answer. Hot water removes oils from your skin. After the bath your skin feels more &quot;clean&quot;, that is more rough. Have you ever tried washing in cold water? This way is better for you as it doesnt remove as many oils from your skin and as some benefits for your skin also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, just the hot water alone will take more oils off your skin. Great makes oils more liquid and easier to rinse away.</p>
<p>When I shower, I usually only wash my face, underams, undercarriage and feet (unless I've been doing something yu really get me dirty), and the difference between a lukewarm shower and a hot shower is amazing (in terms of how dried out i get.) I still can't give up my hot showers, though.</p></div>		</li>
