			<div class="markdown"><p>After having seen that Black Hawk Down scene, I have always wondered if a person would be able to reach into a wound and pinch the artery with their fingers in order to stop blood loss. Would the rest of that limb - let's say the leg - start to die off if the artery isn't connected back together soon enough? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the lack of blood supply would eventually lead to tissue necrosis. The pinching of an artery can be related to the application of a tourniquet, the blood vessels supplying the blood are prevented from doing so.</p>
<p>As with both a tourniquet and ceasing a vessel's blood flow some other way, the limb will die if blood flow is not returned in a certain matter of time. The idea is to get the patient to a hospital <strong>before</strong> that happens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would start dying , but it would most likely still be salvageable for several hours after the blood flow was cut off. Either way if the choice is between a limb and life, the answer and solution is pretty obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key point is that it doesn't really matter what would happen to the limb - stopping major bleeding is priority #1 and limb damage isn't relevant because dead people don't use their limbs anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it plausible arteries evolved this mechanism to to help vertebrate animals to survive traumatic tearing / ripping / amputation injuries to limbs inflicted by predators? <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tZrKW234nuk/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">NSFW example</a>.

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if I'm following correctly- it's not really how complete the limb cut is (partial vs severed), but moreso whether the artery is partially or completely cut? </p>
<p>So, a severed artery is just more likely with a severed limb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, was trying to ask - Is the extent of damage to the artery more important than the extent of damage to the limb?</p>
<p>Extent of damage = partial cut, or completely severed. </p></div>		</li>
