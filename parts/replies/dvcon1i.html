			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, looks like the questions from my other posts are addressed more rigorously by cosmologists than I knew about.</p>
<p>So basically, these numbers and explanations for them are not just &quot;mysterious gaps&quot;, but rather the leftovers of cold hard calculations based on what we can readily observe.</p>
<p>How confident are we in our understanding of the cosmic background radiation? What if there is a lot more matter out there than we presumed there to be? Will the James Webb Telescope help ease my curiosities in this area?</p></div>		</li>

<p>he described 1 method of estimating masses to map dark matter.  there are many other quantitative independent methods and they all results in a similar result.  the one other i can speak about is using multiwavelength observations of clusters of galaxies, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/82rhw8/the_universe_is_said_to_be_around_23_dark_matter/dvcqif7/" target="_blank">in this post i made</a>.</p></div>		</li>
