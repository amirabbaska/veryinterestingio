			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically. Interestingly enough, black holes can have maximum of other properties. These are called extremal solutions and there are two well known types of this.</p>
<p>First we have the extremal solutions to the Reissner–Nordström metric for charged black holes. Charged black holes exhibit 2 horizons which are separated based on a relationship of charge and mass, there exists a &quot;max charge&quot; you can pump into a black hole that the two horizons coincide yielding a naked singularity.</p>
<p>Naked singularities are black hole singularities which are visible from the outside universe. The same occurs for the Kerr metric for rotating black holes. There exists a solution where the black hole spins so fast, the event horizon disappears yielding again a naked singularity.</p>
<p>We have good reason to believe such black holes are impossible, and if you tried to shoot charges or use gravity slingshots to induce extremal black holes, through a physical process it would lose those never letting you tip it over to the extremal solution.</p>
<p>So such conundrum doesn't necessarily exists for mass though, we can always pump more mass into a black hole and physical process like Hawking radiation actually decrease with mass so there's no mechanism to stop us. With that said, there is a <em>largest black hole</em> in the de Sitter—Schwarzschild metric, which is a universe with dark energy and a black hole. Here we have two horizons again, the de Sitter horizon which bounds causality and the black hole's event horizon. Here we can <em>merge</em> the two horizons by increasing the mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understood correctly:</p>
<p>In a universe with dark energy, space expands. The de Sitter horizon bounding causality means that something on the other side of the horizon from you is so far away that it can never have any causal effect on you, or vice versa. The expansion of space is such that you are receding from each other at greater than c, and can never interact.</p>
<p>The black hole horizon is as expected, space is distorted so strongly by gravitational mass that nothing inside can interact with anything outside. Theoretically, one could create a black hole with such high mass that it's horizon becomes so large as to merge with the de Sitter horizon. If a black hole were any larger, causality would be established across the de Sitter horizon which is by definition impossible, so a larger black hole can be considered impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The outside universe becomes squished in the r coordinate. However, the strangest thing is that proper distances between the two surfaces doesn't go to zero. Instead, the black hole runs away leaving a universe without a singularity and is non-flat. It also has one spatial dimension that expands which is really weird!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike all of the Schwarzschild-de Sitter solutions, the
Nariai spacetime is homogeneous. It does not possess any
singularity, nor does it possess four-dimensional asymptotic
de Sitter regions</p>

<p>It is also unstable and will degenerate into de Sitter space (or multiple such disconnected spaces) if you perturb it with a kick. The solution looks like this,  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it appears that he is saying that, as well as in that universe there is a set ofbparameters that would lead to the black hole being visible in space</p>
<p>Edit; and it appears to our observations that there might be something like dark energy/matter in our universe, (guess) leading to the possibility that this metric holds in our universe when all mass is fed to this black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So since I've tagged you as &quot;Super Black Hole Man&quot; I think that qualifies you to elucidate a conundrum I've been having. So a black hole can only grow at a certain rate when consuming normal matter because of radiation pressure of the stuff falling in. Presumably a whole mess of dark matter wouldn't have this problem, then again the dark matter would have to radiate off its angular momentum in some way, maybe gravity waves I don't know. But presuming a jet of dark matter is blasting its way directly at a black hole and the black hole is feeding on it, could the black hole grow without limit(dM/dt)? Would we observe a black hole growing without any observable matter around it? Would the hawking radiation resulting from a purely dark matter black hole look different than one which was made with regular matter since information isn't lost? </p>
<p>Going back to my previous thought and I apologize for my ballast point induced stream of consciousness but if the only way dark matter can radiate angular momentum is through gravity waves wouldn't a significant mass of dark matter necessarily create a naked singularity if you had enough of it orbiting a black hole???</p>
<p>I am grateful for any and all insight you might provide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Eddington limit doesn't seem to apply to dark matter as the scattering cross section between dark matter particles must be very small. This brings up a potential scenario of runaway accretion as the black hole grows to gobble up more and more surrounding material without any rate limitation. Luckily for us, dark matter is very diffuse, so this does not happen. Here's some discussion on that:  </p>

</blockquote>
<p>It shouldn't. Whether or not the information survives, the radiation should still at least to first order be thermal.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Gravitation waves power loss for orbiting stellar objects is happens on time scales of yottoyears. The universe is much too young for any such condensation to occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The geometry comes about by assuming a cosmological constant permeating all space and a point mass. So, in a sense, it is taken into account.</p>

<p>The leading mathematical model is the cosmological constant, but we don't know what it physically means. No idea.</p></div>		</li>
