			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that there are not some serious crazies among their ranks, but the research and study that the Weston Price foundation has done about dental issues in urban versus native cultures is really interesting and it's mostly that option 3:  we basically eat a diet that lends itself to bad teeth (in fact, we can pinpoint what side of the agricultural revolution a skull is from by checking it for cavities and dental issues).  A lot of this is processed sugars (be they in the form of grain or regular sugar) becoming a much more common and constant part of the human diet (the constant part matters there a lot, because it gives the nasties that live in your mouth a steady food supply all the time).  It's sort of a big deal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is super true, but I also want to point out that the fossil record of us humans shows we've suffered from <em>massive</em> tooth problems our whole history. I'm talking dental carries that work their way down to the jaw and incessant grinding to the pulp from all the sand and rocks we inadvertently ate with our crushed nuts and bugs and grains. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly, but my understanding is that the agricultural revolution increased the frequency of these, but not usually the severity.  So you were more likely to have lots of small carries.  Obviously a really bad one is still possible and even common as a cause of death before that time. The same is true of wild animals now:  plenty of them crack a tooth or get something stuck in there or get an infection and that's it for them. </p>
<p>EDIT:  IIRC, there is also a difference in teeth coming in straight and staying lined up, but this is probably more to do with shrinking jaw size. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the general consensus is that Dr. Price himself cherry-picked a lot of the data used in his book and the WPF is kinda crazy. But I do agree with the basics of your post: poor diet and constant consumption cause decay. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think so. I'm from Germany and I have never flossed. I once tried it, but my teeth are really close to each other and it only made my gum bleed. There is also the possibility you are spreading the dirt between them by flossing. Brushing one's teeth often enough and long enough, maybe also brushing the tongue and using a mouth water should be enough. I also once asked my dentist about it and he say it wasn't necessary to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every dentist in germany his salt is going to recommend you to floss. I once had bad teeth, but since I started to floss twice daily and use a fluoride tooth paste once a week I haven't had a hole in my teeth for years. </p>
<p>Also I have the same problem that my teeth are close together, but there is extra fine floss out there especially for people like us.</p></div>		</li>
