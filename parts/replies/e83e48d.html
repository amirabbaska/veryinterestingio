			<div class="markdown"><p>For certian pieces hand forging is also incredibly efficient. But only for specific shapes that machine rolled stock is not close to.</p>
<p>Hand forging also allows for improvisation and detail. Overall a higher degree of quality.  </p>
<p>That said, a hand engraved, damascus knife with a gold inlayed Afcrican Blackwood handle is going to cut just as well as a machine cut/stamped piece of whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could sharpen a butterknife (made out of good steel!) To be just as sharp as anything else.</p>
<p>Sure, maybe the snapping tension of damascus (whixh doesnt even have a set meaning!!) Might be a little higher, but there is NO practical difference between a 15n20 stamp cut knife and.
A 1095 and 15n20 damascus knife (asuming same shape, grind and sharpening techniques) IF YOU ARE USING IT AS A KNIFE!
A knife used as a pry-bar the damascus might hold out longer....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk about requiring more skill or knowledge than industrial methods. People literally get phds in this stuff. Some artist tinkering in the garage is very unlikely to achieve even a fraction of this experience and dedication, but doing it by hand is still cool even if simplistic and inferior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldnt say the artistic and spiritual experience of crafting something unique is necessarily inferior. Or that the craftsperson is less experienced or dedicated... People get PhDs in art and craft too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol the product is inferior for sure as measured simply by functionality, as an art piece rather than a tool with a purpose I’m sure it can have significant value. This thread is about the former rather than the latter however. I really don’t care about the craftsperson’s spiritual journey when I decide how good my knife is at being a knife. Maybe it’s really pretty, maybe it’s one of a kind, and maybe someone will give you a lot of money in appreciation of this fact, but the product of a a craftsperson will simply never get up to the level of an engineered product in terms simply of performance.</p>
<p>Yeah let’s be real phds in arts and crafts simply dont have the tools to transfer complex technical knowledge between students of a field. Engineering as a field makes a study of gathering, systemizing, transferring and improving the human races ability to do practical things. Engineering is like the human race’s memory.</p>
<p>The arts have no common technical vocabulary, no method, no empiricism, each one is is on their own journey. An engineer, or a team of engineers bring with them not just their own skills but distilled knowledge and experience of generations before them. Artists have simply their own limited experience to draw upon which will always be extremely limited in comparison.</p>
<p>Getting a PhD in art or craft literally has no bearing on your ability to produce a good product , getting a phd in engineering means that even if you may not be actually good at doing something yourself, have the understanding of process to be able to have extended the engineering understanding in your field, and you have the communication skills to have conveyed this new knowledge to your peers. </p>
<p>By all means you can enjoy your journey but engineering isn’t on an individual journey, it’s on a multigenerational, shared journey and after all this time there are many areas we have moved far past the point where any one persons journey can ever hope to reach without standing on shoulders of those who came before. The making of steel and particularly simple geometric objects like knives from this steel is one of those areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not specifically cause it requires more skill or knowledge, at this stage it's almost because its artistic and will produce a unique blade. When you mass produce stuff they're generally very familiar, where as a hand-forged blade is going to be different from every other blade. </p>
<p>This can be seen most obviously on Japanese forged blades with the &quot;hamon&quot; or those waves seen along the blade. Different black-smiths used different methods and clays when forging the blades and thus could produce an almost trademark pattern. </p>
<p>Western blades also have tell-tale differences. They make the weapons more personal. </p></div>		</li>
