			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that supposed to read &quot;106 to 108 <em>million</em> years&quot;, because a 2 year range for a ring on a 20 million year range for tidal dispersion doesn't sound right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, that's just me not being able to copy and paste. Those should be exponents. So &quot;10^6 to 10^8 years&quot;. Thanks for catching that!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>10^6 = 1,000,000,
10^8 = 100,000,000.
This is an order of magnitude estimate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely the latter. </p>
<p>An external impact (missle, bomb, collision w/ another celestial body) would create a chaotic ejection of materials what could/would escape the gravity of the moon and possibly Mars. These would scatter. </p>
<p>By having the moon drawing closer to Mars, the smaller particles would break up due to increased stress, but still stay in the same orbital path. Sort of like how a comet's tail doesn't just scatter immediately, but rather follows the path the nucleus took. </p>
<p>The only hitch in that giddiyup is that as the moon draws closer to the planet, the tidal stresses increase, creating opportunity for larger fragments to break off. These would fall to the planet or burn up in the atmosphere upon re-entry, but for a (relatively) short period there would be a thick ring extending from the atmosphere to the edge where the initial breakup began. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tidal forces don't deorbit material, as far as I understand it. The material shed in this way would just become a ring, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Edit: I mean tidal forces of the parent body (Mars in this case) don't deorbit material. Gravitational forces due to other nearby objects certainly can do this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait Newton's first law of motion states that an object in motion will stay in motion unless acted upon by an external force. So what force is acting on phobos to adjust it's orbit such that it will eventually either crash into mars or break up forming a ring.</p></div>		</li>
