That is a good example too! Totally forgot about the underwater rivers and jet streams that we saw in Finding Nemo, that will be simple enough and easy to picture.  Plus the child is obsessed with Australia, wishes she had the accent but speaks that way anyway. She will be totally on board for that example. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
