			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but it won't be able to read your browser history directly. Instead it uses tracking cookies which pretty much every website saves on your browser. If you disable cookies, the captcha will often make you do traditional challenges instead as it can't tell who you are anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. Your browsing history is private but cookies are not. However the capcha also works by looking at how you click the check box. A robot will move the cursor in a perfect straight line to it, then click. No matter how hard you try, you could never do an absolutely perfect straight line, there will always be tiny little squiggles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely just variety of websites, how you got to the website with the captcha and such. Bots that are trying to overload websites will not have the same pattern of websites that a normal person does, and would likely viewed the same sight repeatedly and in similar time frames.</p></div>		</li>
