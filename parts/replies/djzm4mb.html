<p>You can still eat, talk, and breathe with a stuffy nose, so primitive man could still eat, communicate about important and unimportant matters, and run and do other physical tasks requiring hard breathing.</p>
<p>You can still drive with itchy eye, still read with itchy eyes, so the aim of primitive man might not be affected enough to prevent them from killing their food or gathering it.</p>
<p>You can still drive with trouble sleep, you can still go about daily tasks with poor sleep, so primitive man could still be a functioning member of his or her community, even if they don't feel like it.</p>
<p>The fact is, if our ancestors couldn't hunt/survive with these symptoms, none of us would be here. So this did not affect them the way you might think it would.</p>
<p>Also, as u/rodiraskol said, evolution goes for &quot;good enough.&quot; Sickle cell disease will greatly shorten your lifespan, especially short without treatment. However, it also protects equatorial populations from malaria (large mosquito populations pass malaria to humans), as those with the disease are immune. Some random genetic mutation kept someone alive long enough to reproduce and pass the gene on to their kids, and their kids lived long enough to reproduce, etc. Those who got malaria were pretty much dead, so a lot of babies and children died along with adults. But people with sickle cell didn't, so they passed on their genes with enough gusto that it still exists today.</p>
<p>Even though primitive man with sickle cell wasn't going to live as long as other adults in his community who never had that disease or contracted malaria, evolution never selected against it because it worked to pass on the genes. If sickle cell mutates to the point where it kills people before puberty, it will be selected against since there will be too few people to pass it on.</p>
<p>These primitive people with allergies? Whatever the effects of those allergies, they stayed alive long enough to have kids, who stayed alive long enough to have more kids, etc. When evolution promotes a deadly disease, a little bit of sneezing and watery eyes won't stop it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No offense, but this is very clearly spoken like someone who has never suffered from bad seasonal allergies.</p>
<p>I have awful pollen allergies, and so do many others. It's not &quot;a little discomfort&quot;, it's not &quot;a stuffy nose&quot; or &quot;a little bit of sneezing&quot;, it is literally debilitating. I have to stay indoors during peak pollen season; if I don't, after 10 minutes I can't hold a conversation or concentrate on other things because I'm focusing on trying not to sneeze. After 15 minutes, I cannot do anything else because I'm sneezing violently every 5 seconds. This goes on for 15 or 20 minutes. Then it stops for a couple minutes. Then the cycle restarts. It does not end until I go inside. Even then, pollen on my clothes and in my hair will trigger sneezing fits and watery/itchy eyes throughout the day. Showering and changing clothes helps somewhat, but not completely. The rush of histamines leaves me drowsy afterward. Itchy eyes might not be life-threatening, but after a certain point, they make it difficult to accomplish otherwise simple tasks. At some point during pollen season, I will inevitably end up with a sinus infection.</p>
<p>It absolutely affects my ability to to ordinary things like communicate, perform physical tasks, etc. Although I am otherwise in great shape and otherwise very capable, I think that if I were placed outdoors in a survival situation during springtime, my ability to just plain survive would be drastically reduced.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah,  but you have to mate.  And who is going to choose the dude with snot running down his face, neck, chest, mating parts, etc.  And who keeps sneezing at you?</p>
<p>It's not simply &quot;good enough&quot;,  it is survival of the fittest.  not survival of everyone.</p>
<p>The real answer for almost all seemingly detrimental genetic traits is that they convey an evolutionary advantage in another way. Sickle Cell is a great example of that.</p>
<p>The secondary answer is that allergies may be a very recent thing for modern humans that has not had any impact of evolution as of yet.  And likely won't since we can treat allergies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But it could be that the alternative is <em>worse.</em></p>
<p>People have this vision that DNA is <em>exactly</em> like a computer and it codes how to build a person, which isn't exactly wrong, but it implies that DNA can do literally any construction imaginable.</p>
<p>The truth is, it's more like a very complicated <em>encoding</em> rather than just direct instructions, where small tweaks can have changes in multiple areas.</p>
<p>Our immune system is incredibly vital to combatting illness. An unfortunate side effect is allergies. It might not be possible to have one without the other. It might very well be possible but require <em>incredibly complex and therefore unlikely</em> mutations to achieve. What you're left with is immunities because they work, and allergies because they suck but come with immunities, and we just haven't seen otherwise.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like the vastly more probable answer. When you think about it, pollen is a fine, spiky powder. That's something you definitely don't want in your body, and it'd be nearly impossible to differentiate that and something more sinister. If pollen isn't just dangerous in general, which isn't a given.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/neanderthal-dna-affects-ethnic-differences-in-immune-response-1.20854" target="_blank">Neanderthal DNA affects ethnic differences in immune response</a></p>
<p>This study posits, on the data collected that Neanderthal influenced immune response in western European populations is different than African immune response; </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Individuals from different populations vary considerably in their susceptibility to immune-related diseases. To understand how genetic variation and natural selection contribute to these differences, we tested for the effects of African versus European ancestry on the transcriptional response of primary macrophages to live bacterial pathogens. A total of 9.3% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection, and African ancestry specifically predicts a stronger inflammatory response and reduced intracellular bacterial growth. A large proportion of these differences are under genetic control: for 804 genes, more than 75% of ancestry effects on the immune response can be explained by a single cis- or trans-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL). Finally, we show that genetic effects on the immune response are strongly enriched for recent, population-specific signatures of adaptation. Together, our results demonstrate how historical selective events continue to shape human phenotypic diversity today, including for traits that are key to controlling infection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35246503" target="_blank">Neanderthal genes 'boosted our immunity'</a></p>
<p>This article discusses research in the  The American Journal of Human Genetics,  that points to a certain cluster of important immune system genes come from the Neanderthals and Denisovans.
From the <a href="http://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297\(15\)00485-1" target="_blank">article at AJoHG</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Finally, we show that innate immunity genes present higher Neandertal introgression than the remainder of the coding genome. Notably, among the genes presenting the highest Neandertal ancestry, we find the TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 cluster, which also contains functional adaptive variation in Europeans. This study identifies highly constrained genes that fulfill essential, non-redundant functions in host survival and reveals others that are more permissive to change—containing variation acquired from archaic hominins or adaptive variants in specific populations—improving our understanding of the relative biological importance of innate immunity pathways in natural conditions.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also some studies that show some allergies to be environmental which would give rise to allergies. Furthermore, it's been a long time since we have been subjected to the level of natural selection where a stuffy nose and itchy eyes would prevent someone from surviving. Sure, prior to the rise of civilizations it may have been an issue, but agriculture and civilizations came to rise around 10,000 years ago. A short time in evolutionary terms to be sure, but more than enough for mutations that cause very little harm to occur and spread. And of course, we don't necessarily live in the same climates/regions as our direct ancestors, meaning these plants were introduced long after we became less susceptible to natural selection and therefore allergies were not selected against because it doesn't affect your reproductive fitness in a civilization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biologist here</p>
<p>This is incorrect on several levels.  </p>
<p>First of all, natural selection does not remove only things that <em>prevent</em> reproduction.  Instead it removes traits that cause reproduction to occur <em>less than average</em>.  If one gene causes people to have 2 kids on average and another causes people to have 2.5 kids on average, the 2.5 gene will eventually push out the 2 gene.  Tiny changes much smaller than allergies <em>do</em> get selected for in nature.  For example, on the galapagos there is heavy selection on finch beaks that differ in size by <em>millimeters</em>.  But that tiny change is enough to matter, and that's enough to lead to different beak shapes in different birds.  </p>
<p>And in fact humans are not &quot;naturally&quot; allergic to pollen because, until recently, allergic reactions to pollen were quite rare (and had probably been weeded out by natural selection). It's only the modern world, where changes in the environment of young children result in alterations to immune development, that allergies have become really common.</p>
<p>Natural selection can't get &quot;perfection'' necessarily, because it can't pull mutations out of thin air or &quot;think ahead&quot;.  But it absolutely does <em>not</em> go for &quot;good enough&quot;.  Natural selection favors the best available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of piggybacking off what you have to say here:</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, because &quot;allergies&quot; (type I hypersensitivities in this context) are IgE-mediated responses, some trials in Europe are looking at introducing people to purposeful IgE-mediated infections to treat highly atopic individuals. The allergic response is secondary to a misdirection of the immune system against perceived threats because we have eliminated the threat for which that branch of our immune system was intended, but that hasn't stopped our immune system from producing the same components it has for a very long time. As a general rule of thumb in medicine, an out-of-control immune system very often leads to pathology, be it a &quot;simple&quot; case of allergies, all the way to cancer secondary to sustained inflammation. </p>
<p>TL;DR: allergies arose from us being &quot;too&quot; hygienic and more-or-less eradicating worm / helminth infections in developed countries. Some scientists / physicians are purposely reintroducing those infections under controlled conditions and treating. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually it's under exposure. A prime example in pediatrics is peanut allergies. Parents scaled back introducing peanut butter at an early age to children for fear of how powerful the response can be. As a result, there was actually an increased incidence of peanut / true nut allergies. Consequently, pediatricians predominately promote early (within reason) introduction to peanuts, etc. to children. </p></div>		</li>
