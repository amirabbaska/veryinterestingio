			<div class="markdown"><p>Those aren't the only factors. Number of requests from a specific IP, the link you followed to the page, the device and browser you're using to connect, probably a lot more you wouldn't expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does more than that, IIRC, it checks things like the page you visited last, and the IP address. It does more things behind the scenes than just watch you move your mouse.</p>
<p>Google knows if you are a robot or not way before you click the button. If any variable doesn't quite add up, it throws the test at you as a sort of failsafe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but it's hard. It's essentially an arms race between people trying to evade detection and those trying to detect it.</p></div>		</li>
