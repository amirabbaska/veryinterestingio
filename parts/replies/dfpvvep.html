			<div class="markdown"><p>Pro tips to build credit:</p>
<p>Pay more than the minimum due.  The minimum leaves money owed long enough for you to have to pay interest.</p>
<p>Treat your credit card as money that actually exists and comes out of your paycheck.  Too many people act like credit cards are free money.  Bad idea.</p>
<p>Use your credit card regularly, preferably for smallish purchases.  Then pay it off the next week.  That way the credit score companies see you using your credit responsibly and it will build your credit score up.</p>
<p>Personally, I use my credit card instead of my debit card, but I use it pretty much like my debit card.  I pay it off every week or so, so I'm not paying interest or building unnecessary debt.  But unlike a debit card, my credit card gives me points to spend on airlines or whatever.  And that basically <em>is</em> free money.  Kind of.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I intend to use the credit card as a debit. I just want to build my credit profile up :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paying on time monthly makes up a large percentage of your credit score. Many cards are now offering free FICO credit reports with your statement. Your score essentially tells you how dependable of a borrower you are in the eyes of financial institutions.</p>
<p>Off the bat your score will be penalized due to lack of accounts (yes your score gets knocked due to only having one CC) and for length of accounts being active. I've had 2 cards now for 5 years and I still get penalized for length of accounts.</p>
<p>But honestly, I've never taken out any big loans and my credit score is in the 770s just by consistently paying my card off each month. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How true is this outside of the US though? Where I live (Europe) any utilised credit card debt is seen as a negative if you're trying to get e.g. a mortgage. In their credit checks they can't see if you've actually paid any interest on the credit card debt, so they assume in their calculations that all utilised debt carries the full interest rate (which can be high, 10% or more).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are a student, you should see whether there are any cards or account types especially for students. Since that's the first time a lot of people are going to be doing their own banking, lots of banks offer decent perks in the hope that the student will then keep banking with them for a long time.<br />
I'm sure a lot of the perks will be BS gimmicks, but there are good ones around (e.g. 1/3 off rail travel in the UK with Santander).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ING or online banks are great because they have greatly reduced fees compared to the big four like commbank etc. As someone else said - treat it like money you have, pay it off every month. The big banks have billions in profits because people forget that they aren't a public service: they are a business. Pay it off so they you're not giving them thousands over your lifetime.</p>
<p>Its often recommended to get a debit card instead (works the same as a credit card but its money you have).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>I think i'm more inclined towards commbank, only because the degree of control and security of (all) cards are really customisable! </p>
<p>But i'm not wedded to the idea of commbank so, i will definitely look at ING or other banks :) </p></div>		</li>
