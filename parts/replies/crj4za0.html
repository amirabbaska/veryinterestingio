			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good point. It seems that the claims of &quot;security&quot; are often wildly unrealistic because it's assuming that you're going to try to crack the security using the method the brute force way instead of another easier way.</p>
<p>For example when I used to work as PC support back in the day, the company wanted to switch to a more complicated password with more letters, numbers, special characters that needed to be changed every month. I'm sure they thought they gained better security that way. But when they did that I noticed that most users began writing their passwords down on pieces of pieces of paper and either hiding it under their keyboard or mousepad, or just blatantly sticking it to their monitor. They actually made security much worse. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have answered there were operational failings - when encoding a message the sender had to enter the Kenngruppen, basically pick a few random letters, many operators would use their initials, those of a girlfriend or some other memorable collection of letters. This had an impact because the people at the Y-Stations who listened for enigma messages and then sent them to the codebreakers got to recognise the signature/style of the morse code that the operators sent, therefore a guess could be made as to what the Kenngruppen was, which aided the decoding of the message.</p>
<p>The enigma also had an inherent weakness in that it was impossible to see the same letter encoded as the same thing if they were next to each other, e.g. &quot;hello&quot; would never be encoded to &quot;ethhn&quot;. Also, a letter would never be encoded as itself (e.g. &quot;hello&quot; would never become &quot;hcrtk&quot; or &quot;xeghy&quot;). This was a huge help when trying to see if a crib (clear text) could possibly match the message.</p>
<p>Also, do keep in mind that the English Government Code &amp; Cipher School (the organisation responsible for code breaking) was also fed information from the Polish cipher bureau, who had been working on the Enigma for some time during the 1930s (Enigma started as a commercial venture for banks etc to send secure messages). The Poles had made some nroads in to prewar enigmas and understood some elements of how the machine worked - Henryk Zygalski, Marian Rejewski and Jerzy Różycki did much of the early work to defeat enigma, indeed Rejewski devised the initial design for the bombe machine that Alan Turing later improved on before GC&amp;CS made the machine(s) that helped significantly in the decoding effort.
Zygalski created his sheets - you can find examples on the internet but they were sheets with perforated holes in, by placing the sheets over each other in the right order some of the enigma settings could be determined. An almost identical method was devised by Gordon Welchman at Bletchley Park (he hadn't been told they existed..), the sheets were used extensively during the war.</p>
<p>Do note that the enigma changed many times before and during the war, there was a lot of hard work done during the war to get on top of Enigma and keep up with the changes. Whilst Alan Turing is the best known of the codebreakers there were many more - Dilly Knox, Gordon Welchman, Bill Tutte to name but a few. There were thousands of people working at Bletchley at one point.</p>
<p>If you are interested I can fully recommend Hugh Sebag-Montefiore's &quot;Engima - The battle for the code&quot; which is a superb book that covers the breaking of the Enigma and Bletchley Park, also take a look at &quot;The hut six story&quot; that Gordon Welchman himself wrote, quite technical but very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's not really accurate to say the code was broken. Codes changed daily, and some days the code might simply not be broken.</p>
<p>In the same vein, reuse of codes also gave Bletchley Park a lot more sample ciphertext to work with, so some of the comparative ease was also down to lazy radio operators.</p>
<p>Also in WW2 Nazi messages used standard snippets of text (known as &quot;cribs&quot;) which could be quickly searched for in decrypted text to indicate a successful break. </p>
<p>One such crib which sticks in my mind was a quantity of Z characters at the beginning of the message denoting how important it was (more Zs == more important). Other things which were often included were phrases used to report weather conditions.</p>
<p>Also worth noting is that to this day, there are secret and top secret techniques for decoding encrypted messages. I'm guessing these didn't make it into the software mentioned elsewhere in this thread. </p>
<p>Edit : worth noting, not nothing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If every nazi had followed safety protocol to a T, it would have never been broken, but many of them skipped protocol and slowly leaked enough secrets to the Allies for them to break it.  Modern computers were pretty much the result of inventing tech to break Enigma.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe" target="_blank">Alan Turing came up with the design for a logic machine called the Bombe</a> which was the power-house behind decoding stuff.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't exactly true..   They had a working German enigma machine at Bletchley Park, the trick was that the rotor positions were changed daily, so they only had 24 hours to brute force the code before they changed again.  </p>
<p>The decoder was no where near powerful enough todo this, the breakthrough came when they realised that the Germans would transmit a weather report every morning, so they would get an encrypted message they they knew would start with the same characters. </p>
<p>This allowed them to us the Bombe to calculate the enigma rotor positions and in turn allow them to decrypt all the German messages for that day. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not so much, actually.  The Enigma project was shut down and heavily classified after the war - it didn't become known until the 90s.  All the technology that went into computers had to be invented separately.</p>
<p>In addition, the equipment they designed was not a computer in the sense we understand it.  It was a machine designed to do one job as quickly as possible.  In that sense it was closer to Babbage's Difference Engine than a modern (Turing complete) computer.  </p>
<p>It's instructive to note though how powerful a dedicated piece of hardware is when you compare what the Bombe could achieve with the computer power you need to do a similar job in a similar time.</p></div>		</li>
