			<div class="markdown"><p>Orcas aren't heavy enough for them to be crushed underneath their own weight as quickly as a blue whale, they can stay beached for a little longer. Instead, there is a bigger threat of dehydration, which is why the people helping kept pouring water over the creature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually isn't so much about dehydration as it is temperature regulation. Whales and such have a very thick insulating layer of blubber to keep them warm in the cold water. You replace the water with air, which is much less thermal conductive than water and they will overheat very quickly. They would pour water on the animals to keep them from having a deadly case of hyperthermia. </p></div>		</li>
