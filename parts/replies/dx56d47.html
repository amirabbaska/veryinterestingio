			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm that's actually a really good question. Well some have critical points that are at high enough pressure that many plasmas can operate under that level (like gold's critical pressure is something like 5000 atm). Actually, most fluids can probably exist as a low pressure plasma. The issue becomes that if you want to have liquid and plasma in even a quasi equilibrium, that might not be reasonable due to the L-G critical point.</p></div>		</li>
