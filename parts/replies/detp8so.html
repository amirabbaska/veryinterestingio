			<div class="markdown"><p>It really doesn't take much. What probably happened to steve bannons jacuzzi was it was not taken care of. If the waters pH drops to around 6 (not very acidic) and sits there for 6 months or so the heater, jets gaskets, and pump seals will break down. You are left with a leaking pile of junk. For some models because the inside is filled solid with spray foam it is impossible to fix leaks like this cost effectively.  The labor costs quickly exceed the value of the jacuzzi.</p>

<p>You should be more worried. You've gone from wondering if OP wants to dissolve a dead body in a jacuzzi to wondering if Steve Bannon really did dissolve a dead body in a jacuzzi.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Physical resiliency is completely separate from chemical resiliency. Something that's physically pretty weak can be resistant to chemical attack and vice versa. Recall the Breaking Bad thing - plastic &gt; ceramic bathtub when it came to the acid they were using, even though it's physically a lot weaker. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hydrocloric acid is used to lower ph in pools and hot tubs but obviously if you are running super low ph your gonna have issues. A 7.4 ph is totally acceptable, we inject undiluted acid using stenner pumps directly into a pool or tub based on sensors that are set to a specific ph. If you are just dumping straight acid into a pool and you add too much you will probably have issues. That is why most home non public tubs use bisulfate which is granulated acid and you take readings and then based on a chart calculate how much bisulfate by weight to add. Short answer acid should be used in a hot tub to maintain the correct ph. If you are just talking about acid washing plaster or fiberglass you should dilute it and rinse it off fairly quickly after scrubbing with it. I think we need more info in what you mean by jucuzzie. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How to test your sealer: Drip some water on the granite. If it beads up like rain-x does to rain on your windshield you're all good. If it doesn't go to Home Depot and buy some sealer. You just spray on and wipe off. </p>
<p>We always recommend people clean with simple dish soap and water. They sell specialized cleaners for $$$ but I don't think they are necessary.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Make a 3% solution, soak for 24 hours, hit with a wire brush, and repeat if necessary.  Carbolic acid works well, too. I found it sold at a woodworking store as wood bleach and tried it out on an old set of chisels. If the rust is bad enough that there is pitting, then the metal itself has been eaten away.  There will still be pits, but it will take the rust off. If you're using this for tools, hit the metal with some camellia oil after you rinse and dry them. It will ward off the rust for a while. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about Iron Stains outside of the pool yes. If you're talking about Iron Stains inside of the Pool... </p>
<p>Yes...BUT, Iron stains inside the pool will release with Citric Acid at PH Around 7.0 and Chlorine at 0. The iron can be released at a mixture of approximately 1/2-1lb per 10,000 gallons.</p>
<p>After the iron releases from pool surface, a sequestering agent then needs to be added to the water to bind the iron particles and keep them from reattaching to pool surface. </p></div>		</li>
