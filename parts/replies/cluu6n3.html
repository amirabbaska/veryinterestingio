			<div class="markdown"><p>It's speculated that most pregnancies <del>(50~75%)</del> end in miscarriage. That is, a fertilized embryo implants but lost shortly after. In medically recognized pregnancies, the miscarriage rate is still about 15~20%. </p>
<p>So yes. All the time.</p>

<p>Edit: Also, this is why most couples don't announce that they're expecting until they are past the first trimester. </p>
<p>Edit edit: Sorry, to clarify, human miscarriages mostly end in the expulsion of the pregnancy tissues. However, you will occasionally get silent or missed miscarrages, in which case the tissues are automatically reabsorbed. These are much less common.</p>
<p>Edit edit edit: Messed up my numbers a tad. 50~75% miscarriages are are chemical pregnancies (from first source). About half of all fertilized eggs die and are aborted spontaneously (second source).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's only been in recent history that we've had such accurate ways to determine pregnancy.  In the past many women probably never knew they were pregnant.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, the first article that you cited states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Studies reveal that anywhere from 10-25% of all clinically recognized pregnancies will end in miscarriage. Chemical pregnancies may account for 50-75% of all miscarriages. This occurs when a pregnancy is lost shortly after implantation, resulting in bleeding that occurs around the time of her expected period. The woman may not realize that she conceived when she experiences a chemical pregnancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This does <em>not</em> mean that 50-75% of pregnancies end in miscarriage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically it can happen. Kinda. But humans rarely reabsorb pregnancies. </p>
<p>Keep in mind humans menstruate - overt menstruation (bleeding) is only seen in some primates, &amp; in other placental mammals the endometrium is reabsorbed at the end of the reproductive cycle. So in humans, death of a fetus results in a miscarriage that expels the fetus, much like the typical shedding of the endometrium during menses.</p>
<p>The only info I can find on humans reabsorbing a fetus is if it somehow gets into the abdominal cavity (e.g. an early ectopic pregnancy ruptures the fallopian tube &amp; ends up in the abdominal cavity).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All mammals do this, it is completely normal. It isn't as bad as it sounds, and evolution definitely supports it. Most miscarriages are the result of mutation or bad embryo development, most of the time causing the embryo death directly, which means you absolutely don't want the baby to come to term and in all likelihood it can't anyways.</p>
<p>Think about this. Down syndrome is a result of trisomy of two possible chromosomes (trisomy = 3 chromosome copies rather than a pair). Trisomy in every other chromosome almost always leads to death/miscarriage, as well as a ton of other possible mutations. Down syndrome is the exception of exceptions. Miscarriage is the norm for a bad embryo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although as far as I know, humans can't do it (and I have no idea about Pandas), many species do have the ability to either accept or reject sperm after mating, depending on the situation, and sometimes choose between the sperm of multiple males.  It's usually called cryptic female choice</p>
