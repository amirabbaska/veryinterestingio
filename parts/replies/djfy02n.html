			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of this is correct.</p>
<p>Blood vessels away from the heart, are called arteries. They do not have valves in the arteries to prevent backwards flow. There is one valve between the heart and the arteries (aortic valve), and this functions to prevent flow back into the heart whilst it resets for the next heartbeat. Otherwise, arteries do not need valves as there is a high pressure going forwards that prevents blood going backwards.</p>
<p>Blood vessels to the heart, called veins, have valves. They need valves as A) the forward pressure is low and B) there is a backwards pressure from gravity pushing it back. Valves prevent blood going backwards. When you move, your leg (or arm) muscles squeeze to make movement. This squeezing is near the veins and also helps to push the blood. As it can't go backwards (due to the valves), the blood in the veins goes forward. Without the muscle action of assisting the pumping of blood in the veins, you would have blood moving very slowly back to the heart. This places you at risk of various problems such as heart failure or clots.</p>
<p>NB this doesn't apply to the pulmonary circulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I've been corrected several times regarding the valves and realized that I had myself confused there. It's been awhile since basic sciences and I'm not usually having to think about that stuff in my day to day. Thanks for the great addition!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two valves between your heart and arteries!  The aortic valve is between the left ventricle and aorta, and the pulmonary semilunar (pulmonic) valve is between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is just anecdotal but my back used to be sore a lot and what worked wonders for me was doing a little ab work and focusing on keeping tension in my stomach when my back was sore. I believe my issue was bad posture because my back was a lot stronger because I lifted things for work but didn't ever need to engage my core as much. Take all with a grain of salt though, never talked to a doctor about it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nope, you nailed it. Your strong back was causing anterior pelvic tilt and straining your lower back. Strengthening your abs countered the strength of your back and rotated it back into place. You could have strengthened your hamstrings also for a similar effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually been trying to work the core muscles, front and back. Ever since I hurt my back I haven't had the strength in the muscles from laying around so much. If working the muscles feels better, then dammit I feel like I need to be in a gym.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be more inclined to think that your posture is possibly off and that when standing still you place pressure on some of your vertebrae which are causing nerve compression and therefore pain. Most of the blood vessels that supply the spine would have alternate routes along the ribs and wouldn't be as readily affected by gravity as your legs. You also don't have large clusters of skeletal muscles that pump around your vertical veins with movement.</p>
<p>That said, any form of sitting still is going to result in some blood stasis because pretty much everything except your head/brain need some movement (the head relies primarily on gravity because the blood can just flow downwards to the heart in most positions). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely nerve stuff going on. So I've had back problems for about 13 years. Ribs go out, hips go out up to almost 2 inches (one leg almost 2 inches shorter than the other one) I got my appendix checked last year with really bad pain and obviously nothing found. The last couple months I've been figuring out that when I extend my spine (grab something and hang, hands on a rail and lift, hands on quads and bend knees while leaning forward) the pain will go away. Uncle suggests an inverted table. Joints just popping out for no reason, mostly hip as I can just be standing there and all of a sudden I can't support my weight on one or the other leg. But mostly just working the muscles really feels good/doesn't hurt. Still working on the details. Ran across a yahoo ask thingy with lots of men asking about the appendix area hurting but no clues.. Ileocecal  valve is right there too. I've had soft stools/diarrhea for 5 years in Nov. That's only stopped since camping the last two weekends. Upon waking I have to run to bathroom with cramps but the last two weekends camping I haven't pooed for the whole 2 then 3 days. Just compiling data to share. Also to not hurt anymore.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What they said has zero medical standing. Pay attention to your posture, but more specifically your hip rotation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you mean hip rotation? I can be standing still and a hip will go out and it's painful to stand on until I get it back in, after which I can put full weight on it or run, no problems til it pops out again. But that's just standing still, let alone walking. There's many days without and there's days they pop out a lot. idk.</p></div>		</li>
