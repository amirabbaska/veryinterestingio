			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The amount of fissile matter (uranium) within the Hiroshima bomb &quot;Little Boy&quot; that went critical was less than 2% of the total mass. The first nukes were very crude and woefully inefficient. Little Boy was basically just a long tube with two bits subcritical uranium at either end, that fired one piece into the other to initiate the reaction.</p>
<p>The problem with nuclear weapon design is getting the fissile material to actually stay together long enough to yield a bigger blast. As I understand it, modern thermonuclear warheads have become very efficient, small, and capable of blasts that make Hiroshima seem like a firecracker. Comforting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Really it was already energy, since mass is just a measure of the energy content of a body at rest. Potential energy in nuclear forces became kinetic energy as the atoms split.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes? This is the fundamental theory behind antimatter weapons. Matter and antimatter annihilate into energy (since there's no 'anti-light' or 'anti-heat', when they annihilate they release the same energy). 10 grams of antimatter would release an explosion of about 450 kilotons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it means we're converting 0.2 g/s from one type of energy to another, but a significant fraction of that energy sticks around. The mass that the Earth loses would be equal to the difference between the energy the Earth radiates into space and the amount it receives from the sun, and I don't have the numbers for that at hand.</p></div>		</li>
