			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to factor in time. If you spend an extra hour and a half getting cheap gas every week then you're effectively working for less than minimum wage. The difference you get is pretty large so it makes sense in your case but for a 5 cent price per gallon difference, with a typical tank of 15 gallons, it doesn't make sense to go any more than 5 minutes out of your way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's be honest, most of us aren't leading horribly exciting lives. I am sitting here wasting time on Reddit, I might as well be driving a bit more to get a cheaper gas price.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sometimes, sitting on your ass doing nothing is a supreme luxury in itself that is worth a lot more than the money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speak for yourself.  I only have time to post on Reddit because refractory periods are a thing \s</p>
<p>Seriously, though, if you enjoy Reddit, then time away from Reddit to get gas is a reduction in pleasure and thus your quality of life.  It has a non zero value.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, I figure out which stations are usually the cheapest around my home/work, and just make those my regular stations, but putting in more effort than that just makes no sense.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>50 dollars of gas at the prices he said is 2-3 tanks worth of gas. Some people might spend half an hour on such a trip. In my previous comment though I said it was probably a good deal for him but it wouldn't be with the typical price differences you see between local gas stations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can’t be the only one who passes 2-5 stations going anywhere and has ~16 within a two mile radius of my house. I have my usual driving patterns and never really go out of my way. I definitely stop at the same 2-3 stations most of the time. </p>
<p>I consult my gas app when I’m under 1/4 tank? Plan ahead?  People who refill their car too early and often probably waste more time and miles.</p>
<p>Most of the time everything is within 25 cents in my weekly driving range of stations, but it sure saves more than 5 cents per gallon to pay attention to where/when you buy. </p></div>		</li>
