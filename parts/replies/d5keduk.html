			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, this is some really neat and useful information. Is the USGS currently doing this for bees? I could see how this and /u/Corte-Real 's comment about Harmonic Radar could yield much more accurate data on bee populations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She does this for wild bees that are endangered, she has a degree in mathematics and does the statistics and modeling. She is actually trying to push her group into doing more Remote Sensing of all kinds, as that is her area of expertise. Biologist as a whole have been kinda slow to adopt it.</p>
<p>The funding is prioritized, so the most endangered animals get first go. Her job is pretty specific to endangered animals, that are native. However, a University, or Conservation group with a grant could, and does, do this for a non endangered animal to a limited degree. A Biology Professor could easily make all his Grad Students get their PHDs in bee populations, and send them out as free labor to do the surveying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm with the people who want to help. How can I help...help count...help diversify populations? I live near orchard country and spend a good deal of time outdoors. I also garden, think large English cottage garden with a lot of variety and some food plants thrown in.</p>
<p>I have a vivid memory from my first year living here back in 1990 of riding my bike down country roads, rounding a corner and coming upon a magnificent old style apple tree in full blossom and it was buzzing with life, with drowsy, sated bees fair dripping from the branches. One of my favorite beautiful life memories was sitting under that magnificent tree.</p>
<p>That was followed by more years of cycling/driving through the orchards, always accompanied by beautiful bees, I had bees in my home gardens...they were swarming with bees. I loved it as a part of the circle of life. Corny, true. </p>
<p>And then one spring 2011...2012? I stopped at one of my favorite blossoming orchards and ...nothing. No sound...nothing. It was creepy. I still had some bumblebees and other types of bees in my garden flowers but there were markedly fewer. Something is going on. </p>
<p>Thank God for the song birds I still have, we feed and care for them through out the year, providing cover and food. If it weren't for the singing birds I'd be deep in my own silent spring. I'm sure we'd evolve in our food production but, damn, we'd have killed the bees....just the way we are killing Monarch Butterflies. I will forever beg forgiveness from future children for we are loosing the magnificent Monarchs and bees on our watch. This does not bode well for us.</p>
<p>How can we help?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When she was getting her Master's degree I was basically her free labor to digitize Google Earth and other data entry, so I learned a bunch about her field while she was in school. I also have a degree in Political Science, where I focused on stats. She is much, much better at math than I am, but she at least humors me and asks me my opinion on her statistical analysis. </p></div>		</li>
