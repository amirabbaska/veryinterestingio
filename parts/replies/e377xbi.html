			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify the reason that this is different to planes: the plane wants the accelerated air to hit the wings, as this generates additional lift and helps the plane to stay in the air - whereas a boat is able to float simply due to having a net density lower than that of water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Delayed response, and not OP, but yes. Also something to consider when placing test wings on larger jets. Mounted low gets more airflow from the engines, mounted high gets less turbulent air</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A design consideration is with a prop in front, the wing is in a turbulent airflow. With the prop behind, the prop is in turbulent flow from the wing. You try to keep one from interfering with the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why the rudder of the boat/ship is placed directly behind the propeller to generate a larger turning force. Also it also has a greater turning lever from the point the ship turns about</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>technically you are also pulling the water from where the hull is, it works both ways.</p>
<p>ultimately you need to put the propeller below the hull, front or back, not a big deal... though might be something to be said about the turbulence of the prop wash against the hull increasing drag, better to leave that turbulance behind you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The situation is not symmetric in turbulent flows (=the situation for every ship). You pull water from basically everywhere, but you push it in a single direction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Added, you'd create turbulent water to push the hull through. I don't think that's good for the ship or the stomachs of the people on board.</p>
<p>But it's mostly as you say, you'd cancel out a load of the propelling force by making the water hit a wall attached to the object trying to pull it forward.</p>
<p>Even if the hull is a nice wedge, a bunch of the force will be directed sideways rather than backwards, ruining the efficiency.</p>
<p>It's why there's so much investment in  aerospike engines for lift vehicles, a lot of the force is lost in all directions because of the cone shape of the exhaust nozzle of a rocket engine. If  you can at least make 1 of the axes more directional, you gain a lot of extra propulsion.</p>
<p>Heck, even water jet propellers suck water from under the boat and jettison it out the back instead of from the front and out the back.</p></div>		</li>
