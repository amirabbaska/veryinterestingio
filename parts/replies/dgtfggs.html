			<div class="markdown"><p>ID cards do not track where you have been going and they carry less information than a passport. One of the purposes of a passport is that they carry information that is kept on a database for card IDs. Those databases are not international, the countries you visit do not have access to them. </p>
<p>The thing you have to remember is that the EU for better or worse functions as a pseudo federal government with the member nations functioning similar to US States (not identically). So they have things like a unified database that can be accessed to look up an EU ID card, or at lest access to the issuing nations database. That is not true for nations not a part of the EU. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The funny thing is that the EU is a lot more similar to what the US was founded to be than the US is right now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume you've never been through a central/south american border.  Belize doesn't even accept card payments for the fee they charge tourists.  I don't think they'll be upgrading beyond a stamp anytime soon.  And the Iguazu falls border (Paraguay, Brazil, Argentina), getting a passport even stamped felt more like a suggestion.</p></div>		</li>
