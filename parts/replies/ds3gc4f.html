			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the microwave will heat up and melt the sugar molecules in the bread and cause it to feel soft and fluffy until they reharden.  It will also remove moisture or boil water molecules inside bread which will  continue to cook or dry it out.  It pretty much just causes it to behave like you left it out in the open for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Talking about microwave.  If you want to heat up a slice of cold pizza, and nuke it, for say, a minute and a half, it will be hot, but soggy - no differentiation between cheese and crust.  The latter just becomes a gooey mass.  But if you nuke it just long enough to warm it a little and soften the cheese, then put it in a toaster oven for a couple of minutes, the crust will firm back up.</p>
<p>But your're right that if you forget it in the toaster oven for more than a few minutes, it will turn as hard as a roofing shingle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also talking about microwave. Every pizza I've ever reheated in the microwave more or less is soft but not soggy, but if I reheat it too long it becomes hard and chewy.</p></div>		</li>
