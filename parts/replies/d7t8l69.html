			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I mean, very roughly (if you don't mind fact-checking):</p>
<p>The classical understanding is that the proton is coming in with some amount of kinetic energy. If it's more than the critical energy, it will overcome the Coloumb forces and fuse, if not, it will be pushed away.</p>
<p>Temperature is a measure of the kinetic energy of all the protons, and given the strength of the forces and the expected variance between different protons, we'd anticipate a certain number of fusion events every hour. But we keep measuring more of them.</p>
<p>So instead, given the uncertainty principle, you can't say &quot;these two particles are separated by distance x, and their kinetic energy is y and at distance x, the critical energy is z. Since y&lt;z, no fusion.&quot;</p>
<p>You have to say, &quot;these two particles are separated by distance x +/- a, and their kinetic energy is y +/- b, and at distance x, their critical energy is z. There will be some fusion as long as y+b&gt;z, or if x-a sufficiently lowers the critical energy.</p>
<p>To the extent the &quot;borrowing&quot; idea is useful, it's because x and y are averages, so any protons that have extra kinetic energy must be matched by some with less kinetic energy, so that the total temperature remains the same. But since now you have some fusion, rather than none, despite the lowish temperature, the reaction heats up everything, allowing a sustainable effect.</p>
<p>Is that basically right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, roughly this is a correct description of what is happening.</p>
<p>However, regarding this part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;these two particles are separated by distance x +/- a, and their kinetic energy is y +/- b, and at distance x, their critical energy is z.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you think in terms of wavefunctions, you don't <em>need</em> to say that you &quot;borrowed&quot; energy or that you had some uncertainty in energy, it just so happens that there is a probability for protons being closer than the critical distance, no need for extra energy!</p>
<p>Other than that, &quot;energy borrowing&quot; may be a useful concept.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And if you think in terms of particles, can't you just as easily say out of a population of N particles, there will be pN particles that will get closer than the critical distance where p is the probability of finding two particles with sufficient energy to cross the energy threshold at the same time and place?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, yeah - it works just as well to assume that all the uncertainty is in position, with a known energy, y.</p>
<p>So although the average is too far away for the y to be greater than the critical energy, there is some chance of any given proton actually being close enough. </p>
<p>Although separately - isn't this true because of the statistical nature of temperature, anyway? Even classically, won't you have a mix of warmer and cooler protons, some of which are enough to go over the top?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you think it out of the realm of possibility that our reality is a computer simulation? I say this because quantum mechanics is so strange and counterintuitive, specifically the double slit experiment. I see stuff on this from time to time and was wondering your opinion because you seem to know the intricacies of these things. If you do happen to answer, are there any specifics that have you convinced? It seems like if technology advances for thousands of years beyond where it's at now this wouldn't be out if the realm of possibility. May seem like a stupid question to you but I'd be fascinated to hear your take!</p></div>		</li>

<p>It sounds like you're considering that, for an average temperature, there will be some protons at a higher speed, and some at a lower, following a distribution, which is true.  The Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann distribution gives this.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution</a></p>
<p><em>However</em>, what you're describing doesn't sound quite like quantum tunneling.  QT doesn't depend on temperature distributions (though the overall rate of fusion certainly will).  Analogies are dangerous when talking about quantum things, so it can be hard to wrap your head around (that's a significant understatement).</p>
<p>Basically, the position of a particle can be described as a wave function which describes the probability of a particle being in a particular location.  The key insight (or at least one interpretation) is not that the particle is located at a particular point and we just don't know about it; rather, the particle doesn't really exist at a particular point until it is 'observed', which basically means interacting with another particle.  Until that point, it 'exists' everywhere(nowhere?) in the wavefunction, and thus can interfere with itself as in the famous double slit experiments.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#The_Copenhagen_interpretation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#The_Copenhagen_interpretation</a></p>
<p>Ultimately, QM is all about wavefunctions, and that's all we really know.  Describing things beyond that depends on analogy, which can break down and be deceiving.  For tunneling, you just have to realize that the wavefunction describes some small probability that the particle will exist within that critical barrier to fusion, thus 'tunneling' through the barrier.  IIRC, the particle's energy doesn't change while doing this, it just circumvents having to 'borrow' the energy to cross over that barrier.  The interpretation of 'borrow' is really thorny, but it is not referring to the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, yes - I think I was just trying to think through how exactly the &quot;average&quot; still held. </p>
<p>So maybe said more specifically: the wavefunction is such that, although there is some probability of the proton being sufficiently energetic to fuse, there is also a corresponding probability that a given proton will have less energy than we otherwise would expect under a classical system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in simpler terms the energy of the particles must exceed their critical energy. Like said above the math going into the process is much more complex but you captured the essence of it with X, Y and Z examples</p></div>		</li>

<p>For classically interacting particles, this is true. But tunneling can't be explained with classical ideas. In fact, quantum tunneling is the explanation for cases where particles interact when they <em>don't</em> exceed the critical energies involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not possible. Diproton(^(2)He) has negative binding energy, which means you need to spend energy to force two Hydrogen atoms together. So at room temperature, it won't be possible due to conservation of energy.</p>
<p>Edit: of course, due to energy distribution in gas, some pair <em>may</em> have enough energy for that, but it's <em>extremely</em> unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except that the Maxwell-Boltzmann-Distribution doesn't sufficiently explain the rate at which protons undergo nuclear fusion at a given temperature. The way we account for that is using the wave function and the effect called quantum tunneling which is being explained in this thread.</p>
<p>This graph explains it a bit better:</p>
