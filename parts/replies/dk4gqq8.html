			<div class="markdown"><p>The first recorded SUCCESSFUL transfusion was between two dogs performed by Richard Lower in like 1660 or something. Then people started giving lamb's blood to people. That went poorly frequently, so it was outlawed. Then they tried again (years later with human to human transfusions) and it worked. People discovered blood types and bob's your uncle. </p>
<p>Fun fact: they also tried transfusing (infusing?) other shit too... like milk. That also went poorly, as you can imagine. (source: I used to run a veterinary blood bank and am a veterinarian)</p>
<p>edit: more clarity </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, humans can receive lamb blood?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People have been attempting blood transfusions since at least the 17th century, but it wasn't until the late 19th century that any were successful. Even then, that was mostly luck. In the early 1900s scientists discovered the ABO blood group by mixing red blood cells and serum from different people and seeing agglutination. This discovery is generally credited to Karl Landsteiner, but others hit on the same discovery around the same time. </p>
<p>The discovery of ABO and serocompatibility opened the door to safe transfusions and the invention of anticoagulant storage solutions led to blood banking. </p>
<p>If the scientific community had ever thought transfusions were outright impossible we wouldn't have ever figured out how to make them safe, because we would have stopped trying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, kind of, with varying degrees of usefulness. The quickest and dirtiest way would be to replicate the early experiments that Landsteiner et al did back in the early 1900s: prick your finger, squeeze out a drop of blood onto a non-porous surface, like a piece of glass. Prick someone else's finger, squeeze out a drop of blood next to the first drop, then mix them together. If the blood starts to clump up (agglutinate), there's a blood group incompatibility, likely in ABO. </p>
<p>If you have access to a safe method of venipuncture and a centrifuge, you can draw blood into an anticoagulant, spin the sample down to separate the red blood cells from the plasma, then combine red cells from person A with plasma from person B and vice versa and look for agglutination.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/WUwA3" target="_blank">Here's a graphic I made for a talk</a> illustrating the outcomes of different ABO cells and plasma combinations. </p>
<p>Briefly: People will make the antibody to the ABO antigen they don't have. People who are type A make anti-B antibodies. People who are type B make anti-A antibodies. People who are type O make both anti-A and anti-B. People who are AB make neither anti-A nor anti-B antibodies. If you mix the plasma from a person who is type O with the cells of a person who is A or B, they will clump. If you mix cells from the O person with plasma from an A or a B, they <em>won't</em> clump, because the O cell has neither A nor B antigens. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so, say you have tons of people on a deserted island, and they have the basic stuff to do transfusions, but no blood tests, is there away to find compatible blood types, without fancy equipment?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blood mixing experiment I described elsewhere in this thread is the quick and dirty way to test compatibility, and it's basically how early transfusion safety was tested. You wouldn't need any fancy equipment and it would probably be enough to get you through an emergency in your desert island situation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Some of the earliest cases of blood transfusion were actually done in the 1600s. There are accounts of a man studying blood bleeding a dog nearly to death, then transfusing the blood back to him and watching him become well. In humans, there were at least a couple of incidents where sheep blood was given to humans as well. Of course, trial and error. If I remember right, the field was abandoned briefly after more error than success, and then returned to in the 1800s.</p></div>		</li>
