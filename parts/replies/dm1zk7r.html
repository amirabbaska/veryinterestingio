			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that single blades are more efficient is a little simplified. Efficiency increases with diminished returns as the number of blades increases. The turbulence is only a single factor in a more complex equation that defines wind turbine efficiency, and is also a function of rotational velocity.</p>
<p>A wind turbine has a specific rotational velocity for peak efficiency, this velocity decreases as you increase the number of blades. The velocity you want your turbine to turn needs to balance gearbox efficiency, efficiency of the generator (which needs to output 50hz AC) and noise as well.</p>
<p>Balancing all these factors leads to either 2 or 3 blade turbines being best suited for electrical generation, however 2 blades machines have issues with yawing the blades causing cyclic imbalance that the asymmetry of 3 blade designs negate.</p>
<p>Some in the industry favour 2 blade designs for offshore use where noise is less of an issue (they have to spin faster) and the lighter weight makes the installation easier. I believe China are investigating in some gargantuan 2 blade turbine farms for offshore use.</p>

<p>A note about western US water pumps. These pumps favour much lower rpm, high torque turbines driving them, which the high number of blades grants over a much smaller disc diameter. For electrical generation where you need to output a 50/60Hz AC current, the 3 or 2 blade designs are better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>for the same surface area, slim blades and slim wings have lower induced drag at low speeds. this is why gliders have really long, slim wings too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blades have a small chord, but large span.  The span is large because power generation increases like R^4.  It's super important to sweep out a large area with your blades.  What limits size is trying to avoid supersonic wing tips, manufacturing ability, and the local site wind speed.</p>
<p>Back in 2008 when I did some wind turbine manufacturing work, a very large blade was 43 m.  There are now offshore blades that are double that.</p>
<p>So why a small chord to make the blade look skinny?  A long chord would increase skin friction drag creating separated flow leading to local stall.  When enough of the blade/wing stalls, your power generation dies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They occasionally ship parts of wind turbine blades by truck on the highways near here at night and they are easily 100 feet long, and it's not even the whole blade. It's like a third of a blade. They get escorted by about a half-dozen vehicles with flashing yellow lights because they're so ridiculously huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't completely comment on the slim blade but my most educated guess would be, they are that slim in order to cut down on the amount of turbulence they create in order to not interfere with the other blades.</p>
<p>As for the flatter design, no, no it wouldn't. The blades are sloped like they are in order to produce the most rotation possible in the wind, kind of the opposite to a ceiling fan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have your efficiency ordering backwards.</p>
<p>The most efficient propeller/jet engine/wind turbine has infinite blades that have a very large radius.  More blades=less lift/thrust per blade=less induced drag (drag due to lift/thrust) = less tip losses= less total disturbance to the flow.</p>
<p>Regarding the wake, the wake is downstream, so the blades don't interact directly with the wake.</p>
<p>So why 3 blades? There is a tradeoff on cost vs efficiency, so you'll see some 8 or 12 bladed propellers and many more &quot;blades&quot; on the compressor/turbine stages of a jet engine (like 100+).  </p>
<p>For a wind turbine, the blade are so large that the cost a lot and the increase in efficiency isn't worth it.  You'd also need bigger brakes and require more wind speed to generate power.</p>
<p>There are even 2 bladed wind turbines. </p></div>		</li>
