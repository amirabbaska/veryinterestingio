			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Canada. 50-60 is a nice spring day. Easily t-shirt and shorts weather. </p>
<p>In the winter time I get so acclimated to the cold that when the temperature goes up to -5 - 0 C (23 - 32 F) I can go out in jeans and a long sleeve shirt and be perfectly fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>in that weather i have a 1 hour exposure limit at those temps.  but if i'm moving and being active it can be extended all day.  i moved to a cold climate from a warm one, and i had to acclimate,  but after the first year;  all my visitors would be bundled up and shivering and i'm in shorts and t shirt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a person who spends their life indoors in a temperature controlled environment, it is possible for a person in wet clothing to suffer from exposure. Several generations of people living outside can do wonders for acclimatizing a people. I know several people here who work outside and wear shorts and t-shirts year-round. They put on rain gear when its really wet out, but mostly they are just very active and very used to the weather. My son wears nothing but shorts (no shoes) while playing outside from May to September. Its really not bad weather here once you get used to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't answer his question, it only provides a new historical reference from a region and climate that is very different from the examples he gave. </p>
<p>I have my own opinions on the matter but that's all they are, so instead I chose to present the most relevant information I could recall reading. I am looking back to this thread with hope that someone else has a more qualified answer!</p></div>		</li>
