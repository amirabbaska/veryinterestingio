This is pretty much how all toothed whales and dolphins have evolved. Some of them even kill things for fun (bottle nosed dolphins routinely &quot;play&quot;  harbor porpoises to death).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Orcas have been documented inducing tonic immobility in Great White Sharks (biting and grabbing them and rolling over to make the shark upside down; sharks can't breathe when they are upside down).
They are bigger, fiercer and more intelligent than Great Whites. But somehow they don't get the savory reputation of the Great White.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually; tonic immobility itself does not cause the shark to be unable to breathe. It is the lack of forward motion that causes them to suffocate. Many species of shark rely on obligate ram ventilation to breathe, which means they MUST be in forward motion to get fresh oxygen-rich water flowing over their gills. Flipping the shark over induces a state of immobility, and these species then drown because they are not moving forward. This would not work on species like the Nurse Shark; who use buccal pumping to breathe</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely because sharks kill people. Not saying it's super common but it does happen. A great white killed a man in 2012 in Cali. Wheras Orcas do not kill people. There is no reports of wild orcas killing anyone, only 1 confirmed report of a wild orca biting someone and a couple where they did something showing aggression but could have been playing as well (wave washing boats/ice flows). Obviously that all goes out the window when we talk captive orcas.</p></div>		</li>
