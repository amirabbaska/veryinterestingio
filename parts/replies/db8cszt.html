			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of that is what has been given as reasoning for the conclusion that it was the Russian government.  They have said that the methods and motivations are in line with the Russians.  That is not proof that it was the Russians, though.  Neither is a cyrillic keyboard, or an originating Russian IP address.  Also, the analysis of the implant left on the DNC's workstations showed it was amateurish, and probably not developed by a nation state.</p>
<p>In short, according to the publicly available knowledge, we don't know it was the Russians, we just suspect it was the Russians.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of unrelated to the original question but.. Didn't the most recent CIA report conclude it was indeed the Russians? Via the cyber espionage talked about here AND undisclosed sources? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also work in the field and have looked into this, and there were some very clear indicators it was tied to two Russian APT groups: the malware used was unique to them and used in other hacks knows to be tied to these groups, data was exfiltrated to known servers associated with these groups, there were cryptographic keys used that only these groups possess the private keys for, and there were other tools used that are unique to these groups. </p>
<p>Oftentimes organizations have packet capture set up so they can replay network traffic like a DVR, and they may also have endpoint tools that can detect malicious activity and capture forensic information that allows investigators to reconstruct what happened. </p>
<p>I'd say most security focused organizations over 500 employees have something like this or are looking into it. The technology is around, but your average layperson hasn't heard of it. </p></div>		</li>
