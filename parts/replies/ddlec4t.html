			<div class="markdown"><p>A better term might be cosmetically unsaleable. </p>
<p>There is nothing unsafe about a steak that's been in a retail case for three days and has a brown spot. Many grocery stores choose to grind instead of discount as a steak because it cannibalizes the sale of unblemished steaks. </p>
<p>You legally have seven days to retail beef once its out of cryovac. Most large chains retail as a steak for three to four days, grind, then have another three days to sell as ground before they claim a loss and toss it. </p>
<p>Beef as a steak or roast is remarkably hearty and takes over a month at refrigeration temps to become truly rancid, well beyond what you would ever retail something at. </p>
<p>Lastly no-one is that sketchy in the retail industry to intentionally risk customer health, its an instant death sentence, look how much money chipotle has lost in the past two years for small norovirus and ecoli outbreaks.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We only dated ground for a single day. (Ground = TODAY, Sell by = TODAY.)</p>
<p>&quot;Expiring&quot; to us means &quot;Sell by date.&quot;  It's still good for 2-3 days after &quot;sell by date.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>take the steaks that were expiring for sale that day,</p>

<p>If they are expiring that day, how long can they last as ground beef?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Big grocery stores can only keep cut steaks for one day in the counter. At least that's how Kroger was when I worked there in the meat dept. </p>
<p>We never ground whole steaks though. After 1 day we put them in trays and put them out on the wall for another day. If they didn't sell then, we tossed them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah where I'm a butcher our ground beef has 2 days on its shelf life and nothing gets mixed in with less than 2 days to that... At least while I'm there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We only dated our ground for that day only.</p>
<p>But, ground beef should not be kept more than 2-3 days, tops.</p></div>		</li>
