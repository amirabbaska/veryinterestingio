			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned earlier, oscillometric blood pressure monitors measure the oscillations of the blood vessels. These signals are very small and need to be amplified. this means they are susceptible to noise from movement and EMI. They also estimate systolic and diastolic pressure based on an algorithm, which has its own accuracy issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why the doctor or nurse asks you to remain silent for the duration of the test?  When they don't know or don't care and start to talk to me, I just signal &quot;one moment&quot; with my finger because that my throw my test off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah exactly. Remaining calm will give you a better reading. When I test the machines I have to run them a bunch of times and take an average of the readings. They vary a bit, but in general they are pretty close given the error inherent in the manual method. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they're measuring your blood pressure by manual manometry, they ask you to be quiet so they can hear the Korotkoff sounds (the sounds made when your artery is partially occluded and the blood flow is turbulent).</p>
<p>Supposedly, talking, sitting with an unsupported back, sitting with crossed legs, etc. can also increase your blood pressure somewhat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but by noise I mean electrical noise as well as physical movement. Because the device measures oscillations it can pick up minute movement in the skin and muscles. Or, for instance electrical noise from ECG leads. Actual audio noise is the drawback of the auscultatory (sphygnomanometer) method. Or, your doc gets old and can't hear the Korotkoff sounds like they used to. From my understanding (Biomed Tech) both of these are fine for routine blood pressure tests. If you're in serious condition, or need continuous monitoring, then they will use an invasive blood pressure monitor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Automatic blood pressure machines also have a wide failure rate with irregular heartbeat disorders such as atrial fibrillation or more benign irregularities. If a machine shows an odd value I always take a pressure manually just to make sure.</p></div>		</li>
