			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of the problem here is assuming <em>everyone</em> is worrying about just one thing. We have a lot of different people worrying about many many different things from short term to long term.</p>
<p>For example, Yellowstone will be a problem one day, but most people in our lifetime probably shouldn't worry much about it. There are a dozen other local disasters everyone should worry about.</p>
<p>For example, I live in the Salt Lake Valley, which is pretty much adjacent to the Wasatch Fault. That's gonna be catastrophic (and probably in the next 50 years.) People need to prepare for those too.</p>
<p>People are thinking about how to make our deserts and oceans more habitable - but some people are also thinking about Mars. And some of those people are thinking about both, since the disciplines do cross.</p></div>		</li>

<p>what if a meteor strikes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if meteor strikes, and at the same time nuclear war breaks out, and deadly pandemic spreads, Earth will still be by far the most hospitable place to life known to us. So, instead of building a bunker on Mars, why not just build one on Earth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's happened all of one time in the entire history of the planet and it created the moon. The solar system has settled down since then, massive asteroids don't just appear out of nowhere to destroy the earth any more. Destroy cities or small countries? Sure. Actually change the earth so much it'd be less habitable than Mars? No, just not going to happen. The real threat is climate change which luckily going to Mars could help, what with advanced renewable energy technology for example</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why not build a bunker on Earth and Mars?  Something catastrophic happens on one and the other can help rebuild the one that was destroyed.</p>
<p>Plus building on Mars gives you better practice for if we ever want/need to go further out.</p></div>		</li>
