			<div class="markdown"><p>So to relate this to an earlier post a couple weeks ago...
People who smoke a lot of weed; the article said that people who smoke weed daily don't enter the REM stage of sleep and the body tries to make up for it once the person stops.
So do people who smoke a lot of weed not get this problem very often?</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. Cannabis <em>reduces</em> REM. It doesn't eliminate it. This means the person still enters REM, just the total amount is reduced.  So someone who smokes weed, will still experience morning wood... it's just the amount and likelihood is reduced. Once a person stops weed, then there is a REM rebound (i.e. sudden increased in REM sleep). </p></div>		</li>

<p>ED and low sex drive are very different problems. One is whether your car runs. The other is whether or not you want to go for a drive. </p></div>		</li>
