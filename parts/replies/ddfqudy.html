			<div class="markdown"><p>This is partly true, but it's also the case that animals <strong>do</strong> get sick from eating raw/spoiled food and drinking contaminated water. Wild fish are sometimes so full of parasites that the extent that it impacts the quality of the meat, even though it's safe once cooked. Moose get brainworm, deer get CWD and most mammals can get giardia. Domestic dogs and other pets are often treated constantly for parasitic worms as a preventative measure, feral and wild populations are often infected with those diseases. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes of course there are enough diseases animal catch. I did not want to imply that they are immune to everything. What i meant was that they are immune to the most common food infections like salmonella, staphylococcus, norovirus, camphylobacter and some more. There is nearly no way to become immune to parasites though as far as i know.</p></div>		</li>
