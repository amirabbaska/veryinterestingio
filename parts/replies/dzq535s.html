			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, Chem101 is super intro-level, reserved for topics that <em>do</em> have more depth to them but best kept on hold for advanced courses so as to not overwhelm the budding chemist. We don't want to frighten the students <em>too</em> much. It took me a separate Inorganic Chemistry course to explain the detailed nuance of nuclear interactions.</p></div>		</li>
