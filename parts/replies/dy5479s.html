			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey buddy. Mind dosing this Lovenox, Vancomycin, and Kcentra for me? Those were always a joy in the hospital. Also, another patient's INR is 3.4 on 5mg Coumadin and he's 130kg. Thanks! (Former hospital pharmacy tech here)</p>
<p>I guess further simplifying this, dosing can be complicated on a number of drugs (see above). </p>
<p>If the drug itself has shown a variation of effectiveness when given at the same strength between patients of dissimilar weights, then it would be dosed on weight if the weight can be reasonably established as the cause for the variation.</p>
<p>This (usually) occurs in drug testing during clinical trials, so once this general rule is established during testing, it's used as standard reference. I did drug development research for a bit, but I wasn't hands-on with the clinical trials so this might be a bit oversimplified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the higher strengths it is more uncommon (but not <em>that</em> rare) to have an INR higher than 2, which is obviously not ideal. Usually they were because the patient had started on a new medication that interacted with Coumadin (and I swear, like half of the meds we used interacted in one way or another) and we'd adjust their dose accordingly. </p>
<p>The highest I ever saw was 11.2 on a patient, somehow he had gotten an antibiotic (Levaquin) from his PCP that was absolutely contraindicated. He came in because he (naturally) felt like crap.</p>
<p>Yeah, he got Vitamin K immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For kids, yes. For adults, it's typically a flat dose. Azithro is a flat 250mg or 500mg daily no matter if you're 100lb or 600lb as an adult.</p></div>		</li>
