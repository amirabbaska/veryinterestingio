			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on Claravis and to avoid this exact scenario I have to use two forms of birth control at all times until a month after my last dose, I have to get my blood tested monthly and I have to have a pregnancy test monthly, and before I can pick up my prescription every month I have to show through a test over the phone that I understand the terms of participating in the program.They take that stuff extremely seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus after all that, every 10 capsules comes in a cardboard portfolio plastered in warnings about all the birth defects, with another CVS-receipt-length folded up paper with warnings. Each capsule is behind a tiny, crossed-out silhouette of a pregnant lady and then another layer of foil. PITA to get them out. Just one month of capsules takes up an entire plastic shopping bag due to all the warning packaging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I have a dedicated old prescription bottle sitting in the kitchen so once a month I can spend ten minutes with a pair of scissors to free all of them from those damn blister packs and I can just dump out pills as I need them.</p></div>		</li>
