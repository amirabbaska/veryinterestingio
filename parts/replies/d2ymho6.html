			<div class="markdown"><p>i've always wondered: do star systems keep their angle as they proceed around the galaxy, like some kind of gyroscope? (so, if there was a distant galaxy that the sun's pole pointed at, would it still be pointing the same way by the time it's on the other side of the galaxy?) thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, yeah. There's not much to provide a torque to change the orientation, unless a passing star happened to get very close, and that would be more likely to scatter things randomly rather than adjust the orientation of the star system as a whole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probable the angle varies to some degree.  Just as earth doesn't always point to the North Star (we wobble on a 26,000 year cycle, just like a spinning top does.), our solar system kind of undulates up and down through the plane of the Milky Way.  It's highly unlikely that our solar system is always perpendicular to a single fixed point. </p>
<p>I want to include links to what I described, but can't find them right now on mobile. If someone could help, please do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The random set up of other solar systems is a big factor in our current hunt for extrasolar planets too. The transit method of planet detection only works on some stars because if they are arranged flat side on to us their planets never transit the star with respect to our viewpoint. </p></div>		</li>
