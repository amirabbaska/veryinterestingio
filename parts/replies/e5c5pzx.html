			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. Thrusting radially outwards doesn't really change the period - it makes the orbit more or less eccentric. If they push upwards (radial out) the station has to move downwards (radial in) with the opposite momentum. So its orbit ahead is lower. However, the forward speed of the station didn't change, so to make up for it the orbit behind the station goes to a higher altitude. This different orbit will have pretty much the same average altitude but will start to drop relative to the original orbit.</p>
<p>Of course the crew couldn't impart much momentum and they'd soon cancel it out again by hitting the nadir side of the station. Still, they would momentarily cause the station to drop - that is, move into a orbit that is lower in altitude ahead, but higher behind. Once they re-contact the other side, they'd counteract the change and put the station back on its old orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right I used the wrong terminology, I blame the lack of nicotine and poor sleep. Meant providing thrust inward and outward or radially would change the ellipse of the orbit in relation to the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving up and down would certainly change the apoapse and periapse but wouldn't change the period. Moving forward or back would change the attitude 180 degrees later as well as the period.</p>
<p>Is there a /r/shittyorbitaldynamics sub? Because I see a lot of questionable orbital physics on here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I messed up, I posted further down, a guys wall of text he responded to me with, I used the wrong term I was tired. Radial thrust rotates the apoapse and periapse. Or the Phasing of an orbit.</p></div>		</li>
