			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with the other user, this was an awesome answer. Iâ€™m still kind of confused over what the diplomats do, but I at least understand the gesture a little better. </p>
<p>Do diplomats lobby essentially for different political action? Sanctions, tariffs, etc? Or do they do other stuff?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diplomats do tons of different stuff. The handle all the interactions between the two countries involved. Visas, citizen issues abroad, international legal issues, import/export stuff, media contact, etc.</p>
<p>Ejecting a bunch of diplomats makes everyone else at the embassy have to work harder, and usually results in some services being cut. That hampers travel, business, and everything else the embassy facilitates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do a lot of what you say - lobby, represent the home country's business interests, and generally do administrative stuff.  But they also do other stuff, and one of these is espionage.</p>
<p>Intelligence services will use diplomatic cover as a pretense for a person's position in another country, and to provide a degree of immunity if they get caught doing naughty things, like recruiting a network of intelligence assets whose information they can pass on.</p>
<p>Unless things are really bad, you don't reveal to the other nation that you know who their spies are, you don't kick down doors and arrest them.  You don't even let them know how much you've penetrated their network, as this could give them an idea of <em>how</em> you managed to achieve this.</p>
<p>It's much better for the opposition to think that they've got a nice ring of spies in your country, feeding lots of juicy and salacious information back home when it is in fact nonsense.  And I use the word 'opposition' rather than 'enemy' because all nations spy on each other, to some degree or another, even allies.  Publicly identifying and expelling another country's spies is a big deal because you've given away a bit of what you knew in the first place, can no longer monitor or make use of the network they'd set up beforehand, and puts pressure on them to try to establish new networks - with perhaps greater success.</p>
<p>So, when a country has a mass expulsion of diplomats like this, expect a proportion of those <em>(and I make no guesses if this is 1% or 100%)</em> to be spies, and for this to be seen as an escalation. </p>
<p>It's a big deal.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of that.  It's also the conduit for negotiations.  It makes big news when POTUS signs an agreement with the president of another country for, say, a trade deal or a military alliance...but that negotiation didn't take place the same day as the treaties are signed.  That negotiation has taken months, maybe years, of back-and-forth between the two countries.  The diplomats are the people who make that negotiation happen.  They're given the positions of their leadership, then hammer out a deal (&quot;We're willing to yield on these points, we absolutely won't give up these other points&quot;, etc).</p>
<p>Anytime you see a news story talking about how &quot;Washington is in talks with the UK/France/China&quot;, it's probably diplomats doing the talking.</p></div>		</li>
