</blockquote>
<p>It absolutely is correct. You are just using the word to mean something different than they do. </p>
<p>When someone says &quot;the internet is decentralized&quot;, they are speaking in the context of the original design purpose of the internet. There is no single point of failure that can bring the internet down. No natural disaster or enemy attack can bring it down. You can bring down specific sites, and you can make it so certain people may not be able to get access, but the network as a whole continues to function.</p>
<p>The point that /u/Adrian_F made is absolutely true, but as he notes, there are also significant downsides to decentralizing like that. People have been experimenting with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_community_network" target="_blank">community WiFi networks</a> for probably 15 years now, but they haven't caught on widely because they aren't the panacea that they first seem.</p>
<p>Mesh networks do have their place, and one of the biggest is dealing with the exact sort of disaster than might bring down one part of the internet. For example, a government crackdown might block access to the network, but if even one person knows a back door and can set up  a VPN that the government can't spy on, then that mesh network can allow everyone to use it. </p>
<p>But you can probably already see the problem... If everyone is using that one connection, it will be slow as molasses. But how is that different from the Mesh network you are suggesting? Sooner or later, your packets still need to get on the backbone, unless you are only trying to access data that is already in your local community. But if 80% of the people in your neighborhood only have the mesh and not a backbone connection, your connection will be slower than sin. </p>
<p>And keep in mind what happens when one of the people in the mesh throws a temper tantrum and does a DoS attack, bringing the entire network down... </p>
<p>No thanks, I'll stick to my &quot;undecentralized&quot; high speed connection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally the connection would simply reroute as there are more paths to the destination. But that's what I meant by saying a large amount of participants is needed because otherwise you run into this exact problem as the nodes would be too sparce. </p></div>		</li>
