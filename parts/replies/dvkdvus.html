<p>Just a minor comment: we definitely have memory of multiple instances of the same sound, and we can compare. We know how voice, or breathing, or a pen hitting the floor, sound. </p>
<p>What you are describing is much more evident when the sound is unusual, or doesn't have any interesting harmonic component. Like a beep from an electronic device. In that case it's very hard to tell whether it's close or far away, because we don't know how it is supposed to sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we can compare. I didn't say we can't. My point was that direct vs reflected doesn't require previous experience, it is an absolute perception of distance and one of the most powerful ways we accurately perceive distance because of how reliable it is.</p></div>		</li>
