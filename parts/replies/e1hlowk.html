			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, kinda. As said an alter-ego is more of a chosen identity, Dissociative personality disorder is what used to be called multiple personality disorder - it's more of a fragmentation of personality that the suffer switches between without conscious choice. Someone playing the role of their alter ego know that it is not the &quot;real&quot; them (the superhero is the alter ego and the &quot;hidden identity&quot; is the true identity), someone suffering DPD switches between the two involuntarily and suffers memory lapses from times and events that don't correlate to one or both identities.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some people living double (or more than double) lives enough, cease to assign &quot;real self&quot; to any singular role. Sometimes leading to an identity crisis, more often reassigning it to the nebulous &quot;sum of them all&quot;, and switching faces at will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It boils down to Bruce Wayne // Batman, where the man is aware of both &quot;Identities&quot; and Dr. Jeckyll and Mr Hyde, where they dont exactly have control of who is the dominate personality. That said, due to the childhood trama one can honestly say the same about Bruce Wayne, as he really is so focused on the Batman persona at a certain stage of the series, he doesnt exactly know how to be Bruce any more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another good comparison is Mr. Robot vs Superman (or most any other super hero)  </p>
<p>With an alter ego, it's a conscious choice they make, like Superman putting on a different identity depending on if he is presenting as Superman or Clark.  </p>
<p>However, a show like Mr. Robot, despite perhaps being a bit extreme in order to advance the narrative, shows what it's like for a person to have DID. It's something they can't control, and may even suffer over and seek treatment for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way you frame this makes it sound like people diagnosed with DID are being accused of malingering, which is not the case. </p>
<p>Even experts who are skeptical are not accusing people with DID of malingering. That is not what the controversy is about. The accusation is not that people with DID are &quot;faking&quot; for personal gain, attention, or to get out of trouble. </p>
<p>The actual controversy surrounding DID is that <em>some</em> people in the field feel that DID is not a valid diagnostic category and is not worthy of inclusion in the DSM. They feel that although the experiences and feelings of these people are valid, they would be better of with a diagnosis like PTSD (or CPTSD which has not been recognized by the APA yet but may be included in the next revision), BPD, or a combination of the two. </p>
<p>While there are some cases of people malingering with claims of DID, the majority of people actually diagnosed with DID are survivors of severe childhood abuse. Whether they have DID or would be better off being diagnosed with some other diagnosis, they are obviously in distress. Framing their experiences as &quot;dubious claims&quot; is a very stigmatizing and harmful way to talk about this, and I think we can do better. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you but we should also consider the distinction between what the popular conception of DID thinks it is and what the clinical diagnosis refers to. People usually think of representations like the series and movies e.g.  <em>United states of Tara</em> or <em>Split.</em> When in reality this type of cases are less than a handful in the world and are heavily surrounded by controversy. The average DID case does not look at all like multiple personality and both professionals and non-clinicians would have a difficult time recognizing the disorder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm talking about the people who are not actually afflicted. The popular conception of &quot;multiple personality disorder&quot; is not accurate and people fake having it. Usually younger people. And some who have also survived severe abuse. My point is that there's the real deal and also fakers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dissociation can occur to varying degrees. It's a common coping mechanism for trauma, but it can also be used in more positive ways (&quot;compartmentalizing&quot;).</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while many times features typically associated with certain disorders can present in otherwise healthy people, in order for it to be diagnosed as a disorder, the DSM specifically states that it must significantly impact daily living.</p>
<p>That said, it would not at all surprise me if the substances you took exacerbated any dissociation you might've had into something more serious-- though DID in particular has some pretty rigid criteria and a few key features (like memory issues).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you really abstract the concept of a personality (or alter ego in this case), it can be viewed as a certain set of behaviours which have been selected by the brain while under the influence of certain constraints - hormones, data regarding your life experiences, currently prioritized patterns of thought [neuronal pathways carrying the most bias], etc. These constraints are constantly undergoing change, both chaotically (emotions), and predictably through the results of our chosen actions and thoughts; thus your sober personality undergoes gradual evolution. </p>
<p>Drugs however totally blitz all of this and send these constraints haywire, through shifting them in extreme degrees that would take years to naturally occur. Correspondingly, behaviours will drastically change, as the variables the brain uses to calculate the best course of action are now completely different (and often have values that are impossible to ever reach sober). It appears to me that by taking a drug you indeed experience a change of personality - temporarily.</p>
<p>This explains why afterwards it's hard to remember anything at all from the time spent being high, especially after having taken drugs that affect headspace (psychs) rather than body feeling (opiates). Also explains why drug abuse permanently affects the brain, as the data produced while on drugs is still accumulated (not to mention physical effects). Feel free to ask for/give me some examples, I'm happy to try explain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Drug use can certainly cause dissociation. However, one of the criteria for a diagnosis of DID is that the dissociative episodes are <strong>not</strong> explained by drug use. </p>
<p>Dissociation occurs on a spectrum, with DID on the very end of that spectrum as one of the most severe forms of dissociation. Dissociation caused by drug use a more common experience of dissociation. </p></div>		</li>
