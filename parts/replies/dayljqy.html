			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good explination for the emotional relationship to the whole thing. The key parts being that its is very complicated and hard to fix, and there is no where else like it. We can go to space, we can make versions of habitats that humans could survive in. But the simple but incredibly fucking important fact is, once we fuck this planet up, we wont be able to go back. Some version of life will continue, but probably not one we as humans can survive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy crap that's scary.  I honestly think that any five-year-old who was told that story and understood it would have nightmares for years if not decades afterward.</p>
<p>As bad as that sounds (I don't like children having nightmares more than the next person, I'm not a monster) maybe we should be teaching it this way in schools.  I mean, the thing is that if we don't, they're going to have to face the vast and unforgiving emptiness of space - and facing that scares <em>me</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vivid imagery, I like the metaphor for the complexity of the problem. But wouldn't the 5-year old suggest you get some more candles? It sounds like running out of fossil fuels is the problem, when using them real problem. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I was running out the door and it was the first analogy that came to mind. I really just wanted to portray the chain effect of tampering with one part of a really complicated machine. I think part of the problem with the way global warming is perceived is that people think of it primarily in terms of weather and temperature which makes it seem like something you can solve by adding or removing layers of clothes. There is rarely any discussion or media coverage of the domino effect that has already started and it so massive it will literally effect every living thing on earth by the time the climate resolves to whatever the &quot;new normal&quot; may be (a process that will likely take more than a few generations).</p></div>		</li>
