			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, shingles is no joke. I had <em>the most</em> intense burning/irritation on the entire right side of my torso, hip to armpit. There was no rash, no reddening of the skin, no bumps, nothing to tell me &quot;oh hey, maybe you got something on your skin or your clothes.&quot; The skin looked perfectly normal, but was <em>excruciating</em> to the touch. Like the worst sunburn I've ever had or something.</p>
<p>Turns out not only did I win the age lottery, and develop shingles at 33, but I also won the symptoms lottery, and managed to develop all the pain/sensory symptoms of shingles, with no unsightly/disfiguring rash.</p>
<p>Lucky me!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES omg. I was 25 years old, I was young too like wtf?! I barely had a few red dots here and there on my skin but the burning sensation and sometimes stabbing pain sensation was horrible. I feel ya. I couldn't wear a bra top of it, it was unbearable. Eeek. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I ended up having to take some time off work, because I couldn't stand to wear a shirt. Just the feeling of the fabric rubbing against my skin was enough to make me want to cry. Of course, not wearing a shirt was almost as bad - let a stiff breeze blow across the irritated skin, ugh. I had to turn off the fans around the house for a little while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh damn my fiancee has these little bumps under one of his pecs that flare up and go away due to stress and who knows what. Always hurts when stressed, flares up when sick... Now I'm horrified this could be what REALLY happened to him. </p>
<p>Doctors are clueless. We thought it was &quot;just a skin issue&quot; and have been trying eeeeeverything we can think of (including more doctors when we can afford it). The problem is we're almost destitute and his mom did not make it clear that he was fully insured as a kid, adolescent, adult until 26, etc... basically until i met him. He'll be 29 this year, I'm 25. And I'm absolutely not saying the mom is a bad person, just forgetful to an extreme and possibly in need of some meds/therapy after years of protecting my fiancee from his drunk dad's fists when the douchetrain was still around (decades ago).</p>
<p>Fuck, now what if it's dormant shingles?! Or non dormant?! They do flare up but never move, sometimes there are more with a new flare-up... He has had lung pain but no doctor/ ER person can give us an answer. Nothing &quot;looks wrong&quot; inside. They've scarred a bit from coming and going over the years. And hey, they look just like a few chicken pox scars i had (I got it at 12 so a couple of them stuck around) so -___- damn.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep sounds exactly like shingles to me but I'm not a doctor. But its not dangerous. Unless it gets infected or it is located on the head or around the eye it would be a different story but its not her case. Still it is very easily treatable.  Shingles is the virus of chicken pox that is dormant in one of your nerve endings. Almost everybody has it but not everybody develops it later in life. It happens mostly to older people or to very sick people that had their immune system weakened as I mentioned. Nothing to worry about, except for the pain. Omg its a bitch to endure.      </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird, I used to have similar pains (more so it would flare up, and during it filling lungs to capacity would be agonizing for several minutes). Later developed a collapsed lung. Still have no idea if the pains were the &quot;blebs&quot; growing or if it was just coincidence though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, I get these every once in a while.  I thought it was a trapped gas bubble.  Only lasts a few minutes.</p>
<p>What are blebs?  What's growing inside me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to spook ya but that's what they are, gas bubbles. Blebs are air pockets that pass out of the lung and sit between the lung and rib cage. These can sort of form, join and get bigger, and ultimately start displacing organs. That's what a collapsed lung (or pneumothorax, if you plan on seeing a doctor) is. </p>
<p>Again, not certain the pains and lung were connected.</p></div>		</li>
