			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a side job working in a winery tasting room. It's incredible the number of people who'll smell a wine and say &quot;It's sweet&quot;. Sorry, you are not smelling sweetness - you're smelling aromas that are associated with sweetness (berries, apple, pear, apricot, peach, honey, melon, etc.).</p>
<p>They will taste the wine, and when it's a red, will immediately realize it's bone dry. With some whites, some will still insist it's sweet, even though we know from the lab tests the residual sugar is negligible.</p>
<p>Our brains trick us all the time.</p>
<p>EDIT: In the U.S., a lot of the mass-produced whites and reds actually do contain significant residual sugar, which is part of the reason why they are successful including with folks who are not wine connoisseurs. Pretty much everybody likes sugar. Appreciating really dry wines is an acquired taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you're 6 (in which case I compliment you on your communication skills), you've gone through this for a ton of different foods, but you've already forgotten about it. You are probably enjoying foods as a grown-up that at some point you hated as a kid. There are tons of people who hate anything with alcohol in it until they are teenagers (or sometimes older). Many folks who can't stand tonic water or arugula or even coffee until they're adults. And so on. Wine is just another one of those things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the exact opposite :/ my girlfriend loves sweet wines and would drink a sugary faux flavored moscato for dinner ever night if she had it. I'll take the most bone dry chianti I can find and enjoy the hell out of it every time. I'll drink other stuff but chianti and Sangiovese grape wine is the only wine I actually really enjoy. Pinots and blends come a close second, though. </p>
<p>I was brought up without any soda/sugar/sugary foods and drink, though, and she was the opposite. Kinda funny, how environment and associations we make really shape our preferences and taste buds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man. The &quot;wetness&quot; feeling when you're not actually wet. It's just heat energy leaving your hands or whatever at a similar rate that cool/cold water would do so. You rub the spot like 38 times to make sure it's not wet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Vanilla doesn't smell sweet. It smells like vanilla. Your brain associates vanilla with sweetness, so you think it smells sweet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why do other things smell sweet that we know tastes bad? A flower for example can smell very sweet and we have no reason to associate flowers with sweetness. Or perfume.</p></div>		</li>
