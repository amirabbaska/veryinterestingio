<p>The thought of a car screaming down a motorway with only the air pressure inside the tire preventing it all coming apart was a little disconcerting.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>A tire is already made of rubber, which is a common material to make a seal out of. Just pressurize the tire, and it will lock into the rim and create a seal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(To expound...) The only advantage to an inner tube is having a separate layer, but modern tires have many layers. Literally every tire sold (for normal consumer use) is a &quot;steel-belted radial&quot;. Yet, the term &quot;radial tires&quot; is something people have heard of because they didn't used to all be radial tires. edit: According to wikipedia, no car tires were radials until 1946, and not standard on any car until 1970. /edit This design is far superior to having an inner-tube, which amounts to one more non-radial layer.</p>
<p>Plus, if you do get a flat in, say..., Crook City, South Dakota, you'd not only need to find a replacement tire of the right size, but a matching inner-tube. I have memory as a child walking the highway because of no spare inner-tube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One reason that many car tires don't use tubes, besides additional cost, is that the friction between the tube and tire at high speed causes a lot of heat, and the rubber in inner tubes, which have to stretch a lot, degrades quickly in the heat.</p>
<p>Additionally, because the tube valve rubs on the hole in the wheel, it will often fail there.</p>
<p>If you are worried about the bead, try to take a flat tire off the wheel. The bead is stretched steel cables, tightly gripping the rim. It takes powerful force to get it to come off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason they do this is because of the cost to the manufacturing process. Watching an assembly kit in a car factory is stunning to watch. The tyre is blown up in under 2 seconds each time. They do this by placing a tube over the side wall top and bottom, then apply pressure from the top. It inflates the tyre, and then seals it at the same time. No one touches the valves until it needs some sort of service after manufacture. The rest of the process is very clever, and probably standard across all car producers these days. But I don't know how much trouble I would get into by explaining it publicly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But when they change the tire they obviously don't blow the rubber onto the hub.  So what is going on here? Is the seal less effective after this?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Former Tire Industry of America certified trainer for Michelin. The #1 cause of non puncture related air loss is bead leaks. The bead seat (lip of the rim where this section of tire sits) is not exactly air tight. Most shops use a sealer upon installing new tires to help this. However that little gap between the tire and rim collects water, salt and debris. Here's the kicker, as a whole the tire industry dealt with bead leaks significantly less during the steel rim era. Rate of bead leaks increased with the introduction of aluminum alloy rims. Alloy rims are notorious for bead leaks. Oxidiation and pitting becomes a HUGE problem on alloy rims after a couple years, more often than not requiring the replacement of the wheel itself. Definitely something for people to consider before they dish out that extra several hundred bucks for those fancy rims at the dealership. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question: if my tire loses about 5 psi/week, is that possibly a bead leak? The tire was previously fixed for a puncture, but I brought it back and they said the plug was fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so that &quot;plug&quot; is probably not fine. Resin plugs have actually been outlawed in some parts of the country because a resin plug is by no means a safe fix for on road use. If however you have a two piece plug and patch combo (the material this is made of is impossible to separate if done right and will outlast the tire itself) then it's probably just a bead leak. Have them do a spray or dunk test on the tire. Regardless of the results of that ask them to dismount the tire, then wire brush and seal the bead for your piece of mind. It's a quick little process and shouldn't cost you more than $12 unless the shop you're at sucks.</p></div>		</li>
