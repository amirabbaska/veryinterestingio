			<div class="markdown"><p>You specifically point out UV radiation, and if I understand it correctly, all electromagnetic radiation produces heat when absorbed.</p>
<p>If we are talking about perception, I think UV radiation is actually not very well perceived comepared to infrared (they are on opposite sides of the visible light spectrum). For example, UV still (readily?) makes it way through clouds, but infrared does not.  We feel cooler under a cloud, and I think this is mainly because infrared is more effectively blocked (yes, it is also true that overall EM radiation is reduced by the cloud.)
Anyways, maybe a pedantic point, but I think specifically pointing out UV radiation is wrong?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically pointing out any particular wavelength or band of EM radiation would be wrong.</p>
<p>How a specific wavelength of light heats an object depends on the wavelength in question (shorter wavelengths carry more energy), the intensity of the source (how many photons it's putting out), and the absorption spectrum of what it's striking.</p>
<p>Infrared doesn't carry all that much energy <em>per photon</em>, but the Sun is an extremely intense infrared source (over the entire IR band, mind - if you look at specific wavelengths, then solar intensity peaks in the blue/violet wavelength). Infrared is also strongly absorbed by water.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet carries more energy per photon, but the Sun's intensity in the UV band isn't as high as the infrared band. Near ultraviolet is also not strongly absorbed by water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point!  the intensity of energy that is proportional to a frequency (e.g. x-ray vs. microwave) and amount of energy that the source is emitting within specific frequency bands makes a difference too.
Thanks for clarification. </p></div>		</li>
