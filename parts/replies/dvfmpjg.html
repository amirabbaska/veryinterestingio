			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. You could jump and fly. You would then actually be at rest, relative to the center of rotation. After a while, air drag will put you back in sync with the rest of the space station and you &quot;fall down&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but you wouldn't be able to hover by running against the spin. in order to run you need traction and as your gravity decreases you lose traction necessary to accelerate yourself forward. </p>
<p>carefully observe what you do when you start walking or running,  you don't start by pushing back, you start by falling forward!  you can't run without gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’d have <em>some</em> gravity until you got near 0g and then when you got close (but still had some traction) you could dive to overcome the rest. You’d probably need some track spikes and a rubber floor but I think you could do it. </p>
<p>The bigger problem is that the rotating ship would have to be very small. Your centripetal (and also centrifugal) acceleration is v^(2)/r.  For a ship giving you effective gravity of 1g that’s 9.8=v^(2)/r   Or   (9.8r)^(1/2)=v.  Let’s say a human can run 10m/s, the max radius is only about 10 meters. </p>
<p>Most likely you’re looking at a radius of 100m bare minimum. That means the velocity for 1g is 31m/s. For reference, a cheetah tops out at an absolute max of about 28m/s or 100km/hr. You’d need a launching device to get you up to speed </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be an issue if you drive against the rotation in a car. But a human should be able to get to speed by occasionally pushing against the ground so my guess would be you can hover.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine this would cause interesting problems for transit in a space station (you couldn't have a standard earth freeway along the inside of the outer ring, for example).</p>
<p>Though that being said, what math would we use to figure out the rate of rotation and radius to simulate earth gravity? I'd imagine it would need to either be fast enough or large enough that you couldn't trivially outrun &quot;gravity&quot; </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The equation is acceleration = tangential velocity^2 / radius = angular velocity^2 x radius. Acceleration would be 1 g (9.8 m/s^2 ), so you can just plug in either the velocity or the radius to find the other. </p>
<p>For example if the radius is 1 km, the, velocity = sqrt( (9.8 m/s ^2) x (1km) ) = 99 m/s, with a period of one rotation every 64 seconds.</p>
<p>Or, if you figure you can run at 5 m/s, then the radius small enough to keep up would be (5 m/s)^2 / (9.8 m/s^2 ) = <em>2.55 meters</em>, with a rotation period of 3.2 seconds - way too small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: Big issue with a fast rotation period/small radius, as I'm sure you know, is the difference between head and foot gravity. Since it's based on radius, your head and feet are at different points along that radius and thus experience different gravity, which (from what we can guess so far) would cause massive issues with blood circulation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you want Earth-equivalent gravity while at rest (your frame of reference) then that rotational velocity is dictated, you can't just choose it. If you can &quot;outrun gravity&quot; at that rate of rotation there isn't anything you can do about it really, increasing the rate of rotation would make everything heavier than it would be on Earth at rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't necessarily NEED Earth-equivalent gravity though. You could probably get away with half gravity and still avoid most of the effects of free fall. I say probably because there aren't exactly a lot of long term studies of humans in reduced gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's another problem you're going to encounter while doing this.  Running requires pushing against the ground in order to accelerate.  As you approach the velocity of the floor, you will experience less and less force from the ground, making you generate less and less force to use to accelerate yourself.</p>
<p>This problem would also exist for a car driven inside a rotating ship.  We could avoid it by using non-ground propulsion like jets or propellers or by using something like a train secured to the ground on rails.</p></div>		</li>
