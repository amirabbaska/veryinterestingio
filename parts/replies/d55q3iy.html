			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the metaphor! Mostly though atoms are empty space (just like galaxies) so instead of dense, it would be quite barren. In order to get to the cells inside the ISS they pass through the solid walls of the craft-right through the empty spaces in the atoms that make up the walls- and so for them the human body would also have plenty of empty spaces to pass through. Actual collisions with nuclei/DNA are quite rare, which is why I spent so many hours trying to find the few cells that had tracks! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats what we're trying to answer. It's well known that DNA breaks are bad, its one of the more serious types of DNA damage. Cells however have evolved responses to deal with this as un-repaired DNA damage of all kinds can kill tissue, induce cancer, etc. In the presence of a DNA strand break, DNA repair molecules will detect the breakage and attempt to re-ligate the strands. If this fails, the cell may arrest/ become senescent or undergo apotosis. If these things don't happen, then the cell may go on to become cancerous.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds so interesting to me. What would you study to get into this kind of stuff? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So most of the people in the group have backgrounds in physics. A lot of the radiation biophysics done at NASA, at least at the Johnson Space center is on the modeling side so its lots of computational type things. For the little subgroup I work in though, its biologists since we look at the effects on cells. My co-workers have PhDs in biology, microbiology, or bio-informatics and for myself my background is in neurobiology, chemistry, and biophysics. </p></div>		</li>
