			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot find a link but there is also a very rare case where a cat cancer transfered to a person with HIV and due to the compromised immune system the cancer lived and spread to seven sites in the patient. I think the doctors believed it to be a new cancer until they worked out what had happened. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HIV greatly increased the possibility of parasite infection and made the cancer possible. So it's not like three completely different diseases developed independently. There may be more people with the same condition, this was the only case where it was found and desribed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And not just any cancer, he got <em>the tapeworm's</em> cancer. That opens a <em>whole</em> lot of freaky doors. Like, &quot;What are the chances?&quot;, &quot;How many non-human organisms <em>are</em> there on or in the average human?&quot;, &quot;How many of those can develop cancer?&quot;, &quot;How many have cancer <em>right now</em>?&quot;, &quot;Isn't cancer really common, just mostly benign?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They injected HeLa cells to sick patients who already had cancer, so they had compromised immune systems. The nodules that formed regressed with time. They also injected the cells to healthy volunteers and the cells were rejected in those volunteers. Even in the lab environment it's not always easy to induce immunocompromised mice with cancer. It's possible, but very difficult to be induced with cancer, especially if you have a healthy immune system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because science. Even for the 1960s, the experiments were pretty horrifying and Chester Southam was reported to the NYS medical board and he was put on probation. </p>
<p>Fun fact, Southam eventually returned to medicine and was elected president of the American Association for Cancer Research, the biggest professional cancer research organization. How's that for justice, eh. </p></div>		</li>
