			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very complicated. Understanding it requires understanding Fourier transformation.</p>
<p>But the gist of it is:</p>
<p>You apply a secondary magnetic field with a field strength that varies in space (gradient field). This means that the signal will vary depending on where in this gradient you are, because the hydrogen spin frequency will be different.</p>
<p>Now depending on the steepness of the gradient, you will be listening to different positions in k-space (the Fourier transformation of an image). It's like trying to figure out a song, but you can only listen to one frequency at a time, and it's visual and in multiple dimensions.</p>
<p>After you've gathered enough data in k-space, you inverse Fourier transform that, and you get an image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The frequency of the atomic resonance (and therefore the frequency of the radio wave) depends on the strength of the magnetic field.</p>
<p>By changing the magnetic field in one part of the scanner, you make the atoms in different places produce different frequency signals which can then be separated out in the receiver using a process called Fourier transformation. </p>
<p>For example, if you strengthen the magnetic field on the right of the scanner and weaken it on the left then you will get a mixed signal back. The signal exactly in tune is from the middle. The signal with higher frequency is ftom the right, and the higher it is, the further to the right it is from. Signal with lower frequency is from the left. </p>
<p>By taking a ton of measurements with magnetic field weakened and strengthened in different directions it becomes possible to reconstruct an image of exactly how much signal came from each point in space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually wavelengths of several meters are used for MRI.</p>
<p>The frequency of the magnetic resonance signal is proportional to the magnetic field strength. So if you use a magnetic field gradient along one direction (e.g. a larger magnetic field towards the head than towards the feet), then you can get a 1D MRI by comparing how much signal (= how many water molecules) you get for each frequency.</p>
<p>For 2D and 3D MRI, you need to switch the radio transmitter and the gradients in all three directions on and off according to specialized sequences. Using the proper sequences you can do really almost magical stuff, like measuring fluid (e.g. blood) flow, or even map out energy consumption across the brain (&quot;functional&quot; MRI, or fMRI).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True say. In my defence I actually have to explain MRIs to 5 year olds fairly regularly - my inner nerd just needed a way to express itself.</p>
<p>For those interested the actual explanation tends to run along the lines of:</p>
<p>We’re going to give you some medicine to help you sleep and then you’ll sleep in a big machine that will look inside you. Isn’t that cool?</p></div>		</li>
