I do the same thing at work, Im very aware that its hilariously insecure. When it fails and its compromised, then its not my problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah at my last job, our job tracking software forced us to change our password every 90 days. I just used the same password, and put a letter on the end, starting with A. I'd just run up through the alphabet, going up a letter each time we had to change it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with a second factor, you should still change your password if there's any chance it has been compromised. The second factor only increases the time before a successful attack. Most 2FAs are just 6 digit one time codes that change every 30s or 60s.</p>
<p>It's not completely infeasible to correctly guess that. An attacker could simply pick a couple of random ones and then just repeatedly try those same codes over time. Chances are that any random 6 digit code will become valid sooner or later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have that and I STILL get made to change my passwords (plural!).  They made me install a key generator app on my phone that I have to enter every time I log in, and I still have to make a new password.  As my own work has close to zero value for any hacker, I find this a bit irritating.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It forces people to keep from using passwords they use in their every day life, It's good to keep them fresh, however some companies make it a bit too hard by remembering your last X passwords, and forcing you to change them often.</p></div>		</li>
