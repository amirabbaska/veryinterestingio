			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you spend a lifetime associating and identifying with the voice you hear through your head. So when you hear this strange voice played back it's a sort of cognitive dissonance.</p>
<p>When I first heard my own voice I thought I sounded dopey. Eventually I got quite used to it, doesn't bother me at all now. I &quot;hear&quot; it when I speak, now that I'm aware of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know I wonder if streamers hate their own voice.  That's why i have a hard time trying to stream or edit videos.  I hear my own, editing and wonder if it sounds that bad when I stream.  If everybody hates it then it must be normal and I need to get over the thought of it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't stream, nor do I know any streamers, but I wouldn't be surprised if they and other broadcasting/acting professionals had the same experience I did.</p>
<p>I can't promise you would, too, but I would be surprised if you didn't. Our brains are great at adapting to new stuff, given enough exposure.</p>
<p>When you get more comfortable in your own voice, that comfort will come out in your streaming and in turn make you a better broadcaster. Keep at it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have a shitty little 10-viewer stream back when I still had good internet and I absolutely hate my voice  although people kept saying that I have a nice and relaxing voice (although whenever I hear myself I get the feeling I sound like a retarded person instead of calming and relaxing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happens with photographs. We are used to seeing ourselves in the mirror and since our faces are not identical on both sides looking yourself on a photo might look off to you. Hence the illusion why you look weird on every photo and your friends look good. Unless you're ugly af, can't help that. That's why front facing cameras show you a mirrored image by default these days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer. If you hear somthing one way your entire lif,e hearing if different would not be that pleasant. It is normal to everyone else. How many people do you know sound weird when they speak?? Not many. So why would you be any different? Its just perception.</p></div>		</li>
