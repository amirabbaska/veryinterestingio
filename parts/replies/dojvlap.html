<p>migraine are often lateralized</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In some senses that is a statement of definition rather than a characterization.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.etymonline.com/word/migraine" target="_blank">http://www.etymonline.com/word/migraine</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>migraine (n.)
late 14c., megrim, from Old French migraigne (13c.), from vulgar pronunciation of Late Latin hemicrania &quot;pain in one side of the head, headache,&quot; from Greek hemikrania, from hemi- &quot;half&quot; + kranion &quot;skull&quot; (see cranium). The Middle English form was re-spelled 1777 on the French model. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arguably one that isn't &quot;lateralized&quot; is not, by the origin and  meaning of the english  word &quot;migraine&quot;, a migraine.</p>
<p>So an  interesting question would be &quot;Are there any headaches having the same physiological basis as a migraine, that are not lateralized?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>huh i never knew that etymology.. migraines are also known to travel from one side to the other, or can be on both sides at once (i.e. lateralized but not unilateral), so there's that... but i don't think lateralization is a necessary feature for something to qualify as migraine (though it is a 'classical' feature).</p></div>		</li>
