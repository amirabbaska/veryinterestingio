			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, the communists had won in China and America certainly did <strong>not</strong> want to do anything that would garner them support or additional influence. While the Soviets and China had been allies of the rest of the Allies <em>during</em> the war, they certainly were not so after the war.</p>
<p>So, their sacrifices were downplayed and Japan's atrocities were ignored largely. Hitler et al didn't get quite the same treatment simply because it would have been very hard to do so and because the world wanted Germany to understand that they weren't going to be allowed to do this world war thing again anytime soon. Besides, there was definitely still the feeling that Europe was important in and of itself while Asia was just economic potential. Well, at least up until the dirty commies started spreading around some.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add, the treatment of Germany by the western allies would also have been a lot harsher, hadn't the Soviet Union / communism been declared main the enemy after the end of the war. There were lots and lots of Nazis who kept their positions in the military, government or secret services, because a functional western German state was more important than bringing those criminals to justice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly... A lot of the atrocities committed by the Japanese included human experiments  much like the nazis, and once Japan lost the war good old murica struck a deal with the Japanese government to swap the human experiment results for a cover up basically... </p></div>		</li>
