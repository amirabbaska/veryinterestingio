<p>Most notably the North Atlantic Drift, which brings warm water up from the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere to the North Sea. That would cause England to become as cold as northern Canada at that latitude, and all but uninhabitable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This &quot;common wisdom&quot; that Europe is unusually warm for its latitude because of the Gulf Stream has actually been heavily questioned in the past decade or two.</p>
<p>Seager, et al., 2002 (<a href="http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/pubs/Seager_etal_QJ_2002.pdf" target="_blank">PDF here</a>) argue instead that Europe's warm climate results from atmospheric flow rather than oceanic flow. The Rocky Mountains set up a standing wave in the eastward-flowing jet stream that first turns south, pulling colder arctic air down over the American Midwest (explaining why it tends to be colder), then turning northwards as it continues east and pulls warm tropical air over Europe.</p>
<p>Then there's Kaspi &amp; Schneider, 2011 (<a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/eserpages/kaspi/publications/Kaspi-Schneider-2011a.pdf" target="_blank">PDF here</a>) that suggest the oceans just act as giant heat sinks, radiating that heat to the eastward-flowing jet stream which then passes over land, so that the western part of any continent will be warmer than the eastern part. This conveniently explains why North America's West Coast (Seattle up to Alaska) is also unusually warm.</p>
<p>In truth, all 3 - Gulf Stream, Standing Atmospheric Wave, Ocean Heat Sink - probably play a role in Europe's warmth, but there's still heavy debate over how much each matters, and it's still far from settled.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And pretty well all of Western Scandinavia, as well as Northern Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and parts of Western Gallia. Weâ€™re talking close to 200M people here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. It feels like the northern latitudes that will get &quot;better&quot; weather due to warming will just continue to see migration there as this goes on.  Will there eventually a norther and southern band of heavy population just far enough from the equator and the poles?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response.  Don't salinity-driven ocean currents work by forming a gradient between different oceans which causes them to mix?  Hypothetically couldn't other contents in fresh water cause a similar effect, especially on a large scale?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effect happens when the sea freezes at the poles, and the newly formed ice crystal spits out the salt molecules. This dense, cold, salty water sinks to the bottom and becomes a giant global ocean current that flows up to the arctic and back - the thermohaline circulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This effect does currently form the bottom water, but the volume of reject salt is small to begin with, compared with volumes of cooled water, and the water underneath is fresher than average, so it doesn't make it down very far in most places.  It's only in a few relatively shallow places that the reject salt collects together and forms bottom water.  So presently the circulation is quite slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably depends more on where the salt comes from.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom is that it came from weathering processes of land rocks, but a recent theory is that ocean water circulates between the ocean itself and the Earth's mantle, and deep down there is where it picks up its salinity. Here's <a href="https://theconversation.com/comets-or-volcanoes-scientists-are-changing-their-minds-about-how-the-earths-water-got-here-73781" target="_blank">a reference</a> of sorts.</p></div>		</li>
