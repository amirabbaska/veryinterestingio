			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the baking soda and vinegar analogy. Technically though, if how quickly the balloon inflates (flow rate) is current, then voltage is actually pressure, not volume. Volume would be charge. You could have a really huge balloon that is only maintains a pressure of 1 psi. It would't produce a fast flow, but it could produce it for a long time. On the other hand, you could have a small balloon with a high pressure. It could produce a rapid flow, but only briefly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, I used to put dead batteries in direct sunlight for hours on end so that when I put them back into my Gameboy Advanced they'd be fully charged again. I was a dumb child, but how does that happen? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat helps speed up the chemical reaction, like a very mild catalyst. Up to a certain point, it will make the batteries seem like they have more charge, but in reality it's just more quickly using what little is left.</p>
<p>It's also not advised to practice this with more volatile battery compositions, like lithium batteries, since they can literally explode in an unquenchable lithium fire. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This does more than just create surface charge to the battery</p>
<p>Dead alkaline batteries crystallize internally, and leaving the battery under near boiling water for a few minutes dissolves the crystals in the battery back into suspension and allows the chemicals to react where the previous chemical interaction wouldn't have happened as a result of a physical disconnect between the reagents. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it have anything to do with temperature? I thought it was because a battery being used heats up and a hotter battery works less efficiently. Once it cools down it can use that little bit that it couldn't when it was hot. Is this way off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a little to do with temperature. The chemical reaction in batteries slows down when it's cold and speeds up when it gets warmer (up to a certain point). This is why your grandparents or parents may refrigerate their unused batteries.</p>
<p>Nowadays, it's not as big of an issue since battery technology has improved drastically over the last few decades, but it still doesn't hurt.</p>
<p>Also, this is why it's harder to start your car in the winter; chemical reaction is slower.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No he's right, batteries have an optimal temperature and have a lower resistance at that temp. Electric F1 actually has battery heaters along side the coolers to maintain optimal temp from lap one till the end</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Contrary to the post you responded to.. Batteries have their internal resistance increase as they drain, while the electromotive force (measured in volts) of the electrochemical stays the same. Heat alters the internal resistance of the cell and can make the battery seem more drained. Internal resistance is also why mechanics talk about &quot;cold cranking amps&quot; when talking about car batteries. It is the amount of restriction to the maximum current of a battery that determines the age of the battery and how &quot;drained&quot; a battery is -- which varies greatly with heat!</p></div>		</li>
