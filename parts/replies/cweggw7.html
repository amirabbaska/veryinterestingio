			<p>&gt; why <br><br>Hardest question in Linguistics.  I had it explained to me once that you can't ask <em>why</em> Rock &amp; Roll means what it does and not &quot;a wig&quot; or something similarly arbitrary.  It just does.  We can analyze what happened, when and how, but <em>why</em> proves to be much more difficult.<br><br>Edit: whelp. Went to class and got gilded.  Thanks, kind benefactor!</p>		</li>

Sometimes when my students would ask me &quot;why&quot; questions the best I could do was &quot;that's just how it works in English.&quot; The odd rule exceptions, like why you have mooses/mice despite mouse/moose ending with the same sound -- I'm sure there's a lengthy explanation, but oftentimes it's better to just remember a rule and move on.<br><br>English really is a mess of a language -- there's a reason why other languages don't have spelling bees.

			<p>our rules do make some semblance of sense.<br>When you remember we've got out language roots from several places.<br>So the rules for one set of words will come from Germanic, the rules for another set come from Anglican, then there are Latin influences and also French I think.<br><br>(this blog explains why moose doesn't follow similar words, such as goose, foot and tooth: <a href="http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/03/plural-moose-meese/" target="_blank">http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2015/03/plural-moose-meese/</a>) <br><br>(this one sort of explains mice and the other odd one 'oxen' it's a little simplistics but eh <a href="http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/what-is-the-plural-of-mouse" target="_blank">http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/what-is-the-plural-of-mouse</a>)<br><br>Basically we beg borrow and steal a lot of words. <br><br>Plus i recall reading somewhere that at some point in ye olden tymes. a bunch of scholars sat down and decided to 'standardise' english spelling. They did this by taking words that were spelled a way that made sense and tarting them up with extra letters and Latin influences to make them sound more fancy. <br><br>For the most part our spelling isn't that bad, and i can generally make a good guess at how a word will be spelled based on hearing it, or how a word will be pronounced based on reading it.<br>Then again i'm a native English speaker and i've been figuring the language out since i was born...</p>		</li>

			<p>Hang on. This is definitely a &quot;it depends&quot; situation. When we refer to &quot;metal&quot; in this context, we're talking <em>heavy metal</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_%28chemical_element%29" target="_blank">Heavy metals</a> include lead, gold, palladium, platinum, uranium, iron, nickel, copper, chromium, manganese, cobalt, gold, silver, neodymium, zinc, arsenic, selenium, silver, antimony, thallium, vanadium, strontium and molybdenum. If we use Mohs hardness scale, these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardnesses_of_the_elements_%28data_page%29" target="_blank">run from</a> 1.0 (thallium) up to 8.5 (chromium).<br><br>If you compare to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohs_scale_of_mineral_hardness" target="_blank">Mohs hardness for rocks</a>, you find they are well interwoven, with even granite only at 6. Above that you're looking at quartz, topaz, and diamonds, which are moving away from what we'd tend to call &quot;rock&quot; (except in slang for jewelry). <br><br>So if we do a full <a href="comparison" target="_blank">Mohs scale</a>, at 6 we have feldspar (rock), titanium (metal), and hair metal (music). At 7 we have quartz (rock), vanadium (metal), and classic/power metal (music). At 8 we have topaz (rock/gem), between tungsten (7.5) and chromium (8.5) (metal), and thrash metal (music). At 9, corundum (rock/gem), titanium carbide (metal), and death metal (music). Finally, at 10, diamond (rock/gem), titanium diboride (metal), and black metal (music).<br><br>So I think metal still qualifies as pretty damn hard. But, I think there's a case to be made that the correct terms are <em>hard rock</em> and <em>heavy metal</em>. The hardest rock is a real gem, and the <a href="http://gizmodo.com/scientists-have-created-the-heaviest-metal-ever-ununse-1571258317" target="_blank">heaviest metal</a> is very decadent, decaying in milliseconds.</p>		</li>

			<p>I went to my first metal show 5 years ago in HS and I remember it being pretty intense, but even recently I went to a Slipknot concert and the pit on the lawn was a joke.<br><br>Real crazy and violent mosh pits have started happening at edm shows, especially with the harder dubstep acts like Excision and Datsik.  It's kinda fucked up tho because no one obeys the mosh etiquette and people just go fucking insane attacking people. I saw a dude get thrown headfirst into a table, then just get back up and start swinging again. A lot of people being on uppers at these shows probably don't help. </p>		</li>

			<p>Actually the origin of metal is via the line &quot;heavy metal thunder&quot; in Steppenwolf's <em>Born to Be Wild</em>. &quot;Heavy&quot; was already being used for amplified, intense music. Several bands had metals in their names and song lyrics (like Iron Butterfly, Led Zeppelin, Iron Claw, <em>Iron Man</em> by Black Sabbath, or <em>Silver Machine</em> by Hawkwind) before the name had really stuck solidly to the genre.</p>		</li>

			<p>not just that it's easily divisible, but also you can count it on one hand (as opposed to needing both hands to count to ten):<br><br>count phalanges (bones between the knuckles) of each finger starting from the palm, and you get 1, 2, 3, 4; 5, 6, 7, 8; 9, 10, 11, and 12. then you can use your other hand to mark the &quot;first&quot; dozen, count another dozen on the original hand, and move your finger on the second hand to the next phalange for the &quot;second&quot; dozen. this way you can count all the way up to 144 on two hands.</p>		</li>

			<p>I know that base 10 is easily explained by saying you have 10 fingers, but base 12 is actually explainable in a similar manner. <br><br>Use your thumb to oppose your fingers when counting. Oppose your thumb and pinky and place it on the fleshy part between the inside of your bottom two knuckles. That's &quot;1.&quot; Then oppose your thumb to the next highest fleshy part (&quot;2&quot;), and then the top fleshy part (&quot;3&quot;). You will notice that there are three fleshy parts in each of the four fingers opposed to the thumb. 3 fleshy parts in each of 4 fingers, 3*4, 12. Thus, the base 12 system.</p>		</li>

All letters used to be capital back before Ye Olde days, then as handwriting became more 'flowey' and cursive, the lower case evolved and they (monks and scribes) would only use capitals when creating the kind of <a href="http://pgomez.dmmdmcfatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/medieval.jpeg" target="_blank">letter art</a> you see at the very start of <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/69/2c/75/692c7500f67e8dcdb6e9b001db33dfa9.jpg" target="_blank">pages</a> and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/KellsFol309r.jpg" target="_blank">sentences</a>. As for proper nouns, that one is likely to have stuck as it actually served a practical function as an identifier.<br><br>With regards to the reason/s behind the phenomenon OP noticed - no effin' idea, sorry. If I had to hazard a guess - lots of language bastardisations occur because of the ease with which things are spoken. Maybe the germanic 'one-left' was easier to say than 'one-ten'? Maybe it flowed better in the sequence? (like if you were counting up, going from ten to eleven was easier than ten to one-ten, and likewise for going twelve to three-ten).<br><br>It could also have something to do with imperial measurements being in dozens. Not quite sure how exactly though (something to do with unique words counted up to the dozen, then for anything more complicated it goes back to the standard system?).</p>		</li>

			<p>This can be related back to German as well; they capitalize all nouns, although not pronouns. Why they do these things, no one knows.</p>		</li>

			<p>And in Spanish, they capitalize hardly anything -- not days of the week, names of the months, etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Ye Olde days<br><br>Another great example of a language change. The first letter in the first word up there was not &quot;Y.&quot; It was called Thorne, so the phrase actually looks like this: √ûe Olde days.<br><br>Thorne was pronounced &quot;th,&quot; so the word sounded just like our modern &quot;the.&quot; However, when people started to use the expression to make things look medieval, thorne no longer existed so they just assumed it was the letter &quot;Y.&quot;</p>		</li>
