			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm, well my research (thanks Google) indicates that the English eleven and twelve, and the German <em>elf</em> and <em>zwölf</em>,  have been traced to <em>ein-lif</em> and <em>zwo-lif</em>; <em>lif</em> being old German for &quot;ten&quot; - not &quot;left&quot;. Comes from <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pg_RKtlVlNMC&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">this book</a>, apparently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><em>ainalif and </em>twalif, from Proto-Germanic, not Old German, the two aren't synonymous; German comes from Proto-Germanic, just like English and Swedish and Gothic do. The Germanic word for ten was <em>tehun. It also had a word for &quot;group of ten&quot;, </em>teguz, the plural of which, *tigiwiz, gives the suffix '-ty' in twenty, thirty, fifty.</p>
<p><em>-lif did indeed mean &quot;-left&quot;, because the o-grade form of that root gives us 'leave', from Proto-Germanic </em>laibijaną, &quot;to cause to stay, cause to remain&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hardest question in Linguistics.  I had it explained to me once that you can't ask <em>why</em> Rock &amp; Roll means what it does and not &quot;a wig&quot; or something similarly arbitrary.  It just does.  We can analyze what happened, when and how, but <em>why</em> proves to be much more difficult.</p>

<p>12 inches to a foot </p>

<p>12 x 5 (60) seconds to a minute. </p>
<p>12 x 5 (60) minutes to an hour</p>
<p>12 x 2 hours to a day (12 light, 12 dark (bonus points for checking feudal Japan clocks))</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know that base 10 is easily explained by saying you have 10 fingers, but base 12 is actually explainable in a similar manner. </p>
<p>Use your thumb to oppose your fingers when counting. Oppose your thumb and pinky and place it on the fleshy part between the inside of your bottom two knuckles. That's &quot;1.&quot; Then oppose your thumb to the next highest fleshy part (&quot;2&quot;), and then the top fleshy part (&quot;3&quot;). You will notice that there are three fleshy parts in each of the four fingers opposed to the thumb. 3 fleshy parts in each of 4 fingers, 3*4, 12. Thus, the base 12 system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same reason English speakers used to capitalise all nouns and pronouns, but now only capitalise proper nouns... with the exception of the pronoun 'I' and the addition of sentence starts.</p>
<p>Because language.</p>
<p>If you really want to know why the aforementioned occurs, it most likely had something to do with the scribes and monks reprinting books. All letters used to be capital back before Ye Olde days, then as handwriting became more 'flowey' and cursive, the lower case evolved and they (monks and scribes) would only use capitals when creating the kind of <a href="http://pgomez.dmmdmcfatter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/medieval.jpeg" target="_blank">letter art</a> you see at the very start of <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/236x/69/2c/75/692c7500f67e8dcdb6e9b001db33dfa9.jpg" target="_blank">pages</a> and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/KellsFol309r.jpg" target="_blank">sentences</a>. As for proper nouns, that one is likely to have stuck as it actually served a practical function as an identifier.</p>
<p>With regards to the reason/s behind the phenomenon OP noticed - no effin' idea, sorry. If I had to hazard a guess - lots of language bastardisations occur because of the ease with which things are spoken. Maybe the germanic 'one-left' was easier to say than 'one-ten'? Maybe it flowed better in the sequence? (like if you were counting up, going from ten to eleven was easier than ten to one-ten, and likewise for going twelve to three-ten).</p>
<p>It could also have something to do with imperial measurements being in dozens. Not quite sure how exactly though (something to do with unique words counted up to the dozen, then for anything more complicated it goes back to the standard system?).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Ye Olde days</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another great example of a language change. The first letter in the first word up there was not &quot;Y.&quot; It was called Thorne, so the phrase actually looks like this: Þe Olde days.</p>
<p>Thorne was pronounced &quot;th,&quot; so the word sounded just like our modern &quot;the.&quot; However, when people started to use the expression to make things look medieval, thorne no longer existed so they just assumed it was the letter &quot;Y.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I think this misses the point of the question. It's why is the whole 11-19 range not from the germanic &quot;one-left&quot;, &quot;two-left&quot; style, or in the teens style.</p>
<p>Its fairly obvious that the two have different etymological origins, but why the split, and why right at 12?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One reason might be aesthetics.  You have 12 numbers that you use all the time so you give each of them a unique name.  Then you have all the other numbers that rarely get used so you just give them a rigid system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I have heard in the past (and idk how true it is) is that the difference stems from the original base 12 number system. This distinction is prevalent in almost all languages that developed in Northern Africa and the Middle East, but is not as common (at all) in Asain or southern African based languages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Norman invasion of 1066 mixed the French speaking Normans with the Germanic Anglo people of the British isles.  </p>
<p>If you think about what the poor Anglo Saxons would have been using to count it wouldn't have been the French numbers.  It would have been the Germanic based numbers.  Now take in to account that they were probably not literate and what's the largest number you think they might use on a regular basis? </p>
<ol>
<li>So we stick with the German backed numbers up to 12 because the merchants had to work with the poor Anglo Saxons and the rich French speaking Normans. </li>
</ol>
<p>Over several generations the language codified with the base 12 sticking to the German base numbers. </p></div>		</li>
