			<div class="markdown"><p>I have occasionally had the rapid eye movement thing. I've also got hearing loss in one ear, was prescribed a hearing aid to compensate (but never wear it). Although diagnosed at 30 I believe I have had this my whole life (doctors said it was most likely fused bones in the outer ear). I also get periods of very temporary hearing loss (sounds like ears are full of water, like after swimming). Is that likely to be Menieres or are there more obvious symptoms that I don't have of the disease. Also, my sympathys for your condition, I'm sure it's not very pleasant. Thanks in advance for the impromptu AMA :) </p>
<p>Edit: corrected eye to ear, as was pointed out it's difficult to lose hearing in one eye. Doh! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 33, was diagnosed at 23. I had minor symptoms like yours for a few years prior.</p>
<p>The hearing coming and going is definitely a thing I had. Each time it goes, it goes further away and never quite comes back. My ENT explained that this is because the fluid (which is why it feels and sounds like water in your ear except is behind the ear drum) is messing up the like hair things.</p>
<p>Menieres as I understand it is that, plus tinnitus (ringing in ear) plus vertigo. The deafness is a nuisance unless you have bilateral menieres (I don't), the ringing is annoying but you learn to ignore it, but the vertigo is life altering. I've gotten in car accidents, thrown up in someone else's car without warning and have had to crawl to a bathroom in a large office building.</p>
<p>So without those other symptoms I dunno if it's menieres.</p>
<p>If it is, sorry to tell you but unless you figure out a way to stop it, the hearing will only get worse. I had a hearing aid too and eventually it was no good because the hearing is so bad in that ear. There is an implant they can do that uses bone conductivity instead of amplification through the ear drum... So it vibrates instead of using a speaker. It bypasses all the usual doodads and goes straight to the bones in your ear.</p>
<p>I opted not to do that because they attach it to your skull and a thing about 1&quot; square sits outside your skin attached to it. Seemed uncomfortable and awkward and I'm kinda used to being deaf... But that's an option if you qualify. It's elective surgery though so sorry if you're an American like me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it started gradually, at about 20 or 21.</p>
<p>The hearing loss came first.  It comes and goes, and each time it goes it goes further away and never quite comes back to where it was.  It looks a lot like an ear infection.  They put me on Amox and steroids a few times and it cleared up.</p>
<p>But each time it comes and goes, it gets a little worse until it compounds and you wind up with total deafness like I have now.  I still register sounds but I have 0 clarity.  That ear can only tell me that a sound happened.  It can't tell me what it was, what it said, or anything like that.  When I have headphones in, I still use both because i can detect the lack of sound on the one side, but if someone talks to me, I only bother taking the good side out so I can hear them.  The other side offers no value.</p>
<p>I'm dizzy 24/7.  Even when I dream, I'm dizzy in my dream.  You get used to it.  If I turn my head, I stumble.  Every time.  That's different than vertigo though.</p>
<p>Rapid eye movements for Menieres, AFAIK but definitely for me, are only present during episodes of vertigo.  The world appears to be spinning during a vertigo attack like mine because my eyes are physically moving around without me telling them to.  I can't override it and even worse, they're moving in ways I can't even physically tell them to - they actually move in a 3 dimensional way.  Someone earlier described it best as &quot;twisting&quot;.  Similar to how your eyes will roll over if you lay on your side (look in a mirror as you lay down - it's weird if you have never done it!). This causes a disagreement in my brain between my eyes and other balance indicators, which my brain interprets as &quot;we're fucked&quot;, and so vertigo, falling down, crawling, nausea, olympic level sweating, panic, fear, hopelessness, crying, wishing for death like the guy in the One music video, etc.  </p>
<p>The tinnitus came gradually through the whole process.  It hasn't gotten worse in a long time and honestly I don't remember when it first started.  It's important to know that tinnitus is not a hearing condition.  You're not &quot;hearing&quot; the sound.  Your brain is inventing it.  One can be deaf and have tinnitus.  The surgery I'm looking in to would sever the hearing nerve between my brain and ear drum, but I'd still have tinnitus.</p>
<p>I really dont mind the tinnitus at all.  Mine's a constant sound, so it's very sharp, but at least it's constant.  Some people have awful sweeping sounds or something like bubbles rapidly popping and that sounds very awful.  Mine's a constant, never ending single note and easy to ignore.</p>
<p>Mine is something like #1, 2 or 3 of the <a href="http://www.hear-it.org/Impressions-of-hearing-loss-and-Tinnitus-" target="_blank">&quot;Sound files: (Tinnitus)
&quot; section on this page</a>.  Occasionally, I'll hear my heartbeat like #7, especially during exercise.</p>
<p>The poor people with #12 though.  What the hell.  Man.</p>
<p>The vertigo is the last symptom but usually the one that sends you to the doctor.  Mine has accelerated.  It used to be once a year.  It once took like a 7 year vacation even.  Then it came back and it was every few months.  Then maybe once a month.  Then this past year, it became as much as 10 times a day.  That was a very dark time.  My life was on the verge of ruin, which is stressful and stress has been shown to cause the symptoms to worsen.</p>
<p>It seems like allergy season is a new trigger for me.  That may be coincidence though, since the last 2 allergy seasons have also been periods of stress (new job and moving at the same time, both times).</p>
<p>I've been on diuretics for years since fluid retention is thought to be a cause.  They don't seem to help honestly.  I can go off of them for years and not notice a difference.  I also take an allergy pill every day and I think maybe that's been helping but it's hard to isolate it because I started it when allergy season was already winding down.  I've also been on steroids early on, and those helped restore hearing and remove the &quot;water in the ear&quot; feeling.
Eventually they stopped helping though, so they injected steroids through the ear drum.  It feels about like you'd imagine.  That helped pretty immediately but the hearing loss and all of that comes back and like oral steroids, it stops being effective eventually.</p>
<p>So I'm at the end of the treatment options.  Options left are &quot;stop bothering us&quot; or get surgery to sever the balance nerve, which means 100% hearing loss in the ear and having to learn to balance again, without help from the one side.  I've been warned that it means having dizziness (different from vertigo) for a month or two as you re-learn to balance yourself.</p></div>		</li>
