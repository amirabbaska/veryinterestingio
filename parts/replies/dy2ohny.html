			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer is still the &quot;right&quot; one - The OP's question isn't answerable, because &quot;spinning&quot; is by definition converting light from one form of energy to another, regardless of the exact mechanism.</p>
<p>You could just as well ask if it's possible to make something spin from <em>gasoline</em> without converting to another form of energy first.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>A Nichols radiometer was the apparatus used by Ernest Fox Nichols and Gordon Ferrie Hull in 1901 for the measurement of radiation pressure. It consisted of a pair of small silvered glass mirrors suspended in the manner of a torsion balance by a fine quartz fibre within an enclosure in which the air pressure could be regulated. The torsion head to which the fiber was attached could be turned from the outside using a magnet. A beam of light was directed first on one mirror and then on the other, and the opposite deflections observed with mirror and scale. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>With enough light and a better vacuum, the Crookes radiometer would turn. But in the opposite direction. The light pressure would be twice as high pushing on the white part as the black part. So would turn away from the white part.</p></div>		</li>
