			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally depends. A person-sized thick metal shield will just mean you splat on <em>it</em> instead. </p>
<p>I expect the best case is something which draws out the &quot;impact time&quot; while also deforming to absorb some of the energy... Like one of those giant stunt-balloons, which are also used on land :p</p></div>		</li>

<p>Unless Superman's speed was not reduced upon water entry, because he is Superman. </p>

<p>Not necessarily. f = ma </p>
<p>The thick metal shield may provide more force to move the water, slow down less, and thus transfer less acceleration to you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that the speed of sound in water is around 1500 m/s, which is almost two orders of magnitude greater than could be attained from a 54-m fall. So, the geometry of the impact must have a very important role in determining the safe fall height.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If a surface with a 45 degree angle hits the water, then the water will move sideways initially at the same speed the object enters the water.  But for a near flat surface the water would have to move sideways at many times the speed. A 2 degree angle away from flat would result in the tangent being over 30, so require speeds above 1500m/s. I have no idea how to do fluid dynamics like this, but I would guess that if only a small part of the impact is creating this supersonic flow, the shock wave will effectively be an incompressible surface. So if the whole impact surface was at significantly higher angle, the entry into the water would be smooth. But a human will always have some part that forms a flat impact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to generate a very high phase speed when falling into water. If that phase speed approximately exceeds the speed of sound in water, the relevant surfaces get slowed down to speed of sound in water. Usually that does the job of killing you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That long answer is good, all those other calculations are very crude though. Even at relatively low speeds, high instantaneous pressures can be generated if there is a large surface area. The answer really isn't clear cut, and will depend on the form of the dive, surface area and angle of impact, etc.</p></div>		</li>
