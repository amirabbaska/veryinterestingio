			<div class="markdown"><p>Here you can see a video with an example of what happens empirically when you connect two batteries together, one fully charged and one fully discharged. This is not the case with the portable chargers, but illustrates the equilibrium situation you are wondering about.</p>

<p>Compare that style to bigclive doing much the same things, but adictive viewing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current still flows from the battery with higher voltage to the discharged one, but this just produces heat in the discharged one instead of recharging it.  This can lead to fire, explosion or leaking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you <em>can</em> actually (somewhat) recharge regular alkaline batteries - I used to do it to feed my battery-killing Discman.</p>
<p>The biggest problem is they have a pretty high risk (maybe 10%) of blowing up (not spectacularly, but not in a way you want your eyes anywhere near them - Usually they just start leaking, though sometimes they spray a bit) while recharging them, and they really don't hold anywhere near their original charge.  The former I dealt with by charging them inside a closed shoe-box.  The latter, well, 10YO me just liked the idea of free batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can recharge alkaline batteries, if you build the proper charger. But they usually don't last more than ten charges before they leak, if I recall right. </p></div>		</li>
