			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, how often was &quot;I'll have more children in case some die&quot; a conscious reasoning, and how much of it was just unconsciously ingrained in society because that's what ended up happening? The video might address this, but I'll have to watch it later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay. I've heard people cite that the reason they're having kids is because they want someone to take care of them when they're older, so I wasn't sure how often it was a conscious reasoning back then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think most people thought about it in connection with one of my other points up-thread, the reliance on kids as a retirement plan.  People definitely tried to make sure they had enough kids to take care of them when they got too old to work, and if you know they're not all gonna make it to adulthood, you'd better have some extras.</p>
<p>This is especially true for women, folklore is full of cautionary tales about the penniless spinster or the childless widow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A family would be something of what we'd call a business or &quot;going concern'.  You had kids because they'd work the farm, because they'd take care of you, and because a large family in general would both show and promote prosperity to some degree.</p>
<p>Remember, an extended family in those days worked considerably differently than the nuclear family structures we have today.  It was very much almost its own welfare, business, and even local government structure to some degree.  You can still see that in places where they have strong extended family structures.  </p></div>		</li>
