			<div class="markdown"><p>It was spinning from the start.  Remember that the dust cloud will be much, much larger than the galaxy that forms from it. Not sure exactly how much larger but suffice to say that it will be if the <del>galaxy is measured in millions of miles, the cloud would be lightyears across.</del>   (thanks devilphish for the correction) many orders of magnitude larger.</p>
<p>Since the cloud is so large, even a tiny bit of rotation (which there pretty much always is) translates into a lot more velocity when the cloud condenses.  Think of a figure skater bringing his/her arms inwards to spin faster.  The effect is the same, just on a massive scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try it at home: take two spherical magnets, pull them apart and let them come together. They come together with speed but almost never hit perfectly straight on so the energy turns into a spinning motion when they collide. Now imagine that with trillions of magnets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to further extrapolate that, take a water balloon, hold it by the tied bit, twist it till that is good and taut (essentially a wound spring) and let go.  as the spinning accelerates, you'll notice the balloon becoming shorter (top to bottom) and wider around the equator, just as the same forces eventually turn a spinning particle cloud into a disc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the particles will be moving in a random direction but on the whole there will be a slight tenancy for the to move more in one direction than any others. If you draw a thousand random numbers between -1 and 1, the mean will never be exactly 0, it will slightly positive or negative.  This also doesn't take into account other factors that might induce greater spin such as super novae</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With your example, you would expect the mean to bounce back and forth between positive and negative over time. This isn't true for spinning celestial objects. They spin in one direction and maintain that direction over time. Also as the sample gets larger, the mean gets closer and closer to 0. Spinning celestial objects aren't just random partical motion. There is a net angular momentum in a given direction which does not fluctuate randomly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect, or unclear. </p>
<p>In ELI5 terms, the reason everything ends up spinning in the same direction, and only on a 2d sphere, is that it has already collided with everything else. </p>
<p>Anything that spins in the opposite direction, or crosses the disc will, in time, create a collision. Over time, only one plane and one direction remains. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy is actually correct. Even when you have a cloud of seemingly random particles, if you look at the cloud as a whole, it will have a net spin. Any particles not in the plane and direction of the net spin will cause a collision and will either get ejected, or normalized into the net spin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Earth isn't spinning fast enough. When stars explode, they make REALLY HEAVY STUFF. That really heavy stuff likes to clump, and those clumps eventually make rocks. Rocks collide and clump and make planets. The &quot;perfect&quot; shape is a sphere, so things will eventually normalize to more or less a sphere. If they are spinning really quickly, you will get misshapen planets. If they aren't spinning at all or are spinning slowly, you get what we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth mentioning that Earth isn't a perfect sphere, but rather an oblate spheroid, which means that it bulges out at the equator. As you spin the planet faster and faster, it flattens out more and more towards a 2D shape.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason spherical bodies exist (aside from McDonalds) is that gravity works in three dimensions, pulling all effected matter towards a common central point.  Pile up enough matter from all directions, the most stable shape is going to be roughly spherical.  </p>
<p>There are other forces at work doing a similar task in a droplet of water, which will do the same, collapse the mass to the simplest stable geometry, a rough spheroid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once you get enough mass to stick together, the gravity of each particle attracts enough to the rest that they self-equalize. The force of the gravity crushes and heats the contents in the middle and it inevitably forms into a spherical shape.  That's why planets and moons are spherical but smaller asteroids and comets aren't. </p></div>		</li>
