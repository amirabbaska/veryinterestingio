			<div class="markdown"><p>With the transition to digital communication, and the ability to reduce many circuits to a handful of chips, have communication satellites become smaller over time?</p>
<p>Or has the demand for more bandwidth kept them roughly the same size, and I guess maybe some things can't be shrunk, like the radio amplifiers and antennas</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Communication satellites going to geosynchronous orbit are still monsters. But miniaturization has certainly given rise to very tiny spacecraft, such as Cubesats. </p>
<p>So yes and no. You still need a powerful rocket to loft a major communication relay, but we're also seeing an unprecedented number of small satellites that can be launched for a fraction of the cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A commercial communications satellite has to make a profit, the more the better.  They must strike a balance between how many satellites they need in orbit at one time, the number they need over time, the cost of the satellite and the cost of the launches.  There is a lot more, but those are the big requirements constraints.   The net effect is usually as big a satellite as the available launchers can handle, with as much communications capability as possible, with as much lifetime as possible.  Among other things, circuits getting smaller means they can launch more capacity using the same launcher, or include more fuel in the satellite for a longer lifetime, or a combination of the two. </p>
<p>The economics of commercial satellite design is complex. If this kind of thing interests you, try to find a library with a subscription to Aviation Week &amp; Technology and read it regularly (subscriptions are expensive). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the most part, the chips used in satellites are not digital. The transponders are analog amplifiers. They just happen to be carrying a lot of digital signals. The signals are modulated using analog techniques. Some newer satellites do demodulate digital data and re-modulate it, but that does not use much power. </p>
<p>There are many small satellites, but they can't reach small earth antennas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered about that re:small earth antennas -- wouldn't it be a lot cheaper/more feasible to make the antennas on earth bigger (be that large dish collection with some other method of signal distribution or whatever) to reduce the cost of the satellites?  Earth-bound infrastructure is cheaper to erect and easier to maintain for longer lifetimes, right?</p></div>		</li>
