			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a lot of sense. As a smoker myself I kinda just figured it was more habit than anything (certainly get why I smoke with alcohol or why a cig after a joint was always nice) but the meal thing shoot, I can't not do it and I annoy people because I want to rush out the restaurant quickly to go light up. But maybe that's exactly why that craving is so much more intense when I'm out to eat and with friends and all, more dopamine than eating alone at home. </p>
<p>I think we don't talk as much about what cigarettes do to the brain (with dopamine or whatever other chemicals are involved) versus other substances. Like it's emphasized a ton with alcohol and even joked about but as much as I know I'm terribly addicted to my cigarettes, I guess I never really thought much about all the chemistry and biology stuff behind it. (I also feel like people don't always realize or respect how much of an addiction smoking is. But that's a discussion for another day. But I'm guessing the two issues are very connected. So many people, some smokers I've known included, seem to think it's as easy as just not picking up another cigarette. Yeah, I wish.)</p>
<p>I really would like to quit once some wildly stressful stuff in my life settles down. So thanks because while I know other people went more in depth there was something about your post that just clicked for me and I'm sitting here thinking about all my triggers, the things that most make me want to light up, and I guess, suddenly I can understand why those things are as triggering as they are. Not saying that's going to make quitting much or even any easier but understanding my behavior has got to be a step in the right direction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally drinking is the worst thing that makes me smoke. I've got a vape (think what you will of them) and when I'm at home it only take a little willpower to suck on the e cig than a proper cig. Throughout the day I'm fine with the vape but I drink basically every evening (probably another thing I should try to address) and it gradually get harder to vape than actually smoke. </p>
<p>If you haven't got anything against vaping I'd recommend it. As a sporadic vaper I can say it's cut spending and reduced my intake of horrible tar and stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been smoking for about 6 years. I'll go weeks, maybe even a month without thinking about smoking. And then I get drunk and go through a whole pack in a night. For 6 years I've been smoking like that, I know the day will eventually come when I crave them stone sober, but till then I'll enjoy this disgusting habit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard from several smokers that smoking while on psychedelics like LSD and psilocybe-containing mushrooms made them want to quit smoking because they questioned why, exactly, they were smoking.  They were forced to do some self-reflection and analyze their own behavior.  But smoking on feel-good drugs like alcohol, cocaine, mdma, heroin etc.  is reportedly very satisfying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've smoked cigs on shrooms and lsd and I got more of a &quot;I can feel the dopamine being released in my brain when I hit this.&quot;  Didn't question it, it makes sense, everything releases chemicals. However I could also notice that each individual piece of the cigarette ritual releases dopamine. It's the entirety of the action, not just the nicotine. Vape and cigarettes have an entirely different set of feelings and sensations connected to both. Nicotine is just one piece of smoking. It's the entire scene that's set and cigarettes do quite a bit for scene-setting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was never addicted to cigs but used to smoke casually in college, and yeah, if I was tripping I couldn't be anywhere near the smoke. Or meat. It always felt evil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I smoke cigs casually, could definitely go days or maybe a few weeks without smoking a cigarette but when I am on a psychedelic I love smoking cigs. Smoked an entire pack the last time I took a trip! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never thought of it like that, but with any drug I take, be it coke, drinking, MD, ketamine, heroin, or weird psychedelics like 2cb, smoking is the one thing that's consistent. Unlike the person below I've never had an epiphany about smoking on acid - I'm not a huge psych fan - but it really is the icing on an often lovely cake. </p>
<p>When I'm working (writing) I often smoke too. Perhaps it's the same idea as sucking a sweet while you take an exam. Having an additional passive stimulus helps you focus more clearly on the task at hand. For me, focusing entirely on one thing puts too much pressure on it, and having another small, meaningless outlet for my mind to occasionally focus on helps me with the important part.</p></div>		</li>
