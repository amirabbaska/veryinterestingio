			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you sure the X chromosome a woman passes to her child isn't a hodgepodge of her two X chromosomes?  Because my male cousin's daughter and I (also female) have both done 23 and Me and we share random big chunks of one of our respective X Chromosomes. If what you are saying is true, then she and I should have either 100% or none at all.  Although if you're right, that might explain why she and I share 7.56% or our genes and statistically should only share 6.25%.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You totally correct, actually! While this was beyond the scope of my original answer, I can explain something called &quot;crossing-over.&quot;</p>
<p>I mentioned that the gamete cell parents first double (to have 4 copies) then split once to have 2 copies, then split again to have 1. Crossing-over is a process that occurs right before the first split.</p>
<p>At this point, their are 2 pairs (total of 4) of sex chromosomes. The pairs of chromosomes bind each other so tightly that <em>they will actually trade a chunk of the chromosome!</em> The location of crossing-over is the same on the two chromosomes (or it should be), and so the chromosomes will stay the same size with the same framework of genes, but they will be a hybrid chromosome that represents both parents. </p>
<p>Where this occurs varies, so crossing-over may create a true 50%-50% hybrid chromosome, or a skewed 95%-5% (for example).</p>
<p>However, crossing-over only occurs between the two arms of the 4 chromosomes that are most tightly packed together during the &quot;4 copy&quot; stage. Conceptually, this looks like this: XXXX (with the two X's in the middle capable of crossing over.) The <em>outer</em> chromosomes won't have crossing-over. This means that, for example, if the two in the middle trade 25% of their length, the final 4 eggs might have 1 of 4 possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>100% X chromosome from mother (here this means the &quot;mother's mother,&quot; or the egg's grandmother)</li>
<li>75% X chromosome from mother/25% X chromosome from father</li>
<li>25% X chromosome from mother/75% X chromosome from father</li>
<li>0% X chromosome from mother/100% X chromosome from father</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this probability is the same in the sperm cells, and the same for <em>each individual</em> chromosome (crossing-over is random and not at the same rate for each chromosome) so humans &quot;average out&quot; to a consistent rate of relatedness based on statistics, but it is perfectly within probability to have some familial individuals to be more or less related than the average. You and your cousin are more related than most cousins of your distance would be, and their are an equal number of cousins less related than the average.</p>
<p>A fun quirk of this actually: theoretically two siblings can share <em>no</em> chromosomes at all! If the divisions for every chromosome were exactly equal and opposite (astronomically low chance: this has to happen 23 times in each parent's gamete) than the two siblings would have no chromosomes in common. By the same odds two randomly generated siblings at different times could theoretically share <em>all</em> their chromosomes, being effective genomic twins of each other. (There are other rules for inheritance of non-chromosomal DNA, however. Mitochondria and mtDNA is always inherited from the mother. All humans can trace their mtDNA back to &quot;mitochondrial eve&quot;)</p>
<p>tl:dr Yes you are more related to your cousin than &quot;average&quot; and this is because chromosomes can trade DNA.</p></div>		</li>
