<p>Likely have a few load balancers around the globe too, which the domain can easily switch too.</p>
<p>They are also behind cloudflare IIRC who have a good reputation for not disclosing client information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I’m definitely not a lawyer but from what I understand net neutrality is forcing your isp to work more like a utility instead of a service. For example your electricity provider can’t say what you can or cannot use your electricity with. If net neutrality goes away however, they can operate like a service and do whatever they want. </p></div>		</li>
