It's just whichever one degrades enough to insufficiently do its job first.  Then you tend to get a cascade of organ failures as one organ not doing it's job puts more stress on all the others barely doing their job.</p>
<p>With that said, if you did a full survey - biopsies from every major organ and averaged the telomer lengths in each - I wouldn't be surprised if you could get some predictive power with which organs are the most likely to fail first, again presuming no specific disease or trauma takes any out unexpectedly.</p>
<p>You could probably do a decent job with it, but there will still be a pretty big variance on the results.  Plus I don't really know what we'd gain from knowing the information from a medical standpoint, since we can't stop aging, and have much better metrics to determine organ function and address those issues specifically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also just years and years of use. Many of our body's basic metabolic processes can cause inflammation or damage tissues over time. Lots of delicate balances have to be upheld to keep your body's own chemicals from causing damage. Throughout a lifetime, these balances are thrown off by all sorts of things--Illness, toxins, hormones, psychological states, you name it. Scar tissue or cell abnormalities can develop in organs, preventing them from functioning right (like liver cirrhosis or lung disease) or causing cancer. Our hearts and circulatory systems also tend to get damaged over time and have a somewhat finite lifespan. When you get stressed or excited or your blood pressure goes up for whatever reason, it strains your heart and over time can cause a myriad of problems.</p>
<p>It's impossible to avoid a certain amount of exposure to toxins and irritants, like dust, mold, smoke, alcohol, harmful chemicals, etc. Pretty much everything has the potential to cause irritation and inflammation under the right circumstances. Over time, with all these different factors combined with a little bad luck, you'll develop one of the millions of age-related diseases. <em>Something</em> has to fail eventually, and it's a matter of lifestyle, environment, genetics, and luck that determine which one it is.</p>
<p>Our bodies are also constantly under siege from viruses, bacteria, fungus, plant toxins (in the environment and the foods we eat), parasites, etc. Even  if you don't get sick, your body is beating these things away constantly</p>
<p>If your body wasn't constantly repairing itself every moment of every day, you'd decompose from bacteria, fungi, and your body's own enzymes and chemicals (if you want proof, take a look at how quickly human bodies compose on their own once they die and stop protecting and repairing themselves.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain aspects of cell degredation is just an increase in rate of error during division and output, this can be a deletion, insertion, or inverting of order of cellular information. The shortening of the telomeres is the bookends of the information shortening each time, raising that probability even more so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really &quot;direct cell death&quot; that matters, but a bunch of different factors that compound. I work with immune cells and there's already different ways the immune system can go astray that can impair organ function (low grade inflammation, autoimmunity/tissue injury, lymphocyte infiltration...). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When Jeanne Calment died at 120, in 1995, I remember reading an interview of a gerontolog. Upon being asked if they had performed an autopsy to see what did she died of, his answer was along the lines of:</p>
<p>When you open up those kinds of bodies, it's not really to see what they died of, but rather to wonder how they could still be alive, with all their organs showing amounts of decay that would normally be considered terminal in otherwise healthy patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's usually not even at the cellular level. The cells themselves are probably perfectly healthy, but the overall architecture is distorted by years of wear. </p>
<p>For example, in vascular disease, years of hypertension leads to changes in the vascular vessel walls and alters their function but if you were to isolate the cells from the vessels they would likely appear perfectly healthy. They just have a new arrangement that makes it harder for them to do their job correctly</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huntington's Disease is caused by a CAG tandem repeat in the Huntingtin gene. Normal people have short repeats, but people presenting the disease have much longer repeats. Interestingly, people with longer repeats tend to present the symptoms earlier in their life. This has led to the speculation that short repeats are not an issue because the rough age-of-onset is too far off for people to get before they die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a geneticist and you said speculative, but I thought that this explains why HD doesn't have 100% penetrance. That there are some with the inherited mutation that are asymptomatic for a normal life span. If these asymptomatic people with HD lived long enough they would become symptomatic. </p>
<p>I did a uptodate.com review of the genetics and they talk about the wild type allele (6-26 CAG repeats in the HTT gene) as  protective. &quot; The wild-type huntingtin may have a prosurvival (anti-apoptotic) function&quot;. </p>
<p>You're referring to this concept for the role of CAG repeats for severity of disease:
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16230019/" target="_blank">Levels of mutant huntingtin influence the phenotypic severity of Huntington disease in YAC128 mouse models.</a>
But it's the &quot;aggregation of mutant huntingtin as a pathologic hallmark of the disease process&quot;. Not normal huntingtin caused by the wild type allele, which is beneficial to survival and &quot;essential for normal embryonic development&quot;.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have wondered about this a lot. I know I don't have HD, I have been tested, but because of the correlation between the amount of repetitions and the onset of the disease, I've been wondering &quot;what if&quot; a lot. What if I eat a super-pill of some sort, and get to live to about 200 years old. Will I then get HD? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP might have meant Parkinson's disease. Huntington's is a genetic disease, whereas Parkinson's is caused by degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in the basal ganglia. Everyones dopaminergic neurons degenerate as we age, but people who develop Parkinson's have more degeneration and reach the threshold for developing the disease while they are alive. If we all lived long enough we would all eventually pass that threshold and develop Parkinson's. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A combination of this and others. Not only is bone fracture dangerous in itself in old age (especially of the pelvis), it does not heal well and the rate of bone removal can vastly overwhelm repair rate, disrupting homeostasis in some cases.</p></div>		</li>
