			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't buy that as a major contributer..I get crushed by mosquitos while my wife doesn't get touched generally. For example today I was wearing a green shirt and tan shorts, she was wearing blue jeans and a dark grey shirt and I got bit at least 6 times, including one on my face, even though I was wearing lighter colors. She got 0 bites. I was also wearing bug spray and one of those repellent bracelets while she had neither, and spent a lot more time outside because I was tired of getting bites and came in. I've always been one to get eaten up by mosquitos regardless of what I'm wearing. I think if you are just a normal person this might help, but if you're someone who is like OPs gf (or myself), it doesn't really matter</p></div>		</li>
