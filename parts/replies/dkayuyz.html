			<div class="markdown"><p>to go along with general &quot;uncultured&quot;... that and other types of &quot;cultured&quot; require a degree of self awareness and discipline rather than slacking into the lowest energy equilibrium state, like posture or avoiding certain offensive words or subjects... lacking that discipline or self awareness is probably at least as often out of inability as laziness... some people don't bother, others need every ounce of mental capacity to keep breathing at all... and most people pick a couple of points of culture to foster because they've decided they're most valuable, or more detrimental if not done... and the rest go in the &quot;can't be perfect&quot; bucket</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If everyone mouth-breathed, it'd seem normal. But we don't. So I feel like it's basically a &quot;red flag&quot; in the part of your brain that wants to be accepted by the rest of humanity. Humans tend to try to be as sophisticated as we can be, and, as social creatures, we are constantly trying to fit in and be accepted by each other. So something that is portrayed as &quot;heathen-ish&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot;, like mouth breathing, becomes an unfavorable trait. Nobody wants to look stupid. So nobody likes things that look stupid compared to the norm.</p></div>		</li>
