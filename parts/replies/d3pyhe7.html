			<div class="markdown"><p>And it may interest you even more to know that the standard way of <del>~keeping it open</del>~ closing it is with indomethacin, which is basically just extra-strong ibuprofen.</p>
<p>NSAIDs like ibuprofen, indomethacin, aspirin, and naproxen are prostaglandin inhibitors, and one of the prostaglandins (I've long forgotten exactly which one) is responsible for <del>~closing</del>~ keeping the ductus open.</p>
<p>NSAIDs have quite a lot of useful functions outside of people's usual thoughts of &quot;oh, this is good for general aches.&quot; For example, indomethacin is essentially a cure for hemicrania continua, a rare type of headache related to cluster headaches, that is pretty much otherwise untreatable. But the fact that indomethacin works so well compared to a typical migraine/cluster headache makes it almost diagnostic of the condition (as well as a similar kind of headache known as paroxysmal hemicrania).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vice versa, I believe. Indomethacin closes the ductus, and prostaglandin keeps it open. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got contradicting statements there.  Prostaglandins keep the PDA open.  Alprostadil is the synthetic prostaglandin used to keep the PDA open (necessary in certain heart defects while the baby is waiting for corrective surgery).  Indomethacin or ibuprofen can be used to close the PDA.</p></div>		</li>

<p>ductus arteriosus</p>

<p>Blood vessels becoming ligaments? That's awesome. Is the ductus arteriosus made out of different tissue than other blood vessels? Or are blood vessels in general the same type of tissue as ligaments?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, we call them ligaments but I'm actually not sure that they become ligaments properly.  More that they atrophy into a closed remnant and fibrose. I will have to try to find some histological slides of ligamentum arteriosum (or another of the fetal remnant ligaments), but I suspect that they are histologically distinct from true ligaments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently, it's either non-functional, or actually detrimental to adult heart health. Man, learn something new every day.</p>
<p>&quot;The arterial ligament is described by some as a non-functional piece of the DA after the formation of the embryo. Others however consider the ligament as one of the factors which contribute towards aorta rupture during times of major trauma. It is said that the ligamentum arteriosum keeps the largest artery in the body in its place when it comes back to its normal location at the time of rapid deceleration. This can sometimes cause the artery to burst open.&quot;
