			<div class="markdown"><p>A point can be made that the makers of the game have done most of the work, mod makers have just tinkered with it.
Valves own percentage cut is the sticking point for me, their contribution is only having an interface to install mods and a very small bandwidth cost.</p>
<p>Edit: I suppose that valve also has to deal with costs like payment processing, charge back fees and other expenses a shop has to deal with so my sticking point is slightly lessened.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The makers made their game and got their cut when the sold it. They shouldn't be receiving a cut of everything that is made from the game 4 years later.</p>
<p>It's the same thing that happened last summer with Mojang and Minecraft. Mojang sold it's game, allowed people to tinker with it and then later said &quot;You can't make money off this, any money you make, we get some&quot;.</p>
<p>Bethesda and Valve are doing the same thing, they sold their game and now want to take part of any money that is made from the mods afterwards.</p>
<p>What if Ford suddenly said that you had to pay them whenever you wanted to put an aftermarket part on one of their cars? What if Microsoft wanted to take a cut of whatever money you spent via their computers?</p>
<p>It's insane. If they wanted to do that, let it be known, or sell the construction kits. But no, 4 years later they decide that they want to cash in on a community that was built with minimal help from them. They created the game engine, the modders created everything else.</p></div>		</li>
