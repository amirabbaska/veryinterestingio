			<p>Mod creators that want to make money - Shouldn't we be earning more than 25%? We're doing the majority of the work at this point, right?</p>		</li>

			<p>A point can be made that the makers of the game have done most of the work, mod makers have just tinkered with it.<br>Valves own percentage cut is the sticking point for me, their contribution is only having an interface to install mods and a very small bandwidth cost.<br>  <br>Edit: I suppose that valve also has to deal with costs like payment processing, charge back fees and other expenses a shop has to deal with so my sticking point is slightly lessened.</p>		</li>

			<p>The makers made their game and got their cut when the sold it. They shouldn't be receiving a cut of everything that is made from the game 4 years later.<br><br>It's the same thing that happened last summer with Mojang and Minecraft. Mojang sold it's game, allowed people to tinker with it and then later said &quot;You can't make money off this, any money you make, we get some&quot;.<br><br>Bethesda and Valve are doing the same thing, they sold their game and now want to take part of any money that is made from the mods afterwards.<br><br>What if Ford suddenly said that you had to pay them whenever you wanted to put an aftermarket part on one of their cars? What if Microsoft wanted to take a cut of whatever money you spent via their computers?<br><br>It's insane. If they wanted to do that, let it be known, or sell the construction kits. But no, 4 years later they decide that they want to cash in on a community that was built with minimal help from them. They created the game engine, the modders created everything else.</p>		</li>

			<p>You buy a Black and Decker tool kit.<br>You go out and start building and selling cabinets.<br><br>Does B&amp;D now expect a cut of your cabinet sales?<br><br><br>No. Of course not. This is no different, except for the fact that the developers WANT it to be different.</p>		</li>
