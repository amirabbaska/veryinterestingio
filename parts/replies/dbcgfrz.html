<p>The doors are mounted outside the walls, so they overlap when they close and you don't get the gap. The feet are adjustable to account for slanting or uneven floors.</p>
<p>They're made from nylon and bakelite. They feel pretty sturdy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is why U.S. Is just now getting Chip and PIN credit card technology even though it's been around for many years in other countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that wasn't why we were slow getting chip and pin.</p>
<p>We were slow getting chip EMV basically because credit card fraud was a lot less common in the US. Online and immediate authorization helped keep fraud down, while in Europe, it used to be common practice to only process transactions at the end of a business day.</p>
<p>The reason we still don't have PINs is that credit card companies don't want a barrier to use. The lost revenue from fraud is still going to be less than the lost revenue from adding an obstacle to spending.</p>
<p>But patents? Nope. EMV was invented in the 60s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have never been to Asia.  </p>
<p>Doors are the least of your concerns.  No soap, no hand towels, no toilet paper and western toilets are only common in the newest buildings (squat toilets are just not as fun as they look).</p>
<p>And most public toilets you get a divider about 1m tall usually covered in cheap tile and the remnants of the last 100 visitors deposits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct, but I wouldn't say everyone else is wrong either. The reason why this kind of efficiency-at-the-cost-of-privacy is acceptable has a lot to do with the other answers as well.</p>
<p>You don't see huge gaps in most fitting rooms, because that wouldn't be acceptable or justified even though they also face a lot of wear and tear. But fitting rooms are just for changing, not pooping (unless youve been to a fitting room at Ross) so you're far less likely to see a homeless person set up a mobile drug-lab/glory hole in a fitting room.</p></div>		</li>
