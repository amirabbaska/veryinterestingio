			<div class="markdown"><p>I was overthinking this way too much. that formula makes so much sense and makes it so intuitive.  With no friction you just pull the exact direction you want it to go, but as friction increases, it makes sense to spend more of the energy to reduce the normal force. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was answered. The optimal angle is the one at which the forward/upward ratio yields the best outcome. </p>
<p>In terms of providing an actual number... there’s no way to know for sure the specific frictions experienced between an unknown steel sled and dirt. Interwebing yielded a 0.4 estimate for coefficient of friction between steel and gravel - if that’s to be trusted plug and chug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite simple, if you pull something upwards -&gt; the friction reduces.  And to pull something forward you have to beat the friction force. You simply need to find an angle at which if you pulled the sled -&gt; it reduces the friction at some level but by doing so makes it more efficient to pull the sled.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>he did answer.  The answer just has a variable in it because the original question is too open ended. does he mean ground as in smooth pavement and the object dragged is a block or rubber, or is it a grassy field and the object being dragged is a sheet of smooth steel?</p>
<p>The way the question is asked there is no way to give an actual angle as there isn't enough information to determine it.  </p>
<p>It would be like asking what is the best wheel size?  Well, are we talking for a car? semi-truck? bicycle? skateboard?  Sure, bigger wheels can handle variation in terrain easier and have larger contact patches, provide more room for brake systems, but are also heavier which translates to longer stopping distances, slower acceleration, higher clearances, increased cost, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>θ is also the angle that a ladder would slide out. It’s cool because it shows it doesn’t matter how much weight is on the ladder. Only the angle and the surface friction counts.</p>
<p>It also shows how you can avoid slipping on wet surfaces. Keep your angles near vertical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One detail:<br />
If I'm reading it correctly, this formula only applies when the rope is attached at the object's center of mass.<br />
In practice, I would assume the rope is more likely to be attached at the end of the object, meaning changing the angle of the rope results in an application of torque about  the object's center of mass, which I think would complicate the behaviour of the friction. We can circumvent this if we assume the center of mass lines up with the rope at the particular angle we're considering, but in practice it would be very difficult to keep it aligned consistently without actually attaching it at the COM.  </p>
<p>Anyways, my point is that before anyone goes and applies this formula they need to consider if their rope is attached at the correct point for the object in question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't done the math but it's my understanding that in a rigid body model applying torque would not change θ. See frictional force in linearly proportional to normal force. In a rigid body model with positive today from the right end would linearly decrease the normal force and the same rate it increases the normal force on the other end meaning that there is not and effect change in net frictional force. </p></div>		</li>
