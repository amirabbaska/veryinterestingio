<p>Those who first consumed chocolate (in Mesoamerica) drank it in unsweetened, fermented form, so it would have been bitter and strong</p>

<p>Do we have any information on how this would have been prepared? Or has some chef-historian come up with a recreation? </p>
<p>A bitter, strong, unsweetened drink made from roasted beans sounds pretty good to me. I'm really curious how it would compare to black coffee. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I always think of artichokes too. A spiny thistle that many of us now find extremely enjoyable. How many thousands of years of breeding did it take to get the artichoke into its current, delicious, but still labor-intensive, form? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thik this every time I eat an artichoke. How hungry did someome have to be to KEEP persisting with artichokes till they found the good parts of it? </p>
<p>And the first person to chase down a crab and try to eat it? Or crawfish? Yikes! </p>
<p>Which leads me to ask.. what amazing delicacy remains to be discovered because so far attempts to eat it have deemed it unpalatable? </p></div>		</li>
