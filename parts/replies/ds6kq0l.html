			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting corollary of this is that, when you hit the ground after jumping 2.6 times as high, the force exerted on your legs would be equal to your base-line-jump on earth. </p>
<p>Because of this, you wouldn't have to worry about jumping so high that your legs couldn't handle it. If you can jump that high, you can survive the fall from that high. </p></div>		</li>

If you weighed 2.6 times less, your body would become weaker to account for this change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if you were in 1/15th gravity because your downward acceleration would also be at 1/15th rate. So go 15 times higher, but accelerate at 1/15th the rate on the way down (and decelerate at 1/15th of the rate on the way up) that would work out to landing at the same speed with the same force as on earth (and also roughly the same speed and force that you jumped up with in the first place, minus any air friction). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if the reason you're able to jump that much higher is a reduction in gravity, then yes, because for every bit higher you can jump, there's that much less gravity pushing you back down onto the surface. so you'd land at the same velocity no matter where you jumped, because you're essentially not changing the either of the parts of the equation that effect it (how hard you're jumping, or the impact you can withstand), just how long it's going to take you for gravity to push you back down (and subsequently, how high you end up going)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinematics equation is v^2 = 2ax (for initially stationary objects), where <em>v</em> is your final velocity, <em>a</em> is your acceleration (in this instance, due to gravity), and <em>x</em> is the distance you fall. If you decrease gravity proportionally to the increase in height jumped (e.g. halve gravity, double height), the right hand side doesn't change, which means the speed at which you hit the ground doesn't change.</p>
<p>Since your speed doesn't change, neither does your momentum or kinetic energy, so you can land safely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in this case jump height is not linearly proportional to gravitational strength but rather inversely proportional; one could say jump height has a linear relationship with gravity weakness in the same way electrical current has a linear relationship with conductivity but an inverse proportionality to resistivity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it's still linear though considering how muscles function. For example I can't throw a 1lb object twice as far as a 2lb object. And although I can throw a 40lb object a decent enough distance I would only be able to drop an 80lb object.</p>
<p>Basically jumping seems reliant on a high force over a small time, and muscles are probably better able to do this as the weight they need to move drops until it plateaus at some maximum efficiency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the name of consistency, my argument assumes that you're providing X force to the jump. </p>
<p>You're correct that exactly how much force you <em>could</em> apply would increase, but that wouldn't make for an accurate comparison. The question was more about gravity, I believe, and how changes to it change certain things. </p>
<p>Given the need to make an accurate comparison, we assume X force on both jumps. Which, on mars, would provide 2.6 times as much height. Comparing X jump on earth to Y jump on mars says nothing about the precise nature of gravity, just that you can apply more force. </p>
<p>It's an interesting fact, and it can be relevant to different questions, but in this case, I think, it's important to keep the jumps consistent. You don't throw an iron ball 10 feet up, and measure the force with which it hits the ground, and then throw an orange 10 feet up on mars, and measure that force, and say you have an accurate picture of two separate gravities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are pretty big assumptions though, aren't they? If gravity was 5x higher, your jump wouldn't drop 80%, from 3 feet to .6 feet - you wouldn't make it off the ground at all. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree with your general point and the comparison basis is spot on, but wanted to discuss this more: the force applied could decrease actually on Mars, because the force you apply on the ground with your feet depends on your weight allowing you to press with X force as long as your legs aren't fully extended.</p>
<p>I'm starting to think that this may be more complicated and that we wouldn't leap as high as we would think (2.6 times) - because the initial Y force on Mars would be less due to the dynamics of how we use our leg extension and body weight reaction to leap.</p>
