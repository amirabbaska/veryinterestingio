			<div class="markdown"><p>Sex jellies aren't my area of expertise but taking a piss after handling habenaros felt like Lucifer himself grabbed my meat weasel. So capsaicin might be intense, unless you like the rush. </p>
<p>Maybe lubes use something like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camphor" target="_blank">camphor</a>. It's the stuff in Vicks vapor ointments that gives that warming tingly sensation. Not sure on that though, guess I need to find out ingredients of lubes. So don't go mixing chemicals and inserting them onto or into your body unless you know what you're doing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Hands, fingers, lips have high density of receptors. But a key thing to note is hands are thick skin, and gentials are much thinner. Mucous membranes are even thinner (mouth, nostril, anus, vagina, etc) . Also know there's all different types of receptors with varying ratios in different areas.
what's interesting about these high density areas is they generally have smaller receptive fields. This means they have increased acuity (your brain knows exactly where the sensation is coming in at).  However it doesn't necessarily equate to them responding to a stimulus that wouldn't be picked up in less dense areas. </p>
<p>A simple way to test this w/ touch have someone take two pins and hold them approx 2mm apart. You close your eyes or look away. The person w/ pins touches the palm-side of your finger tip with the pins, then touches the side of your shoulder with it. You should be able to discern the 2 separate points on your finger tip, but on the shoulder it'll feel like you're just getting poked with one. </p>
<p>Why is this? Because your shoulder has a larger receptive field since there are less receptors in the region. You definitely know you're being poked in the general region, but not exactly sure where like your fingers would know. Same intensity of stimulus but altered perceptions.<br />
Another example, even though odd, would be Braille. You can read Braille w/ finger tips, but probably not with the tip of your penis (which is more sensitive cause thin skin, but not able to differentiate orientation of the Braille characters).    </p></div>		</li>
