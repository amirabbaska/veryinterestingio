<p>So we are living on a big electric generator, fighting over fuel.... </p></div>		</li>

<p>But why does it contain electric charges? Just because of the friction, like static electricity? If so, I assume this is the same charge which drives lightning?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It contains charges because atoms are made of charges. Since the molten iron is conductive, and electrons that are not tied up in atoms are free to move around, leading to currents. A superheated metal is bound to have free charges zipping around due at least to thermal energy.</p></div>		</li>
