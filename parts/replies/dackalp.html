			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc Newton etcs breakthrough was connecting differentiation and integration. </p>
<p>Fermat and others were already doing problems which one might class as Calculus (finding slopes etc), but no connection between the gradient and the area under the curve etc. </p>
<p>Another thing to think about is how people did math prior to the Cartesian plane... It's so natural to consider coordinates now but for so long they just had geometric constructions for everything. </p>
<p>This comment is loose and off the top of my head, but I think if anyone looks onto it they'll at least find something along these lines :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was of course definitely stuff missing from even what Leibniz and Newton were doing - it took quite a while post its introduction for the ideas to be digested and put on a really sound mathematical footing.
(Which working on this stuff does very much need - infinite sequences can be incredibly tricky to work out using basic inituition.).</p></div>		</li>

<p>but imagine you were tasked with designing a rocket without knowing F=ma, there's no way to design the rocket without discovering it</p>

<p>Trial and error, my friend. You could absolutely design a rocket without calculus. Would you understand it? Maybe not. Would it take a reallly long time and significant resources? Absolutely. </p></div>		</li>
