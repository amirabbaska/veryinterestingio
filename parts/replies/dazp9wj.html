<p>Everything above ~£330k (afair) is then in inheritance tax.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another major item that wealthy individuals use to avoid paying taxes is the step up in basis their beneficiaries get upon their death. This doesn't decrease your estate value before the the estate tax exclusion of $10.4M OP mentioned in number 4 but rather it can wipe clean a lifetime of asset appreciation which you would have paid normally in addition to the estate tax.</p>
<p>ELI5 Ex. </p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> I start a company with $10,000. I now own stock in a company worth $10,000. As my business does well so to does its value grow. Let's say I've hit it big and my company is now worth over $20,000,000. (This is a not too unrealistic scenario with farmers buying farmland 40 or 50 years ago. There are a lot of very rich farmers.)</p>
<p><strong>1. No use of step up in basis:</strong> I would sell my business and get $20M (in cash to make it easy). The tax man would require me to pay taxes on $19.99M, or about $4M using a simple tax rate of 20%. Now when you die you have $16M in the bank ($20M - $4M tax) of which your estate will have to pay taxes on $5.6M thanks to the exclusion mention above of $10.4 ($16M - 10.4).</p>
<p><strong>2. Using a step up in basis:</strong> When I retire instead of selling my assets I decide to sit on them and continue to own the company (We'll also assume I don't do anything else noted in OP's comment above). So I have a $20M investment in which I have a basis (amount that would be return of capital) of $10,000 leaving the 19.99M of Unrealized Gain. When I die and pass on my company stock to my beneficiary, however, my basis is <em>stepped up</em> to the fair market value of the asset. That means that my basis increases from $10,000 to $20M and my unrealized gain decreases from $19.99M to 0 essentially wiping out a lifetime of taxable asset appreciation. When I die I now have $20M in assets to give to my beneficiaries of which I will need to pay estate taxes on $10.6.</p>
<p><strong>For those wondering:</strong> at the current top estate tax rate of 40% my total tax bill under plan 1 above is around $6.34M, under plan 2 above it's $4.24M, which saves you $1.998M in taxes. This is without using any of the other methods except the lifetime exclusion (no. 4) mentioned by OP.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in estate planning for ultra high Net worth individuals...and w33tad1d nailed it with the trusts.  I was on the investment management side.  We'd manage money in shell companies(LLC's) controlled by trusts and did a lot of harvesting losses.  The person who owned the trust was always a few layers removed.  Another loophole is investing in an angel or other early stage companies.  Can write those pre-revenue losses off way into the future.  Real estate is a big one too.  Also, can set up some shell companies in tax havens...maybe make a scholarship foundation that can only be awarded to your descendants, etc.  depends how shady you want to get.  Also, set up family foundations, hire family and pay them salaries off that and max out 401(k) contributions.  There are a million and one ways to game it.  </p></div>		</li>
