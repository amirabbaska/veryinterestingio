			<div class="markdown"><p>This can be risky. It’s possible to superheat water in the microwave above 100°C without the water boiling. If you add a nucleation site the water will boil quickly, which can cause boiling water to escape the cup. The corner of a teabag is a suitable nucleation site.</p>
<p>If you try it, most likely nothing will happen. If thousands of people try it, most likely something will happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is actually quite dangerous, especially if the water is very clean.</p>
<p>Boiling and freezing necessitate a point of nucleation; that generally is some impurity or perturbation, but modern microwaves tend to heat things more uniformly, with less internal convection.</p>
<p>When you microwave clean water, you run into the risk of superheating the water slightly beyond boiling point without any actual bubbling; when you then drop the teabag that can cause some of the water to flash into steam due to the excess energy, with all the associated splashing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would, too. As far as I know, there isn't anything that boils faster than the microwave. </p>
<p>Edit: I have since learned that there are kettles that work in a minute. That is usually faster than a microwave. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't believe you, so I just tested my electric kettle and a cup of water in my 1000W microwave. 0.35L each. The kettle took 1:15 to bring the water to a full boil. I turned the microwave on for the same amount of time and measured the temperature of the water. It only got up to ~70C</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a food manufacturer we are literally more concerned about the staple.  We don't care how the consumer fucks up the product, only safety is a concern with labels like those. And yes the staple is a non-issue but on the chance is does arc and cause a problem the label is there as a CYA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Man I don't know... While I definitely agree that it would taste better done correctly, my gut says it's on there because of the staples, just because you generally don't have instructions on how not to prepare a product unless they're specific warnings to prevent misuse/bodily harm</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned from Alton Brown’s popcorn episode that 1-2 staples in the microwave aren’t a problem.  I usually boil water for my tea but if I’m feeling super lazy I just dunk the teabag into the water/make sure it’s staple side down, no muss no fuss.</p>
