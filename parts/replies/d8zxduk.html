			<p>Obsidian is good if you need a small blade for incisions, or a larger, but uneven blade for cuts. For a razor you need a straight blade of several centimeters, which is nearly impossible to make.</p>		</li>

			<p>The big things to look for when reading those articles are:<br><br>1) Just as a general rule, a chair of family med isn't going to be doing a ton of surgical procedures. The ones he will do are fairly simple, and only give a very limited look at the efficacy and experience one would have using obsidian scalpels. <br><br>2) In the cnn article, there is zero scientific data about efficacy. It's just an anecdote about how one guy claims his friend ran an experiment, and what they thought the results were. Not a strong argument. <br><br>3) The ncbi article you linked (a much more reputable source with data to support it) pretty succinctly states there is no end difference in any of the areas studied, which is especially important when looking at healing time and visual result. When you also consider that 48 days is a pretty minimal period in terms of scar healing, when there is already no discernible difference at that time it does not bod well for there being a big end discrepancy between the two methods. <br><br>I appreciate you going and looking for sources, and I hope my replies don't come off rude or condescending. The reason I suggested looking for sources was because of precisely what you found: data doesn't support faster healing or improved cosmetic result. Or I should say at least as far as I am aware.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sort of a tangent addition to the other replies:<br><br>Basically every blade material has tradeoffs between durability, sharpness, corrosion resistance, etc.  In industrial applications (where I've had to do this) the blade is chosen based on the task.  Example: A blade that is super sharp (acute angle) is usually fragile (lacks shock resistance).  That blade will be great for cutting plastic film but suck for cutting cardboard.  There is no &quot;one blade fits all tasks&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>It would be possible, the question is whether it would be practical and the answer is most definitely no.<br><br>As someone mentioned above, the typical 'width' of the edge of a household razor blade is 300-600 angstroms.  Something that's 30 angstroms would shear off the top layer of your skin like a hot knife through butter if you didn't hit the shaving angle perfectly and if you accidentally moved laterally across your face..forget about it, you're going to the hospital because you sliced open your cheek. <br><br>Shaving already removes skin, we don't want to go overboard with this.</p>		</li>

			<p>I took an archaeology class many years back that got into Knapping flint for cutting tools.  Obsidian can be easily worked to get a super sharp edge.  The example was a current day (at least for the class current) of a barbershop in Mexico City that used Obsidian for their Razors.  The barber would knock off a long flake from a large core (bowling ball sized) and use the flake to shave the customer.</p>		</li>

			<p>Metal scalpels are already incredibly sharp for their purposes. Making an even sharper, obsidian blade is unnecessary cutting power for cutting through most tissue, and it's prone to shattering/breaking. Having microscopic bits and shards of glass inside of you wouldn't be good (imagine what tiny sharp glass pieces would do to your brain/heart when forced through your blood, under pressure)</p>		</li>

			<p>I know people who have had obsidian scalpels used for surgeries. They didn't complain about it all except I guess when they use a that type a scalpel they go over all the risks and such and have you sign paper work(obviously liability off the surgeon) but each person informed me that the scalpel is used once and its gone. So I agree I don't want it breaking off in my cut and becoming infected but were seeing them be used more than they were and they work very well.

			<p>The hardness isn't the direct selling point in this case. What the hardness does allow, however, is a thinner edge that reduces tissue damage. The long term effects on healing don't appear to be significant and some surgeons don't like the reduces tactile feedback, but at least on study on lab rats has shown some sort-term reductions in scarring.</p>		</li>

			<p>Obsidian is sharper but it's not necessarily better.  For one thing it's so sharp it can cut through underlying tissue unintentionally.  Anothing thing to consider is that surgeons don't actually use scalpels that much during surgery.  A scalpel is usually used to make the initial incision in the skin, after that they will use other tools.  For that initial incision a stainless steel scalpel is plenty sharp enough and costs a fraction what obsidian costs.</p>		</li>

			<p>Natural obsidian has all sorts of problems. However we can make very close proxy to it that is actually superior in many ways including not having so many imperfections in the mix.<br><br>Now, we can make surgical blased out of obsidian, however in the US they are not approved for use on humans by the FDA partly due to lack of consistency in production and other problems therein. <br><br>All of that falls under the category of &quot;glass knives&quot; though be they 700000 year old obsidian ones, or something more modern.</p>		</li>

			<p>There are companies that make obsidian scalpels for example, I believe there is a Canadian manufacturer. Plastic surgeons will sometimes use them. They are incredibly expensive compared to traditional scalpels and there is a learning curve on how to use them without breaking them.<br><br>Cost is important for a physician who owns their own practice and can charge only a certain amount for a given procedure. A $500 to $1000 scalpel blade compared to a $5 blade is hard for some to justify.</p>		</li>

			<p>A razor for shaving?  I haven't knapped obsidian but I have knapped flint.  You make an edge by striking it and shattering it into flakes.  They are typically rounded and bumpy, with a relatively short edge depending on how the material breaks.  I wouldn't shave with it because it would be almost impossible to make a perfectly straight and flat edge.  Great for cutting into something, horrible for dragging across your face. </p>		</li>

			<p>I have shaved with obsidian. The Main issue is getting a long flat flake, but if instead of flint knapping you were to maybe grind it into a razor, then it might work better. <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I think it is only so sharp because of the way it flakes. I don't think you can get the same edge by grinding. The processes are so different and the nature of the flaked material is what makes it so sharp, not just the material itself being processed another way like grinding.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not sure about that, it gets a much finer edge due to it's amorphous nature, rather than being crystalline like a metal. But, I'm not a materials scientist, I'm a flint knapper. </p>		</li>

			<p>Maybe it would work to grind it but as you well know (better than I) that making a simple sharp edge by knapping has got to be the most efficient method.</p>		</li>

			<p>For all intents and purposes (shaving wise that is) steel blades are the most cost effective way to shave. Keep your razor in a small cup of mineral oil to prevent rusting and cavitation of your blade after use and it'll be perfectly fine for months. People may respond to this to tell you it doesn't work, but I'm saying it does work and I have no ulterior motive. I'm not selling anything (unless you think I'm a mineral oil salesman).</p>		</li>
