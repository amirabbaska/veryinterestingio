			<div class="markdown"><p>So AM signals don't need to me demodulated?</p>
<p>Could you explain what you mean by rectifying?</p>
<p>The male connector for my headphones is gold plated and the female connector on the extension is not. Could the drivers in my headphones be rectifying the signal on their own?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AM means &quot;amplitude modulation&quot;.  The radio station broadcasts a nearly pure RF tone (say, 1,000,000 times per second in the middle of the radio band allocated for AM transmission), called a &quot;carrier wave&quot;.  It &quot;modulates&quot; that tone to encode sound on it.  AM is maybe the simplest modulation of all:  the tone gets louder when the speaker cone of the receiver is supposed to push outward, and softer when it is supposed to pull inward.  Repeat 20,000 times per second (about once every 50 periods of the carrier wave).</p>
<p>To demodulate and recover the original sound, all you need is some sort of nonlinear circuit element that responds differently to the upward-going part and the downward-going part of the carrier wave.  The very simplest is a &quot;rectifier&quot;, which allows current to travel in one direction but not in the other.  If you put a piece of metal in range of the radio station, electrons in the metal will shunt back and forth, responding to the carrier wave passing through.  If you hook an oscilloscope (a fancy voltage plotter that combines a voltmeter with a graphing calculator) onto the end of the piece of metal, you'll see a wiggly waveform as the &quot;electric pressure&quot; (voltage) changes very fast, from the electrons shunting back and forth.</p>
<p>If you hook a rectifier onto the metal, electrons will shunt <em>only one way through it</em> as each wave front goes by, and then they'll have to try to find a different way to get back to where they used to be.  The wiggly waveform gets its bottom half cut off.</p>
<p>If you disconnect the oscilloscope from the rectifier, and instead connect the wire to some other device that can't respond 1,000,000 times a second, the device will move more slowly, following the smoothed time-averaged voltage of that wiggly waveform.  Since the bottom half of the waveform was chopped off, the time average value is no longer zero: it varies with the strength of the carrier wave.  If that device is a headphone, the headphone's membrane will move back and forth depending on the strength of the carrier wave.</p>
<p>But in an AM radio signal, remember, the strength of the carrier wave encodes the audio itself, so you'll be able to hear the radio station.</p>
<p>That's how a crystal radio works -- in the 1960s through 1980s, it used to be common for kids to build those as a sort of introduction to electronics.  (Earlier, it was more common for grown-ups to build those as a way to listen to radio).  </p>
<p>The easiest thing about a crystal radio is that you don't actually have to have a perfect rectifier in the circuit -- practically anything that allows current to flow marginally better in one direction than the other will work.  It turns out that tons of different things, including point contacts between different types of metal, can do that job.  So it's pretty easy, particularly near a strong radio station, to produce &quot;accidental&quot; crystal radios, especially when headphones and long, cheap (not properly shielded) wires are involved.  </p>
<p>People even used to joke about picking up radio stations with their mercury-amalgam fillings in their teeth, and those stories <a href="http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/3638/is-it-possible-to-pick-up-radio-signals-from-dental-fillings" target="_blank">may have some basis in truth</a>. </p>
<p>The nifty thing is that your ear is sensitive enough that you can actually <em>hear</em> decoded AM radio pulled directly out of the air with a long wire, a diode, and a headphone.  You don't have to have any amplification, if the signal is strong.</p>
<p>That's probably what's happening (by accident) with your headphone rig.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rectification is the process of converting Alternating Current to Direct Current. It blocks current in one direction and passes it in the other. It is all that's needed to form an AM demodulator. </p>
<p>Usually the metals used in connectors are not dissimilar enough to cause rectification, but if they get corroded they could. Copper oxide rectifiers were used before silicon ones became available. I think rectification in the TV's amplifier is more likely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rectifying is can be done by a single diode or equivalent(once done by actual crystals) AND a capacitor.  The AM signal is just the channel frequency in an envelope of the sound signal.  Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AM_broadcasting</a> for a picture.  The diode makes the radio signal DC and the capacitor smooths it out to the sound signal.  </p></div>		</li>
