			<div class="markdown"><p>The rotation of the earth has no effect on the timing of the launch; I'm not sure what that other guy is getting at.</p>
<p>The real cost you pay for missing launch windows is fuel.  The 'minimum fuel, two burn' trajectory between planets is a heliocentric <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hohmann+transfer&amp;t=ffab&amp;ia=web" target="_blank">Hohmann Transfer</a> which has stringent timing requirements.  Once you start getting deviations from that trajectory, you pay more in fuel.</p>
<p>In truth though, you can plan the mission by using what's called Lambert Targeting(solving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert%27s_problem" target="_blank">Lambert's problem</a> with the departure planet and arrival planet's positions as input) and it will handle pretty significant deviation in the launch window.  You then compute the delta V requirements using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patched_conic_approximation" target="_blank">patched conic approximation</a> and compare it to existing rocket technology and see if it's achievable.  You can also follow this process to find non-Hohmann trajectories that have a more reasonable transfer time since Hohmann transfers are slow as hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rotation of the earth absolutely has an effect. The earth is spinning around 1700 kph at the equator, and you want to utilize as much of that velocity as possible.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, low-Earth orbit is a lot shorter about 88minutes, how much worse is <code>δv_surface_to_LEO + δv_LEO_to_slingshot</code> versus <code>δv_surface_to_slingshot</code>? Seems like a lot of the velocity you get circularizing the orbit adds to the orbital speed, which is in the right direction if you depart at the right time. (edit: of course, unless you have to go way off-plane)</p>
<p>Not entirely sure, and of course, could be technical issues, i.e. you can't turn off solid fuel, reliability concerns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ideally the two delta V's you've mentiond are the same.  When it comes to coordinating the motion of a launch vehicle there may be some reasons to favor one method over the other.  For instance, if you've got an extendable nozzle or something for your rocket that you have to kill the burn in order to operate you might favor parking in LEO for at least a couple of orbits.  You can also do it to handle timing the departure burn.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends, but I believe the Oberth effect does play a big part in the efficiency of the engines. The faster you are traveling, the more efficient your engines are. Also, the lower your orbit is, the faster your ship is traveling. Therefore I would think that combining the circularization and slingshot maneuvers would be most efficient, but that might not always be possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't sound right.  Once you put your craft into a parking orbit, you get a new departure window every 90 min or so.  No matter what time of day you launch the earth is still spinning the same speed so you're getting the same boost no matter when you launch.  The real reason they wait is due to a mix of weather and visibility related problems.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>  I could certainly be wrong about this, but I've at least taken a course in orbital mechanics recently so I've got some practice with this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My assumption is that interplanetary launches are not put into parking orbit. We don't really do refueling in space although it looks like we have some recent/ongoing experiments with it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_Refueling_Mission" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_Refueling_Mission</a>. So I don't see why we would go into a parking orbit.</p>
<p>I imagine getting into a parking orbit first would just waste fuel although it could very well open up the launch window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With my KSP-level skills... I see lots of reasons to go into a parking orbit.   Basically if you need to depart earth's orbit on day X, you better depart on that date.  So why not plan be up in a parking orbit a week or two early?  If there's some kind of launch issue, you have time to correct it before you have to leave Earth, that way if it's too cloudy, or a hurricane, or your launch vehicle is misbehaving... you've got plenty of time to get into the parking orbit.</p>
<p>As long as you plan correctly, the parking orbit doesn't cost you any extra fuel, just select a parking orbit that's in the same plane as your planning on exiting, then select all of your orbit's characteristics to maximize your efficiency when leaving earth's orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Putting in in to a parking orbit actually doesn't waste any fuel in and of itself, but keeping it in that parking orbit can in fact waste quite a bit of fuel, depending on the length of time. Rockets aren't really meant to keep fuel for long periods of time in them, except for tweaking orbits and the likes, which use a lower efficiency fuel. If you add more thermal protection, then it adds mass and lowers the effective weight of the payload. It's all tradeoffs, but it's better to launch in to the correct orbit if you can, and minimize the parking orbit time period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if it were hydrogen you'd be right.  You don't typically use hydrogen in upper stages though since it requires a lot more inert mass(larger turbopumps, multi-layer tanks since it's cryogenic, etc.) that you have to carry with you once you've expended all the fuel.   Hydrazine doesn't have those issues, and since it's hypergolic with lots of oxidizers you don't have to carry a flame ignition system either.  This <em>is</em> what's normally used.  Hydrazine has it's own issues, but it doesn't leak the way you're thinking.</p>
