			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience is vice versa. I have some anterior pelvic tilt and I noticed I have to actively rotate my hip like, uhh... It's difficult to explain because English is not my first language. Anyway, I rotate my hip so that my dick comes forward. That way my back feels better and I look better too because my stomach is smaller and I don't look like Donald Duck</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started off with the reverse of what you have, my hips were tilted too far backwards.  I definitely don't think the tail advice fits everyone but after reading quite a bit into it and having constant trouble with trying to keep good posture without really knowing what that felt like, the advice helped quite a bit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's definitely not to the point of anterior pelvic tilt, before hand I was like the second option in this infographic:

<p>I was trying to keep my spine literally straight when it's natural resting position is a gentle curve. When I'm walking around or sitting I'm not literally jutting out my stomach and pulling back my shoulders while fully tilting my hips forward. It's a surprisingly minor adjustment but it's still something I consciously had to do for a while, it made a huge difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll check it all out when I get home. When I saw your first reply I was then imagining you holding a hollow hold type straightness before the change, which makes more sense now </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll have to find the information when I get back but it's not tilting to that extent. Before hand I was tilted backwards thinking I had correct posture. I was trying to keep my back straight as a board.  In order to keep everything in line, I had to tilt it slightly forward from where I was. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just overextended your arch. Having your back straight is proper posture. You probably didnt relax your shoulders down as well. Having a straight posture while relaxed is the best posture. Having a hunch is asking for neck problems. I would love to see your sources. I would also like if you type in proper posture on google and tell me how far it takes to get to your source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, I've always been under the impression that standing perfectly straight was good posture. </p>
<p>Can you link me to some of the sites which talk about the whole &quot;pretend you have a monkey tail&quot; thing? </p></div>		</li>
