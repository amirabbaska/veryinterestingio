			<p>The lasers we use for cutting metal at my job shoot a very focused jet of compressed air to blow away the waste material. For thick steel, we actually use pure oxygen instead of nitrogen, in which case it's basically the same process as oxy-acetylene cutting. The difference is just that a laser beam heats the material to kindling temperature instead of burning gas. </p>		</li>

			<p>The OP's point was that with the simplified equation, mass being 0, the photons would have no energy.  It wasn't a question about kinetic impact.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Right but most of the energy from a photon doesn't come from its mass, it comes from its wavelength.  E=mc2 isn't the only way to get energy.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm not questioning the physics, i'm clarifying what the original question was.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, that was the crux of my original question.  Where did the Energy come from if there was no Mass to begin with in the equation.  I knew instinctively that there was something I DIDN'T understand about what allowed the Energy to exist, but I couldn't figure out what the heck it was.  The answers about Rest Mass and the Momentum factors made me understand.</p>		</li>

			<p>There is actually another method of laser ablation that doesn't involve heating the material. The laser can be used to strip electrons from a given location, with the remain atoms experiencing strong repulsion and exploding into cloud of plasma.</p>		</li>
