			<div class="markdown"><p>I was with you up until the hybrid comment. Most car manufacturers use the same body for their hybrid version. Try to tell a civic from a civic hybrid at a distance. Nobody <em>notices</em> a Chevy volt. Electric/hybrid cars are like toupees: you only notice the ugly ones, but the ugly ones are reeeallly ugly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hybrids and electric vehicles are designed the way they are because of efficiency, not so they look high tech. They have a lot of clever aerodynamic features integrated into the shape of the body to reduce drag and increase mileage/range. These features can be expensive; there is a lot of development time and they are relatively expensive to manufacture because of their more complicated shapes. They often make the cars look more futuristic but their primary function is to increase efficiency. An example of this is the Honda Insight, it had covers over the rear wheels effectively putting them behind the body. They make the car look more futuristic but their purpose is to reduce drag.</p>
<p>Aerodynamics has a huge part in the efficiency of a car. Take pickup trucks as an example. They have very high drag and as a result won't get better gas mileage than the low 20s. Put the same engine into a car and gas mileage will be in the low-mid 30 mpg range. I'm pretty sure you can see this with some Ford's, the F150 has an Eco-Boost v6 option which I think is the same engine you can get in the Escape. The F150 will get ~20mpg, while the Escape will get ~26mpg. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have two examples.  The Prius was the first mad produced hybrid, the leaf was some strange experiment with electric cars.
For every hideous hybrid or EV I can name quite a few that are stunning like a Tesla or same body hybrids like most manufacturers make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you and the person you're replying to might be talking about two different time periods. As electric and hybrid cars normalized into society as regular tech, so did their designs, and user/consumer base broadened. So you're correct, but the guy above is right about the how they introduced hybrids into the market. If ugly becomes iconic, it can sometimes shake the ugly label in the long run as well.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the fact that a shoe was a sneaker at all made it ugly, and I can bet you that my fly-AF Jordan's don't look nearly as cool to my mother, so it's all relative. I love obnoxious shoe design so I disagree with OPs option that running shoe palettes are ugly, but understand his point. I've met a lot of older gym rats and fitness gurus who lament the proliferation of neon in a once navy and grey space.
