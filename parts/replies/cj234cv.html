			<div class="markdown"><p>We <em>do</em> do it for buildings on Earth, where most of that hard radiation is stopped by the Earth's atmosphere. Not to mention the constant rain of micrometeorites, which are also stopped by the Earth's atmosphere. You would lose any &quot;wood-ish&quot; visual or aesthetic qualities with the protection you would have to apply to it, it would need regular maintenance, it would take up a lot more space than the space-age materials we're going to be using instead (in all likelihood, we'd have to use those materials to protect it anyhow), and it would be hugely expensive.  </p></div>		</li>
