			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC102777" target="_blank">more births are men than women, and we're not sure why</a>. This seems to be true <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/article/39169" target="_blank">around the world.</a></p>
<p>After birth male mortality is generally higher at any given age. Men are more susceptible to heart attacks and strokes, men are more likely to engage in risk-prone or reckless behavior, and men are more likely to die in armed conflicts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Longer life expectancy. There are slightly more boys born than girls but boys and men have higher mortality at all ages for a variety of reasons including greater susceptibility to genetic disease and greater exposure to violence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. There is speculation that y chromosome carrying sperm are slightly faster than X chromosome carrying sperm, since the Y chromosome is lighter than the X chromosome. I have not seen data to suggest sperm survival differs. However, international birth ratios are slightly skewed to the males - about .51 of births are male, and .49 are female. This was the reason for the sperm speed hypothesis.</p></div>		</li>
