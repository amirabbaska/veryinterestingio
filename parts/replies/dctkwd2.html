<p>And it's not specifically that the radio waves are too low energy, it's that they don't have the <em>right</em> energy, be it high or low. Visible light does the same thing with water or glass, visible light simply does not have the right energy for the electrons in those materials to absorb them. There's no available freedom for electrons in glass to move that matches the amount of energy that a visible light photon has. But if low energy infrared photons pass through, they are absorbed by the electrons in glass or water. The electrons are free move in a way that matches the energy that IR photons have. </p>
<p>Now if the electrons are free to move to a large degree like as an electrical current, like in a metal, this freedom means they can move with the radio wave frequency and absorb it, or reflect. In the case, the radio waves are not too low in energy. Radio waves will not pass through conductive materials. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, not exactly. Dielectric materials (aka non-conducting) will all absorb some RF energy. This is why you can heat things by subjecting them to strong radio energy. Household microwave ovens operate at 2.4GHz because it's in the ISM band, and penetrates through pretty much what you can fit in the box. Industrial units tend to operate down towards 440MHz so that you can heat/cook an entire pallet of food at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how I feel about this explanation. It is too limited to electrons, when a majority of the interaction of visible light and opaque objects is reflection, not absorption/emission. How would this explanation work with radio waves that can't move through a mountain? Why does it help so much to have your antenna on your roof instead of in your basement if radio waves supposedly don't interact with dirt particles?</p></div>		</li>
