			<div class="markdown"><p>There already have been massive mosquito eradication programmes in most of the developed world, it's why there isn't any malaria in the US or Europe any more. Malaria used be a big problem in those areas but it isn't any more, because they killed all the mosquitos. The mosquito population bounces back, obviously, you just have to break the cycle.</p>
<p>Most scientists believe the harm caused by mosquito borne diseases far, far outweighs the  potential ecological damage from eradicating the things. I've survived two mosquito borne diseases in the last few years, the most recent one earlier this month, and Christ it was the sickest I've ever felt in my life. And I didn't even have a particularly bad one, it was only dengue. Kill the fuckers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't think of any specific animal diseases which <em>require</em> humans as a vector. However, humans are entirely possible of serving as vectors for diseases such as Foot-and-Mouth Disease. Humans who work with animals could also serves as de-facto vectors for pathogens such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA). </p>
<p>When you actually look at pathogens, particularly bacterial ones, you realise that they are often far less fussy about hosts than you'd expect. Within this context any animal which contacts other animals could serve as a vector for these diseases.</p>
<p>(by the same logic milking machines are one of the most significant vectors for MRSA transmission within dairy cattle)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Desert Tortoise has an interesting history.  It's numbers have been declining in recent decades so the powers that be chose to put them on the &quot;threatened&quot; list.  At that point, it became illegal for people to keep them as pets (they do very well in captivity), so people did what they thought they were supposed to do... They took their pet tortoises out into the boonies and let them go.</p>
<p>...And the law of unintended consequences hit like Mike Tyson in his prime.</p>
<p>Turned out that humans carry an illness (sorry, I never caught what it was) that becomes chronic in tortoises.  As long as they're well fed and such (as a captive tortoise tends to be), their systems are strong enough to resist it and all is well.  But when times are hard and their system weakens (like during the summer in the open desert), they develop pneumonia and die.</p>
<p>So... All those people releasing their pets turned out to be catastrophic for the tortoise population.  The newly released tortoises ran around the desert spreading the disease (OK, crawled around...) and the next summer the population crashed.  It hit them HARD.</p>
<p>These days they tell people that if they have a captive tortoise, under no circumstances are they to release said tortoise back into the wild as said tortoise is most likely doomed and will take others with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: No.</p>
<p>Long answer: Anthroponotic disease is what you're asking about but we aren't specifically a vector for anything chiefly because we are fairly new on the scene. We are a common reservoir for a lot of diseases, Leishmaniasis is a good example. Lots of interesting little side stories though like how we may have first developed TB and initially gave it to cattle and thus evolved the varying forms....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also birds can get very sick from influenza. For example, there were multiple outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in chickens in the United States such as in Virginia in 2003ish and in Delaware a little later. These strains did not infect humans but did have the potential to mutate to ones that did and were (somewhat) quickly stamped out. </p></div>		</li>

<p>An asymptomatic infection is still an infection. And those infections are productive enough for the virus to spread to other animals. If there were no infection, then no virus would be produced and we would not have a problem. Also many of these animals, such as pigs do indeed show symptoms as /u/PHealthy points out. Others like seals do not, but they are still infected and producing virus. (<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/288/5468/1051" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They treat the host species as a vector</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're confusing vector and reservoir. A vector is an organism that serves to spread a pathogen from one species (often the reservoir species) to another species, often an arthropod like a tick or mosquito. In some vector borne diseases like malaria, the vector is an essential part of the parasites life cycle -the plasmodium parasite matures in the mosquito. This is different from a zoonotic disease which is caused by a pathogen that can jump species -originally from a reservoir species to another. You seem to be equating these two classifications when they're in fact different. Certain animals are the reservoir for influenza A (aquatic birds, chickens, wild birds, etc.), but they are not vectors.  They crap out the virus or cough it out and we in turn catch it.  Short answer: vector-borne diseases are zoonotic, but not all zoonoses are vector-borne. </p>
<p>So we're talking about reservoirs, among other things. One reason OP's proposal would not work is because influenza A resides in a reservoir species. No matter how perfectly isolated and cleared of infection the human population would be via the hypothetical quarantine, the virus is replicating away in the reservoirs waiting for us to emerge and get back to business. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you!  Your post should be at the top.  Can you clarify one thing for me tough: If humans were isolated long enough that any active flu infections were resolved, couldn't we still see an elimination of the human-adapted flu stains?  Meaning that while flu would still exist in the guts of waterfowl, it would have to go through a successful host shift, which might give us at least a few years of flu-free humanity? (Followed by the emergence of a likely more-virulent-than-we're-used-to strain?)</p></div>		</li>
