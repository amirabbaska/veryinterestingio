			<div class="markdown"><p>Among other possible connections, one conjectured mechanism for mountain building (later disproved through continental drift theory) was that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geophysical_global_cooling" target="_blank">mountains formed by compressive stress and buckling</a> as a result of the Earth cooling over vast geological time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not by any mechanism you might be imagining, no.  Just a quick read through of his site suggests the main process there is driven by evaporative contraction, which is not at all analogous to the process that drives tectonic plate formation.  As a generalization, the plates are formed by irregularly shaped and distributed convective patterns in the Earth's mantle that arise as a method of large-scale cooling of our interior.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no desire nor the software necessary to stabilize this video, however attempting to compensate for the motion of the camera, it does appear that the table or plate is occasionally being bumped or moved, as OP said it was a college dining hall, there are likely several other people sitting a a long table which are causing the liquid to shift slightly, you can observe a similar rippling/puckering behavior with a plastic bag filled partially with water with the air evacuated laying flat and sloshing it a bit.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that this is likely cold corn syrup (a university dining hall is unlikely to have real maple syrup) as such the skin is likely an extremely thin but somewhat rigid layer of crystalized <a href="https://exploringtheinvisible.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/dsc_0113.jpg" target="_blank">Fructose</a> and/or <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Glucose_crystal.jpg" target="_blank">Glucose</a>: </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did immediately think it was a skin rippling, rather than the surface of the liquid, upon watching the gif, so I suspect your explanation could be correct. </p></div>		</li>
