			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a native English speaker, so I'm guessing it's probably wrong. I only use Old Reddit, so it's not a reference to New Reddit.</p>
<p>English has a lot of weird unique words that substitute for the self-explanatory names of other languages, such as saying &quot;pneumonia&quot; instead of &quot;lung inflammation&quot;. It's easy to get them mixed. In this case I figured the word for a passive lifestyle would at least make sense if it referred to how sedimentary rock is formed but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only reason I mentioned it is because someone else made the same mistake on another thread yesterday and there was a bit of humorous follow-up, so I wasn't sure if you were referencing that or not. :)</p></div>		</li>
