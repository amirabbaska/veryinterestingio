<p>This is mainly due to our brains being very good at selective attention. It is impossible for the human brain to focus on every bit of information it receives, so instead it will focus on one or two main points and effectively ignore the rest.</p>

<p>How about those with anxiety and basically feel that they are hyperaware, always cautious and noticing things, people, their emotions, multiple people and THEIR emotions? I have prided myself in being able to be observant and aware, but I know that its part of social anxiety that I've got. Just curious, if you know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a similar thing going on with being hyper aware. Luckily I've learned to calm my brain so I'm not so stressed out and running on max all the time especially in situations taking place outside the home. </p>
<p>I'm pretty sure it's more that the awareness is switching faster and noticing more of the environment and external stimuluses but (postulating) it's not multitasking and more that your brain, after time and having learned things, uses old memories and pattern recognition to notice things that are alike. So even though you are noticing a lot of the environment, it's a specific part of the environment that is tailored to your anxiety. In my experience the brain and body try to be the best at whatever you tell them to do and will adapt to situations, especially ones that fit the mold of previously learned encounters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the thing to remember is that you're forcing yourself to notice these things, either on purpose or by default.</p>
<p>With all that information I've found that &quot;ultra observant&quot; people usually over-read and over-assume.  </p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that the vast majority of people will be &quot;ultra observant&quot; in uncomfortable, maybe novel, situations.  It just happens your anxiety follows you everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the lack there of filtering. Your brain is Supposed to filter shit out, because if it don't, you get anxious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to ask me to imagine a terrifying monster, I would then see some kind of monster in my mind. You might then ask &quot;what is it like?&quot; And I could tell you it was hairy or scaly or had thin puckered skin hanging tautly off sharp bones. But then you might say, &quot;can you please count the spines you said run down its back?&quot;...and I wouldn't be able to. If I were to try, the image would become suddenly intangible and disappear.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to ask about is: it seems to me that I'm seeing something but its also very different than seeing. I can imagine a vivid image without working out the details. When our conscious minds imagine, it seems we are not like video game programmers who must design and place every ragged tooth or claw but more like Picard in the holodeck, who simply says &quot;Computer, make an 18th century galleon&quot; and leaves the details to the machine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to ask the same, I can't visualize mentally, vividly or otherwise. I wouldn't say I can daydream in anything but a mental narrative of concepts or thoughts. Definitely seems like a different description to me...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same!! Sometimes my mind wanders off on a narrative but no images. I can't draw well either beyond know what something is like but not visualising it. Can you dream in images? I've been trying to figure that out but I don't really remember my dreams but I don't think they are visual</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Aphantasia is the suggested name for a condition where one does not possess a functioning mind's eye and cannot visualize imagery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My understanding is that most people can imagine/visualise things in their minds, such as imagining a house or recalling a person's face, while others cannot. Those that cannot, it's said they have aphantasia. </p></div>		</li>
