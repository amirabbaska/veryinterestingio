			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of being tired, I read a quote once from someone who has been studying sleep for decades and the very best answer he could give in terms of why we have to sleep was &quot;Because we feel tired.&quot;</p>
<p>We have absolutely no idea why we get tired. As I understand it, we can't find a mechanism to cause it or a purpose behind it, other than the fact that we start feeling tired.</p></div>		</li>

<p>tl;dr: the brain seems to change structure slightly when we sleep, allowing it to expel a lot of waste products that build up in neurons while we're awake</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this why, when I have to do something dull and repetitive, that having something on in the background like music or a podcast makes it so that I dont feel as tired after? Essentially I'm switching from the repetitive task's voluntary attention, which is tiring, to the involuntary attention of something I actually want to pay attention to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly. We know that task switching is effortful but this has mainly been studied in dual task situations where both tasks are voluntary/effortful. I have never read of a study that looked at what you describe but it could be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really want to thank you for this response -as a teacher of students with brain injury and some with visual impairments, I often see the 'non-purposeful' gaze and/or gazing at lights. I have been able to tell other staff members that this is like a break the brain takes, bit you explained it more appropriately! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and esp if they have any frontal lobe impairment then the directed attention will be affected</p></div>		</li>
