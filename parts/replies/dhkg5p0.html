			<div class="markdown"><p>The electrons don't stay at an elevated energy level forever.  They can decay to a lower energy state, emitting a photon in the process.  But the direction of that emission will be random, so very little gets emitted in the same direction as the incoming light that was absorbed.  And that process repeats as you go each molecule deeper into the absorbing material, until almost no photons are emitted in that direction at all.  So the absorbing material still appears opaque even when the decay happens very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. It's true the atoms decay from their excited state to their ground state but mostly that's through converting the increased energy into kinetic energy (bonds start vibrating etc.). If a material does emit light when the molecules return to the ground state then it is fluorescent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also possible that while the electron is in that elevated state (because that state is high-energy) that particular excited molecule can actually break its covalent bonds or react with other nearby molecules, changing its structure and absorption/diffraction rate.  This is why exposure to UV/sunlight tends to bleach things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question!</p>
<p>It actually really reflects, for this you have to consider photons as particles instead of waves. Analogous to light 'bending' when it enters water, it can also really reflect.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-mirrors-reflect-ph/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-mirrors-reflect-ph/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of a silver mirror, this reflection occurs at the interface of glass to silver, essentially because the optical properties of the metal are very different from those of glass. (As a general rule, waves experience significant reflection at interfaces between media with substantially different propagation properties.) In the case of this silver mirror, there is also another, weaker reflection at the air/glass interface. In the end we obtain a reflected wave with essentially the same properties as the incident wave apart from some loss of power, which typically amounts to a few percent for silver mirrors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In this case the photon model is a poor way to describe the process of reflection. Reflection doesn't involve photons being absorbed then re-emitted. You're correct that the oscillating light wave of the light interacts with electrons in the reflector, and the resulting oscillating dipoles reradiate light. However, while this is easily described using a wave model it's hard to describe using photons. As a general rule the photon model works well when light is exchanging energy with something so for example it would be a good model if the light was ejecting photoelectrons from the mirror. When we're studying the propagation of light the wave model is a far better approximation.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a more common example would be  lower frequency WiFi signals, they pass through what we see as solid walls. Infrared can pass through a lot of specific plastics, it's used on my virtual reality headset for tracking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A seriously great question, and I'm proud of you for making that association!</p>
<p>In a short answer: Absolutely! </p>
<p>Standard construction walls, for instance, are not that great at absorbing wifi signals. They typically just penetrate right on through it with a little bit of signal decay (there's more to it than that, but brevity is good) unless there's metal or wiring running through it. <em>Organic tissue</em> on the other hand, due to its high water content, is <em>fantastic</em> at absorbing it! So one could use <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/fadel/wivi/" target="_blank">wifi signals</a> to peek through walls and see things on the other side in real time!</p>
<p>The example I've provided is, at this point, antiquated compared to multi-antenna 5G systems that rely on the same principals~</p>
<p>A potential major application? Firefighters will soon be able to see, in real time, the location and body position of all building occupants in real time in their helmet-mounted HUDs! It's really amazing stuff!</p>
<p>In short, almost everything is at least moderately transparent to <em>some</em> medium or frequency of energy, it just depends on how you're &quot;looking&quot;. Even <em>lead</em>, though at that point it's a bit out of my range of study (neutrinos, cosmological radiant forces and all that).</p></div>		</li>

It applies similarly to reflection as well, gold is a better reflector of the IR spectrum than something like aluminum that performs well in the visible spectrum. </p></div>		</li>
