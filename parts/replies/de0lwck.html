			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol. It's hard to say. Different jurisdictions have different laws. I assume there was no trial. Also, some jurisdictions have age immunity. Many use the rule of 7. Under 7, you're not liable for shit. 7-14 you are expected to act reasonably base on your individual characteristics, and over 14 you are expected to act like a reasonable x year old. As an adult you have a duty to act as a reasonable and prudent person under the circumstances. </p>
<p>The right lawyer may have pointed out the store's negligence for placing a vase, so shiny and enticing, within the reach of a child, endangering that child's health and negligently inflicting emotional distress upon that child for the guilt of breaking a poorly placed vase. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a difference between mens rea and just motive though.</p>
<p>Someone can know something is illegal, but not feel it is immoral (stealing bread for your family to eat).  At the same time something can be illegal regardless of motive.</p>
<p>And I'm pretty sure you will never see the value on an item adjusted because of motive, you would have additional rewards for a civil case though.  But the item in question is the same value either way, the additional costs are supposed to reflect actual losses (couldn't make it to work because you slit my tires, that's worth another day's pay on the recovery), not the defendants motives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, there's also an element here of minimum amounts before police / FBI or whomever are interested in pursuing the case - which causes a lot of creativity over the damages.</p>
<p>You see  this all the time when hackers have supposed caused tens of thousands or more &quot;damage&quot;</p>
<p>It'd be like someone knocking over the figurine and then charging the janitor who sweeped up the mess at $400/hour when assessing the &quot;damage&quot; the customer had done.</p></div>		</li>
