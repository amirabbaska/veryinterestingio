<p>Periodically while it's boiling I shake the kettle as to shake the water inside.  I do this because I think I'll be moving the colder water at the top down to the element quicker than just the heat alone will do it.   Watching this there is some method to my madness? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: the original is cancelled out and a new one is emitted</p>
<p>Long answer:
In this case it's best not to think of the photon as a particle, but rather as an electromagnetic wave.</p>
<p>To be a little bit abstract what happens is that the electromagnetic wave does what electromagnetic waves do to charged particles: it causes it to change direction (aka accelerates it) and as you may know: an accelerating charged particle emits electomagnetic radiation.</p>
<p>In &quot;regular&quot; interactions of this kind (Compton scattering) the &quot;collision&quot; is inelastic and the particle being accelerated keeps some of the energy and the photon loses some energy, but if the photon's energy is low enough the particle looses the ability to skim any more off (Thompson Scattering) and so a perfect copy of the original photon is produced (just with a new direction).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the exact answer, but I do know a technicality that may change things: in the core of the sun, there are no more things known as &quot;atoms&quot;. Everything is a charged particle soup of protons and electrons and some neutrons bouncing around in very tight spaces, so normal absorption and emission are non-existent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering time is meaningless from a photons reference, does measuring the age of a photon give a meaningful result? It's brand new always.</p>
<p>If I magically travelled at the speed of light and returned, having experienced no time, while the earth experienced a century, would I be 34 or 134? I wouldn't be any older, but the difference between now and my birthdate would have changed.</p>
<p>So I would have definitely been born 134 years ago... But how 'old' would I be considering I hadnt 'aged'?</p>
<p>You couldn't measure me and determine I was born in 1983, so wouldn't it be meaningless to measure a photon?
As I understand it we can only infer the relative time elapsed since its creation by guessing where it was emitted  (unless we are close enough to know for sure the source, it could have come from a source anywhere along it's trajectory)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One way to distinguish photons though would be wavelength, no? The wavelength of photons emitted from the photosphere is much longer than the gamma radiation created in the core. I don't think it's redshift. What is the mechanism of this loss of energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  If you want to think about lower limits, then take the time it takes for the photon to escape the sun in light years (some estimates are about 170,000 years with 1 million years being on the long side) and divide by the diameter of the sun.  That is absolute minimum number of &quot;bounces&quot;.  <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=170000+light+years+%2F+diameter+of+the+sun" target="_blank">That calculation</a> gives a little over a trillion bounces.  Given that the mean free path of a photon in the sun is at most a few centimeters (let's say 10 for easy calculation), then you must multiply that number by the ratio of the sun's diameter to 10 centimeters (<a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=diameter+of+the+sun+%2F+10+cm" target="_blank">about 13 billion</a>).  That means that a low estimate (since 10 cm is a large mean free path estimate) for the number of bounces is about 10 <a href="http://www.statman.info/conversions/number_scales.html" target="_blank">sextillion</a> bounces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but to get the number of bounces shouldn't you take the avg time for a photon to escape the sun and divide by the avg time per bounce? Not divide by the diameter of the sun..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC a photon takes about 100,000 years to get from the sun's core to its surface, whereas it would take 3 seconds if there were no matter in the way, so it has to bounce <em>at least</em> (100,000 yr./3s) ~ 10^9 times. That's a billion, but yeah, you have the right idea.</p>
<p>Actually a better estimate comes from 100,000 light years divided by the mean free path, 2 cm (as calculated elsewhere on this page), which is more than 4x10^(22). 40 billion trillion bounces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now you are getting closer to the answer.</p>
<p>You realise you could do these calculations for the Earth now.  A photon comes in from the Sun at noon on Tuesday.</p>
<p>How long does this energy spend time in the Earth system before it is emitted back to space?  How many molecules does it spend time in?</p>
<p>From the Sun's core to the surface is actually 200,000 years I believe is the correct answer.  On Earth, from entering the Earth system to leaving it, would be measured in hours.</p>
<p>It is the essence of the climate and the temperature of the ground and the air.  Give it a shot. </p></div>		</li>
