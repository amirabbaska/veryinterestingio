			<div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly the way the residents of Smith/Tangier Islands in the Chesapeake Bay, and the original residents of the Outer Banks/Hatteras Island/Ocracoke Island before the bridges and roads got built are/were a good presentation of the accents of colonial america and england of the time. Worked with a guy in Richmond who was from up in the hills in Southwestern Virginia. His accent was also very close to what I remembered hearing in &quot;The Story of English&quot; from the Tangier Islanders accent. The story of english was a series produced by <del>Jim Lehrer</del> Robert MacNeil of PBS MacNeil Lehrer News Hour. Very comprehensive book and TV show on the evolution of the language<br />
--EDIT--<br />
Had the wrong host of the News Hour driving The Story of English<br />
Here's a youtube of the Story of English episode of speech on Tangiers<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to realize they are not in complete isolation and technically are in &quot;the south&quot; Tangier/Smith are close to Maryland/Virginia eastern shore which is culturally similar to rural north carolina. All that said, the southern accent itself is descended from a lot of english, scots and irish. This is very obvious if you look at the skin/hair/freckles and bone structure of the people of Appalachia and Piedmont southern USA</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This isn't a popular fun fact, probably because it challenges the view of the southern accent most people have (it sounds &quot;uneducated&quot; is usually the nice way people say it), but as a southerner myself, I always enjoy telling people that they might be surprised to hear that the forefathers they loved so much probably sounded a little more like me than them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like I should point out that accents and dialects varied hugely within the UK during colonial times. Even now, any Brit will tell you that there's no real &quot;British English&quot; accent, since villages 10 miles apart can have different dialects. And that's in the present day, when technology and social changes have watered down the differences. </p>
<p>I'm not sure what the demographical makeup of colonial settlers were, but if they were even half as diverse as the Britain they came from, then there would have been huge variations in their spoken languages. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was fascinating to me as a Canadian. It's impossible to tell where someone is from here unless they're from Atlantic provinces.  In the UK, everyone knew instantly where another person was from within a few words. </p>
<p>I honestly felt a little jealous because that likely comes with a sense of greater identity, something that is lacking here.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are subtle differences west of Québec. For example BC has less /æ/ tensing than Ontario. Also they have virtually no Canadian raising. Saskatchewan has some unusual vowels thanks to their Ukrainian settlers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia is like this too. It's mostly quite difficult to pick where someone is from just by their accent. It's sometimes possible to tell if someone comes from the country (I mean rural areas), but more specific than that is tricky.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hot Fuzz is set in Gloucestershire, and filmed in Somerset. The accent in Hot Fuzz is not very Cornish, it's quite distinctly a Somerset (Maybe some Wiltshire and Devon) accent.</p></div>		</li>
