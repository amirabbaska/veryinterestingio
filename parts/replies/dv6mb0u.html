			<div class="markdown"><p>Testosterone deficiency is usually treated with intramuscular shots every 2-4 weeks depending on need. You'll then get a shot of 75-125mg once a month depending on the severity of your deficiency, as an example.</p>
<p>Fun fact edit: High level bodybuilders (mr. Olympia and similar) will use around 3000mg (yeah, that's three zeros..) of testosterone a week, along with other types of steroids (not all steroids are testosterone) as well as growth hormone.</p>
<p>Source: Used to run a powerlifting club, so spent a lot of time around that type of people. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why don't we all do this? Or at least a little more than we naturally have? (I googled, but there's so much contrary information...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Posters about yesterday replacements injections are flat out wrong.</p>
<p>Standard dose is 100mg a week of testosterone (cypionate or enanthate), rarely it's 200mg every two weeks.  That gives someone about 70mg of actual testosterone a week.  This dose is adjusted for body weight of each person too, but it puts them in the upper limit or testosterone, about 800-900 total T in their body.</p>
<p>Edit: my brother has to take testosterone, probably going to such to the cream though.</p></div>		</li>
