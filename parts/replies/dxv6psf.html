			<div class="markdown"><p>How much more water does a folded-in-half paper towel absorb than the same paper towel laid down flat? I'm not asking for precise calculations, something along the lines of &quot;a teensy bit&quot; vs &quot;a cheese ton more&quot; are both good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A reasonably large amount. Consider when you wet your thumb and index finger, press them together, and slowly separate them. The water maintains connection between your two fingers for some distance. You're employing a similar tactic but with a much larger surface area, i.e. the two halves of the paper towel which are face-to-face. Granted this trapped water is more prone to being released by pressure, so squeezing a soaked and folded paper towel will negate some of this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure it varies depending on the type of paper towel, but if you are just referencing the additional capillary action it would be a fairly small amount. There's a lot more spaces for capillary action to take place inside of the paper towel, especially if it's a thick paper towel.</p>
<p>1-ply toilet paper would have a higher percentage increase by folding it in half. 1-ply can't absorb much water anyways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems like something you could easily try.  Get a paper towel and fold it over a couple times and then put it under the faucet or in a tub of water.  Then squeeze the water into another vessel or even a table.  Then put the paper towel flat into the water and then pull it out to see how much water is left.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water has surface energy where the water molecules do not have enough local molecules to bind to. With some surfaces, water can lower its surface energy by binding to the surface.</p>
<p>This can pull water up hill, as long as the amount of extra gravitational potential energy is less than the reduced surface energy. The energy is already there in the water surface, but it wont be able to get the water to leave the capilliary unless extra energy is put in.</p>
<p>i.e if the volume of water being lifted is a very narrow bit, while the amount of surface area is relative large.</p>
<p>The same effect causes drips on a surface to have their distinctive shape. And why drips form differently depending on different surfaces, e.g plastic, glass, metal, ceramics .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemical potential would be a more accurate term from a thermodynamic perspective. The water climbing effect is a mixture of force balances involving hydrogen bonding, electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic/hydrophilic interactions, Van der Waals, and gravity. Chemical potential deals with most of these, and in the context of Gibbs Free Energy can give us the driving force for such motion. Essentially, you can look at the chemical potential of water in water versus the chemical potential of water spreading along a given surface. If the water on the surface has a lower chemical potential than water in water, then the water will &quot;climb&quot; the surface to minimize its Gibbs Free Energy. At that point it's equilibrium will be determined by the available energy in the water is offset by the potential energy accumulated through the mass moving up against gravity.</p>
<p>Please note that &quot;Gibbs Free Energy&quot; is not &quot;Free Energy&quot; in the sense that people think you can pull energy out of nothing. It is merely a measure of enthalpy available in a system that can be used to do work (such as climbing). Energy is conserved, and some quantity will change in the system as a result (Temperature, Entropy, Volume, etc.) to compensate and balance the energy.</p></div>		</li>
