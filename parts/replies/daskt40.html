			<div class="markdown"><p>The only answer I've seen in this thread with any crediblity. Dimensional lumber is a grab bag. If you want a true 2x4 piece of lumber go to the sawmill and get 8/4 lumber and rip it down. Or you can get lumber by the board foot. Other than those options, you're paying for convenience in a rough-build situation. This is why some people choose 5/8&quot; drywall. It helps hide the imperfections in different dimensions of the lumber that supports it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, as a DIY guy, I researched the hell out of building stair stringers. Except going to the lumber yard to see the 2X12 I would be using. It was 11 even. With the 11 inch depth of step I wanted and the angle, I think I barely cleared 4&quot; on the thinnest part when I thought I would have ~5&quot;. I don't think it's a problem as there is a center support, but it freaked me out on the trip to the yard.</p></div>		</li>
