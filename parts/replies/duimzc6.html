			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m a research assistant in a Biopsychology lab that’s currently focusing on the physiology and behavior relating to the female cycle in an evolutionary context. My professor was recently published for a study that found both men and women can subconsciously detect when a female is ovulating. They consistently rated the same female’s voice more attractive when she was ovulating at the time of the recording. Other studies have found similar findings with smell of clothing, faces, and breast size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not subconscious then is it?  They're basing it off of their voice which would imply something is different about a woman's voice when they're ovulating.</p>
<p>Edit: ah, I missed they only thought the person was attractive.  I thought they correctly guessed whether or not the woman was ovulating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's subconscious because they're not thinking &quot;That woman's voice sounds like she's ovulating, so she is more like to get pregnant through sex. Therefore she is attractive.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, here is an explanation I pulled from one of our project proposals: &quot;Newman, Butler, and Gray (2000) demonstrated that increased estrogen levels during high fertility, known as the late follicular phase, has been found to increase mucus production and thicken the laryngeal mucosa (i.e., mucus that coats the vocal folds). The laryngeal mucosa becomes dryer during low levels of estrogen, such as during a female’s period of low fertility, which is known as the luteal phase (Newman, Butler, &amp; Gray, 2000).&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>snipped from an article within the link posted by u/littlewootiewoo</p>
<p>On the guy's side, men subconsciously scout for hormonal and physical clues of pregnancy before becoming involved with a gal — after all, the whole point is to impregnate her himself. As a result, men might find ovulating women more attractive than those on the Pill, scientists say. </p>
<p>there seems to be some science that supports your hypothesis.</p>
<p>Edit: changed proved to support; thanks u/theoldsaltydog for the science lesson</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If only I had a way to go back in time and figure out if all the women I'd been attracted/not attracted to were on the pill or not. That'd be interesting. </p>
<p>I'd like to think it wouldn't matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the context of this thread though, the article seem to mention that it's not the pheromones, but the behavior of the women that changes.  Men are just fine tuned to perceive these change in behavior and physiology; the article mentions voice and facial changes in women experiencing hormonal change, cues that were picked up by both men and women. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought it was a given that you could smell ovulation. I've always been able to with long term partners. There's studies like this that seem to support that:</p>
<p><a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/15/4/579/205993" target="_blank"><a href="https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/15/4/579/205993" target="_blank">https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/15/4/579/205993</a></a></p>
<p>I can't say that it's pheromones or what, but there's definitely something to smell through a woman's cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also doesnt it (in some women at least) cause secondary sex characteristics like breasts/hips to generally swell and be more prominent?</p>
<p>Just going off the fact that the hormone released during ovulation is the same hormone given to trans women to help with the growth of those things, i might be wrong though.</p></div>		</li>
