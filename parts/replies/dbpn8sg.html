			<div class="markdown"><p>No, Ohm's Law does not display nonlinear behavior outside a certain range.  It is by definition linear because it applies to linear materials.  Even materials that are not linear will still obey Ohm's Law at whatever static conditions you choose to verify it.  For example, if a resistor self heats due to current going through it and it changes resistance as a result, the voltage across it is still exactly the current through it multiplied by the (new) resistance of the material.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, but that is incredibly circular reasoning. If you constrain the conditions enough, you can posit just about any law.</p>
<p>Rumborak's law: &quot;All materials are perfectly green in the color range at which they are the most green&quot;.</p>
<p>On a more serious note, Ohm's Law is eventually thwarted by Brownian Motion. Which already means that the law, even under perfect conditions, has limited applicability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rumbrorak's Law however does not allow you to make useful inferences of an object by measuring the relationship of its color to any other property.  It simply says &quot;green objects are green&quot; which is not the same thing at all.  Ohm's Law does this by letting us make things like DMMs that can measure resistance by putting current through a device and measuring the voltage imposed across it.  </p>
<p>I don't know much about Brownian Motion outside of my teacup, but I do know that if Ohm's Law were as suspect as you are suggesting, then we would not have any good test equipment, such as DMMs.</p>
<p>I just don't want OP to get the impression that the relationship of V=I*R somehow changes outside a certain range of V, I, or R.  It doesn't.</p></div>		</li>
