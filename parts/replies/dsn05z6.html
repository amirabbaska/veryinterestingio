			<div class="markdown"><p>Best answer in this thread. There are a lot of other answers that are correctly pointing out that thinking about neurons as little bitty pieces of computer doesn't really work, but they stop there.</p>
<p>The question is valid nonetheless because the term &quot;bytes&quot; just means &quot;8 bits&quot; and a bit is a concept in broader information theory, not just a thing computers have.</p>
<p>Thanks for finding and linking a reputable scientific source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer in the thread. Thank you. </p>
<p>With respect to why the confusion, neurons are memristors, and to complicate an already complicated idea, they have nonlinear analog inputs but binary outputs. These properties make it easy to get OPs question wrong.</p>
<p>Maybe OP is a writer and just wants a rough number for how much data the brain stores. For that, I'd go with the paper's estimation technique. Divide it by 20 (fewer synapses in non purkinje cells on avg) and multiply it by 80 billion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The information in this case is stored in the synapses (in the strength of the synaptic connections), which can change over time and be shaped by experience (the patterns of activity seen by the neuron), thereby implementing memorization/learning.</p></div>		</li>
