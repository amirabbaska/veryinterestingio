<p>phytoplankton removes the carbon and when it dies, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean, </p>

<p>Wasn't there some guy who claimed to be able to reverse global warming by spreading a ton of iron filings on the ocean, to create a phytoplankton boom, which would capture a lot of CO2 ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoever said that talking out his ass. Phytoplankton doesn't last long and when it decays it sucks oxygen from the water and releases the CO2 straight back because it doesn't become dirt. CO2 levels would plummet for several weaks, then the plankton dies and takes every other living thing in the area with it except for jellies, and then the CO2 levels go back up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Planting trees may help to remove carbon from the atmosphere but it only stores the carbon for a short period of time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Could you explain further? 5-year-old me thought that the process goes something like this: photosynthesis -&gt; sugar -&gt; cellulose. Let's say the tree dies but the cellulose doesn't burn; how does it then turn back into C02 and fly away? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that seems pretty obvious now that it's pointed out. I guess the process that leads to the creation of fossil fuels doesn't account for a significant portion of the carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At a guess, I'd say that co2 would be released as a byproduct of the metabolism of the organisms that eat the dead tree.</p></div>		</li>
