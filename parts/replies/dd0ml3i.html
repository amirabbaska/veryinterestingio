			<div class="markdown"><p>I really appreciate the concern, but can confidently tell you the answer is “NO” – I’ll explain why. Unlike my scientist brethren at places like the EPA, USDA, and HHS, the mission of my office is focused on national and international security and has enjoyed strong, bipartisan support since it was created. Our government may disagree on a lot of things, but it agrees that we should do whatever we can to keep WMD materials away from the people who want to use them against the U.S. or its allies. </p>
<p>Science is inherently apolitical, and truth doesn’t care what your beliefs or opinions are. Be wary of people who try to politicize science for their own means, and ask yourself, why are they doing this? I'm grateful that there has been such an outpouring of support for gov't scientists, and hope people keep it up and remember that love the next time they're in a voting booth!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to remember that scientists like me, and the majority of employees across the federal government, are in our jobs not because we want to work for a particular individual or administration, but because we want to serve our country.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the way, people came to believe that Washington is a &quot;swamp&quot; where everyone who works for the federal government is corrupt, selfish, petty, egotistical, coldhearted, and cares only about money.  </p>
<p>I want to state definitively that never before have I had the pleasure to work alongside so many selfless, talented, dedicated, and patriotic colleagues as I have at State, and that so many of the people I've worked with across the interagency are cut from the same cloth.</p>
<p>This is also a critical difference between politicians and policymakers:
Politicians are not required to have any political or policy ability or experience, and are put in office to serve the people who put them there (which usually means serving whoever gives them the most money to stay in office). </p>
<p>Policymakers, on the other hand, serve the whole American public (since they are often paid by taxpayer dollars) and are usually hired for their specific abilities and experiences.</p>
<p>Both are supposed to be responsible stewards of taxpayer funds, but only one side, politicians, and specifically the 535 members of Congress, gets to decide how the money gets spent. So if you think it's incredible that $15 billion could be found to build a wall but $55 million can't be found to fix pipes in Flint, MI, you have to remember that it's not about the amount of money, it's about the priorities of the people controlling the money. In other words, if building a wall gets them votes but fixing pipes won't, then it doesn't matter if there are orders of magnitude differences in costs - what will be funded is what gets votes.</p>
<p>If you want to change how the Congress, and the federal government as a whole, spends its money, then you have to change the priorities of the people controlling the money. This means VOTING for people who share your priorities.</p></div>		</li>
