			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually explains a lot, I've always been one to feel like death if I get less than 8 hours of sleep everyday. My friend, on the other hand goes everyday with about 5-6 hours and seems to feel better than me on 8. </p>
<p>My father has always been even worse, needing about 10 hours a day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah shit I sure hope not, my dad has sleep apnea. (If that's the one where he basically just stops breathing for short amounts of time) </p>
<p>My sleep is very strange, I have days where I am in a deep sleep and if you slapped me i might not wake up still, other days I just sleep extremely light and wake up every few hours. On both occasions I feel extremely tired for the rest of the day, sometimes feeling decently awake around midday or evenings. I also have tough times falling asleep on some days, I always assume an extra 30-45 minutes in bed of just relaxing until I pass out. </p>
<p>Another random point, on days that I'm in really deep sleep I have extremely vivid dreams. </p>
<p>My dad sleeping scares the hell out of me, he snores loudly and it's very clear when he's not breathing and it's for minutes. I don't know why but that shit is scary. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The only times I actually fall asleep like a normal homo sapien is when I cuddle with my gf or get really sick. Then I'll sleep 5-6 hours</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So as others pointed out, you can't change your genetic code in any meaningful way yet; BUT, your genetic code isn't all on, and just because you have gene A, doesn't mean outcome A. You have copies of genes, and some people with less of gene A have bigger outcome A because that same gene is upregulated a lot. It's all a bunch of whooey, but the end game in the case for you is that yes you can train yourself to be better at getting up. Med school has done that for me. In a genetic sense, if you keep doing a thing, your body will usually upregulate genes that are appropriate to help you do that thing. </p>
<p>As an example, if you workout, your body will upregulate genes that help burn off bodily fuels to help you workout better. If you sit at a computer all day eating constantly, your body will upregulate genes to help you store fuels as that what you're telling your body you need to be doing now. It's a two way street, your genes influence your and you influence them through your habits. </p>
<p>I like to explain it simply as your genes set up a million different train tracks. You can't get off the rails, but they're all interconnected and you can choose which ones to take. (As in, your genes set up everything you can do, but you have the choice of what you're going to do.) Choo choo mofo. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Gene therapy is right on the border between science and science fiction these days. A day will come when we can make certain changes to our genetic makeup post-birth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true. Due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenetics" target="_blank">epigenetics</a>, the <em>expression</em> of a gene may change without an actual change in the underlying genetic sequence.</p>
<p>Environmental stress can cause a compensating epigenetic effect. Epigenetic effects can persist through cell division and even to offspring through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgenerational_epigenetics" target="_blank">transgenerational epigenetics</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't change genes*. It's literally aprt of your genetic code.</p>
<p>*yet. Gene therapy is starting to look promising, who knows if we in, say, 50 years aren't able to lengthen our endpoint segments of chromosomes (telemeres) to ensure no genetic degredation upon copies as well as full-body gene insertion and replacements. I hope we can. I want a tail. And night vision. Oh, and less sleep would be kidna cool too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lengthening your endpoint segments of genes literally would do nothing beneficial. It would actually screw a lot up because your cells need the end of your gene to give precise directions for where to send the mRNA for translation. Maybe you are thinking of telomeres? Those are the ends of the chromosomes and they do get shortened with division in most cells.</p></div>		</li>
