			<div class="markdown"><p>It's cool that while largely the two phones aren't massively different from an outside perspective asides for the OS, both do things differently behind the scenes that most people don't know about. You end up at the same destination but the route taken is different on both. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The different route is that Android phone manufacturers have been eating the cost of the higher end hardware (more RAM, faster CPU) needed to maintain competitive performance. Before ART, this was far more the case. It's surprising to think about how much unnecessary battery usage tens of millions of phones running Dalvik were gobbling. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>They have another technique that solves the same problem. When an app is closed, it is told that it will happen and get a chance to save its state.</p>
<p>Say you have a notes app open. The entire note and other stuff is in memory. Lets say 1 MB, it could very easily be much more. The app is now told that the memory will be cleared and asked what it wants to save. The note is already saved in storage, it's only in memory so it can be displayed on screen. So the app only saves the filename and the keyboard cursor position, say 1 kB of data.</p>
<p>When you switch back to the app, it opens as if it was the first time you ever used it. Except is sees the saved state, opens the file and moves the keyboard cursor position to the last position.</p>
<p>To you, it will look like the app was never closed, except maybe you notice a slight delay while opening. Just like on iPhone.</p></div>		</li>
