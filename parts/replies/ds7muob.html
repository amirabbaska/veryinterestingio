			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe you are mistaken, we only need to be in space to build a space elevator. It's simply lowering a long, strong cable from geo synchronous to the surface. Space elevators do not need an rockets for construction or operation.</p>
<p>Currently we can only get into space with rockets but there are other ways (lofstrom loop, space plane, space gun)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I could be way off here, but how would increasing the diameter by 1.5 change the Earth to 1.5G? Wouldn't you need to increase the mass by 1.5? I thought gravity was a function of (m1)(m2) / r^2 ?</p>
<p>EDIT: I figured it out. It doesn't. But increasing the size of a sphere increases the mass by a function of r^3.</p>
<p>TL;DR - I forgot we live in three dimensions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but that's changing the distance from r^2 to (1.5r)^2 or 2.25r^2. Am I missing something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely right. In fact it is entirely possible to have a planet produce 1.5G and be smaller than Earth. It would just need to be a lot more dense.</p></div>		</li>
