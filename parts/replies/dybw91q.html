			<div class="markdown"><p>This. One of my former teachers called it a &quot;dead&quot; language because no new words are being coined which makes it easy for terms and jargons to be used without the fear of changes in meaning.</p>
<p>EDIT: As per the ever mindful redditors said down below, words are still being coined and are maintained by the Vatican.  Still convenient enough to use as jargons because word meanings do not change. Thanks for showing me the enlightenment, little DeVoes. :) </p></div>		</li>

Even over the past 50 years, with the discoveries being made in medicine and physiology, the English names for things change all the time. Regions and definitions are shifting. The only thing that isn't? The latin names. God bless Latin</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there really no new words being made?  I took Latin for 2 years in the UK when I was younger and I swear we had &quot;words&quot; for computer and other more modern things.  They could have been an amalgamation or some other words, but for the life of me I can't remember what we used.  Maybe I am wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>new words are being made because the Vatican still has Latin as its official language. It's only ever used in trials and church stuff though. </p>
<p>They needed to add new words to have a basis for the trials and some speeches, because there is obviously no word for &quot;computer&quot; or &quot;car&quot; in Latin.</p>
<p>There is actually a dictionnary you can consult in the Vatican which is sorta up to date. The language is still pretty much &quot;dead&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Latin is used because it doesn't experience semantic change, and this is especially useful for science which needs consistency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is not correct to say that Latin is used in science because it is a dead language. Both of those things are true individually, but one was not the cause of the other. Some scientific fields (<em>e.g.</em> medicine and taxonomy), <em>but not all</em>, use Latin because during the time when those fields were being formalized, many important texts were written originally in Latin. Thus, a physician would need to know how to read Latin. And since a physician in France and one in England would both read and write Latin, it made sense to write new medical texts in Latin in order to reach as broad an audience as possible.</p>
<p>But if you look at newer scientific fields--say, aeronautics or particle physics--you'll find almost no Latin. This despite the fact that Latin is still dead and does not undergo semantic drift. Latin fluency is no longer needed for a scientific education, and thus newly coined scientific terms rarely use Latin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn’t find Latin in particle physics or aeronautics though because the root of the science is based in mathematics.  There isn’t a need to describe natural phenomena in these subjects when mathematics is how individuals communicate.  </p>
<p>I could be wrong but I think the naming of organisms is still influenced by Latin, as well as new medical diagnoses.  That isn’t to say that there are strict rules regarding Latin use, however, but just that there is still a need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make it sound as if only mathematical terms are used in science, which is not true. New names are frequently coined to describe new phenomena. Some examples to illustrate my point: </p>
<p><em>quark</em> - from James Joyce's <em>Finnegan's Wake</em></p>
<p><em>neutrino</em> - from Italian, diminutive of &quot;neutral&quot;</p>
<p><em>color</em> - from English, by analogy to the mixing of primary colors</p>
<p><em>Boson, Fermion</em> - from Satyendra Nath Bose and Enrico Fermi, respectively</p>
<p><em>dark matter</em> - from English because it does not interact via electromagnetism and is therefore &quot;dark&quot;, unable to be seen</p>
<p><em>meson, muon, lepton, hadron, baryon</em>, others - from Greek, still very much a living language</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark in these cases means absent of light. If it were in Latin you’d have the same situation but just a different word. In fact terms like this originate by a physicist calling it “dark matter” as in the adjective “dark” and the noun “matter” but it eventually evolved into its current more proper noun-like usage “dark matter.”</p></div>		</li>
