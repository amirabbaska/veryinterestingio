			<div class="markdown"><p>I think anyone who has children knows this already.  We always try not to over react to our kid's accidents, instead merely asking if she's ok.  99% of the time, she responds with &quot;I'm fine&quot;and runs off.  One time she ate it hard on her bike... Face first over the bars.  Gigantic kid's helmet kept her face off the pavement, fortunately, but still hit the pavement hard.  Mind you, she's 2. Cried for like 2 minutes, the got back on her bike and soldiered on.  Part of good parenting is knowing when to make a big deal out of an accident and when not to.</p></div>		</li>
