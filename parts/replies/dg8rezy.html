<p>Glacial ice is about 0.92 times as dense as water, so being under 1 km of ice is equivalent to having 920 meters of water above you. </p>

<p>Enceladus' surface gravity is 1% that of Earth. As a very rough estimate, wouldn't it mean 1km of ice above you on Enceladus creates about as much pressure as 10m of water on Earth? It's uncomfortable, but humans can swim at that depth without pressure suits or decompression stops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. That would mean that 1 km of ice in Enceladus amounts for about as much pressure as 9.2 m of water on Earth. However, those glaciers must be WAY thicker than 1 km. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. The real question is how deep is the ice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Enceladus' diameter is 500km. If <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/PIA19656-SaturnMoon-Enceladus-Ocean-ArtConcept-20150915.jpg" target="_blank">this wikipedia diagram</a> is any accurate, the ice ranges from 11km to 15km thick. If it can be translated to 1% pressure, it'd imply about 100m to 140m water pressure equivalence on Earth. This is beyond pressure levels considered safe for scuba diving, although some expert divers exceed this depth.</p>
<p>Perhaps more interestingly, a wide range of marine life can exist in such depths. If pressure scales to 1% of Earth's, it's less than 2% of the pressure at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, and some forms of marine life were discovered even on its bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about the volume of the ice? It takes more space than water so would that increase the pressure. On Earth when the Arctic freezes the water just moves out of the way. Enceladus being completely covered the water has no where to go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Enceladus is tidally locked to Saturn though, so unless I'm really misunderstanding what that means, it shouldn't have tides, right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's in a non circular orbit so it get closer and further away from Saturn as it orbits. The change in gravity causes the moon to change shape as it orbits generating heat and possibly tides. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being tidally-locked does not necessarily mean that all the surface mass stays on that spot. Tidally locked means the planet's rotational period around its own rotation axis is equal to its revolution period. In simpler terms a day lasts as long as a year, in reference to the Saturn in this example of course.</p>
<p>But to that you have to add other forces as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>the effects of other bodies (Sun, Jupiter, other local moons)</li>
<li>consider Saturn as a mass distribution as well. There is nothing preventing Saturn's atmosphere to exhibit tide-like properties thus changing Saturns mass distribution. The semi-major axis of Enceladus is 237 948km (very small eccentricity so let's just call it orbit radius) while the diameter of Saturn is 116 464km which would be hardly dismisable(?word) in this case. </li>
<li>consider any libration effects too. Even though the orbit has very low eccentricity it still is not perfectly round, and with these masses and distances this could have significant effects especially given that, unlike the long orbital period of the moon (~27 days), the orbital period of Enceladus is only ~40h. Any libration effects would then reposition the exact closest point, or point under the most gravitational influence of Saturn, therefore if you were just standing in a single spot you would measure certain oscillations.  </li>
<li>Consider temperature change and how perhaps someone more educated in oceanic physics could elaborate on th</li>
</ul>
<p>Now to say, I do not know and have not bothered to check if any of these effects exist for Enceladus, but they do exist for most objects so I find it natural to assume they would. These &quot;tides&quot; would be faaaar less than the tides that would occur if Enceladus wasn't tidally locked to Saturn, of course, so you are correct on that notion. However, physics would then also dictate that the planet soon becomes tidally locked again as with these masses and distances these &quot;tides&quot; would have a lot of energy associated with them which would usually be spent working against the rotation, they would truly be very destructive.</p></div>		</li>
