			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response! I use an app called sleep cycle in which I set a time, say 7 am, and based on how much I move while sleeping, it measures the rhythm of my sleep for when I am in the lightest sleep, and wakes me up during this time.  It takes a period of thirty minutes and adjusts accordingly.  It definitely helps but as someone else identified below, it may be because I have a demanding day ahead of me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It takes the movements on your mattress.  Before you go to bed, you place it face down on your mattress under your sheet and it takes a reading of your movements, if I understood it correctly.  Kind of eerie, but I've given up on trying to keep my privacy while using mobile devices.  I like it a lot though. It's way better than waking up to BEEP BEEPing in your ear.  It's like wind chimes or something.  Very soothing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can confirm. Was getting up easy at 5:30 all summer to go to the gym because the sun rose around then right through my window. Now the sun only decides to show up around 6:30 and it's impossible to get up earlier and now I hate everyone and everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have one of these.  They dont work well. You know why? The light they produce is no way near the same as sunlight.  Its the equivalent of someone just turning the light on.  Sure thatll wake you up a bit, but it wont give you that refreshed feeling.  Fifteen minutes into being awake and youll start feeling tired again.</p>
<p>They need to make ones where the light has a similar spectrum as what you get when the sun rises.</p>
<p>If one like this exists, please link me to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No joke, man. It's crazy how much Northeastern Winter will fuck with your ability to wake up feeling refreshed, despite being on a regular schedule. Also doesn't help the sun starts setting at 4:30pm or whatever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate it any time of year. I worked days for 6 months a couple years ago and could never get used to it. I ran back to 2-10 as fast as I could, and even now I hate subbing early for my boss when he's off. Even if I get 9 hours the night before, I'm still tired and crabby.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, I have a light blocking curtain and the difference between when it's closed vs. open in terms of waking up is crazy. I wake up naturally just a little before my alarm clock when they're open and it's awesome. When they're closed I'll sleep till like 1pm (which is great for days I want to sleep in!). Needless to say I always leave them open on days I need to wake up early. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahh see I have blinds and a curtain - the blinds my apartment came with like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/HIygsTy.png" target="_blank">these</a> which light easily penetrates when closed but you can't see in or out, and then I bought a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LyhKUq9.png" target="_blank">light blocking curtain</a> which blocks all light. So I just pull the curtain back to let light in, but my blinds are still closed so people can't see in. </p></div>		</li>
