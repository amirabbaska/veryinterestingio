			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, do smoke or icky smells make people sneeze? I can't remember either of those things happening. When I sneeze, it mostly seems to be out of nowhere. That's why I've always been confused about the reasoning. Also I sneeze like seven times in a row. People get tired of saying gezundheit after the first 3. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a doctor, scientist, or lawyer. But based on the above answer re: nerve endings I imagine it's something akin to an itch inside your sinuses.</p>
<p>Like if my hand itches I scratch it. If my sinuses itch I suffer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The incomplete response still sets off some “sneeze me out” processes in your nose, which give you the feeling of needing to sneeze. That burning sensation normally ceases when the sneeze is completed, but because there’s no climax, it just kinda fades out. Similar to losing an orgasm. Sill feels good, but there’s no peak like in the full completed process</p></div>		</li>
