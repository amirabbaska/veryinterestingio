			<div class="markdown"><p>This leads to an extra question how is the us justice competent for sites based out of the US and owned by non US people ? Thc site can still be reached in the US but wouldn't it be normally for the justice system of the country where they live to judge them ? Especially, when the American system is way harder than in other countries </p></div>		</li>
