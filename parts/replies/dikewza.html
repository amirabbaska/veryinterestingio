<p>Edit. I don't mean to sound like you are wrong just something this post and your comment made me think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think parallax is more related to height, our &quot;science-y questions answered&quot; radio show covered it. Basically people are likely to speed in a four wheel drive that's higher off the ground because it feels slower than a low car (if that's what they're used to)</p>
<p>Bikes, motorbikes, and most cars would have you at roughly the same height most of the time, but it probably plays a part when you stand up on a bike along with the extra wind resistance slowing you down a bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, sitting on a motorcycle puts your eyes at the same level of a truck.  Consider that the seat on a typical motorcycle is round about 30 inches and then you sit on top of that so add the height from you seated position to your eyes.  I just point this out as I could easily see into most cars while on my moto and it was scary.  Stop texting in your lap while driving at 75 mph on the freeway!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently got a car which is quite low, you drive in a semi-racing sort of position. Theoretically, its a faster car and I assumed I would start to drive faster in it. But being closer to the ground changed my perception of the speed I was going so that I actually drove slightly slower than I used to. It's also noticeably more tricky to park accurately because you see less below the windows and you are seeing the parking spaces from a shallower angle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;I was slowing down to stop. You know how you get a bit impatient? 'Oh, well, I'll just open the door.' Fortunately I looked back at the speedo and I was still doing 70.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in your motorcycle helmet, your up-down vision is restricted (you can't see the ground below you like on a bike), so you'd expect the sensation of objects rushing past to be less. You lose lose sight of the ground at the point it does the edge-of-the-win95-star-screensaver-thing.</p></div>		</li>
