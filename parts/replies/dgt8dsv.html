			<div class="markdown"><p>Why in the world would someone stay on the phone for 30 minutes with someone who is insulting them? Wouldn't they just hang up as soon as it's obvious you're not buying what they're selling?</p>
<p>In any case, I feel like most of the calls I get these days aren't even humans, just robot voices. Maybe it would be a human eventually if I stuck around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started getting constant calls from the IRS scammers about a year and a half ago and eventually just lost my shit on them one day because they called me while I was on my way to the hospital to give birth. So if I were a more confrontational person and had time to waste, I could see myself doing this. Instead I just screen all unfamiliar numbers and then check my voicemail once in a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh I just get to the point where they want a cc number i tell them I have to go get it and I occasionally say I'm still looking for it. It's amazing how long they'll hang on though they do seem to get frustrated.  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I stopped the fake microsoft guys this way. </p>
<p>I tell them I was out in the yard, and had to walk to the house. 5 minutes of them asking &quot;Sir. Are you at your computer yet&quot; and I don't answer, or may just say &quot;not yet, still walking&quot;. They continue the question, then I act alerted because &quot;Damnit I forgot my gun in the woods! I will be right back&quot;</p>
<p>Eventually around the 15 minute mark I tell them i'm at the computer. They ask me to go to start, etc but I cut them off and start complaining that its still starting, and its so slow, i'm glad they called me.</p>
<p>I normally never have the patience myself to get to the part where I act like a confused hillbilly who can't find the start bar, its around 25-30 minutes in the call already and I just set the phone down on mute and check back on it in an hour or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice, you can't hurt them with anything besides taking their time from scamming the next guy </p>
<p>I always &quot;go get the homeowner&quot; and say I'm walking to the workshop in the back. Every time they start talking again I beg and plead to hold on because I'm almost there and &quot;you do want to talk to the homeowner don't you?&quot;. Then I'm working on a very tricky lock and give a long explanation about how to juggle it just right before lifting just so etc.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I'm watching tv, playing game, working on whatever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are coding tools online that will generate fake CC numbers that pass the check-digit test, but fail if you tried to run them since nothing else would match. </p>
<p>I'll usually give the scammer at least a few CC #s that look fake from this, but pass the basic check digit test, and it strings them along for another 5-10 minutes while I pretend I don't know why the card numbers I gave them aren't working. </p></div>		</li>
