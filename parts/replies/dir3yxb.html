<p>I've always thought this to be the case since led lights are renowned to give an unnatural look on film/stage eleven when the colour temp of the lights is the same as the incandescent globes they replace. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it matters. In addition to the spectral emmittance of the light source, you have to consider the spectral reflectance of the objects. You might walk into a store with spikey fluorescent lights, and find a blue shirt that you like. This &quot;blue&quot; shirt reflects some red wavelengths as well, but the store lighting isn't emitting any energy at those wavelengths. Then when you step outside, your blue shirt is suddenly purple because the sun emits at all visible wavelengths and the shirt is now reflecting both blue and red. </p>
<p>There's a standardized calculation called Color Rendering Index (CRI) where the color of a set of objects under an artificial light source is compared to their color under natural lighting of the same color temperature. You'll see it stamped on the box of any professional light and sometimes on the bulbs you can buy for your house. (it's actually not a very robust metric, as the number of objects is pretty small) </p>
<p>Edit: also, my claim that the sun emits at all visible wavelengths isnt precisely true, the atmosphere filters out some very narrow bands of energy but that's not important in most cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New LED lights blend different colors of 'white' to follow the curve of black-body radiation, even when dimmed. I'm curious how this would look filmed though, as it mimics the arc by playing with colors our eyes see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: &quot;accurately imitating daylight&quot; is basically a solved problem, given enough money...</p>
<p>I'd just like to add some more thoughts, if I may :-)</p>
<p>The chart you linked to shows a 3000K incandescent bulb, which is typical for a halogen bulb (tungsten filament in bromine/iodine doped argon or something similar in a quartz envelope) while an old style (tungsten filament in argon) bulb would typically be about 2700K - noticeably yellowish by comparison^1 Halogen bulbs are produced up to about 3400K, which gives a whiter still light, but still falls somewhat short of daylight.</p>
<p>At the same power consumption, a hotter incandescent bulb is &quot;brighter&quot;. partly this is because a hotter filament actually emits more of its energy at visible wavelengths, wasting proportionally less as heat. Partly this is because a whiter colour which <em>looks</em> brighter per watt of visible light, owing to the way our eyes respond to different wavelengths.^0</p>
<p>At the lower end of the power range, more powerful bulbs tend to be hotter and therefore whiter, though there's a limit to how hot the filament can get without burning out in an unacceptably short time - halogen allows a higher temperature than argon, so once the temperature limit is reached, increasing the power means adding more filament at the same temperature.</p>
<p>So, to create a light source with an <em>actual</em> temperature comparable to sunlight, we need a light source heated to about 6000-6500K which is, in technical terms &quot;fricking hot&quot;. There are a couple of ways to do this, but they all come at a cost. Arc lights (basically lightning in a bottle) are very bright and produce very white or even blue light, but they are expensive and inconvenient to run, have short running times, and produce a lot of UV which needs filtering out for most uses. HID lights in cars are a form of arc lights and their distinctive bluish tinge is now so sought after that even incandescent bulbs often have a blue filter on them that actually makes them give <em>less</em> light. (SMH)</p>
<p>The other technologies mentioned above (LEDs and Fluorescent tubes) only emit at a handful of wavelengths (e.g. the fluorescent &quot;daylight&quot; bulb on my desk with an apparent colour temperature of 6400K appears to emit in 7 or 8 distinct colours^2 ranging from a scarlet red to violet. For direct ingestion by the human eye, this is overkill - in fact, your monitor almost certainly uses only three colours to produce the full range of colours you want to see, but if you want to illuminate arbitrary surfaces and have the <em>reflected</em> light also mimic how daylight would reflect, then the gaps between those colour bands begin to matter.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a surface that reflects 625nm light very effectively, but not so much at other wavelengths, in daylight, it'll look very bright orangey red - perhaps it's a rose petal.</p>
<p>Illuminated by a computer screen emitting &quot;white&quot; light at 650nm (&quot;red&quot;), 570nm (&quot;green&quot;) and 475nm (&quot;blue&quot;), it'll reflect very little even though the light might look white. For this reason, the use of the light must be taken into consideration when deciding if it &quot;accurately imitates daylight&quot;.^3</p>
<p>Illuminated by my daylight bulb designed with this kind of usage in mind, it would reflect some light from one phosphor and some light from another phosphor and probably look much closer to how daylight would make it appear, but not close enough for a photographer with a chip on his shoulder, and certainly not close enough for a scientist using a spectrometer to discover the chemical make-up of the target...</p>
<p>^0 Our eyes have three kinds of cones, (well, some have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness" target="_blank">less</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy" target="_blank">more</a>) each with its own colour range of sensitivity, as well as rods which are more sensitive in low light levels. The net effect is that our eyes are most sensitive to light at a wavelength of about 555nm.</p>
<p>^1 Confusingly, these yellower coloured lights often get described as &quot;warm&quot; light versus whiter / bluer colours being described as &quot;cool&quot; light because we associate yellow with sunshine and bluish light with cloudy days. In fact, to produce the whiter / bluer colours of light requires higher temperatures</p>
<p>^2 Easy to see by looking at the rainbow-like reflection of it in a CD/DVD (I assume it works with blu-ray but I don't have one to hand and have never bothered looking) the finely spaced tracks act like a diffraction grid and separate the different wavelengths. An incandescent light will show a smooth rainbow, a fluorescent or LED light will show as multiple distinct bands of colour. I wrapped my bulb in tinfoil with a small hole poked in it to get a nice sharp image.</p>
<p>^3 I have a friend who (among other things) sets up lighting for huge gigs (think of a band - he's probably set up their lights) and even though LEDs are a huge power saving and are used for lots of things, they're never used for illumination, because they make everything look weird without spending more fixing that problem than you'd spend on incandescents.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to explain in more detail without delving into some rather obscure terminology or tortured analogies, but I'll try!</p>
<p>If you imagine that each number from 1 to 100 represents a colour of light, pure &quot;white&quot; light would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ..., 99, 100.</p>
<p>Your eyes, however, can't be bothered with that many colours and just counts colours 0-33 as &quot;red&quot;, colours 34-66 as &quot;green&quot; and colours 67-100 as &quot;blue&quot;.</p>
<p>Many surfaces reflect a range of colours of light (perhaps all the numbers under 50, perhaps every number between 70 and 80). When you shine &quot;white&quot; light on one of these surfaces, it'll reflect all the colours it can reflect and you'll get all the numbers below 50, or all the numbers from 70-80 reflected back. Your eyes say &quot;hmm, that surface has plenty of 0-33 light and quite a bit of 34-66 light - it looks yellow to me!&quot; or &quot;hmm, that surface has quite a bit of 67-100 light - it looks deep blue to me!&quot;</p>
<p>If you shine a &quot;special&quot; light on these, with only <em>odd</em> numbers, you'll get &quot;all the <em>odd</em> numbers below 50&quot; and &quot;all the <em>odd</em> numbers from 70-80) reflected back. Your eyes still see &quot;a bunch of red and green&quot; -&gt; &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;quite a bit of blue&quot; -&gt; deep blue.</p>
<p>Imagine, though, that you have a surface that reflects only even numbers below 50, or only odd numbers from 61-69. In white light, as before, these reflect lots of red &amp; green and quite a bit of blue respectively - your eyes see them much as they did before. In our &quot;special&quot; light, while the blue surface looks much as it did before, the formerly yellow surface now looks black!</p>
<p>So, now switching from one light to the other completely changes how these two colours look next to each other. Under one light, you see a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Sweden#/media/File:Flag_of_Sweden.svg" target="_blank">Swedish flag</a>, under the other, you see the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_United_Kingdom#/media/File:Flag_of_Saint_David.svg" target="_blank">flag of Saint David</a> - pretty embarrassing if you're hosting the Olympics and you used LED lighting light the parade!</p>
<p>In reality, the wavelengths of light emitted by a light or reflected by a surface aren't quite as clearly delineated as my analogy would suggest, so the contrast between one light and another is rarely as stark as this, but it can certainly be enough to make the scenery behind your school play look very weird!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the atmosphere filters this light. Sunlight in Italia is different from sunlight in Norway. So the question is not how do we mimic the light coming from the sun, but how do we mimic sunlight in X place coming from the sun?</p></div>		</li>
