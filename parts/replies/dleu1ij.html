<p>Really, you're a great parent by the sound of it. Kudos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When my kids were around a year we could hardly get them to eat anything, they rejected virtually everything except milk. I was fully onboard with the &quot;just feed them different things&quot; but it simply didn't work.  It's still hard, no matter how much we try, letting them go hungry makes them crazy and angry, and then they still won't eat anything healthy. </p>
<p>People saying it's easy have had easy kids, and often think everyone else is an idiot.  Kids are very different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dad used to say, &quot;you'll eat it if you're hungry enough&quot;. He was right. We never had a choice of what was for dinner, you ate what they gave you. But, I disgress, as a parent myself it's pretty tough to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way you worded that might get you some downvotes. However, you are right. Speaking from experience I learned to eat whatever was put in front of me, no matter how much or how little I enjoyed it because sad food&gt;no food. That became ingrained in me and I still eat almost everything.</p>
<p>The real key to get kids to eat anything is simple, make it taste good. The art of cooking is dying, it's a shame that parents don't cook for their  children more. I had pizza maybe once every 3 months, never mac and cheese, no fast food or pre packaged meals. My parents would cook dinner all the time, and if they were working during dinner hours, would have a meal for me in the fridge to eat when I got hungry. I really appreciate how far my dad went to ensure I was a good eater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two kids, raised exactly the same way - same food options, approach, etc. Daughter will eat (or at least try) whatever we serve, my son  can literally go days without eat anything, and when he does - it's only ever carbs or some specific fruit. I'm grateful for the wealth of information provided by nutritionists and paediatric specialists, but get really annoyed when my sons picky eating is blamed on poor parenting. Kids are people, with individual opinions and preferences and sensitivities.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best example of that for me is my twins. Because they are twins they are being raised exactly the same. As opposed to their older sister where we are are TRYING to raise them the same, but time and experience means it's not going to be the same. One twin is a WAY more picky eater than the other. So when it comes to this stuff - sometimes it's the kids, not the parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm having a difficult time with my daughter, right now. We literally had a one hour fight over the tiniest cube of chicken and no amount of care-free attitude, compromise or cajoling was going to get her to eat that chicken. Which is ridiculous because she loves chicken sausages (where I can hide some veggies) and chicken nuggets. She won't eat any veggies that aren't hidden. </p>
<p>But she'll eat fruit and yoghurt like nobody's business, so I take solace in that. But I do feel like I'm frequently being judged because of her picky appetite </p>
<p>(Although I found that she does eat a more diverse range of food at child care) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah! That sounds like me as a kid. In my defense, my mom bought hard into the &quot;All fat is bad, period!&quot; trend. She's stripped fats so far out of her diet that dark meat turkey gives her gallstones. As an adult cooking for myself, I eat chicken all the goddamn time. Pan-sear a thigh in olive oil and wine, with just a dash of garlic, salt, and rosemary, and I'm a happy camper. But I still can't eat chicken that my mom prepares. It's dried-out, chewy, and disgusting. As a kid, she would fight me tooth and nail to eat that disgusting chicken breast.</p>
<p>Maybe try a different cut of chicken or cook it a different way. It could be that what you're trying to get her to eat is just too dry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kids are weird. Also, the day care thing is REAL! My mom has owns 2 daycares (400 kids total) and kids have a very high understanding of situational awareness. At day care they generally eat better and behave better. They know unconsciously that these aren't their parents and aren't going to take shit from them like their parents do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This shows that it's not inherent, it's what she thinks she can get away with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate hate HATE seeing &quot;if your kids won't eat, starve'em. And also your cooking is probably shit or you're feeding them junk.&quot; </p>
<p>It's such a shitty 19 year old edgelord attitude from people who have obviously never been caregivers for a person with multiple sensory/processing issues. My kid has food issues related to taste/texture, junk food gets rejected right along &quot;healthy&quot; foods. It's not about &quot;bad parenting&quot; or &quot;giving in to tantrums&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
