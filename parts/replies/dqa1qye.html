			<div class="markdown"><p>Also don't forget that you can't really remove/kill all the bacteria, nor do you want to. If you did, then you just allow the first random culture to take over your mouth and it might be a nasty variety that's hard to dislodge. What we really want is a probiotic solution in which we have exactly the right bacterial strain move in which does not produce destructive acids and is strong enough to ward off other invaders that would replace it. You'd still want to brush to remove food, but once such a solution is developed, it could mean the end of tooth decay.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure, your mouth would probably be gross and full of food, but still... no bacteria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn’t work because the Listerine won’t be able to penetrate between the stuck food and your teeth. Like the difference between scrubbing a dish and just rinsing it off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of, maybe, no.</p>
<p>Alcohol and alcohol based disinfectants work in two ways: firstly by breaking down (effectively dissolving) the phospholipid membrane around a bacterial cell leading to cell destruction, and then also by denaturing proteins such an enzymes so they won't work anymore. For this to happen, there needs to be contact between the alcohol and the bacteria. If the bacteria is protected from the environment by contamination in the mouth, then irrelevent of how long you keep the Listerine in your mouth, it will never reach the bacteria.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that the cell membrane of animal cells is exactly the same as bacteria, and the same process will happen to those cells. Not fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dental student here.  Couldn’t agree more...the analogy i like is pressure washing the dirt off the rims. Not matter if you are using 1500 psi, the rims stay dirty but a slight wipe with your finger at .25 psi is enough. Same concept for teeth.</p></div>		</li>
