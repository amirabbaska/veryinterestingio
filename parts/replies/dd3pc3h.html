			<div class="markdown"><p>is there a specific reason it's the speed of sound? I imagine it must have to do with a law that dictates flow through a medium, but I'd imagine that the speed of sound depends on the material through which it's traveling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of sound through metal vs other mediums for example would vary. Sound is vibrations, you can relabel &quot;speed of sound&quot; with &quot;how fast the effected molecules interact with other molecules in that medium&quot;. When you have a jet going above the speed of sound, its really going though its medium faster than the molecules in the medium are able to interact with each other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this was the answer I was looking for. so, when original commenter says &quot;speed of sound&quot;, he's not necessarily talking about terrestrial, conventional, 340m/s speed of sound, but whatever the average speed of sound for the object encountering the black hole is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so this made me thing of a slightly different question. Lets say something with 10,000 times the mass of a black hole is on a direct collision course with it. What would happen? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be torn apart, into a long string of rubble, and most of that rubble would become part of the black hole's accretion disk, falling inward over time, radiating a <em>lot</em>, and eventually passing the event horizon after which point the black holes mass would increase and the area of the event horizon as well.</p>
<p>There is <em>nothing</em> that could survive a close brush with a black hole, and frankly the more massive the object the more it's going to subjected to devastating tidal forces along its massive bulk. In short, it would break apart, at first a little, then a lot, as it entered a decaying orbit around the black hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, it wouldn't like just suck up to the parts that get close enough and basically punch a nice sized hole through he middle? That is what I pictured happening and I thought it would be pretty cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the incoming object has 10,000 times the mass, wouldn't the black hole pass right though it (consuming some of it, obviously), and potentially start orbiting the larger object, depending on the speeds and angles involved?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short(ish) answer: It depends on how big or, by extension, dense the 'something' is. Below a certain size something ten thousand times the mass of a black hole will be dense enough to be a black hole itself. If the something isn't a black hole then, depending on the size/density and relative speed of the object and the black hole, the object would most likely either be completely pulled into the accretion disk and then the black hole; or the black hole would travel through it, scavenging mass from the object along its path, but ultimately passing through it and out the other size. </p>
<p>I am a nurse, there is no reason for you to trust me on any of this, but I think I'm right. </p></div>		</li>
