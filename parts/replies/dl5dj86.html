			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah intermittent and long term fasting is a known weight loss program. I was 266lbs and I'm currently 198 because of a combination of intermittent fasting and a ketogenic diet. I'm in the middle of cutting weight for a boxing match at 178 which is why I'm fasting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey sorry it took me so long to get back to you all. I literally just rolled my car and was dealing with that. </p>
<p>Honestly my fasting is really easy. I only eat between 6 and 7am. I work nights so I get off work at 5. I go home and eat a meal mostly consisting of fatty meats like bacon or salami. Cheeses are good too. I try to avoid chicken since it has so much protein it can cause problems with your ketogenic diet. I slather most of it in butter or oil to increase the fat content and then I supliment with multivitamins. I eat less than 25 grams of carbs and drink plenty of water. Usually the main course itself is around 12 oz of fatty meat. After that I go to sleep until around 2 or 3. I get up and go about my day with things like house work and going to the gym before I go to work at 10. The fasting is done all day. I only eat between 6 and 7 in the morning and that's it. Sorry to cut this short I will probably return. Have to deal with my car. </p>
<p>Edit: OK I'm back my cars totalled and I'm out 3 grand but I walked away with literally just a scratch on my elbow despite being in a car that rolled twice at 75 miles an hour. Lucky as fuck. Not important on to the diet. </p>
<p>The key is understanding no diet is good or bad for you in the correct dosage. My diet is a cholesterol death trap at times but I cycle it for that very reason. Instead of constantly sitting on my diet and killing myself with it I cycle on and cycle off. It keeps cholesterol down. The alternative is finding other low carb high fat foods that don't have high cholesterol but I find those flavorless and boring. I usually do a 4 week cycle and spend at least 2 weeks off my cycle to bring my body back to a normal non ketonic state and to let it recuperate. As long as you don't go totally insane with your diet when you're off the keto diet you should have no issue keeping the weight off. What I like to do is lose as much as I can until I either hit my goal weight or 4 weeks has passed. If 4 weeks passes then I switch to a high protein low carb diet and start bulking as much muscle mass as possible.  If I hit my goal weight then I'm done with the ketogenic and fasting and switch to the same high protein low card diet and try to get my muscles full and ready for the fight. I wait for the week of my fight and dehydrate the remaining 8lbs. Dehydrating weight is only good for very temporary weight loss and that's it. Like literally a day or two. Don't ever dehydrate unless you know what you're doing and how to do it safely. </p></div>		</li>
