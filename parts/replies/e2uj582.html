			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. They're only similar in diffusion being the method of exchange. </p>
<p>Lungs and gills are very different structurally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fish sometimes have urea anyway, to balance osmosis and adapt to different levels of salinity. In fact it's thought that having an alternate path to deal with ammonia waste besides gills was an evolutionary capture of that pathway that made amphibians, and then land animals, possible!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah interesting, I had assumed that ammonia being highly toxic yet highly soluble meant it would be instantly diluted in the aquatic habitat of fish which would negate the toxic effects removing the need for urea but you make a good point! How do they form the urea do you know? Is it similar to humans in the liver? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gill filaments, or lamellae, act like hair strands that separate in water, but stick together when pulled out. The reason fish suffocate on land  is due to the lamellae ‘sticking together’ out of water and reducing the surface area so less O2 is diffused into the bloodstream, thus, suffocation</p></div>		</li>
