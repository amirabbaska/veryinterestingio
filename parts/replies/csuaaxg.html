			<div class="markdown"><p>And even then, thousands of years is hardly a drop in the bucket to the millions/billions/ possibly trillions of years some stars end up living (counting the lifespan of white dwarfs). It's quite a stretch to say LONG gone for any star on that timescale...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  The Sun is far away, right?</p>
<p>Well the sun is only ~8 light-minutes away.  This means Voyager is ~135x farther away than the sun.  That's pretty far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, whilst that seems like a short amount of time, thinking how fast light travels then that it takes 18 hours to go that distance really is crazy. Just to grasp it easier, is it 18 hours in the past or future?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would see 18 hours into the past. Bear in mind that, in this case, the light goes from
Sun -8 minutes&gt; Earth -18 hours&gt; Voyager
And Voyager is seeing the light that hit Earth 18 hours ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would take another 18 hours to send that picture back to earth. By the time we saw it we would be seeing a picture 36 hours old. However if we told it to take a picture right now it would take 18 hours to get the signal so the picture would arrive in 36 hours from now and be 18 hours old. Also the picture would contain the exact moment we sent the signal to take the picture. </p></div>		</li>
