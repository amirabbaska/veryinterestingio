			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand what the alt-right is, and how the internet hosts sites that such communities settle on. But my understanding is that 4chan's community used to be--if not outright liberal--more diverse or apolitical. I'm curious about how the culture on that site had developed in this way, and why.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just speculating, but if you create a place where it's considered funny to be shocking (gross images, using the n-word) there will be some set of visitors that get it is shock humor and some that are like &quot;Finally, I get to say the n-word!  These are my people!&quot;</p>
<p>To the people there for shock humor, eventually it gets old and they move on, but the people who were saying these types of things in more honest expression will still find it to be a refreshingly free place to speak and will stick around.  The population starts to shift.</p>
<p>And there is probably also some amount of people going in thinking it's all a joke but after being inundated with it for long enough, start to internalize the joke and start thinking differently.</p>
<p>Again, just speculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly my experience with places like 4chan. It used to be a pretty good place for things that were generally shocking or in poor taste. On top of that you had the lulz, memes, etc. 4chan used to be a bunch of non racists laughing at a racist joke. Now its basically a bunch of actual racists who attempt humor but just end up with hate speech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is my experience. Though my sense of humor hasn't changed, I got tired of the same &quot;content&quot; and lost interest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really useful way to think about 4cham users. Mostly just edgy teenagers passing through until they grow out of it, and also a few actual racists who just like it there</p></div>		</li>

<p>It still is for the most part.</p>
<p>Anything 4chan has ever done has been &quot;for the lulz&quot;. The primary goal of any 4chan led event has been messing with people, be that naming a Mt Dew line &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong&quot; or starting a fake Bieber cancer movement to get people to shave their heads for no reason. For the most part, anything they do is meant to have shock value, and their support of Trump falls in this category.</p>
<p>4chan is just getting lumped in with everyone else that supported Trump, and the whole pepe-the-hate-frog thing happened, where a fairly universal meme was shown in the news media as a hate symbol out of ignorance. This kind of stuck, causing 4chan to be associated with the right wingers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Alt-right&quot; is VERY rarely used by anyone that would be referred to by &quot;the normies&quot; as such to identify themselves. Richard Spencer embraced it because it gave him a spotlight. </p>
<p>So, is 4chan really &quot;affiliated&quot; with members of the alt-right? No. The ideas expressed on /pol/ might be seen as alt-right, but I would place bets that they would not self-reference as such. </p>
<p>The &quot;alt-right&quot; doesn't really exist in the way it is being portrayed by the media and even in the comments here, but angry opposition to far-left ideas that are becoming mainstream, does exist. When people are angry, they say incredulous, offensive things. We are all human, after all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh c'mon....</p>
<p>There is a large following of people on /pol/ who believe that non-whites have a low IQ and are genetically predisposed to violence, and that white people should create a white nation-state in the US, and prevent women from having sex with non-white men.</p>
<p>That's not a silly joke among them, that's a serious stance that many of them hold up as a foundation of their political stances.</p>
<p>The media has watered down the word &quot;alt right&quot;, but it had a real meaning and was a damn useful term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't go that far.</p>
<p>I'd say it's because they don't delete comments left and right (no pun intended). </p>
<p>They have more freedom what gets posted and/or deleted. </p>
<p>But on Reddits you get banned from subreddits if you are subscribed to the opposing view, get banned when you challenge the opposing &quot;team&quot;, get limited to how much you can post if you get downvoted a lot.</p>
<p>And thats why there is a heavier concentracion of &quot;alt-right&quot; people there, because they have the freedom to express themselves more freely. </p>
<p>People who get banned or downvoted a lot here, just simply move to 4chan in my opinion. A lot of them start there, because they know how much freeier(?) they are there. </p>
<p>A lot of it is just shitposting, which a lot of it would break reddits rules.  Keep that in mind. </p></div>		</li>
