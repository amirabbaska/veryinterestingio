			<div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a response that's similar but perhaps with a bit more on how attention differs from the basic process of reading, and a bit about fatigue. </p>
<p>Attention is mediated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and a few related areas, which very easily divert attention to other sensory info or thoughts. Also, these areas do a harder job putting together inputs from the other parts of the brain and making them into cohesive thoughts in your working memory, as well as a bunch of other things like controlling your emotional reactions and bodily movements etc. This means they get fatigued and stop working somewhat when you've been reading for too long. </p>
<p>In contrast, the visual and auditory cortices take in manageable amounts of information, especially if you're in a quiet room with no distractions. Therefore it's a lot easier to take in the words and even hear them in your mind - having them in your sensory memory - even if your PFC is focusing on other thoughts or simply too tired to do its job. Eventually (ironically) the PFC leads you to realise you just read something (and you even remember the last few words!) but haven't taken anything in. </p>
<p>The full picture with all the details on reading specifically would require quite a lot of research, but this is the overall gist. </p>
<p>Edit: just realised this is ELI5! Mine is more of an r/AskScience answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do teach it to teachers. Most of it is based in psychology and biology. You have to back up your lesson plans with this information to make sure you're an effective teacher. This is done by turning in lesson plans every week to administrators and looked at during observations of your teaching by many different people.</p>
<p>Education today in elementary school (specifically) looks nothing like it did when most of us went to school. Lecturing is a thing of the past and self discovery has taken over which is far more effective. </p>
<p>They've also decided to let teachers tailor their education to each student by allowing for modifications and differentiations which allows for students below grade level to improve their skills at their rate and they feel successful so they are more likely to learn new skills of their own free will. This also translates to those students on grade level and above grade level.</p>
<p>There's so much more emphasis on the student and how their brains work including nature and nurture. There's an incredible amount of information on how a student's socio-economic status affects brain development and other things.</p>
<p>There are other factors in our education system that are causing problems and ineffective teachers are the least of the US's problems, but know that for every bad teacher out there (they definitely exist) a great and passionate teacher exists that is changing students lives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains why in high school I could never answer a question (well) after reading a portion of anything aloud. Was always thinking about how I sounded, if I was loud enough, etc. instead of what I was actually reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure that everyone has had this experience at some point in their education. Makes me wonder why they force kids to read out loud without somehow explaining this to them. Wouldn't it be better for kids that are new to reading out loud to know that it's difficult for everyone to focus on their voice and the content at the same time and that is why they are reading to the class. To build that skill. Maybe they did explain this to us but once they said you'll be reading out loud I zoned out because of fear and forgot the explanation. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh god - number 3 is the reason I can't remember anything from where I put my phone to learning a new move in a BJJ class to listening in and processing stuff during a meeting at work. </p>
<p>Might be easier I didn't have 1-2 ear worms singing in my head, a day dream about what would have happened if (xyz), how I should have done abc better, what I need to do after work in addition to paying attention to what's actually going on around me. </p>
<p>It shouldn't be this hard at the age of 40ish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello fellow BJJ-er, yeah, me too. This year I started trying to focus more when the instructor explains the move and trying to make more connections in different ways in my head to what's going on. Seems to help. </p>
<p>For all you non-BJJ-ers, feel free to ignore!  Or try jiujitsu but be aware, it's pretty life-changing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tried that and it does help a little bit. Lately I've been imagining myself doing the move and moving my own body just a tiny bit as the instructor does the move. I have too much pride to be &quot;one of those people&quot; who acts out the move as the instructor does it. I reckon if I could swallow my pride and just do it thine that would help a lot. The more I'm doing something with my body the less time spent indulging all the other noise in my head.</p></div>		</li>
