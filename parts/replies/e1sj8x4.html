			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d say yes it would make sense theoretically assuming you’d be ok with imaginary results from equations about say the force between two charged particles. In that sense the math would be consistent because complex analysis is consistent. </p>
<p>Other things to think about though,  the existence of an imaginary charge would imply the existence of a negative imaginary charge as well. How might imaginary charges interact with normal charges if at all?</p></div>		</li>
