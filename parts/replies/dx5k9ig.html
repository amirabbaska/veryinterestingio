			<div class="markdown"><p>Sri. English grammar forbids words that start sr-. It's a rule we learn instinctively. And when we see it we automatically replace it with shri because that works grammatically. Spanish does the same thing with words that start sc- or sk-. And it's not until someone points it out that it ever occurs to us to question how we say it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Example 2: glottal tap in certain British accents (i.e. Bottle becomes *bo'ul)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you're mixing up the glottal stop and alveolar tap here? At least I've never heard of a glottal tap. Both appear as allophones of /t/ in American English in certain situations. For example &quot;Bottle&quot; is pronounced with an alveolar flap, and &quot;button&quot; with a glottal stop.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Proof of Aspiration you can Try At Home</p>
<p>If you are one of those people who can't hear it, well, I can't help you. Not unless you learn a language that requires you to learn to listen for it. I know it's there and still can't tell by listening. </p>
<p>But I can prove we have both 'p' s. </p>
<p>Stand in a room with no fan or moving air. Light a match, hold it close in front of your lips, and say Spot. Normally, like you always do. Don't try to ensure you pronounce it right, or say it slow. Just say it like normal. Then say it louder. And then louder. You'll be pretty loud before you see that flame flicker, and it's from more air to sustain the volume. </p>
<p>Now light another match. Hold it close in front of your lips. Now whisper, quiet mind you, the word 'pot'. Watch that flame dance. You might even have put it out. </p>
<p>That is aspiration in action. And if you're like me, you're either astonished, or pissed off that after ten years of knowing thus you still can't fecking hear the fecking thing. </p></div>		</li>
