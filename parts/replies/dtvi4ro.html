			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it was System of a Down's secret song at the end of their Toxicity album, after Aerials. Now on Spotify it shows it being its own song. But in the past, that was a hidden gem you'd only find if you left the song playing ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other thing was to put a secret song on the final track after like 5-10 minutes of silence. It doesn't work so well when your album listing tells you how long all the tracks are though. And it's a pain if you listen to things on shuffle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the Nine Inch Nails album that had 2 bonus tracks, but they were 98 and 99, and all the tracks in between the last track and the tracks were just a second of silence. Real pain in the ass on shuffle, especially in a CD changer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time I ever heard Endless Nameless by Nirvana was after I feel asleep after listening to the last normal track on the Nevermind album with headphones. Talk about a rude, surreal awakening! This was before the internet was big, and you only learned of such things by talking to people, so I had listened to the album many times before I ever discovered it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I split out everything and issued them new track numbers. If you have KLF &quot;Chill Out,&quot; your purism may lead you to merge all tracks. Arista inserted the track markers; Jimmy wanted the album to play only as one long continuous radio mix.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFI used to do this on pretty much every album, up to DecemberUnderground. The used to have them on the last track after a gap typically, but Very Proud of Ya hides &quot;No Dave Party&quot; by rewinding track one, and DecemberUnderground hides &quot;Then I'll be Home&quot; by rewinding &quot;Affliction&quot; to -0:21.</p></div>		</li>
