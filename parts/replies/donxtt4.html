<p>Here's an article published by one of my colleagues in the British Journal of Psychology </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. Consensus is more along the lines of using a combination of  delivery modes benefits all learners, not one mode is benefiting one subset and another mode and other subset. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not bogus, just misunderstood at a practical level. My understanding during linguistics classes in grad school for education was that people tend to be better at things they perceive they are better at because people tend to want to do things that are good at. Simply, the more you do something, the better you get at it, which makes you want to do it more... et cetera. At the classroom level this was employed (poorly) as a system of means to understand or explain deficiencies. All-in-all, it is pretty interesting, but for all intents and purposes, just about everyone can &quot;understand&quot; things in just about the same physiological way. Our environment tends to be the largest deciding factor(s) in &quot;performance&quot; though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As one redditor comment said, basically despite learning styles each can reinforce the other.  If you think you learn better by hearing something pair it with print at the same time for even better retention of information. </p>
<p>When it comes down to it I think it's like 90% of information is presented visually. We are all visual learners first, except if you are blind. That the vast majority of our population are visual learners are why teachers are constantly told, present it visually. Don't just tell a student also show them via a visual model, example, or visual explanation of the process. Kinesthetic is a visual model and requires taking visual information then applying it into a physical manner. </p>
<p>When someone is said to be a kinesthetic learner it really means they better retain visual and auditory information when they can physically perform it or make/build something from it. People who are said to learn better with music means if you can take the visual and auditory information and put it into a music form they retain the information better. </p>
<p>We are all types of learners, not one or the other but bottom line is we all have to process visual information to learn. Visual information can be transformed into different formats to help better retain information. </p>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong. I believe I am wrong 100% of the time.  </p></div>		</li>
