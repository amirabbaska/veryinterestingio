<p>I don't believe people end up blind by drinking the cheapest alcohol they buy from a supermarket. Do they? If that's the case, I'm flabbergasted</p></div>		</li>

<p>It lead to the largest number of charges in Czech criminal history, with the two leaders getting life in prison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if I misunderstood the last line of your comment but oils are only taken out through chill filtration and this is only done to be able to lower the alcohol to 40 percent abv (at least for whisky). Oils are a natural part of the distillation process and very necessary for the 'mouth feel' of a good whisky and it's the cheaper 'mass produced' brands that take them out to get more cash out of their process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we are talking about mid-grade vs low-grade off brand. Maybe  a good whisky will give you a worse hangover but typically people aren't binge drinking a whole bottle of expensive whisky in a sitting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to a James Bond novel I read way back when, this was where the Russian custom of putting pepper grinds into vodka came from. Apparently, they soaked up the fusel oils, and sank to the bottom.  Don't know if this is true or apocryphal, though.  Heck, I don't even know if the bit about Russians putting pepper into vodka is true (now or back then - mind you, that Bond novel was written in the '50's).</p></div>		</li>
