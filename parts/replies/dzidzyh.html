			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless a company is planning a major purchase or is required to keep a set account of cash on hand I think most businesses try and keep their money working for them. Cash in a bank account can't earn you anything near as much as it can elsewhere. </p>
<p>Companies (and to a certain extent wealthy individuals) treat money as an <em>asset</em> to be used efficiently. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>according to my dad you should pay extra on your loans to pay then off earlier. My dad believes it's better to have money in your savings account. </p>
</li>
<li>according to Warren Buffett you should make the minimum payments and invest the rest into something that makes a better interest rate than the rate in your loan. Warren Buffett believes you need to <em>use</em> money so it can bring in more money. </li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those pay off loan vs invest calculations get a little more complicated when you bring in  compounding interest and loan amortization schedules. Meaning that if you pay extra now on top of your payment, you'll be paying down strictly the principle. Which then means less interest expense down the road. I had this excel class, and we did a 30 year loan repayment schedule in excel. With the scenario we had set up, we paid an extra $20 on top of the payment one time at the start of the mortgage, and at the end of the term would have saved hundreds of dollars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is broadly true in a lot of cases personally, not just business its just people don't always see it and or/understand percentages. </p>
<p>So For example, here in the UK, mortgage interest rates are filthy low at the moment but most of my friends over pay in their mortgages 'because it saves them interest'</p>
<p>My rate is 1.56% however any spare money I have I put into an dividend heavy etf which returns pretty much 4-5% annually in dividends which I then get those to reinvest. With capital growth (which I don't even really need) it's turned 6-7% annually over the last few years. </p>
<p>My friends keep telling me they will be better off because they will pay their mortgage off quicker.... What they don't grasp is the point where  the value of my fund overtakes my outstanding capital on my mortgage (and hence I could effectively clear my mortgage at any time) will arrive far far sooner than the point they clear their mortgage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Companies do keep a set account of cash on hand, and large companies often have a lot of money in those accounts (at least collectively). Cash on hand accounts are how you pay for business trips, how you pay for business dinners, how you buy emergency replacements for the ink in the printer, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but nowhere near $60 billion. You donâ€™t need that much for trips, dinners and printer ink. The vast majority of that $60 billion is going to be in an investments. It would be a waste not to put that much money to use.</p></div>		</li>
