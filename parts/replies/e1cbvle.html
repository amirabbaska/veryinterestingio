			<div class="markdown"><p>The importance of eigenvalues comes from there relationships with simple harmonic oscillators (SHOs).  So many things in physics are simple harmonic oscillatorsâ€”things of the form Asin(wx) + Bcos(wx). Everything from springs, to chaotic systems, to quantum mechanics relies on SHOs to some extent. When you differentiate this twice, you get Aw^2sin(wx) + Bw^2cos(wx), which is just the original function times w^2, so that is an eigenvalue of the system. If you have done any classical mechanics, you know that w is the angular frequency of the oscillation. </p>
<p>So eigenvalues tell you how a SHO oscillates and the eigenvectors form a basis of its frequency space. Almost anything that has some form of oscillation can be approximated with a SHO, which is why eigenvalues are so pervasive in physics, since they are so nicely related to SHOs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>An eigenvalue is a property of an operator that tells you what real number the operator might act like, if the problem were one dimensional. Just like derivatives allow us to pretend that complex systems are linear, eigenvalues allow us to pretend that multi-dimensional systems are one-dimensional.</p>

<p>I've read about eigenvalues a decent amount, but never really <em>got</em> it. This made everything click for me!</p></div>		</li>
