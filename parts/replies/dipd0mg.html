<p>Edit: the article also goes on to say, if you really want to trace it back, that the trope arguably stems from the ancient Japanese belief in the inherent spiritual power of words (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotodama" target="_blank">kotodama</a>). Also, just off the top of my head, it also arguably relates to the idea of &quot;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiai" target="_blank">kiai</a>&quot; in martial arts, where shouting and vocalizing is considered an essential part of the forms and techniques (a friend of mine who did kendo said you can be penalized in competition if your voice is too quiet or weak).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to practice Okinawan Kempo, we didn't do tournaments too often. But, my sensei also had a degree in sports medicine and one that had something to do with human biology (don't ask me, I'm no college fella), but he said that the kiai, hai, or whichever you prefer allows you to exert more force. </p>
<p>He had us test it with simple things at home, like opening a particularly tough to open jar, and while it may have been a type of placebo effect, it seemed to help. </p>
<p>He said it had to do with breathing specifically; he taught us a form of breathing--called sanchin (I may have misspelled) that involves specific placement of your tongue while you breathe. You're supposed to sound kind of like you're trying to get a piece of popcorn kernel off of the back of your tongue. </p>
<p>I'll swear up and down for the rest of my life that breathing like that is some form of magic. He had us test that one at home too. And this part is pretty goofy if you ask me, but it shows that it works. </p>
<p>Next time you're constipated, exhale how I explained while you're, uh, &quot;pushing.&quot; It's ridiculous, but it's pretty crazy. Almost as crazy as <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9hMp65SzyTU" target="_blank">this technique</a> </p>
<p>Edit: a bunch of people are commenting with their thoughts on why it works, and they're somewhat right. </p>
<p>The kiai is very much about tightening your core, about focusing your attack, etc.
sanchin breathing is slow, methodical. Think of it as core training so that your push-ups have better form. But it also happens to allow you to do handstand push-ups because holy shit that's some good training.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A sharp exhale causes you to instantly contract your intercostal muscles (the muscles between your ribs).  Contracting these muscles at the right moment could give a mechanical advantage during motions that involve your chest or shoulder muscles.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While not directly on the topic of anime, this article seems to back up your point: that pointing and shouting engages more areas of the brain and creates better focus: <a href="http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pointing-and-calling-japan-trains" target="_blank">http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pointing-and-calling-japan-trains</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow! I work at a Japanese company and we have a point and call policy for safety, I didn't realize it was a wide-spread thing (I had heard it was a common industrial practice, though). Thanks for sharing that article! </p>
<p>In particular, in my company, we use it when crossing paths (vehicle traffic). For example, when crossing a path designated for forklifts or other vehicle s: you are supposed to stop, then look and point left and call &quot;left clear, check!&quot; then right and straight before crossing. It definitely feels really goofy and meets pretty heavy resistance. I think the vocalization is the weirdest part. I have been doing it now long enough I don't feel weird pointing, but I'm always conscious that others think it's dumb and won't do it. </p>
<p>I also notice some of my Japanese colleagues will point and call (quietly) when checking something over. I've started to do it as well and I find that for someone scatter brained as I am, it really helps me make sure I got everything. I basically just go over what I'm doing out loud. Like when people are getting ready to go somewhere... </p>
<p>&quot;ok, I have my keys, I have my phone, I let the dog out, stove is off...&quot; </p></div>		</li>

Only happened twice within a few weeks period and never again. But THAT my friend will ruin your mood (and your climax).</p>
