<p>Sorry to jump in - but does your organisation also support and work for greater male representation in scientific fields where men are a minority, such as psychology?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From our website - &quot;We wrote our open letter with no agenda for building a grassroots movement and hoped to get 500 signatures from women scientists (&quot;500&quot; seemed aspirational). We surpassed that goal within hours of posting the letter and we continue to reach more and more women scientists and other supporters across the world.&quot; (<a href="https://500womenscientists.org/about-us/#about-us-1" target="_blank">https://500womenscientists.org/about-us/#about-us-1</a>)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For one thing, I'd like to offer a concrete example of how an organization can become male dominated and somewhat self preserving without any explicit attempt for that.</p>
<p>In the professional chess world, there's an open chess championship (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship" target="_blank">World Chess Championship</a>) and a women's only one (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_World_Chess_Championship" target="_blank">Women's World Chess Championship</a>). There's very few women in the open championship. There's currently no women in the top 100. There's never been a female world champion. It seems that simply male dominated organizations are difficult to break into. Especially when they're hyper competitive. The Women's World Chess Championship plays a part by allowing women to actually participate in upper rankings more easily and encourage participation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Especially when they're hyper competitive&quot; </p>
<p>I mean isn't that why they're hard to break into? Could a woman not best the competition by having superior skill in chess and thus crack the top 100? Unless there's some sort of chess training system within the chess world I'd say it's just a skill disparity that makes it segregated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi GreedyR,</p>
<p>Thanks for your question. This is an important topic and there are a lot of different ways to respond. In part, lack of diversity represents a loss of talent. Brilliant minds come in all different bodies from all different places. By limiting diversity in STEM we are limiting our scientific potential. Another part of this is that often women and minorities don't see themselves represented in the world of science (no mentors or role models) and so they move on to other fields and we have &quot;brain drain&quot; of people that could be some of our greatest innovators. </p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/diversity-in-stem-what-it-is-and-why-it-matters/" target="_blank">This</a> article is a good read about diversity in STEM, and I'm sure some of my fellow scientists will have comments as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for your question,</p>
<p>Wendy</p>
<p>(EDIT: mentors and role models)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is inherent bias. See for example <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/41/16474.short" target="_blank">this</a> study which showed that science faculty rate applications for lab manager positions more highly if they have a male name. </p>
<p>Part of the problem is cultural and societal discouragement (in the US) of participation in STEM fields in K-12. There are plenty of available articles with a simple google search. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Philip_Sadler2/publication/258723136_Stability_and_Volatility_of_STEM_Career_Interest_in_High_School_A_Gender_Study/links/5491867a0cf2d1800d89e360/Stability-and-Volatility-of-STEM-Career-Interest-in-High-School-A-Gender-Study.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> &lt;- pdf!) is one. </p>
<p>Edit: another commenter just linked to <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/17/5360" target="_blank">this</a> interesting study, which found the opposite pattern of results (greater preference for female applications) for applications to assistant-professor-level positions. Please see my comment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/61rpoq/askscience_ama_series_we_are_members_of_500_women/dfhh5vq/" target="_blank">here</a>. Of importance might also be <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1529100614541236" target="_blank">this</a> paper from the same authors that argues that at least at the professional levels in terms of hiring and grant funding, gender discrimination, although once a much more pervasive problem no longer exists (with some caveats). However, while such overt discrimination (e.g. in hiring) may be less of a problem, other forms of discrimination may still be present. See, e.g., <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/gender-equality-in-academia-bad-news-from-the-trenches-and-some-possible-solutions/197F490010755E699DA22D7C6428043E" target="_blank">Monroe et al. 2008</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi GreedyR! To add to Wendy's great answer, some of the leaders in 500 Women Scientists wrote a <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/we-are-never-just-scientists/" target="_blank">great article</a> in Scientific American that describes why diversity is important and what types of barriers women and other underrepresented minorities face. If we have people from different backgrounds, including gender identity, religion, country, income, etc, we will have a diverse understanding of problems that need to be addressed and how to address them. </p>
<p>Another example of this is highlighted in a study that a friend of mine <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759" target="_blank">published in nature</a>. It highlights the problem with people of European descent leading most of the genetics research in the world. People of African, Asian, Pacific Islanders, Middle Eastern, Latin American, and Native descent have different genetic patterns, and medicine is not being targeted at diseases specific to those communities. The same could be said for researching alternative sources of energy, ecology, agriculture, and other biological fields.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi Kelly, </p>
<p>I found the second part of your answer particularly interesting. Is it possible that fewer people of non-white decent are likely to trust the white scientists with the information that can be revealed through genetic analysis? By increasing the number of non-white scientists perhaps that would also increase the rate at which non-whites would participate in the research? </p></div>		</li>
