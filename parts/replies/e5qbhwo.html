			<div class="markdown"><p>Just thought I'd add based on your last sentence, you would literally suffocate to death from smoking weed before you managed to overdose on it. The only real way to get enough THC etc into your system would be injecting it or vaporising it and even then you would probably die from lack of blood before hitting criticality with the THC.</p>
<p>&quot; <strong>It is estimated that marijuana's [median lethal dose] is around 1:20,000 or 1:40,000. In layman terms this means that in order to induce death a marijuana smoker would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times as much marijuana as is contained in one marijuana cigarette. [National Institute on Drug Abuse]-supplied marijuana cigarettes weigh approximately .9 grams. A smoker would theoretically have to consume nearly 1,500 pounds of marijuana within about fifteen minutes to induce a lethal response.</strong> &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not synthetic pot; calling it that gives weed a bad name. It’s a chemical (akin to heroin) that is dissolved in alcohol/acetone and sprayed over herb that can be smoked (mugwort, damiana, etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve never seen anyone come in from something related to synthetic weed. I’ve never even known anyone to use it. I don’t know much about it, to be honest. Hole in my education for sure. </p>
<p>Is it common in your area?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome, thanks for this! Talked about it in nursing school, made jokes about how it could be accomplished but didn’t commit it to memory. </p>
<p>No point in trying to remember how someone is going to die from a weed overdose if they legit can’t do it. At that point I think we’d all just be really impressed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who didn’t read directions on edibles and ate the entire package (which was 12 servings), got super paranoid and convinced they were going to die. (They didn’t die, I promise.) They got a shot to calm the anxiety, slept for a bit, got driven home. </p>
<p>Or, smoked too much and couldn’t stop throwing up. Not fun, dehydration and a low potassium level, but no dying there either. IV fluids, IV nausea meds, some potassium pills, got a cab home. </p>
<p>This all happened in a state where weed recently became legal, so that was usually people who were inexperienced. I can’t say I’ve ever seen a regular pot head roll into the ER with either of those. I haven’t seen anything auto related where it was only weed, usually booze along with it. </p>
<p>Seriously, I’ll take an ER full of stoners over a single mean drunk. Y’all are great. </p></div>		</li>
