<p>The LEDs can only use half of those cycles, so they flash 30 times per second</p>

<p>They only use the positive half or the negative half which means they get 60 half cycles per second and flash 60 times per second.  There is one positive half and one negative half per cycle.</p>
<p>If you put two side by side each facing different directions then you'll basically full wave rectify it and get 120 Hz flicker.  High enough that you won't usually see it looking straight on, but low enough that you'll get weird strobe light effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, 30hz is the one you notice. If the full bridge (60hz) was causing an issue as the others are indicating then you could see the flicker in alot more gear instead of just cheap lights.</p></div>		</li>
