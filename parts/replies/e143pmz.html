			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, notice that most diseases now suspected of being prion based (like Alzheimer's) only show up well after the reproductive years.  So any mechanism to stop it from happening won't be selected for in the population.  Familial Insomnia requires you inherit the gene which likely has its roots in a spontaneous mutation.  It only kills after the reproductive years.  Others like kuru, BCE, etc require you to eat infected nervous tissue.  </p>
<p>Edit:  Some of the comments had me go and reread things and it is &quot;prion like&quot; so not a prion disease but some suspicion the tangles could be transmitted via injection/surgical contamination.  It is under research.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Grandparents are a very strong enabler of fitness in the population. They can care for children while parents are being productive, they can pass on knowledge. Humans have selected for longevity long past reproductive utility.</p>
<p>You seem to be thinking of what is the same as what causes most cancer: Random chance. The longer you're around, the more chance you have of rolling a bum deal. The older you are, the less able you are of beating it back before it becomes too late.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least with cancer, it's kind of <em>weighted</em> random chance, though. Most prions require some kind of exposure, cancer only requires time.</p>
<p>Eventually, your DNA will be so damaged from either wear and tear, or simply from duplication for so long, that you'll end up with cancer cells that don't appoptose.</p>
<p>Until we figure out a way to eliminate damage to DNA (ie, unlock the key to pseudo-immortality), then if one lives long enough, they <em>will</em> have cancer. Probably multiple kinds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor correction: </p>
<p>Alzheimers disease typically thought to be amyloid based, rather than prion. </p>
<p>(Theres another major hypothesis, but its less related here). </p>
<p>Both amyloid and prions can be similar in that, if they can form a modified structure rich in Beta sheets, where they tend to form aggregates and later fibrils. </p>
<p>However, prions and amyloid are not the same. </p>
<p>ELI5 version: Prion are like megablocks whilst amyloid is like lego. They kind of work the same way but are not interchangeable </p></div>		</li>
