<p>Seems fair to assume the antibody titer will flatten out at some point, perhaps after day 14 or so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;potency&quot; of the vaccine is relative to its foreigness when presented to your immune response, so it is stable over time. Your immune response's activity level may change due to factors such as your stress level, age, and nutrient intake, and it is possible for you to have no response to a normally effective vaccine if your body is not prepared for an immune response.</p>
<p>That said, yes, the graph of tiger will peak 9-14 days after first exposure and then flatten out. The &quot;flat&quot; part of the graph will not be zero antibodies, since a small number of memory cells will keep making the antibody stimulated by the vaccine. Future exposures to a matching antigen will take less time to reach peak titer - 1-3 days, and the flat part of the graph will get higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am way late to the party but I specifically work in the flu vaccine field...</p>
<p>We generally tell people 3 weeks for inoculation.  As people have said, even when titers drop, your body mounts a quick immune response when invaded by the real flu because of its &quot;muscle memory&quot; to the antigen in the vaccine. </p>
<p>However...</p>
<p>The main reason it feels like there is a drop in protection over time is not actually because the vaccine weakens.  It is because the influenza virus itself undergoes antigenic shift.  Basically, the strains mutate and the body eventually doesn't recognize the invader. This is why you get a shot every year. H3N2 is particularly good at mutating and tends to wreak the most havoc accordingly. </p>
<p>Yes, I over simplified much of this... But I hope this helps.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain the reason why some studies have seen a drop in antibody response in the elderly? As in if you give a senior a flu shot early in the season they may not have protection through the entire season? I don’t really understand that. I also don’t fully understand why some studies have shown children who get yearly flu shots may have less of an appropriate response to flu shots over time. Those studies didn’t seem well designed so again, I’m not sure. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p><del>AFAIK yes.</del> At least in the case of Health Canada I remember reading that a new vaccine cocktail is prepared every year based on the prevalent flu strains at the time.</p>
<p>Edit: The WHO publishes annual recommendations on the vaccine's content every year, for each hemisphere:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally the the same flu vaccinations are used everywhere. Different brands are used, but they all target the same things. The virus changes all the time so in order to guess what the virus will look like in the northern hemisphere's winter, they look at what it was like in the southern hemisphere's last winter and design against that. Obviously not all the southern hemisphere is perfectly set up for this data collection, so most of the data ends up coming from South Africa, New Zealand and Australia. Then the reverse is done for the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Because the data collection isn't happening in a specific country to start, this makes producing a US or Russia version of the vaccine not really possible, though it might be in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibody level is one thing, vaccine fitness is a totally different parameter to remember. Way ahead of the coming flu, the companies have to “guess” which strains will be part of the seasonal vaccine. Depending on the accuracy of that guess, the vaccine will behave differently each year, sometimes protection is excellent and sometimes protection is lousy. Therefore, a certain level in antibodies won’t tell you how safe you are. </p></div>		</li>
