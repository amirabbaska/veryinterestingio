			<div class="markdown"><p>A newspaper will have an unpredictable number of articles of unpredictable length: it makes it easier to lay out a newspaper if you have a standard width for a column. You make that standard width fairly small so that very brief stories don't end up as a single long line of text.</p>
<p>Having narrow columns also makes it easier for the reader to find the next line of text. Even today, many newspapers have large areas of very dense text, as they try to get as much information as they can into a limited space. It would be very easy for a reader to lose track of the text: having short lines means that when you reach the end of a line, you don't have to track too far back to find the start of the next line, so you're less likely to lose your place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Narrow columns also means that block of text can span multiple columns. A common structure for most publications regardless of size is to have a 12-column grid, so that you can do any subdivision of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 and still be within your structure. </p>
<p>In other words, a &quot;3-column&quot; layout is actually 3x4 columns. This also allows the layout person to use an empty column as a spacer, or as white space for an image for pullquote. This is used most often in things like magazines where there is usually a fairly set size for the overall publication that takes this extra space into account. </p></div>		</li>
