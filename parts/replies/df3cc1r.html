<p>&quot;Bankruptcy&quot; specifically means the legal proceedings in which an insolvent debtor pays, reorganizes, and/or discharges its debts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, thank you. The previous responses are great as well, but this detail was missing. I wasn't aware that bankruptcy describes the proceedings, and not a financial state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chapter 9 is definitely an odd one. I reviewed the City of Detroit's financial statements in nonprofit accounting class and the auditor made clear that many assumptions they made had few accepted precedents - basically they said &quot;hey, we're doing our best but are kinda making it up as we go along so please bear with us&quot;.</p>
<p>It was also a bit jarring to read the auditor's statement that they could not provide assurance that the City of Detroit could continue operating as a &quot;going concern&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, chapter 9's are quite uncommon, but that may be changing quickly. It involves so many financial  considerations that you just don't have in 11's, and the whole process is so politically charged that theyre <em>going</em> to be nightmares.</p>
<p>I, for one, think we should be seeing <em>more</em> of them. Municipalities can flounder and sink themselves deeper in debt in ways that businesses can't, and politicians are often glad to push that process along at taxpayer/bondholder expense. I'm hoping we can dispel the stigma of chapter 9's so imperiled cities can start getting the relief they need. </p></div>		</li>
