			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of like someone else mentioned, it's kind of a dress code to enforce nicer, more upscale customers. They don't want people up in there club if they don't have the cash to buy drinks. But, I imagine you see a lot of those white shirt guys haha</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My brother worked at a large club in downtown Minneapolis that had a similar dress code (no solid colors, etc)- he said it was mostly to keep riff riff out. If someone came in wearing red/blue/whatever, it would only be enforced if that person looked like they might be gang affiliated. I'm sure it ended up in a lot of racial profiling. He said the dress code was used at their discretion to get the type of clientele they wanted.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everyone is talking about gangs here but a lot of upscale/semi-upscale places have a similar dress code, itâ€™s to encourage a higher class of clientele. They want you to present yourself properly to upkeep their image so they can charge you $10 for a vodka soda</p></div>		</li>
