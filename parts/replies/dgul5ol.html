While individuals tend not to smoke today, any movie portraying a historical or low income context may include smoking that is contextually accurate. An example would be a World War II, gang, or Prison film. Why we may not smoke, it would appear abnormal if people whom we would generally expect to smoke did not. (Also people whom, due to past films, we have been conditioned to expect them to smoke.)</p></div>		</li>
