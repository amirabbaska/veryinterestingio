<p>As a baseline, let's use trimix 10/70, which is a common mix for a 90/95 meter dive. That means 10% oxygen and 70% helium, with 20 nitrogen. Normal atmospheric air has 21% oxygen.</p>
<p>If you were breathing that gas on the surface, you would 1.) Probably pass out but assuming you didn't, 2.) You would eventually decrease your heart rate since it would be used to pumping lower amounts of oxygen, meaning that pumping 21% would be easier (you have to pump less to get an equal amount if oxygen to your tissues).</p>
<p>However, you do not breath it on the surface. You breath it at great depth, 90+ meters. This compresses the gas, and raises the partial pressure of oxygen in your blood not only back to atmospheric norm, but higher to help decompression. You want to use the highest partial pressure of oxygen that you can without going over 1.4 ata (1.3 For some), as this makes deco easier. That means that you're actually more used to breathing gasses with a higher PPO2 than atmospheric, meaning you will have to make your heart pump more at atmospheric pressure to get the same PP02. </p>
<p>This seems directly contradictory to what you were saying. If anything, I'd attribute a lower heart rate to a few other things, mainly being that scuba diving is great exercise, and you burn many calories, and use many muscles, similar to an athlete having a lower heart rate due to normal exercise. You just get your exercise in a different form. Another reason is that you are more used to controlling your breathing to keep your SAC to a reasonable level.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear your thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>have you ever noticed the slow heart rate throughout the day?
not really, i feel pretty normal. i guess if i take my pulse i'd notice. people (mainly girlfriend) have noticed my slow heartrate quite a bit. </p>
<p>do you do any cardio?
yes, i run about a mile a day on a treadmill. i also work out with weights whenever i've got time to spare. </p>
<p>how often and how long are your dives for?
it varies. most dives on trimix (O2, Nitrogen, Helium) are done in the summer months, with an average depth of ~230ft and a max of 335. I dive on regular air almost every day, as i'm employed as a divemaster. recreationally i do a lot of dives with multiple tanks, so i'm usually under for over an hour.
as far as work goes, i'm in pools a lot so i'll be under for about an hour and a half accumulatively. </p>
