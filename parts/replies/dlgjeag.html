			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're thinking might be milk tea, I don't know if it's the same in Taiwan but in Hong Kong they have something called Lai Cha which means milk tea and it's popular like crazy, but I'm pretty sure it only became popular after the Brits went over to Asia, bringing milk to put in tea. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one searches in general. Reddit search or otherwise. And Reddit search is not that bad, it's only bad when people have titles that have nothing to do with the content. Otherwise keyword search is fine. OP would have found what they were looking for.</p></div>		</li>
