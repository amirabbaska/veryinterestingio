			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like /u/uncwil said, the reason the gulf is brown in that location is the rivers that dump there, with the addition of the barrier islands like Cat, Ship and Horn, as well as the Mississippi Delta to the south. They tend to hold a lot of the silt near the coast. If you go to the south side of Ship island for example, the water is nearly as clear as Gulf shores or Pensacola.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mississippi Delta refers to a flood plain up a lot closer to Memphis than to New Orleans....perhaps we should be more specific and refer to the area after New Orleans as the delta of the Mississippi?  I don't know how geographers distinguish the two areas by name specifically?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is mostly due to the fact that we have a lot of rivers and bays around here emptying silt and organic matter into the Mississippi Sound.  Also the barrier islands basically make this part of the gulf a large bay in itself and the lack of wave action keeps the water from being pulled out and replaced with &quot;clean&quot; water. The one advantage that comes with this is we have great fishing as the Mississippi Sound (called the Fertile Crescent for a reason) is a great breeding ground for sea life. </p></div>		</li>
