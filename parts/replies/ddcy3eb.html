			<div class="markdown"><p>Serious question, is your reply in agreement to the above post or are you saying there's a difference between logarithmically speaking and the way that person replied?  Aren't they the same. </p>
<p>Also, Planck scale aside, aren't we still closer to the size of the universe than to even an atom?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We are closer to one extreme, but also close to the middle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As the size of the universe is on the order of 10^26 m and the diameter of an atom is on the order of 10^-11 m  we are on the order of 10^0 m. That means we are by far closer to the size of an atom than the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;logarithmically&quot; is the same as comparing 26 and -35 when comparing 10^26 and 10^-35.  One meter is 1^0 m and 0 is kind of in the middle between 26 and -35.  On the other hand, looking at 26 and -35, each increase is more meaningful, so the 9 points of magnitude further away on the small side is a really big difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had a conversation about this the other day!</p>
<p>You and I are on the order of 10^0 meters.
The upper bound on the electron's radius is currently on the order of 10^-22 meters.
The width of our galaxy is on the order of 10^21 meters.</p>
<p>The width of the (current) observable universe is on the order of 10^26 meters.</p>
<p>So humans are about dead middle on the scale between the smallest we have determined anything to be, and the width of our galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between 10^26 and 10^35 may not seem like much, but it's pretty damn big because of exponential growth. 10^26 atoms of carbon is about 2 kg. So, maybe the weight of an encyclopedia book. 10^35 atoms of carbon is the weight of 10 dreadnoughts. Have you ever seen a battleship museum in person? Those things are frickin' huge. Like a small city.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You could have used a half-super-tanker, since those have about twenty times the displacement of the HMS Dreadnought when fully loaded, but that wouldn't have been as impressive.</p></div>		</li>
