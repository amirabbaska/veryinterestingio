			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't really a blood connection. There aren't blood vessels that flow from the mother's bloodstream into the child's bloodstream. The two flows are kept separate.</p>
<p>While not completely correct, the simplest way to picture the arrangement is that the placenta is the child's blood vessels looping &quot;down&quot; into the mother's endometrium, and the mother's blood vessels looping &quot;up&quot; into it. Endometrium is basically somewhat stabilized blood - clots in period blood are very similar to pregnant endometrium. The gasses, nutrients, and wastes are transferred through the endometrium and blood vessel walls, but the blood never touches.</p>
<p>When the placenta detaches, the child's blood vessel loops just pull out of the whole setup and it slips out. If all goes well, very few blood vessels are even broken on either side, and those that do generally heal quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a barrier. Blood isn't transferred. But it can still happen. </p>
<p>Without treatment, 25 percent transmission rate. With treatment, 2 percent.  Infections and diet and other factors can increase likelihood of transmission.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The placenta detaching can be one of the big risks for birthing mothers. If it doesn't detach the way it's supposed to, it can cause a hemorrhage and the mother can bleed to death. </p></div>		</li>
