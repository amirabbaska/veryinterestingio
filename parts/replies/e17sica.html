			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand upon this: most mutations that cause a change in the phenotype are disadvantageous. It is impossible to judge whether a new mutation is or could be beneficial, so the most optimal strategy is to avoid them all even though in rare ocasions that means missing out on a beneficial mutation. It's basically choosing the recipe that has worked in the past instead of taking a risky gamble on something new. This in turn is the reason for speciation. Pretty cool stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is beneficial, then the female population will adapt to recognize and be attracted by it over time, but this feedback loop is a process that takes several generations. It can however also have immediate benefits, which will increase the fitness due to other factors than the evaluation of physical attractiveness. As a hypothetical example, you could be born with a mutation that makes you more willing to take risks but also increase the size of your ears. If that behavior makes you more adapted to your environment than your competition, then it might increase your fitness despite the ears working against you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light colored eyes can make your limbal ring (the darker ring around the outside of the iris) appear thicker and darker. The limbal ring gets thinner and lighter as we age and in studies where they photoshopped thicker, darker limbal rings onto people, those people's photos were considered dramatically more attractive. It's one of the facial neoteny traits that men look for in a femalwe mate because women eventually become less fertile with age. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the common ancestor for blue eyes was a woman. Males tend to be much less picky about mate selection due to the lack of investment, and therefore much more likely to “take risks” with odd phenotypes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>while people who have those &quot;usual&quot; characteristics are attractive alot of the time stunningly attractive people/someone who really catches your eye might have a different nose/facial structure or something it doesn't mean they can't be attractive it just depends. Also eye color seems less noticeable than the size/shape of your face. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, being &quot;average&quot; does have its own disadvantages. Namely, the fact that you don't stand out.</p>
<p>There's the idea of negative frequency dependent selection, wherein rare traits are more favorable. So you get this oscillating trend where the rare traits, being more favorable, lead to increased numbers of that trait. Because the formerly rare trait is now common, a different &quot;rare&quot; trait is more favorable, leading to its eventual rise within the population.</p>
<p>Take for example beards/clean shaven-ness. In one psychology study, a group of women were told to rate photos of men based on appearance. Men that were clean shaven were rated higher when their photo was mixed in a group of mostly bearded men, and bearded men were also rated higher when their photo was mixed in a group of mostly clean-shaven men. Essentially, the &quot;rare&quot; trait stood out as being more attractive.</p>

Essentially, the &quot;rare&quot; trait stood out as being more attractive.es and then measured preferences for four standard levels of beardedness. Women and men judged heavy stubble and full beards more attractive when presented in treatments where beards were rare than when they were common, with intermediate preferences when intermediate frequencies of beardedness were presented. Likewise, clean-shaven faces were least attractive when clean-shaven faces were most common and more attractive when rare. This pattern in preferences is consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Negative frequency-dependent sexual selection maintains striking polymorphisms in secondary sexual traits in several animal species. Here, we test whether frequency of beardedness modulates perceived attractiveness of men's facial hair, a secondary sexual trait subject to considerable cultural variation. We first showed participants a suite of faces, within which we manipulated the frequency of beard thicknesses and then measured preferences for four standard levels of beardedness. Women and men judged heavy stubble and full beards more attractive when presented in treatments where beards were rare than when they were common, with intermediate preferences when intermediate frequencies of beardedness were presented. Likewise, clean-shaven faces were least attractive when clean-shaven faces were most common and more attractive when rare. This pattern in preferences is consistent with negative frequency-dependent selection.</p>

<p>edit: some others in the thread are asking about some actors and actresses that aren't conventionally attractive, and it's my own pet theory (don't quote me on this) that their unique appearance gives them a slight edge in the competition, assuming all else (e.g. talent) is equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One night I was sitting in a pub doing the crossword waiting for a friend. Two mid-20s girls sat at the table next to me and were chatting. I was semi eavesdropping and one said, &quot;I have a new boyfriend.&quot; The other girl said, &quot;Wow great. Is he cute?&quot; The first girl replied &quot;No, he's not cute. But I think he is.&quot;</p>
<p>It took a moment to register that this didn't make any fucking sense to my male brain. Later I had a chat with my friend's wife and said what does this mean? and she said it's that women are 100% focused on looks, but not necessarily on traditional good looks. </p>
<p>Many years ago but it stuck in my brain. </p></div>		</li>
