<p>If not for Everquest, I'd probably still be a hunt-and-peck typer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned to touch-type by playing King's Quest III. You've only got limited amounts of time to do things without getting killed by the main villain, there are several enemies that charge towards you and have to be stopped by use of an object, and the game doesn't pause while you type in commands. You have to be swift and you have to be accurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I can say one thing for sure it's that I learned English by playing video games with English people. School English was just supportive afterall.</p>
<p>My parents hated it when I used to come home from school and play for about 3-5 hours at a time before doing other activities/hobbies.</p>
<p>Video Games also greatly improved my reaction skills and my ability to work and function within a team better than any school ever did it.</p></div>		</li>
