			<div class="markdown"><p>A turbine-driven propeller is much closer to a jet than a piston-driven propeller. A turbofan (the thing on most commercial airlines) is basically a combination propeller and jet. What really distinguishes a motor's operation is how power is generated, not so much how it interfaces with the air. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nature of jet propulsion is that jets <em>are</em> inherently faster (for the same broad engine size/power) - they're constant(ish) thrust devices, whereas a prop has decreasing thrust with airspeed (for a fixed prop angle).</p>
<p>turboprops are still props and still have the speed limitations of props.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they did, though it was even slower than what the British brought out two years later (not by much). And the Germans certainly had a combat operational aircraft far sooner than the Allies did, although the ME262 was held back, out of combat, for quite a while. </p></div>		</li>
