			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to be a dick and point out a minor point of your very long and informative response, but I'm fairly certain that no solitary bee species are non stinging (obviously males don't sting in any species, but you know what I mean.) All stingless bees belong to the tribe meliponini which are pretty closely related to apini, and bombini, all of which are social (also related to euglossini which are solitary, I think). So yeah, stingless bees are social. Sorry to be a stickler, but I don't really know much about anything other than bees and the weird anime pillows my cousin used to sleep with.</p>
<p>Edit: also there are more than two species of honey bee.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not wrong, but the information the OP is missing is that as of a couple years ago some scientists actually discovered that bee populations are increasing, and currently perhaps where they were 20 years ago.<br />
That didn't answer his question either, but OP has a false premise.'''</p>
<p>Some of the panic is theorized to be a result of a recent boom in the number of amateur beekeepers reporting large die-off rates, but that suggests something else perhaps.
Also, reports of mass die off rates mirroring what was observed a few years ago (~50%) have been reported from time to time going back as far as the mid 19th century, long before a lot of the issues that are currently to blame existed.   That's not to say certain farming practices are not hurting bees, but it points to Colony Collapse Disorder being more complicated, less understood than we think.</p>
<p>EDIT: a couple articles.  Of course one can google this, but no doubt some folks will cry &quot;SHILL&quot; at some of the links they find on google (while ignoring the fact that most of their support comes from sites like Naturalnews.com)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That article is stupid. Their data isnt wrong, but they are interpreting it as not a problem. Beekeepers are making sure they have more bee's, so yes, bee population is rising, but the mortality rate is still 40%. When 40% of something dies when it used to be 10%, thats a fucking problem. Its driving up expenses for beekeepers, and there is obviously a problem with the bees that isnt being addressed properly.  </p></div>		</li>
