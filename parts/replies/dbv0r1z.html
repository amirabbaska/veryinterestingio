			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a random Reddit encounter, but my wife has a strange swallowing problem.  It comes and goes, but there are times she can barely swallow food.  She says it feels like it gets stuck, or makes her gag.  Sometimes it doesn't happen at all, certain foods it seems to always happen with- like fries or meat that is fatty.   She did a barium swallow and they found nothing.  Any thoughts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandpa had this. The doctors told him to eat a small bowl of hot soup or drink a bowl of hot broth before eating. I think it was basically using the heat to relax the muscles in his esophagus. It helped him. Might give it a try. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently have been experiencing a similar issue, and have been with increasing frequency over a number of years. Deduced that it was not the food for me, it was the texture: if I did not chew sufficiently, I'd have this issue. I'd feel like the food was stuck, and would start to salivate the thick saliva that occurs before vomiting. Drinking anything did NOT help. Sometimes I can sit through it and it will abate after a full minute or more. Other times I have to make a run for the restroom. Typically I only throw up saliva - not even always the last bite of food. Rinse out my mouth, and then I'm fine and can continue eating. My Internist recommends they send a camera down my esophagus and look for obstructions. This is on my to-do list - this is very annoying and sometimes embarrassing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She could have an esophageal stricture. These can appear to &quot;come and go&quot; occasionally causing food to feel as though it gets stuck. Could also be reflux, depending on where it feels it gets stuck. A barium swallow study showed a normal swallow, meaning her epiglottis closes appropriately to protect the airway and her pharynx rises, so the food/liquid go down to the esophagus correctly (rather than into her lungs). They could (and should have completed during her video swallow) also do an esophagram to check for reflux. If there's a stricture, and it continues to get worse then they can go in endoscopically and inflate that area of the esophagus to loosen the muscles.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's the cough reflex when a fluid goes down the trachea instead of the esophagus (goes on the path to your lungs (where a fluid can cause problems) instead of the path to your stomach).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is what the other answers haven't addressed. We have two tubes that connect with the mouth: the esophagus and the trachea. When we swallow, the entrance to the trachea closes as a reflex so that we don't get stuff entering our airways, but sometimes, be it because we are talking while ewting/breathing, or just because we randomly glitch, the airways don't close while swallowing and food/liquid/saliva goes inside the trachea, causing us to cough and suffer. </p></div>		</li>
