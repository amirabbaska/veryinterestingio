<p>First, the idea that significant nuclear exchange will create the circumstances necessary to create a nuclear winter is contested.  Some models show cooling, some show reduced sunlight, some don't.  It's going to be bad, but there's certainly not a consensus that it would create a &quot;lasting darkness&quot;.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_winter#Criticism_and_debate" target="_blank">see wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Further though, most of these models and certainly those created during the time period where the &quot;nuclear winter&quot; idea was first discussed, came during a period where nuclear policy's dictated that you target enemy city's and production centers in addition to hitting their launch sites.  &quot;Total war&quot; or &quot;massive retaliation&quot; strategy's.  Bombing city's or population centers would create massive fires that would burn uncontrolled and put ash clouds high into the air.  But these assumptions don't work if you're mostly targeting military capabilities which are typically located away from population centers.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Integrated_Operational_Plan#Early_targeting_after_the_Second_World_War" target="_blank">See Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>None of this is to say it wouldn't be bad, and that most humans would probably die as a result of the infrastructure collapse.  It's just that the idea that we could easily render the planet uninhabitable is silly.  Uninhabitable by us, in large numbers?  Yes.  But wildlife would probably thrive.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This ought to be up much higher. We've <em>never</em> had enough nuclear weapons to come close to eradicating humanity (at the peak, the world could place a bomb every 40 miles in a grid over land). However, since 60% of humans live in cities with populations above 250k, it's not very difficult to kill most humans. Since we're so hugely interdependent, even minor global disruptions would be catastrophic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. We have enough firepower to make major urban/industrial centers disappear, but not humanity. And not even <em>close</em> to sterilizing the planet. We couldn't pull that off if we tried. There's microorganisms all through the ocean and miles deep through the crust. You'd have to boil off the entire ocean and then turn the surface of the planet into a sea of lava a mile deep at least to sterilize the planet. Even then I'm not sure. Something might survive in the upper atmosphere or even deeper in the crust until the surface cools.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to summarise it like this: Life on this planet has survived worse things than us. It has survived supervolcanoes, ice ages, and cataclysmic meteorite impacts which have caused mass extinctions <em>several</em> times in the fossil record and climate disruption that a nuclear winter could never hold a candle to. A nuclear war would be very, very bad for humanity but a mere passing inconvenience for the global ecosystem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every 40 miles seems like plenty.  Don't modern nuclear bombs - or even those from the 70s and 80s - have larger blast radiuses than that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Even though it's possible to scale nuclear bombs up to ridiculously powerful levels, it's generally not desirable for most military purposes to do that. Ultra-powerful bombs are larger and heavier, so you need bigger ICBMs. They also waste more of their yield sending a fireball into the upper atmosphere rather than burning and flattening stuff on the ground. And they're more expensive. And sometimes you really don't want to maximize the devastation, for example if the nukes are intended to be used against tank battalions advancing through your own territory or if you just want to bust a bunker.</p>
<p>I don't know what the actual mix of warhead types is, but take a look through <a href="http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/Allbombs.html" target="_blank">this list of U.S. nuclear weapon types</a> and you'll see there's a lot of modern warheads with yields in kiloton or tens of kiloton range. Very few are even a single megaton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, now you're contributing to that exaggeration yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You wouldn't be able to live in the bombed areas for a long time... </p>
</blockquote>
<p>People continued to live in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from that we have a lot of data on how it affected the inhabitants. There where somewhat of an increase in mostly cancer prevalence amongst those who lived close the blast when it happened and in those who arrived in the following days. Those who moved to the cities from a few weeks after the bombs had been dropped however did not see any increase in medical issues. </p>
<p>You could easily live in bombed areas after a few weeks as long as you don't grow your food or drink the water from the emediate vicinity of the blast site.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the highest yield of any of the weapons carried today is around 1,2 Mt so there are really no multi-megaton bombs anymore (at least not in the US arsenal). </p>
<p>The yield of the bomb is not all that relevant for the more longterm effects we are discussing here. The radiation of the particles that would make it dangerous to live there decays exponentially and quite fast so the levels would be safe within a couple of weeks no matter the yield of the bomb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It mostly depends on where the bomb is detonated. In short, you can imagine it this way:</p>
<p>The higher the bomb from the ground explodes, the higher is the blast radius and less radioactive fallout falls out(the actual radioactive threat in nukes).</p>
<p>Nuke a water source however, the blast won't deal as much instant damage, but the zone of contamination will be both bigger and will stay for longer.</p></div>		</li>
