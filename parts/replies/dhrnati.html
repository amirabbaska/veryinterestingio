<p>They knew because over 1582 years, the solstices had drifted from their 21st of the month position by ten days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of asking the natural follow-up, I just looked it up myself. (For anyone interested in further info).</p>
<p>Mechanical clocks date back to the 14th century, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wells_Cathedral_clock" target="_blank">Wells Cathedral Clock</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salisbury_cathedral_clock" target="_blank">Salisbury Cathedral Clock</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By recording the time using a sun dial with a mechanical clock. For example, if on January 1st of 1582, the moment the sun dial did not cast a shadow, the time on a mechanical clock read 12:00. The following year on January 1st , the moment the sun dial did not cast a shadow, the time on the mechanical clock would have read 12:02 and 48 seconds. Hense, the extra 11 minutes even when you account in and extra day for leap years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Skip every 100 years, but not every 400 years. So the next skips will be 2100, 2200, 2300, (2400 is a leap year), 2500, 2600, 2700, (2800 is a leap year), etc </p></div>		</li>
