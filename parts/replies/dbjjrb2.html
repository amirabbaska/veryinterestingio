			<div class="markdown"><p>No, most movies on film are 35mm 4-perf.  </p>
<p>65mm 5-perf is very rarely used, it was a surprise that Tarantino chose that for The Hateful Eight, as only like 50 theaters worldwide could fully show it.  </p>
<p>65mm 15-perf (70mm IMAX) is what Interstellar, The Dark Knight, etc. used, if you were to compare it to digital, it would effectively be around 12K-16K. There are only ~100 theaters in the world (thankfully I live by one and saw all the recent 70mm IMAX films this way). However, 70mm IMAX as a film format is being fazed out, they are using the new ARRI/IMAX 65 digital camera for most all upcoming true IMAX films (not &quot;fake&quot; ones like Transformers). And most all 70mm IMAX theaters that show Hollywood films are being converted into dual-4K laser projection (HDR and pure blacks, like OLED) with 11.1 surround.  </p>
<p>The only 70mm IMAX films in production currently are Dunkirk and Star Wars VIII. I don't know of any normal 70mm films in production.  </p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Why the downvotes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didnt know Dunkirk was being done in 70mm. this is great. Do you know if it's just segments or the full thing?</p>
<p>edit: <a href="http://www.in70mm.com/news/2016/evacuation/index.htm" target="_blank">this site</a> says its the whole thing is in 70mm, but that there are 100minutes filmed in 70mm, and the film is 135mins. so who knows at this point</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is filmed with 70mm IMAX cameras and standard 70mm cameras (65mm 5-perf). So while there are no 35mm shots, it still isn't 100% full IMAX.  </p>
<p>To my knowledge, the first 100% true IMAX movie will be Avengers: Infinity War Part 1, which will be using the new collaborative ARRI Alexa/IMAX 65 digital camera, meaning it won't be film. However, it's a CGI-heavy movie, and CGI is only in 2K for these types of movies (it would cost millions upon millions to upgrade their server farms to handle that amount of 4K rendering).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I understand what is meant by the sizes (35mm, 65mm) but what is &quot;perf&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are saying this, but I just haven't seen it in real life. I worked in theaters for years. The 35mm film never looked as crisp and detailed as the 4k/2k projectors do. Furthermore, at home, 1080p is jaw dropping at times and I've never had an oh dang moment with 35mm film. Well, excepted when it brained wrapped and it feel off the platter. I would love to see some actual comparisons.
Ps. Used all what was left of my motivation to write this. Someone needs to Google that information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got a point. A Theatrical release print is many generations back from the master and likely to have lost a lot of definition and clarity, while the Digital 2K projection is pixel for pixel accurate to the 2K master. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you're comparing digital projections to 35mm prints. There's no doubt that the digital projectors are better, however, many of the movies these days are shot on 35mm negatives and scanned. The rest of the process, including projection, is all digital.</p></div>		</li>
