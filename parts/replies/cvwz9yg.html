That's what you see happening in the gif of the fighter blowing his nose</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what happened to Enson Inoue in his UFC debut, back when they had multiple fights in one day.</p>
<p>Enson won his first fight but took a hit to the nose. Backstage he blew his nose and his face swelled up so he wasn't allowed to continue.</p>
<p>The replacement fighter (remember it was a tournament format so they had backups) was Tito Ortiz.</p>
<p>The opponent was Ken Shamrock's protege Guy Mezger which kicked off the feud between Ken and Tito.</p>
<p>Tito was kneeing Mezger and it looked like Mezger tapped out, even the announcers thought he had. The ref stopped the fight and checked a cut on Mezger then the fight resumed - much to everyone's surprise. Mezger then choked Tito out.</p>
<p>After, Tito called out the Lion's Den and Ken Shamrock thereby igniting the long-running and financially rewarding feud that brought MMA into the mainstream. </p>
<p>tl;dr </p>
<p>So, because Enson blew his nose the UFC blew up and Jon Jones did blow and hit a pregnant lady then ran off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot on here about breathing through the mouth as detrimental in MMA, but mouth breathing is ineffective as a general rule.</p>
<p><strong>Warning: science-y things follow</strong></p>
<p>So your mouth is a big wide open hole, which makes it easy for air to get in and out of low-resistance airways. For the most part, low-resistance airways are <em>sufficient</em> for air exchange, although not terribly <em>efficient</em>: you see, your low-resistance airways are low-resistance because there are very few alveoli (those little sac-like projections that facilitate exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between your lungs and blood; singular--alveolus), and so a lot of the air movement in your low-resistance airways is &quot;dead-space ventilation&quot;; that is, air movement that does not result in any exchange of gas between lungs and blood.</p>
<p>In your higher-resistance airways, there are much denser concentrations of alveoli. There are many reasons for the higher resistance in these airways: they are smaller in diameter, so the same flow goes into a smaller space; they do not have cartilaginous rings supporting them, so they have a tendency to collapse; they have surfactant that facilitates gas exchange and the capturing/movement of sputum and foreign bodies up and out of the lungs (aka &quot;mucociliary clearance&quot;), and so these airways tend to adhere to one another; and so on. These airways are harder to get air into--thus, high resistance--but <em>extremely</em> efficient at gas exchange, so the increased work pays off.</p>
<p>When you are primarily mouth breathing, the pressure generated within your chest cavity (aka intrathroacic pressure) is lower because there's simply not that much resistance to flow, and so you can get a big volume of air into the low-resistance system relatively quickly, which is sort of a rescue mechanism to allow you to ventilate the minimum necessary lung volume in order to keep your blood oxygenated and therefore your organs happy.</p>
<p>Your nose, on the other hand, is a high resistance circuit. In order to fill up your lungs breathing through your nose, you must generate a higher intrathoracic pressure, you get prolonged inspiration as a result, and so these high-resistance airways have both pressure support (from your chest wall) and extra time to open up. You get longer and more efficient gas exchange with a greater overall proportion of your lung volume, which means that you don't have to breathe as often when you breathe through your nose (which is why nose breathing is heavily utilized in yoga, meditation, etc. where the intention is to slow down and focus on breathing). </p>
<p>You can do a little experiment right now that can help demonstrate  the difference: time yourself taking the deepest breath you can tolerate through your mouth; then do the same through your nose. In my own experiments, a mouth breath takes <strong>on average 2.3-2.5 seconds</strong>; a nose breath, on the other hand, <strong>takes on average 6.3-6.5 seconds!</strong> Additionally, these breaths <em>feel</em> different, which you'll notice if you do a handful of mouth breaths as compared to a handful of nose breaths (<strong>warning: do not hyperventilate!</strong>)</p>
<p>Often in our daily lives, we use <em>both</em> nose and mouth breathing for air exchange, which helps us to use our lungs relatively efficiently without concentrating on our breathing. </p>
<p><strong>The Point</strong></p>
<p>When someone elbows your nose and effectively destroys your ability to use it as an airway, you <em>have</em> to mouth breathe, which--in addition to opening your jaw up to big ol' haymakers--is very inefficient, causing you to breathe harder and more frequently. This is very fatiguing compared to normal breathing, and can make all the difference in something like MMA, where there are often tiny margins between victory and defeat.</p>
