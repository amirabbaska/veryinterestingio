			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually EMTs are not required to apply their knowledge how to maximally disable a person, for them the reverse is true.</p>
<p>This is an interesting example how how &quot;knowledge&quot; is one thing and the interpretation and application what you want to do with it is a vastly different one that can change the entire focus of something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In movies, they sometimes show that when a person gets shot in the head, they fall and their  head pumps out blood like a small water fountain/bubbler.  And they also have people who get shot in the chest and shoot forth a jet of blood, like from a kid's mini-water pistol. Are these just bad props which try to capture the audience's attention or does it really happen?  </p>
<p>And for what it's worth, there are scenes where a person gets stabbed by a knife in the torso/waist area, the go &quot;Ack!&quot; and then they die - how realistic are those scenes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, these instances are props. Hollywood and cinema for the most part aren't really interested in accuracy and most of the time may not know what death by bullet looks like. The spurting and shooting blood can occur depending on which blood vessels were severed. </p>
<p>As for the knife fights, we were taught that to disable a sentry, you approach undetected from behind your target if possible and while covering their mouth to prevent outcry to shove a fighting knife into the body next to the spine rotating inward towards the center of the body inside the spine. This would go after those large blood vessels that we talked about earlier. When you have a very large change in blood pressure either high or low, you usually get a loss of consciousness. In this case we would be going after an instant loss of consciousness by significant drop in blood pressure to to piercing or severing the inferior vena cava (vein) if you are right handed and the aorta (artery) on the left. </p>
<p>Remember, in civilian life for a knife fight when both parties are armed with a knife it is a saying that &quot;The loser dies on the street, and the winner dies in the ambulance.&quot; If you as a unarmed civilian are confronted with a knife wielding attacker, the best course of action is to retreat at all speed and summon the proper authorities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks - and here I was thinking that a random stab to anywhere would work.  Never knew that there was an artery in the spine.  And I just realised that not only does attacking from teh back lessen the chances  of the target flailing and fighting back, there also isn't a ribcage to protect the important bits.</p>
<p>Also, thanks very much for the advice should a person ever get into a fight on the streets.  I'll be sure to pass this on to the people I know - they're pretty placid, but who knows if the fight instinct would suddenly kick in.  As you said it's best to run.</p></div>		</li>
