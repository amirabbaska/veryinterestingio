			<div class="markdown"><p>Microsoft's MFC has a CWinApp class.  MFC was developed around the same time.  That was the first place I saw &quot;App&quot;; but it wouldn't surprise me if it came way earlier than we're discussing because it just seems like a natural abbreviation, especially in the bad old 8.3 filename days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the nineties though, people only used app as an abbreviation of application, and pretty much only with a qualifier. e.g. Mission Critical App (application that had to work or the organization ceased to function), or Killer App (an application that would turn the company or person who produced it into an overnight success).</p>
<p>Now app isn't short for anything, and &quot;turn the flash on at max power when the user pushes a button&quot; qualifies as an &quot;app&quot; all by itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a difference.</p>
<p>A program is any set of instructions that make the computer do <em>something</em>. So, for example, the timer that lets your computer know when it’s time to run the Anti Virus, that’s a program... All applications are programs (or collection of programs), but not all programs are applications. An Operating System is a program (modern OSes are actually bundles of programs, even), but for the most part they are not applications.</p>
<p>What distinguishes an application is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They serve some human-oriented function. I.e. they allow some work to be done. Thus, a word processor is an application, an image or video editor are too, a social network is an application, an ERP or a CRM are applications, etc...</p>
</li>
<li>Applications, since are geared towards doing work for humans, usually have User Interfaces (most of the time, GUIs), to allow users to change parameters and produce work.</li>
</ol>
<p>Those are the differences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in the user's mind they are different. </p>
<p>I run programs to do things for Engineering or the like while apps are consumer content - easy to access and simplified. I play computer games when they are more involved - waiting to get my pc repaired atm - and &quot;a chess app&quot; when it's simple - tablet and cellphone compatible. </p>
<p>I enjoy my tablet and laptop for different things. I think the difference between &quot;program&quot; and &quot;app&quot; will widen in the public definition in the future. For example: I love the Total War series but it can not be compared to anything considered an app. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it gets weirder as time goes by. Someone already pointed out APIs... What about &quot;applets&quot;? What about &quot;skills&quot; for Alexa (or Google Home, or Cortana, or Siri; btw, are these AI apps, platforms, or OSes)? Are &quot;skills&quot; apps, or programs, or what are they? </p>
<p>I think that it's important to recognize that these definitions are fluid, and that the distinctions exist for different purposes. One purpose is marketing: there are some things people will be willing to pay, but others that people just expect to have for free. Also, for differentiation, people need to know what is part of a product or what isn't (i.e., &quot;The Google&quot; isn't part of &quot;Windows&quot;, even if you use Windows to access it). Another purpose is for engineering: to define scopes of work, to define workflows, etc... </p></div>		</li>
