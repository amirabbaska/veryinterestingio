<p>Throughout my life what I have perceived as red has remained as far as I can tell, the same. </p>
<p>If red could be very different between people, why does it appear not to change within myself? </p>
<p>My brain seems to be capable of consistently producing what I perceive as red, does this mean that red is a product of some property of human brains, or that brains are just capable of being consistent with a random qualia obtained upon first experience of that qualia? </p>
<p>Actually, yeah even that seems to be completely unfalsifiable. </p>
<p>Lets just partially merge brains really quick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question to have for understanding qualia. Qualia is an argument about external inconsistency; internal consistency is assumed. You see all red things as red; you might argue about which things are red as opposed to orange or yellow or even a dark purple or maroon. But if something is red, it's red. Ignoring those edge cases, if I point out something to you and say &quot;that thing is red&quot; and you say &quot;yes it is&quot; that doesn't answer the question of qualia. Even if we point out 10,000 things and we agree on which of those things are red and which are not, that still doesn't answer the question. The question of qualia doesn't actually matter (even less than usual) when we fight over whether a particular object is red or orange, yellow or green, blue and black or white and gold.</p>
<p>And there are many potential reasons red doesn't change for you, even assuming qualia is a true problem. Arguably your memory is a perception (a perception of a past perception) or at least a reflection that you perceive, and thus the thing is red every time you look at it in your memory and now, but your concept of red is constantly changing despite containing the same exact list of objects.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Is there any good reason to assume internal consistency though? If qualia is just a name applied to that problem, just to paint it that way, maybe qualia isn't exactly the right discussion.</p>
<p>It is a very good hint IMO that there is correlation between external consistency and internal consistency in this case. Still no proof of course, I agree that it can never be proven. But it's a good hint that most people perceive colors the same way if the same person keep perceiving colors the same way throughout life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was something similar in a philosophy class I had to take. I can't remember who it was, but the idea was that youâ€‹ can't tell something that they don't perceive something. If an alien comes down to earth and says that red is green, that's how he percieves the world. We can disagree with him, but we can't deny what he sees.</p></div>		</li>
