			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I’d say it’s a good chunk of both. Some got hunted to extinction, some were not able to adapt to the new climate/lack of space and resources and died out.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There evidence that basically within a few thousand years of humans arriving somewhere (Australia, America’s, etc.) all the megafauna went extinct.</p>
<p>To the point that 2 nearby areas, with the same climate, have radically different extinction dates - the only difference being when humans arrived.</p>
<p>Saw a source for that a while ago, I’ll try find it later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the overkill hypothesis, that was generally accepted in the past is now considered to be unlikely.  More dating on the extinctions has placed them both well before and well after human arrival meaning that we are not the cause. The solution that is most accepted now is that climate change in the Younger Dyras warming period forced the species and their food sources to extinction.
