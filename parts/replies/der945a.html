			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, planets and stars are spheres while galaxies and solar systems are usually disks. Both have gravity pulling inwards, and both usually have some spin (due to the conservation of the total angular momentum of all objects before collecting together). The difference that makes it so that one is a sphere and one is a disk is the major force counteracting gravity: spheres are dense enough and have low enough spin that the major counteracting force is simply the pressure of everything underneath, solar systems have more spin and/or are less dense so that centrifugal force (inertia of spinning objects) counteracts gravity, but only in the axis of rotation, thus giving the flattened disk shape.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What would the gravity be like on the Death Star? Surely a construct that large would have it's own gravitational pull, right? Would that affect the physical infrastructure of it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, it's not actually that big, and would have very minimal gravity. Wookiepedia claims 160km diameter, and if we assume it's using some futuristic steel-like compound, I'd say aluminum could be a good approximation of its density. So if the Death Star were a solid sphere of aluminum, it would weight (2.375 g/cm^(3)) × (4×pi×(80 km)^(3)/3 = 6.44×10^6 km^(3)) = 5.09×10^18 kg, which is tiny (Earth is about 6×10^(24)). And that's assuming it's a solid sphere when it's probably mostly hollow. If it did have that much mass, the acceleration due to gravity someone would experience if they were standing <em>just</em> inside the outer wall would be 0.053 m/s^(2), and a 100 kg (220 lb) person would weigh only 5.3N = 1.19 lbs. Moreover, this would require an &quot;onion&quot; type design, where &quot;down&quot; is toward the center of the Death Star, which is not what's shown. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Gravity is a function of density, and while large, the DS is not really all that dense.  There is a lot of room for hallways, hanger bays, trash compactors, mess halls, sleeping quarters, showers, toilets, armories, infirmaries, etc.  So most of the DS is actually empty, so it would need some sort of artificial gravity to keep everything in place</p></div>		</li>
