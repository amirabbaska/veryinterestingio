			<div class="markdown"><p>A knot in your low back may be in your Quadratus Lumborum muscle.  A therapist would locate it and press on it. You would curl yourself into a &quot;C&quot; shape toward the therapist while the knot releases. This position short-circuits the pain signal to your brain and makes it less painful for you. After the knot releases, you would stretch out in the opposite direction to restore your range of motion, and then press back toward the therapist while they push against you for resistance. This helps to reset your muscle memory. </p></div>		</li>

Lay on your side with your knees bent and try to slowly lift your top leg for a few seconds then set it back down repeat this several times each side. If the leg hurts too much to lift then lightly crunch the torso to while supporting the head.
then lay on your back, legs bent so feet are flat and alternating legs press one foot down. Do this several times then straighten the legs and press the heals down alternatingly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The popular foam rolling which is used with a hard or bumpy foam roller bruises the tissue and can cause a contract response when ANY pain is felt; almost everyone I speak to proudly states that the no pain no gain rule applies.
The IT bands which are tendons for example are the most abused and should NEVER BE ROLLED.
Point blank tendons have a set length that cannot be changed. (Fascia is a different story.)</p>
<p>and foam rolling does not stretch a muscle because at base it just temporarily compresses nerves.  Nerves generally like compression but not to the extent or the kind that given with those rollers.
MELT method is the proper technique for foam rolling and the only one I would ever suggest for public use. It is a course that anyone can take that properly describes motion and foam rolling with soft rollers and balls that target the facial system and joint nerves not the tendons and muscle bellies. </p>
<p>Overall it's a combination of misinformation about how the body Works and an old saying that is the Bain of my existence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its true that the methods you've listed - active range of motion, proprioceptive techniques, MELT method rolling etc - are useful and effective.  But jeezus dude do you really think manual manipulation doesn't work?  &quot;Knots&quot; can be related to fascia, muscle, nerve, tendon, adhesions etc.  Its true that rubbing doesn't work for all of these.  But it works a lot of the time.  You can't go around telling people that the traditional methods don't work just to sound smart.  Physical therapists have doctoral degrees and still employ manual tissue manipulation techniques (as well as lots of other things).  Even elite level athletes use massage and KNOW subjectively that massage works a lot of the time.  They also know it doesn't fix every issue and have an entire staff of people trained in all sorts of things to help keep them in top shape.  </p>
<p>I've known massage therapists like you that like to discredit all modalities other than what you don't use and act like the only enlightened LMT out there. Usually you just don't like the effort of deep tissue massage and you have all these magical cutting edge medical sounding techniques that just don't cut it; or you simply lack the high level, comprehensive understanding of the body to properly employ said techniques.  Y'all like to use medical sounding language and link articles and shit too.  The thing people don't realize about medical research related to physiotherapy and the like is that its so conflicted.  Even studies on simple stretching were contradictory for a long time.  Now there is a growing consensus about a nuanced (not black and white) approach to stretching.  Medical science is still in its infancy.  The whole human race is still in its infancy.  I mean we even recently discovered a new ligament in the knee in 2013: <a href="http://www.livescience.com/40981-new-ligament-found-in-human-knee.html" target="_blank">http://www.livescience.com/40981-new-ligament-found-in-human-knee.html</a></p>
<p>2013 and we were (prolly still are) &quot;discovering&quot; basic anatomy.  Quit pretending like its all figured out and you've got the answers.  In case you don't want to read the article a french surgeon postulated the existence of the ligament in the 1800's.  And doctors and researchers and modern surgeon's missed it even with all the imaging and diagnostic equipment at their disposal not to mention the research cadavers.  We don't have the human body all figured out.  A person needs to explore and find what works for them.  People need to connect with their bodies not listen to techno-babble on the internet.  That french surgeon who theorized the existence of the ligament in 1879 did so because of his familiarity with the body.  He had no other way to learn.  People nowadays think they can learn everything in a book or figure it out in a lab. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your rant is very implying. I understand the need for difference of opinion. However, many your statements are unsupportive. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>You are implying a lot here. I never claimed to know everything, I perform recovery treatment so medical terminology is necessary. To imply that I would have a complete disregard for a manual modality that is THE foundation to my career is an ignorant implication. </p>
<p>Any therapist in my position learns how to provide relatable terms for client education purposes. Just like how a doctor would explain any illness to his or her patient.
We provide knowledge that we know works for the most comfortable process possible and allow room for modification. To not provide an easy to understand rundown is neglectful to their recovery and personal development.</p>
<p>Also, the term &quot;deep tissue&quot; means very little. Pressure and depth are two very different things. Deep tissue is a popular term for a firm sweedish most days which is not hard to accomplish. Engaging the underlying tissue takes time and skill. </p>
<p>Secondly, please take it to consideration that we did not discuss the types of &quot;knots&quot;.
Will manual techniques prove useful for scar tissue? Of course! THey are prefered. Will rubbing a spasm fix a spasm, it depends but rarely so. What I am saying is that there are techniques utilized for at home care as preventatives and then there are &quot;in session&quot; techniques that don't cause A LOT OF PAIN FOR THE CLIENT. </p>
<p>I would expect any professional to understand that &quot;alternative&quot; techniques doesnt imply a reformity; it is a different application entierly just to make sure that there isn't unnecessary discomfort: let's be honest, scrubbing a knot hurts! </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Once again you are implying...</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Implying! And as rehabilitation therapists we are exposed to scenarios every day that let us know what can work for someone who is in a vulnerable state. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>People need to connect with their bodies not listen to techno-babble on the internet.&lt;  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even when connected we all experience sensations that are hard to figure out. It's confusing to try and discover what to do if you have no base of education in the health field. So a community as a sounding board is highly necessary. It is up to those community members to not falsely inform. </p>
<  People nowadays think they can learn everything in a book or figure it out in a lab. >

It's true there is a lot of ego in newly licenced indviduals. But those of us in this community go out of the way to perform research and ask those hard questions for the next patients sake. And in my field each session is a lab that is wonderfully interactive with the client for immediate feedback on any present condition.  

 Lastly, all of this extra information mixed in that youve stated is irrelevant to the conversation. It seems to only be stated to try and prove an unsupported theory that I know everything and disregard fundamental applications to diswade clients from other practitioners or ego stomp them as ill-informed; in an attempt to make me feel ashamed? QUIT IMPLYING. Dear god, by trying get to prove my ignorance you have only convinced me that you are minimally experienced with qualified therapists.</div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't imply anything.  I just came out and said it.  </p>
<p>I don't have the time to parse through your reply bit by bit for you so here is an example of things you did - argumentation techniques you've employed - that don't hold any water.  Your whole reply is based on these methods of discussion that just lead around the subject instead of actually engaging the reasonings behind what I said:</p>
<p>you said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I never claimed to know everything, I perform recovery treatment so medical terminology is necessary. To imply that I would have a complete disregard for a manual modality that is THE foundation to my career is an ignorant implication.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this sentence, by itself, seems like it has a logical flow and ends with me having made an &quot;ignorant implication&quot;.  The problem is that over and over in your original comment you told people what works and what doesn't and what's true and what's not.  I'm not gonna copy those lines here for you.  You know what you did.  You even began with the &quot;professional here&quot; that people on reddit use to establish that they are authorities on the subject.  </p>
<p>So this technique of yours amounts to &quot;I'm a massage therapist and therefore I <em>care</em> and could never be egotistical or act like a know-it-all; therefore, you are ignorant.  You see how it just side steps that I am accusing you of being a know-it-all for legit reasons i.e. the way you presented yourself in your original comment?  Shitty way to argue dude.</p></div>		</li>
