<blockquote>
<p>From Legal point of view; According to the freedom of the high seas code, icebergs can be considered a water resource and subject to acquisition for private use anywhere in the world.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the text of the Antarctic Treaty,</p>
<p><em>The provisions of the present Treaty shall apply to the area south of 60o South latitude, including all ice shelves, but nothing in the present Treaty shall prejudice or in any way affect the rights, or the exercise of the rights, of any State under international law with regard to the high seas within that area.</em></p>
<p>Once an iceberg has broken free from its parent glacier or ice shelf it is therefore no longer affected by the treaty. So as long as the UAE doesn't start deliberately smashing the ice shelves to make more bergs, it shouldn't be a problem.</p></div>		</li>
