<p>Once the Earth’s climate climbs to a certain temperature, cooling will start.</p>

<p>This is not true and not at all how ice age cycles work. The changes is temperatures are due to changes in Earth’s orbit around the sun which slightly changes how much solar radiation is absorbed by the poles during summer time. Summer solar insulation is critical for ice sheets like Antarctica and the Laurentide (previously covering Canada) and therefore it controls global climate on these timescales.</p>
<p>The physics of the current warming are totally independent of these physics. Human caused global warming is so strong that it wins out over the orbital changes and there are several lines of evidence that we have already pushed back the next ice age tens of thousands of years.</p></div>		</li>
