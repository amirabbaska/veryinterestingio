			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Also let's take that from another angle.</p>
<p>The mind-body connection is very deep, and often one feeds the other back and forth. Reciprocal , you could say.</p>
<p>We don't only smile when we're happy, sometimes we are happy because we're smiling.</p>
<p>The brain figures, &quot;well gee, I'm only supposed to smile when I'm happy. I'm smiling now. Better get with the happy.&quot;</p>
<p>This is why forcing yourself to laugh (very hard laughter) can boost your mood. It's why meditation produces mental quiet and calm after most sessions.</p>
<p>So back to OP, your body is flooded with these chemicals which mean danger is around. Surely there must be some impending doom, even though the threat is gone!</p>
<p>As the chemicals are absorbed and the systems calm back down, and you finish waking up to realize what is fake and what is real life, so too can your mind return to (relative) ease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s worth mentioning that clinical depression doesn’t have a root cause necessarily, it’s a disease. Trying to get over it is very difficult because it clouds your judgement. Try talking to somebody maybe! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds more like you specifically was told not to show your emotions rather than society messing you up. </p>
<p>Sucks though. Tried anti-depressants? </p>
<p>Men are on average less emotional than women and less likely to depressed. Hence the stereotype.</p></div>		</li>
