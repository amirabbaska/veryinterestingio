			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a nuclear power plant, and would use a cloud chamber twice daily to check a sample of condensate from the bottom of the turbines. </p>
<p>Crude as all hell and of course we had geiger counters, but it was a neat belt-n-braces approach to check for stray alpha radiation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having done this experiment as well once: very frequently! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xky3f1aSkB8" target="_blank">Here</a> is a short video from CERN with a quick demonstration (and instructions how to make one yourself). Also, for a more spectacular demonstration <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiscokCGOhs" target="_blank">here</a> is an example of radioactive material in a cloud chamber :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen this done before, and would love to do it. I'm curious if lesser radioactive materials would show any noticeable traces like this, such as the well regarded unit of measure banana or maybe brazil nuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a exact number for you, but I can give you a rough ballpark. On a cloud chamber I saw that was something like 1m x 1m x 30cm, there was more than 1 trail per second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without an emitter nearby, maybe 30-80 trails per minute?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In reality, you're probably not seeing many cosmic rays in your cloud chamber, but rather the daughter products from collisions that the cosmic rays had further up in the atmosphere. Still very cool thing to see though! </p></div>		</li>
