			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, Mythbusters did this experiment and found that curse words or phrases were more effective than shouting non-expletives. The reasoning was that curse words are 'stored' in a separate way from ordinary language and we release adrenaline and endorphins when we use so called forbidden words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If curses are more effective... Then...</p>
<p>If I take a group of babies, and for a few years I let them grow up normally and teach them language and such. But I keep telling them &quot;Don't say pasta! Pasta is a nasty word!&quot;. So does that mean they'll shout &quot;Pasta!&quot; when in pain and it'll be more effective?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's it precisely. My research found that swear word offensiveness is subjective and some people have weird &quot;hierarchies&quot; of word offensiveness. One participant for example, had her aggressiveness levels rocket when she said &quot;shit&quot; over other words like &quot;fuck&quot; and &quot;cunt&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
