			<div class="markdown"><p>Tbh. If people stopped being fuckwits then its really not that hard to avoid viruses. Even windows xp will work totally fine if you have enough neurons to know better than thinking that single horny moms in your area need sex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a few issues here.</p>
<p>Sometimes exploits appear that take advantage of update mechanisms or other features of the OS, not every nasty originates from going to bad websites or opening scam emails. (Although PLENTY do, probably the majority as it's easier to trick humans than computers). Thus meaning it's really important to stay on top of updates in general. As an operating system that will never be updated again, Windows XP is A Very Bad Idea.</p>
<p>Also, while avoiding nasties for personal/individual use is one thing.... for businesses it's quite another. We sell most of our stuff business-to-business. For large companies to run without AV, you are assuming that <em>none</em> of your users will ever fall for a scam... this is not a smart gamble. Additionally, there's probably regulatory requirements. If you process credit cards or have people's private information (especially private healthcare info) and you get audited, and your security setup has holes... you can be in a lot of hot water <em>even if no nasties ever got in</em>. On the flipside, there are &quot;safe harbor&quot; laws where if you DO have a good setup and something bad happens, you get out of fines. For example, if a hospital loses a flash drive of people's private information, they have to pay enormous fines and alert everyone, but if they're setup to encrypt all their portable media automatically, they're fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you're saying here. My point is that windows xp might be ancient and vulnerable but if you're an average guy who really doesn't use his PC much then windows xp can serve him just fine if he knows how to not be an A grade dumbass. Its still not recommended to use XP though.</p></div>		</li>
