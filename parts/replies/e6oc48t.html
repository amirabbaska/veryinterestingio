			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's wrong. You don't divide people's pizza they already have. A five year old would understand what you're saying, but what you're saying is wrong. It's too over simplified. This isn't eli4</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much the size of the pizza as much as it is the style, or toppings, of the pizza. At this point in time think of it as the popularity of the pizza giving it value. If the pizza isn't popular its not worth as much. We can argue that pepperoni is the most popular choice, while a pizza with green olives, pickles and anchovies would be the least popular pizza obtaining less value due to very little demand. Pizza shops have infinitely more pepperoni in stock than they do anchovies based on popularity. </p></div>		</li>
