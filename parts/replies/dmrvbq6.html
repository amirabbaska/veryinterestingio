			<div class="markdown"><p>Performance cars exhausts have a similar issue actually.  Mufflers slow down exhaust flow which decreases engine performance.  It's why NASCAR and F1 don't use them.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know the performance decrease is marginal and doesn't really matter to the consumer market unless you have a turbo.) </p></div>		</li>
