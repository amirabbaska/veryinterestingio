Cybernetics researcher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Warwick" target="_blank">Kevin Warwick</a> has actually done so <em>to himself</em>. The results were impressive - not only could an electrode array implanted on his median nerve produce a signal detailed enough to control a robotic arm, but he was also able to <em>obtain feedback from sensors on the arm</em>. Even more interesting, at the end of the project, when the array was removed, it was found that nerve tissue had <em>grown around it, enclosing the sensor</em>.</p>
<p>As to why such techniques aren't used in modern prostheses, it's likely a few reasons. It's more complex, it involves surgery on nerves, and it may even be that modern prosthetics simply aren't advanced enough to take advantage of the potential gain in information flow.</p></div>		</li>

The goal is to have a skin/glove with full fingertip tactile feedback.</p>
<p>It's pretty cool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's definitely several challenges, here are a few off the top of my head: </p>
<p>(1) picking up a clean signal - yes, you can get signals from the nerves, but you will also get other signals like EMG or ECG, isolating the signals of interest can get complicated</p>
<p>(2) interpreting the signals - even if you get a clean purely neural recording how do you analyze and put this data to use? This might be simpler if you are recording from peripheral nerves near an end-organ but what about things closer to the CNS where nerves branch off to multiple sites in the body - what neural signal is relevant and what is not?</p>
<p>(3) recording stability - you might get good signals for a day or a week but what about 6 months? A year? 5 years? Anything you put in the body is gonna result in foreign body response and that is likely problematic down the road, how do you account for this?</p>
<p>This is just what comes to mind from purely a recording standpoint. And even if you solve these challenges for a particular part of the body, it may not translate elsewhere. Peripheral nerves vs central nerves vs the brain are all different. This is purely from a recording standpoint. Stimulating the nerves has its own set of challenges. Just a quick overview from someone working in a research lab focusing on neuromodulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest issue as far as the foreign body being in the object is at its core the same issue facing those with implantable medical devices but for a more directly observable example look at people who have piercings. Yes it's a very different interface it's a very different set up but overall it's still the same core functionality. One very classic example I can use here is people who gauge their ears. You have people that have ears that have been stretched quite thin or large whatever you want to term it and can wear them for years and years and years gradually growing larger / thinner. Still if they remove the gauges overtime he ear will close back up to almost if not in some cases fully closed. See you have that Natural Instinct with the body in general with any foreign object to try and repair the damage. You compound that with an implantable like a medical device or sensory needle cording needle whatever the case may be for the interface for the prosthetic limb with infection rate. The longer you have something inside your body that has any kind of foreign entity to it your body is going to keep fighting it and fighting it at some point it may switch off but at that point it's going to accept it and stop treating it as a foreign body and just accept it as being there part and parcel which means is not going to be able to adequately protect that area anymore because it will treat whatever goes on as being normal if that happens. Viability of such a thing as side you would have to have constant monitoring and constant cleaning somehow of the area or have to keep changing needles which just again the logistics of that and keeping it clean and free of infection are mind-boggling. You have plenty of patients who are on proactive and preventative antibiotics and still get infections despite such as well the more you use antibiotics in a proactive manner the stronger antibiotics you'll need to fight off infections you do get. So you also have that whole side of things that needs to be resolved for something like that to be long-term viable. I'm not saying it's impossible we've come Leaps and Bounds the things we can do now with biotech and cross bridging in small forms is amazing So eventually there's no reason to think you can't be applied to prosthetic limbs it's just another hurdle.</p></div>		</li>
