			<div class="markdown"><p>The latest results from orbital dynamic simulations are actually suggesting that the rings of Saturn are young, coming from a previous inner moon system entering an unstable resonance and grinding itself into bits in a series of catestrophic impacts about 95 million years ago.  Outside the Roche limit new moons recondensed (we can tell their age due to evidence of their past gravitational interactions) and inside the debris cannot recondense.</p></div>		</li>
