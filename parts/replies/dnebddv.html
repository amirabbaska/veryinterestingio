			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I live in Beijing, and the nice thing about taking the fast train to Shanghai is that at both ends the intercity train is connected to the metro system seamlessly. Similar to European cities as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Public transport within cities is of course nice. But compare inter-city trains to flights instead. People need to get to and from the airports and they do not check in their cars on the flights. Obviously flying is still popular, even distances that trains could compete on in total travel time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of a chicken egg situation. We don't have high speed trains because there's no public transportation and we don't have public transporation because we need a car to go long distances anyway. It's not a mutually exculsive thing. We need high speed train and urban public transportation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If there was adequate public transportation within cities, people could drive to cities, park, and then use public transportation. This would be more convenient than taking HSR between cities and then relying on Uber/taxis. Once each city (or a few cities) have their own systems, they can begin to be connected.</p>
<p>On a completely unrelated note, and I'm sorry if this sounds snarky, but...the egg came first. Something that wasn't quite yet a chicken laid an egg that had the first chicken in it. That's how evolution works.</p></div>		</li>
