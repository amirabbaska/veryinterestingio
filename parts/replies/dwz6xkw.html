			<div class="markdown"><p>Mass shooters almost always kill themselves when they're done, and the news reports it 24/7 regardless.</p>
<p>Experts agree that news coverage of mass shootings encourages future mass shooters, but the news covers it anyways. News channels are businesses and they only care about views and money, not human life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what's the alternative to reporting on it? Ignoring it and hoping it solves its self? </p>
<p>I think it could be argued that that's part of why people don't take suicide and mental health as seriously as they should. If there was a news report for every suicide, people would be like &quot;holy fuck, we need to fix something&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you. 590 people died in US Mass shootings in 2017,  suicide killed 44,000. Let's cover these deaths proportionately by talking about suicide <strong>75x more</strong> than we talk about mass murder.</p></div>		</li>
