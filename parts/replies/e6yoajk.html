			<div class="markdown"><p>Opposite sides of a room can vary a couple degrees, and being next to the window makes a big difference in full sun (that's why your cats like to sit in the sunlight). Some thermostats in central air conditioned living spaces have a &quot;circulate&quot; setting, or something synonymous, that turns on the fan periodically to mix the air throughout the house and pull in air from potential hot/cold spots to kick the thermostat on. Generally uses a little more power with the benefit of reducing temperature variance. </p>
<p>The big reason for it &quot;feeling&quot; warmer or cooler is largely local temperature changes in your house due to sun through the windows away from the thermostat and unmanaged variations in humidity that affect how well your sweat is evaporating (when it's hot) or how much energy can be sunk into a unit of air from your skin when it's cold (water vapor holds a lot more heat than regular nitrogen and oxygen). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ceiling fans are great for keeping the air flowing through your house.  In the winter, flip the little switch on the side of your fan motor to reverse it's direction.  Instead of blowing air down on you, it pulls it upwards, displacing the hot air that collects at the top of the space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mean radiant temperature which results form Cold/Hot walls is another factor. My house has no leaks and extra insulation, The comfortable temperature range is huge from 78 to 64 assuming humidity is controlled.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since your house is so well sealed, does your HVAC have external air intakes?  Do you have to run it occasionally just so it doesn't feel stuffy inside?  Always wondered about totally sealing any air leaks/drafts in a house and really good insulation.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the difference was also day and night time then possibly it’s also that people move less when resting so you are generating less body heat. Basically if you are moving your body is warmer than when at rest. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can very much confirm that humans make a ton of heat. Had like 8 people over one night to watch a fight and hangout in a ~1000 sqft apartment. Thermostat was set to 68 and it was having trouble keeping up. Now if I have more than 4-5 people, I'll turn it down to like 65 in the summer before people get there. Winter time I open a window.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree except I had ecobee with thermometers in every room and I surprisingly experience the same effect yet the temp in every room generally is 0.75<em>F to 1.5</em>F of each other. The engineer in me suspects it probably has more to do with the variation in humidity between outside and inside. 72<em>F at 20% humidity will feel different than 72</em>F at 80% humidity </p></div>		</li>
