			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be willing to bet that most code on the internet or software that isn't made by large companies like Google, Adobe, or a Microsoft (obviously lots more) are not reviewed. Things like video games, random websites, plugins, and lots of other stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any company worth it's salt does code review. Even the smaller ones. Because if you are only thinking short term you aren't going to make it long term.</p>
<p>I haven't worked in the video game industry, but I would seriously doubt they have no code review whatsoever on a major AAA title. Smaller indie studios? Sure. The difference here is that you typically release that software and fix bugs with patches, but very rarely do you extend new features and functionality for over a decade like some companies do with their software.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've worked for several AAA studios and they all required code review. Most of the time it's talking over your changes at your desk for a couple minutes with another engineer. At sensitive points in the project, especially when all of engineering is in triage mode, it tends to be more formal, and checkins require not just review, but director approval.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine working at a reputable software company that <em>doesn't</em> do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol! I've worked for (as of now) 3 major software companies over nearly 18 years, all international and all who have been around for decades and are making bank. I think the number of code reviews I've <em>participated</em> in might only be in the dozens.</p>
<p>I'm sure that's not the case in, say, a major game developer or in the financial industry, but in the industries I've been in, we rely on smart developers who do the right thing (and let go those who end up being not smart or aren't doing the right thing) and we rely on unit test coverage by devs and functional testing by a QA group.</p>
<p>It's not like you can screw up a piece of code and have no one find out. Everyone knows who is good and who isn't and that filters in to reviews (all these companies do peer reviews as well) and eventually to whether or not you have a job.</p>
<p>It's not perfect, but it's also <em>way</em> faster than code reviews and gives devs the agency to fix things when they find them. The one time one company tried to institute mandatory code reviews on a team (not mine) all that happened was productivity slowed down dramatically ... quality didn't improve. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could depend on the industry.</p>
<p>I've always worked in the financial industry, either banks on their trading software and in-house apps or at software companies working on the trading software itself.</p>
<p>The banks are more relaxed but there are still 10 or so people who could see what is changed...i doubt they look though.</p>
<p>The trading software companies were fairly strict, it gets reviewed and critiqued no matter your level. A code change submitted to the bug tracking system (only way) triggers an email that has color formatted diffs of what you changed and whatever descriptions you wrote.</p>
<p>That email triggers no less than three people to walk over and tell you how they would have done it.</p>
<p>It was funny to see an email come in and the same 'know it alls' pop up and walk over to that poor dev's desk.</p>
<p>And trust me when i say that if you had done it the way they would..they'd mention a slightly different way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also it depends on the company, the country and the project involved.</p>
<p>Bank software, for example, have to pass several severe audited certifications in EU countries. If the company does not approve the certifications, they cannot use that software, and if it does it can be the end of the bank and jail for the owners. Serious business.</p></div>		</li>
