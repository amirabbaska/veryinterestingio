			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to go into the maths to explain it properly. The overview is that if you sample a wave at a frequency of twice the maximum frequency of the wave, you can recreate the original wave exactly (assuming you take an exact reading at each sample point). If you sample less than 2 times the max frequency, then the original wave might do something unexpected between sample points, and that would cause lost information. But with more than 2 times the max frequency, it's always entirely predictable. </p></div>		</li>
