			<div class="markdown"><p>My father is this way.  He was an alcoholic most of my life, finally going through AA when I was a teenager.  He got sober, fixed a lot of things that were wrong in his (and our) lives, and became the father he always wanted to be (and, when drunk, thought he was).</p>
<p>But, after years of attending AA meetings and staying sober, he began to distance himself from their philosophy.  He understands why it works for so many, but it stopped working for him.  He had addressed his underlying problems, fixed his life, and was tired of being told that even having so much as one drink would destroy it all.</p>
<p>Now, years later, he does drink again.  But, he drinks in moderation.  A glass or two of whiskey (his preferred drink) at family holidays, maybe a beer on the weekends over the summer, and he's fine.  He hasn't been drunk in nearly 20 years, and is still the same wonderful father we discovered had been hiding under the booze for so long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same with my uncle. He was a pretty bad alcoholic. Huge anger issues when he was drinking. He went to AA on and off again. He'd be doing good for a while and then he'd fall off the wagon. A couple years ago, he learned he can have a couple drinks AND not be an asshole. Now he just has a few and he's good to go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a wonderful story :) The literature of AA admits in a couple places that this is possible and even encourages folks to seek out other methods of getting well, whether it involves abstinence or moderation. The Big Book simply says that if a drinker can't control the amount he/she drinks, then maybe AA is a good idea. That's as far as it goes. Sounds like your dad was able to eventually control it, and that's truly remarkable. I applaud it, as everyone should!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will say that most in AA overwhelmingly do have an &quot;all or nothing&quot; philosophy... I talk to my therapist about moderation, I don't think I'd bring it up in a meeting.</p>
<p>And there's <em>plenty</em> to talk about in meetings anyway :) </p>
<p>I think AA helps a lot of people in early recovery (like me), because when you first realize that you want to address the problem you do need to completely abstain for awhile just to get your head on straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AA isn't really all that effective comparatively. There's a lot of religious and superstitious stuff thrown in that isn't very helpful. </p>
<p>Especially considering the ouija board element behind its creation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh. <em>Eh.</em></p>
<p>Yeah, but this thought is so prevalent that I can't help but to respond every time I see it mentioned... AA meetings vary <em>wildly.</em> Like, really wildly. The difference between an 8 PM meeting in the financial district and a 10 AM meeting in the suburbs is huge. </p>
<p>There are tons of meetings out there which de-emphasize the god aspect, and go out of their way to say &quot;god as we know him,&quot; never just &quot;god.&quot; (To me, this is the Unitarian &quot;interdependent web of life,&quot; but I digress).</p>
<p>And as far as the &quot;superstition&quot; stuff goes, the science of addiction is <strong>still</strong> really fucking weak. I'm an alcoholic engineer and was astounded to learn how little we know about it.</p>
<p>Point is, one thing that we are fairly effing certain that helps is talking to other people who have the same problem, and AA provides that in 50 states, 7 days a week. I'm not saying it's perfect by ANY means, but I know the god stuff scared me away for a while, and I would have been better off going sooner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe drinking too much or having risky excessive sex, anything that fills the void in you, and triggers a dopamine fill in your brain, is a symptom of the illness. I was a heroin addict but also filled that void with sex when I was &quot;clean&quot; from drugs. In my experience, until you address what you're trying to avoid feeling, you can fill your emptiness with anything in an obsessive and unhealthy way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, recovered alcoholic and I still drink in moderation. When I say moderation I mean I dont drink every single day every minute like I used to. I drink maybe once or twice a week when Im out with friends and I ussually drink way more than I should but I dont feel the need to consume alcohol every hour like before.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that according to the new strict guidelines on alcohol use, if you get intoxicated every week then you're starting back down the path to alcoholism.  I was watching a mini series on HBO about drinking and it said that having more than 4 ounces of booze within a couple hours is binge drinking.  It was eye opening to hear what health professionals consider &quot;unacceptable behavior&quot; now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently went to the health center on my campus and they asked questions about drinking. I said I have like 0 to 6 drinks a week (mostly over a night or two usually a weekend and never getting drunk) and occasionally a night of 10+ (obviously getting drunk but it's a weekend usually and a once a month thing with friends). The doctor made a big deal about how I shouldn't do this. I just see it as normal behavior for someone in their 20s. I guess according to them you can't ever get drunk even if you are in control of your drinking/ don't have a problem. </p>
<p>Getting drunk once a week seems like an edge case to me. I've had period where I drunk at least once a week and still didn't have a problem. It's all how the person approaches it. Are they getting drunk once a week because they feel they have to (even if they don't necessarily recognize it as that)? Then they have a problem. Are they just drinking because that's how their social circle works but missing a week or even multiple is no big deal? Then there isn't a problem. I can see how it could easily jump from one to the other but that's why you have to pay attention and be responsible for yourself. </p></div>		</li>
