Red will grant me health, green will make me sick, and purple will turn me into a giant fucking spider that fucks his enemies into the ground and leaves a nicely written apology letter informing later passerbys I had not given a single fuck about their family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older game systems didn't start with a wide color palette, so those colors weren't always available.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is also why they use blue liquid to advertise nappies (diapers) and ladies sanitary products, as using red would obviously be too graphic for our innocent little minds, and yellow (wee) and green (pus or something?) have their connotations too.</p></div>		</li>
