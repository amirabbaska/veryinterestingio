			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be right about it simply being the most noticeable! I'm autistic myself and while I very rarely have outbursts like I used to, I still defer back to the good ol' head smacking. Ironically I used to wonder if it was causing me mental issues, never occurred to me that it was a symptom of one.....</p></div>		</li>

<p>The question is, are you doing it because you feel overwhelmed, or because it gets you all those dragon girls?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You nailed it with every word. Sometimes it's hard to distinguish which reason my son has for this, especially for people who don't know him well, as the lines get blurred easily.
I wish we had people as well versed as yourself to help with my boy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like /u/PandaPandamonium said, please do seek help! You may already be receiving services. In that case, if you have a bad experience with a technician or therapist, <em>don't give up.</em> Like any field, there are people you'll gel with and people who rub you the wrong way. You can request a different case manager, technician, etc. I hope you can find someone that really fits well with your family. </p></div>		</li>

I work in the field and this is advice I give to anyone with a child that has behavioral issues, autism or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Commenting directly (rather than in response to the ABA suggestion bc i want you to see this) to say as an autistic person trust me. do NOT take your child to ABA. do some research on autistic adults who have been thru ABA. most of us are traumatized. its horrific. Many autistic adults subjected to even &quot;kind&quot; ABA have PTSD now. Look into other forms of therapy. stay ten miles away from anything that tries to remove all stimming (stimming in non-self injurous ways is healthy!!) and stay ten miles away from anything that uses our special interests as &quot;treats&quot; only, because being deprived of special interests in general can be psychologically torturous.
Do some research. Trust autistic adults. do not trust ABA. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RBT here who is just starting to study for BCBA. I answered OP almost exactly the same but thought attention was a bigger MO than self stim and most were learned. </p>
<p>I work in an intensive in home as well as therapy center that focuses on our early learners (18 months to 2.5 yrs) and functional communication (mand training) as a first step. Majority of the ABC data we've been collecting show gaining attention as the primary function. Most of our families don't report SIBs until mid extinction burst which the antecendent for is attention. </p>
<p>Just curious as to why you said it starts as selfstim.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent points. I agree 100% sometimes SIBs occur only during extinction bursts, where behavior escalates because it used to work, now it doesn't work, so the client turns the dial up to 11. </p>
<p>So, I'm thinking this through here. I'm looking at it this way: Some people engage in SIBs without any extinction procedure in place. The behavior has to happen first in order to get reinforced, and then we see the increase or maintenance of the behavior. So, WHY does the behavior happen in the first place?</p>
<p>It might be that being exposed to a loud noise (unconditioned stimulus) -&gt; hitting head (unconditioned response). It's the same with the old school animal experiments where rats were exposed to aversive stimuli. It's this automatic, sensory behavior where it starts.</p>
<p>Now that the behavior has happened, even JUST once, it's what happens next is <strong>critical</strong>. Did the behavior get A TON of attention? Probably did. Did the behavior get them access to tangibles? Probably did. </p>
<p>For some learners, that ONE TIME of high attention or immediate access to a tangible is enough to set in motion an intense learning history that you and your coworkers have to spend so much time and effort to &quot;undo.&quot; </p>
<p>For other learners, it may take a series of many self-injurious events to set that learning history that I think you're seeing, but eventually other functions do usually develop.  </p>
<p>What you're describing in the extinction burst makes total sense! My point is I do not think that all SIBs are attention-seeking. I think for many people with SPD/ASD something <strong>elicits</strong> that behavior, learning and (accidental) reinforcement occur, and later other factors <strong>evoke</strong> that same behavior for various functions. </p>
<p>PS: I also work in early intervention services. It's a hard, hard, HARD job. Keep it up!</p>
<p>PPS: &quot;Evidence suggests that the common functions of behavior are: social attention, access to tangible rewards, escape or avoidance of activities or situations, and internal stimulation.&quot; So basically all the functions are possible! I didn't mention escape, which does happen at the EI level, but in my professional experience it's not <em>as</em> common as tangibles, attention, and sensory. Though escape is a function I have seen in other behaviors, like elopement (obvi). Not so much with SIBs in my experiences with my students at this time. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3990505/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3990505/</a></p></div>		</li>
