<p>I'm not so sure about that.  I've picked very near ripe fruit off our trees as a teen.  Sure, not completely ripe but give 'em a day or so.  After they spent more than a few days on the ground, forget it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  I've watched an avocado fall from a tree in Hawai'i, picked it up, immediately cut it open, and it was fully ripe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm well I've heard this in plenty of places before (can't seem to find any links though...), and unfortunately I can't grow avocados at home :( I'll strike it out. It may be that this is the standard way that they are picked commercially (similar to tomatoes) and once picked they  begin to ripen, but if left they will eventually ripen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the sloths were big enough to swallow the fruit whole and disperse the seeds (like birds with berries). If the sloths weren't so big the seeds couldn't be so large and the supplies of fat for the seedling wouldn't last as long.</p></div>		</li>
