<p>Would you say that some of the other answers that mention vasodilation, oxygen  and  adrenaline/fight or flight response approach current medical theory about the issue?  </p>
<p>I certainly feel better in the moment when I run then when I'm having a panic attack, but that's just dopamine vs epinephrine, right, and not &quot;feeling&quot; my overall health.  Does science say anything about the difference in movement/actions/response of the heart while under the influence of adrenaline vs. aerobic exercise?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the problem is just with the definition of &quot;good for you&quot; or &quot;bad for you.&quot;  If the goal is to maximize the amount of time between now and when your heart/brain stop functioning, determining what is &quot;good for you&quot; is very complicated.  If the question is how to improve the quality of your life between now and that point, answers are much easier.  Exercise and avoiding stress result in undeniable benefits that significantly improve people's quality of life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention we know things like a lot of sugar and fat (frequently found in caffeinated beverages) are bad for you. We also know that exercise does more for you than improving heart health. So exercise gas multiple positive benefits, and caffeine use and stress have multiple detrimental and perhaps one positive (unconfirmed). Seems a no brainer.</p>
<p>We have to act on the best information we have now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exercise does have a similar effect upon the heart that stress and anxiety have in that it raises HR.  However, it is not accompanied by the same cascade of stress hormones.  So, think of exercise as &quot;stressing&quot; the body physiologically without the psychological stress.  It's a fire drill!  It prepares the body to handle stress effectively.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile stress/anxiety is associated with the release of lots of stress hormones that cause unnecessary inflammation and activates other unnecessary systems.  Overtime, if your stress system (HPA Axis) gets activated by stress regularly it becomes dysregulated and does not work correctly, which has significant implications for health and well being.  There are plenty of studies showing individuals with a dysregulated HPA axis experience stress more intensely and for longer periods of time than individuals whose HPA axis is &quot;normal&quot; even when the stress is equivalent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The adrenal response isn't really the same thing as caffeine in the sense that both make you awake but they target different things. Caffeine is a drug that targets your brain and competes with materials that will make you feel fatigued. Adrenaline is a hormone that affects the entire body, including increased oxygenation, decreased digestive activity, and things like that. It's quite literally preparing your body for fight-or-flight in every way it can; you don't need to be digesting breakfast when someone is trying to kill you. It isn't really accurate to say that adrenaline is &quot;good for you&quot; because  it only lasts for seconds; you aren't going to get any cardiovascular benefit from it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's why for health stuff I've just stopped reading singular articles are refer to meta analysis of many studies instead. Cochrane has some wonderful work they've done in this department. Example include</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Patient education for coronary heart disease</strong> - &quot;We did not find strong evidence that education reduced all cause mortality, cardiac morbidity, revascularisation or hospitalisation compared to control.&quot; - <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD008895/VASC_patient-education-for-coronary-heart-disease" target="_blank">http://www.cochrane.org/CD008895/VASC_patient-education-for-coronary-heart-disease</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise-based rehabilitation for coronary heart disease</strong> -  compared with no exercise control, exercise-based CR reduces the risk of cardiovascular mortality but not total mortality - <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD001800/VASC_exercise-based-rehabilitation-coronary-heart-disease" target="_blank">http://www.cochrane.org/CD001800/VASC_exercise-based-rehabilitation-coronary-heart-disease</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exercise-based rehabilitation for heart failure</strong> - &quot;compared with no exercise control, exercise-based rehabilitation does not increase or decrease the risk of all-cause mortality in the short term (up to 12-months' follow-up) but reduces the risk of hospital admissions and confers important improvements in health-related quality of life.&quot; - <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD003331/VASC_exercise-based-rehabilitation-for-heart-failure" target="_blank">http://www.cochrane.org/CD003331/VASC_exercise-based-rehabilitation-for-heart-failure</a></p>
</li>
<li><strong>Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for patients following a heart transplantation</strong> - &quot;We found moderate quality evidence suggesting that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves exercise capacity, and that exercise has no impact on health-related quality of life in the short-term (median 12 weeks follow-up), in heart transplant recipients.&quot; - <a href="http://www.cochrane.org/CD012264/VASC_exercise-based-cardiac-rehabilitation-patients-following-heart-transplantation" target="_blank">http://www.cochrane.org/CD012264/VASC_exercise-based-cardiac-rehabilitation-patients-following-heart-transplantation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>They have a LOT of great meta analysis on alcohol and drug treatments - the results of which would likely bother some people. Things like methadone being more effective than buprenorphine in keeping opioid addicts on a maintenance program. Further another meta study that finds that adding heroin to a methadone treatment program (for people who can't stick with it) will likely succeed. Meanwhile - the unpopular part - being that pure naltrexone programs don't work any better than placebo, benzos, or even with the fabled buprenorphine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, that's why we need a software that is like a learning AI. I want to then know if some of that is because with heart failure, the humans who actually needed the exercise were more self conscious in and out of controls and did things like stretching at home that they didn't present.</p>
<p>Ugh, I just want like a program to run through most of the common explanations for most different types of stats there are and I really honk that could help the lay man understand statistics in a way that helps them understand how changing the grammar of a sentence can make you technically incorrect or correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note with the chf study is that mortality references death rates, but but does not take into account quality of life. Chf staging (1-4) is based on how much exertion you can do before getting short of breath or cardiac symptoms. That's why they made a note of hospitalizations because a lot of the treatments are meant to treat the symptoms whereas death rate have  a lot more variables.  A computer could tell you stay in bed on this machine for the rest of ur life and u will live longer, but doesn't mean it's the best treatment</p></div>		</li>

<p>I haven't been addicted to opiates myself. But when I was in prison, I saw more than a few guys get stabbed or bashed over bupe. The &quot;community consensus&quot; in there was, it's more addictive than heroin and that's why guys ask to get transferred to buprenorphine programs from methadone - because they can make money selling the bupe tablets.</p>
<p>They hide the tablet in their throat and then bring it up later. Yuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never underestimate the power of marketing. Buprenorphine/naloxone tablets - trade name is Suboxone - are marketed as an opioid treatment that forces the user to take it orally as directed. This is because naloxone has very poor bio-availability through the oral route, but if you inject it the naloxone is strong enough to more or less initiate opaite withdrawal. So physicians see a pill they can prescribe and know that it won't be used to inject. Only ~2% of orally administered naloxone will make it into your system because first-pass metabolism breaks it down before it can be absorbed.</p>
<p>Except the story doesn't end there. Buprenorphine has a much higher affinity for μ-opioid receptors. Worse buprenorphine is way more effective at knocking away what little naloxone does attach to receptors than basically every other opioid.</p>
<p>Literally this is just a pharmaceutical that's designed to give you opiates in a way that prevents you from injecting them. That's it. That's all it does. Yet for whatever reason any number of prescribers see it as this miracle drug because of the marketing which doesn't quite explain how naloxone works. Worse still there's professional education - my state's substance abuse board requires doctors, counselors, etc to get continuing education every so often - and that professional education claims that the naloxone in the pill when taken orally will mitigate how high the patient can get to appeal to the moral crusaders that don't want their patients getting high. As I described above - and you experienced - that's pure poppycock. Then again I lost count of all the half-truths and outright copy/pasting for marketing material that was in that professional education; anyone paying to attend it might as well have just sat through 8 hours of TV advertisements for drugs.</p>
<p>So why was it in your prison? Because the right pharma rep talked to the right people with the right buzzwords - and those &quot;right people&quot; didn't do any homework on their decision - leading to bad decisions. Diversion-wise they could eliminate that by using the sublingual films of suboxone that are made, but those are expensive, so they go with the cheap stuff and end up with the problem you noted. It'd be a lot cheaper to just have a medical assistant giving IV shots of heroin twice a day, but that doesn't play well PR-wise.</p></div>		</li>

My grandfather died in his early 60's of heart complications. My great grandmother seemingly died of old age in her 90's continuing her smoking habit all the way to her death bed.

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you are concieved you get a set of genetic tool blueprints. Not every tool is fully implemented or used correctly, and much of how those tools are built and deployed within the body depends on a host of internal and external variables (environmental factors and such). </p>
<p>Some people have the proper tools to deal with certain things, some of us don't, and some of us are so ill equipped to handle things that major dysfunction occurs (broad example: the smoker that gets cancer at 30 vs the smoker that gets emphysema at 65 vs the smoker that smokes until he is 108 and dies of natural causes) </p>
<p>Your body is a molecular machine comprised of trillions of individual units, that create a web of myriad variables and interactions (the various chemical pathways and tissue systems) most of these are shared between all humans (they do define us as a species) but there is room for a wide degree of variation of expression within these systems and pathways. </p>
<p>The key to health is identifying how your body responds to various stimuli and act accordingly, not to emulate what your neighbor does, because if anything, that could make things worse for you than better, since they have a different set of tools. </p>
<p>One example is alcohol. You could be twice the size as your neighbor, but only be able to drink a fraction of the amount because your body may not have the same capacity in its metabolic pathway catabolize ethanol. This is actually a problem in a large percentage of those from Eastern Asia. Some 30% of Chinese/Japanese/Korean people have a gene mutation that affects this pathway. Their body gets stuck on a step and they cannot quickly metabolize acetaldehyde. The accumulation of acetaldehyde causes inflammation and their whole body can become red and splotchy.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>You may not want to read further. This is not a story with a happy ending. </p>
<p>If he hasn't stopped smoking, make sure he understands the end with COPD is not pretty. He won't die from lack of oxygen. He will die from too much CO2. </p>
<p>If you are &quot;lucky&quot;, you will get a cold that kills you quick. </p>
<p>If you survive the trips to the hospital every time you get a cold, you get to a point when your body can't exhale the CO2 your body produces. </p>
<p>They have a machine that can help pull out CO2 from the lungs but it is like wearing a full face scuba mask and can be claustrophobic. Eventually you get to the point, you need it on 24 hours a day and have to decide when you want to give it up and die.  </p>
<p>You then start the journey to Hypercapnic Respiratory failure. It may take a day. It may take a few. My dad took 2 days. </p>
<p>The patient is morphines up and given muscle relaxers so they don't convulse as the body realizes it is suffocating and gasping for air like a fish. I'll spare all the stages of dying. </p>
<p>The nurses are beyond wonderful keeping the patient as comfortable as possible. And the morphine appears to do a great job controlling the pain, thankfully. </p>
<p>Sadly, there is nothing for the pain of loved ones who watched him die except for time. And there isn't enough of that. </p>
<p>[Source: Watch my father die from COPD complications last year.]</p>
<p>PS if anyone reading this still smokes, please stop. My father died in his early 70s where his parents lived to their mid-90s. He had grandchildren that were too young when he dies who won't have memory of him. </p>
<p>How much of valued time that your family craves are those cigarettes worth? To your family, any time is too much. </p>
<p>My dad smoked right up to the end, which was pretty much a big F.U. to the family. </p></div>		</li>
