			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I wouldn't say that... One of the other comments quotes 1 second in 10 billion years as the most precise value ever achieved with an atomic clock. The nuclear clock could supposedly beat that by at least one order of magnitude, which is a worthy result by itself (but I work in the field of precision measurements, so of course I'll say that publicly). </p>
<p>Off the top of my head I'd tell you about positioning. Clocks and their uncertainty are closely related e.g. to GPS's (and similar) performance, so a better clock will improve precision immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we're not waiting around ten billion years to care about one second. We're measuring picoseconds over a period of hours, to determine the location of space probes, for instance.</p>
<p>A ton of location-based stuff depends on precise time, because the speed of light is a convenient thing to measure against. The more precisely you can measure time, the more precisely you can determine location.</p></div>		</li>
