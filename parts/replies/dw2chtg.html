<p>As a german teenager on a school trip to england, our Bus driver died.</p>
<p>So our teacher somehow managed to have a priest saying his prayers in that Side Altar or what's it called in St. Paul's Cathedral. </p>
<p>It was really really weird!</p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Ok great guys, now my most upvoted post is about the death of a bus driver.</p>
<p>For the people who wanted a bit more infos: </p>
<p>Must've been around 2009, we went on a normal class trip to London from germany. </p>
<p>Split up the class to sleep at their host parents in the evening, went to St. James Park (wonderful place btw, loved it!) by subway. Our teacher told us in a calm moment, that our bus driver had died.</p>
<p>Bus driver had parked at a bus park, cleaning his front window from the outside. The front was facing another Bus, who's driver started the engine. Apparently he didn't have the parking brake on. And the engine was not in neutral but first gear.</p>
<p>(For all of those, who dont drive stick, lets say they front window would have had to be cleaned again).</p>
<p>Back to story: </p>
<p>Teacher told us the busdriver died, some girls started crying, most of us hardly cared as we didn't really know that guy. Walked over to St. Pauls Cathedral, got let into that side altar. Priest held a short service, pretty boring after all. End of story, sorry that it's not that interesting.</p>
<p>But I had a really good laugh at those WW2 jokes! Allthough I normally dont think it's funny to joke about it as my grandfather died in one of the lagers. Fell of the watchtower! There you got another good joke about ww2 ;)</p></div>		</li>
