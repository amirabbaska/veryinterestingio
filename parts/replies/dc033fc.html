			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean that even the photons so densely packed inside of stars, which happen to be past the edge of our visible universe, can have lots of space between them from our super far away reference point?</p>
<p>If we had some way to entangle them...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the photons inside of stars are racing outwards of the center by the pp reaction and at the h alpha emission point, as well as they do not follow the pauli exclusion principle.. So they are not packed, the atoms are, and they dont have to be close or far away from each other because they move as fast as possible and help create more chaos by crashing. Also the superposition state is not inherent of the distance at all. But besides those things, they all travel at the same speed and you can argue that they are all just in a superposition with each other , albeit thats a stretch to say, but has been said. All in all, modular forms have been directly linked in many mathematical papers to elliptical curves, which ARE cyclical, but not the same as circular.. But it being related to primes might have a connection source to what op is arguing, i myself have never thought of this case in those words, but i have thought about it as i just stated. Very intuitive that statement was so i was outstanded, but photons racing out of stars could NOT be further away the faster you went because locality is preserved through special relativity (by light going the same speed no matter which light you are). </p>

<p>Edit: oh wait, i see what youre saying, I misunderstood. Yea, if they were packed once and spread out, the time would be that missing space. So in microtime or something, that angle would be the same as it was super spread out. Once its past our visible universe though... Who knows i guess. Maybe the edge of the visible universe is the beginning?? The microwave background might be related, and time for sure, but the vectors would be the same. As for the superposition thing, again, the vectors dont matter. Thats just me though. Especially since space expands faster than light out there in the brinks !</p>
<p>Edit 2: i seem to have misunderstood again. The visible edge cant be superpositioned IMO because thats the limit. Thats where the ionazation of the universe happened. I would love to talk more about how topology comes into play here but im going to sleep</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't quite work because the orbiting objects would no longer be spherical.  For example, if you had a planet orbiting a star in a circular orbit, in another reference frame you see an ellipsoid planet orbiting an ellipsoid star in an elliptic orbit.  This is not comparable to a spherical planet spherically orbiting a spherical star.  The shape of the gravitational field of a spherical star is different from that of an ellipsoid star.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would there not be a difference because of the way that (assuming objects of very different sizes), the object being orbited is not at the centre of the ellipse? </p>
<p>If you have an ellipse with a major axis 25% longer than the minor axis, you can turn it into a circle by evenly contracting it by 25% along that axis, but reducing the distance between the focii by 25% won't give you a distance of 0.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think so. The gravitational waves are emitted due to the acceleration of the orbiting body, regardless of where the Sun is.</p></div>		</li>
