			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, I really enjoy math and feel I'm pretty good at it. I took through calculus 3, differential equations, and linear algebra. I enjoyed them and got A's in them. When I saw this question I had no idea how to explain it though. I thought, &quot;it just is.&quot; Pretty awesome explanation. </p></div>		</li>
