			<div class="markdown"><p>What if this happens to me all the time? I'm terrible at just about all timed trivia games because it takes me forever to process the actual answer. It makes me feel really dumb and slow. </p>
<p>I'm curious if others have this same problem and if it's called something. I feel like I've underperformed my whole life because I can't think quickly even if I actually know the answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people have this problem regularly.  I sure do.  The problem itself is called tip of the tongue syndrome or presque vu.  There are a bunch of ways to handle it, but the thing that works best for me is &quot;pairing&quot; a word with something else.  For example, I can never remember the word &quot;mom&quot; when I need to.  So I paired it with the letter m and the number 18.  Now all I have to do is think M18 and I can remember the word I need.  This only works for words or phrases that you use regularly and can never remember, though.  It's good for people's names or words like &quot;spoon,&quot; that, while simple, don't really have conversational synonyms.</p>
<p>EDIT:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_effect" target="_blank">Here's</a> is a theory that I subscribe to explaining why this happens with things that you know well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you just have a lot of self doubt and criticism? I know I do, especially with math. I'll sometimes have huge problems with basic things such as 7*4 because I redo them several times in my head and doubt myself each time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to how you'll get up to go get something from another room and forget what it was. Most of the time, if you go back and sit down, or even just go back to the same room, you'll remember what it was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An alternative explanation for that phenomenon is that it's some evolutionary adaption to walking through doors. Everytime we pass a 'threshold' our memories refresh or something and that's why we forget what we're doing. It was a form of adaption to new environments.
Ironically I dont remember the theory properly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, this might be the same explanation i read. It sounds really familiar. Unfortunately, I can't remember any more about it either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can build your own retrieval cues also. The more they relate to data, the better, though.</p>
<p>I had a combination lock which I used at the gym multiple times a week. The combination was 1-27-11. When I was first memorizing it, I just focused on the fact that the last two rhymed. When I switched gyms, I used lockers with built-in locks for a while and my lock fell into disuse. When I wanted to use the lock months later, I couldn't remember the combination, only something about rhyming. I had to spend a few days thinking about it before I figured it out again, but it made me think to improve the quality of the cues I create for myself.</p></div>		</li>
