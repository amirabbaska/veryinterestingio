			<div class="markdown"><p>There are many different levels of vacuum, characterized by the residual gas pressure inside the vacuum vessel, which can vary over many orders of magnitude depending on the application. I wasn’t using the technical terminology, I was just confirming what OP asked about the experiments being under vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a practical sense. High vacuum can be achieved with a roughing pump and then a turbo pump. High vacuum is useful for only certain things. To get to UHV, or ultra high vacuum you need to use diffusion pumps or cryo pumps. At ultra high vacuum the molcules in the gas do not interact, meaning the vacuum is more about capturing molecules than it is sucking them out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there is no way to achieve an ideal vacuum (i.e. an region of space with zero pressure and density), so there are different grades of vacuum (where higher grades denote lower pressure and density) based on the Mean Free Path of a particle in the vacuum, the ambient pressure or the technical requirements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this mean that in theory, there's no way to guarantee a device storing anti-matter couldn't explode?  There's no way to achieve ideal vacuum, so it's always possible a single atom of hydrogen or something would collide with your antimatter?</p></div>		</li>
