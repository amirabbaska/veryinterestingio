			<div class="markdown"><p>We do free range them most afternoons.  It also measurably changes the quality of the eggs.  The yolks are orange, not yellow, when they have the opportunity to forage.  They also help a lot with bug and tick control over the summer, and they tend to help break up the patties and turn bedding in my paddocks for the sheep, which they are near.</p>
<p>However, I don't have the free acreage to let them free range full time, even in summer.  If they're let out in the morning, they'll cover up to 3-5 acres foraging.  That's great except for porous fences and a neighbor who doesn't want to be bothered with fencing their own property, and the rest of my space needs to feed the sheep, not the chickens.  The later we let them out, the less distance they cover, so we tend not to let them out until mid-afternoon, which limits their range and cuts down on them finding holes in the fence.  They have a large, well-ventilated, deep bedded coop we designed to hold up to 40 birds at a time if need be, so with free choice food and plenty of water they tend to stay pretty happy before being let out.  As a bonus, I much prefer collecting eggs from the nest boxes, as opposed to half an acre worth of back yard, since they do most of their laying in the morning.</p>
<p>You also can't really turn them loose in the winter once the vegetation has been dead a bit.  We made that mistake one year.  They will absolutely, positively destroy any living thing within 100' of the coop if they are out when it's not growing season.  We tend to give them kelp periodically in the winter to help keep the yolk quality up instead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Didn't know this one. I thought they go back to their nest to lay eggs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Free Range&quot; just means they have room to move around. Doesn't mean you don't have to feed or water them properly. Unless you mean a flock that's left on a whole piece of land or forest to forage. In that case you'd have loss due to predation, no idea how to find the eggs, and loss of the use of whatever land they are on. Real estate is prime no matter where you are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chickens are generally coop trained.  They will naturally come back to their coop in the evenings as the sun goes down even if they free range, and will habitually lay their eggs in the nest boxes in the coop.  </p>
<p>Most losses to predators (though not all) occur at night.  This can be fixed by ensuring the coop is secure and closing the door at night.  Some people even install automated doors on light sensors that open and close with the sun rise and set.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think he means put them to pasture. Though, that many will eat up what ever yard you put them in. I had a dozen hens a few years back, good sized yard. They would eat the entire yard by summer's end, every year, scratching. After I got rid of my last hen, it took almost two summers to bring it back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do more frequently get the oddball huge egg from the older birds.  However, it's also important to say along with that that the size of the shell is not related to the amount of contents.  You'll get a medium size egg that's absolutely full with a huge yolk just as often as a huge shell that's less full with a smaller yolk.</p>
<p>That's actually why they're graded when you buy them from the store - the grade is related only to how full the egg shell is, nothing else.</p>
<p>Having kept roosters, we've found it's not worth the trouble and prefer buying mail order chicks.  A rooster eats as much as several hens, and you get tired of watching your shins after a while.  It doesn't make sense to keep one around for us when we only need about half a dozen birds a year to keep our numbers up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the grocery store, the eggs seem to be smaller than they were 30 years ago. I buy &quot;extra-large&quot; but remain convinced that they would have been &quot;medium&quot; when I was young.</p>
<p>When I go the farmer's market, the sizes are more like when I was a young, they even have XXL ones (they are full, but I suppose they have graded them already).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Same size. You will get some wonky ones at first, but then they are almost the same until the hen dies or stops laying (whichever comes first).</p></div>		</li>
