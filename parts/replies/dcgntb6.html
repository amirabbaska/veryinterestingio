			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh I'm going to get my radiation dosimetry book later and calculate because all the speculation I see is driving me nuts. I want numbers.</p>
<p>I did some time at a big 10 university's cyclotron back in the dayâ€”it was built in the 70s and while I can't remember the precise energy, it was enough to get you a few feet into a water phantom. I'd imagine something as powerful as the LHC might get things up to that non-interacting regime where it could make it to space.</p></div>		</li>
