			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understood bubbles forming at the base of the straw is the limiting factor in how wide the straw is in a normal straw with parallel edges, but what happens with a tapered straw. Even simply a tapered base. At what point, if there is one, is the weight of the water too great for the upward force of air to keep the water suspended.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's basically no difference in the analysis, just that the radius is for how wide the straw is on the bottom. The dx is infinitesimally small, so the bubble raising this much is not enough for the radius of the straw to change by a significant amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it should, yeah. I haven't tried it myself. There are lots of YouTube hits for &quot;boil room temperature&quot;, where they usually do it by using a pump to get a good vacuum, rather than a long hose.</p>
<p>I'd try to find a tall stairwell, submerge a 30+ foot tube in a bucket of water at the bottom, put my thumb over one end with only a little bit of the tube sticking out of the water (so maybe an inch of air), then walk up the stairs with a partner at the bottom keeping the other side submerged. As you walk up the staircase, the length of the bit of air at the top of the tube should get longer and longer. If you start with 1 inch of air, it should boil when it gets to around 1.5 feet. You'd need to be at a bit more than 30 feet vertically between the bucket and top of the tube.</p>
<p>Now I want to try it out, too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We did exactly this as an experiment of measuring air pressure with high-school kids who were visiting our faculty. Basically the Toricelli experiment times 10. It does actually happen, but one thing you have to consider is that degassing of whatever gases are disolved in the water will also happen as you climb up, so the actual boiling might not start after (ideally) 10.3 m. Boiling the water on stove prior to the experiment might help a bit with lowering the amount of gases present.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am thinking about using a rope and pulley to haul it up. A valve on both ends could be used to fill the hose and seal it for experimentation and predictions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can make waster boil by covering the end of a full syringe and pulling it out to reduce the pressure. The only difference with this method is that the vacuum is supplied by your own force instead of using the weight of the water.</p></div>		</li>
