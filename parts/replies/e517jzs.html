			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Some space projects, like an Earth-based space elevator, are infeasible with modern materials. However, a rotating orbital station is not among them.</p>
<p>(Interesting aside: a moon-based or Mars-based space elevator is actually feasible with modern materials.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The material with which you build the elevator is the main problem. We don't know of any material with the required tensile strength. The cable of the elevator would snap under its own weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. It's always been a question of resources, and we've not run dry on experiments to perform in space (or low-gravity orbit). Since we're not really that concerned about the long term comfort, we don't want to invest a lot into such things that don't serve to add significant scientific opportunities to study. Astronauts know very well the risks of what they are getting themselves into.</p>
<p>Now once we start crossing the threshold of non-specialists in space (consumer flights) then artificial gravity becomes a much more significantly important investment but it's cost to gain ratio isn't high enough to make it worth it for the scientific experiment minded nature of current aerospace ventures.</p>
<p>With any luck we could even conceivably have developed better concepts for gravity simulation by the time it becomes practical to build one, and possibly even make it cheaper to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As in, better concepts than, &quot;Let's just spin the whole thing. That seems to work.&quot; Admittedly, we put more thought into it than that, but if we have some breakthrough that let's us produce gravity at a lower cost, or without the spin, we may be using that instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of an old episode of Star Trek TNG. At least I think it's from that series. </p>
<p>They pick up some passengers who froze themselves a long, long time ago, awaiting for the tech to advance far enough where their life threatening diseases would be cured. Well they get cured, and then a banker asked how much interest his money incurred, because he could very well be the richest person in the universe. The reply is that they got rid of money, it no longer has a use anymore, as funding was a roadblock in the advancement for the cure that he just recieved. </p>
<p>edit - It's on Netflix (<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708811/" target="_blank">TNG Season 1 Episode 25 - The Neutral Zone</a>)</p></div>		</li>
