			<div class="markdown"><p>Minor point: the phrase was just &quot;per se [letter]&quot;, not &quot;and per se [letter]&quot;; the first &quot;and&quot; in the phrase which later became &quot;ampersand&quot; is because the character in question was the last one in the list, not because it was part of the stock phrase.  Thus the letter i was &quot;<em>per se</em> I&quot;, not &quot;<strong>and</strong> <em>per se</em> I&quot;, and when referring to the epershand (why am I using the Scots name?  I have no idea.  I'm not Scottish) it would just have been &quot;<em>per se</em> and&quot; outside the context of reciting the alphabet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oops, good catch. I was thinking about the &quot;and <em>per se</em> and&quot; bit when typing that and accidentally included an extra &quot;and&quot;. Edited it to be correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words, the letters in the list would be X, Y, Z, <strong>and</strong> <strong><em>per se</em></strong> <strong>and</strong>, the last of which became <em>ampersand</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  I'm not disputing the etymology, I'm disputing the bit <em>earlier</em> that said that people would refer to letters with &quot;and <em>per se</em> [letter]&quot;.  The alphabet-reciting including &quot;and&quot; because it's the last of the list is <em>exactly</em> the etymology for &quot;ampersand&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
