<p>Sometimes getting an answer for a question can actually be challenging, because your own train of thought or logic might be broken so easily.</p>
<p>About these pro-coagulant mediators. How do they feel/see the damage? English isnt my first language, so there might be some confusion with pro-lingo/jargon. Are they some sort of cells that are created and dispatched or are they part of each cell throughout the body already?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries, it's neat stuff! </p>
<p>So in general, I'm talking about platelets and coagulation factors, when I speak of pro-coagulant mediators. The coagulation factors make up a pathway, called the 'coagulation cascade' where, upon 'seeing' damage, they activate each other sequentially, and result in the formation of a fibrin clot. What the coagulation factors are 'seeing' is the exposure of injured tissue; imagine the inside of a blood vessel as having a smooth coating, with a rougher surface below that. The smooth, inner coating doesn't express the signals that coagulation factors need to become activated, but the rougher coating below that does; if there's injury to a blood  vessel, the coagulation factors 'see' it, become activated, and form a fibrin clot. The platelets have a similar process happen; when there is damage to a blood vessel, the platelet 'sees' the presence of certain markers, causing it to become activated and begin forming a blood clot, with other platelets. </p>
<p>All of these things are circulating around the body all the time - the liver produces some, the blood vessels themselves produce others, and the platelets are produced by the bone marrow.</p></div>		</li>

The hematologist came along and ordered 5 units of cryoprecipitate which contained the used up components. By the time I left she was holding her new baby. I was hooked on ICU nursing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be curious to hear more about how this process can get so out of control, and how to treat it. I've heard of DIC before in the context of the body reacting to the presence of certain toxins. For example, I believe it's one of the possible systemic reactions that can result from rattlesnake envenomations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically blood vessels are supposed to be smooth on the inside and when they are hurt or bleeding the inside gets kinda rough.  The parts of your blood that form clots (scabs) to stop the bleeding keep going if everything is smooth but get stuck and pile up to form a clot if they hit the rough part.</p>
<p>This is good because you don't have to tell your body &quot;my hand is bleeding, can you fix that?&quot;, it just happens.  The bad news here is that in very large injuries it tries to plug all the holes or rough patches at once with a limited supply of clotting goop.  If this happens it is a very bad thing and you can't stop bleeding because the goop tank is empty and we have to refill it with a blood transfusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best way I can simplify it, at least as I understand: Wherever there's clotting factors (platelets, etc.) there is healing. Regardless of where the bleeding is in the body. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medical student on the last day of my month-long rotation through the trauma surgery service here, hope it's alright if I chime in (please correct me if I say anything incorrect!). The clotting cascade is a rather quick process in the setting of trauma. Sometimes it may not be sufficient to stop a bleed (like a bad splenic laceration, or a nicked systemic artery). In the acute setting of hemorrhagic shock (after bleeding goes on without stopping), then the body will attempt to preserve its #1 organ, the brain, along with its #2 organs, the heart &amp; lungs, by constricting blood vessels throughout the arms &amp; legs to shunt the blood back toward the middle and into the head.</p>
<p>Also, fractures sometimes require re-alignment with surgery, and then take roughly 4-6 weeks to heal. In the setting of multiple fractures, it should still take around the same amount of time, as the cells of the bones lay down new bony matrix in a &quot;decentralized&quot; fashion (without any one bone healing first). Most of these processes are rather decentralized, happening at the same time wherever they are needed (after being initiated by local signals, like &quot;tissue factor&quot; in the case of the clotting cascade).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your great write up!  I was a medic to a team in Afghanistan, and we were constantly looking for better ways to treat hypovolemic shock and keep clots forming/holding.  The issue was logistics really, we had spotty power and our foot patrols made it infeasible to carry anything more exciting than fresh frozen plasma, and colloids.  Fresh Whole Blood is the Holy Grail for traumatic exsanguination right?  If my understanding there is correct, have you any ideas on any other therapies existing or theorized which could give austere practicioners a better chance at keeping our casualties alive?  Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a quick question - I thought the military prioritized using a walking blood bank with preselected donors?  I remember reading an article on this but it may have been in referenced to the Navy and ships so it may not be applicable to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can’t speak for the other users experience in the ‘Stan, but in 2008 in Iraq we carried Hextend which is a blood plasma volume expander...not ideal of course but the plan of action in a firefight for an arterial bleed comes down to slapping on a tourniquet and pushing fluids to extend time for the bird to arrive/extract to an actual trauma center.</p>
<p>Things are obviously different in an actual medical setting, but you gotta be quick and dirty in a fight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only speaking on behalf of the US military here... walking blood banks with preselected/prescreened donors is a relatively new push for medics. Throughout the Iraq/Afg wars medics were pushing crystalloids and colloids like it was cool. Studies done over those war periods are why there is so much emphasis on blood today. No medics carry fresh frozen plasma because of the logistical issues that accompany such an idea. ie Must be kept frozen - not going in a med bag, used within 24 hours after thawing - I think. Freeze Dried Plasma (FDP) is still not FDA approved, so most medics aren't carrying it aside from a few special operations units that are operating under an experimental drug protocol using French FDP</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, you're right  - whole blood is the gold standard, so to speak, since its got everything - red cells, platelets, and plasma, in the proper ratio. Other than stopping the bleeding though, which I believe the military has some pretty effective techniques/dressings for, I don't really know of anything else.</p></div>		</li>
