			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a true/false statement. You can, technically, &quot;say&quot; anything - however, if saying that thing breaks any number of other laws/acts, such as inciting violence, or smearing someone else's name, there are protections in place for civilians to take care of it if the courts don't.</p>
<p>Example: My right to free speech does not provide me the right to yell &quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotta stop ya there - the <em>Schenck</em> case where the &quot;fire in a theater&quot; idiom comes from was partially overturned with <em>Brandenburg</em> in 1969. The justice who wrote that opinion, a guy the name of Holmes, later changed his beliefs on the matter. And on top of that, a justice's explanation of his ruling isn't binding law. And on top of all that, the actual decision was about a guy being convicted under the Espionage act for distributing tame (by any standards) pamphlets telling people to assert their rights - it was a complete fuckfest for free speech, which is why it later got overturned.</p>
<p>Speech, as a whole, needs to be left the fuck alone, rather than edging further towards the line taken in Europe where tweeting the wrong thing winds up with a knock on your door.</p>
<p>That's one of the things that makes the USA great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great is subjective. I can agree that &quot;Your opinion need not be threatened,&quot; But having an opinion and performing an act are two completely different things.</p>
<p>There is a line that needs to be drawn, most people just don't understand how to draw it.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> However, thanks for the history lesson. I didn't know there was follow up to that</p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to think that also.  Until I learned of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_v._Ohio" target="_blank">Brandenburg v Ohio</a> where SCOTUS held that you cannot punish inflammatory speech unless that speech is &quot;directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action&quot;.</p>
<p>Shouting fire in a crowded theater does not cross that threshold.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Snopes and FactCheck.org are already things that exist, though, and there are <em>already</em> a lot of news sources which you should know are not generally considered reputable. The problem is that the disreputable sources were tired of not being able to credibly lie to people, so they got together and started convincing people not to trust the independent organizations either.</p></div>		</li>
