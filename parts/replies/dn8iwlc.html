			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah, thinking about being in deep space where it's so dark you can't see your hand in front of your face, but you'd still be able to see distant galaxies and stars is terrifying and stupifying. It would be like the ultimate out of body experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anywhere a good distance away from cities or large towns, late on a clear, moonless night. That's what it would be like in deep space, away from a nearby star. And, having been there, you certainly can see things around you. Your eyes are amazing at pulling in and using low levels of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Buy a cheap, dull watt night light... Or just have some device with a tiny &quot;power&quot; light on it (pretty much any electronic device will work, most TV's usually will have a little red glowing light in the corner when they're off these days). </p>
<p>Then turn out all the lights in your house. No light whatsoever. Make sure the sun is down and/or you also have blackout curtains (if you live in a city with lots of artificial light).</p>
<p>Then, while you're in the pitch darkness, wave your hand in front of the little red light (or whatever you chose).</p></div>		</li>
