			<div class="markdown"><p>I read around a little last time this was asked and while I think this is definitely part of it, someone also mentioned that a lot of the sound (at least the mid and lower frequencies) comes from the air escaping the balloon and leaving behind a rarefaction. The atmosphere then rebounds and rushes to fill the void, similar to the &quot;bouncing&quot; effect seen in <a href="https://youtu.be/M5gHFJyMQ6o?t=46s" target="_blank">this</a> video, and that oscillation also creates a sound. That's why larger balloons make lower pitched pops.</p>
<p>This is way out of my field though, so I could be wrong. I'm just regurgitating what someone else said last time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A latex party balloon only takes 0.15 psi (~1 kPa) to inflate over atmosphere...</p>
<p>The video is underwater, already much higher pressures involved. It's an apples to oranges comparison. Much different materials or scales would result in a different source for the majority of the sound energy.</p>
<p>In a balloon the energy released by the pop can be shown to be a factor of the internal pressure, but the crack propagation in the skin of the ballon changes too. </p>
<p>Higher pressures put the material into a higher stress state, when the skin ruptures that tear is releasing that energy.</p>
<p>An average party balloon (Volume ≈ 14 L) at our 1 kPa is about 15 Joules of stored energy due to the compressed air.</p>
<p>An estimate for the fracture energy in the latex ≈ 190 kJ/m^2</p>
<p>A ballon skin is about 1.1 mm thick for a quality party balloon.</p>
<p>So for an equivalent release of energy, a crack 71.77mm would be all that formed.</p>
<p>Instead you can see that multiple tears with a much greater energy release occurs due to the rapid crack propagation once the initial failure occurs. It's discussed in that paper I linked above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>then why does a champagne bottle also make a pop when it pushes the cork out, since nothing is being ripped? I think balloons are like those bottles, but when they rip, they just very quickly slide off the ball of pressurized air which suddenly rushes out in all directions, creating a shock wave similar to the ones created by the freed gas behind the champagne cork.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're actually closer on the mark with the Champagne bottle but you're hearing it through the neck of the bottle which is focusing the sound.</p>
<p>Why does my finger pop when I pull it out of the same opening when there is no pressure behind it? </p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the most well-known examples is certainly the
characteristic ‘pop’ sound when opening a champagne bottle:
the pressure inside the bottle, initially larger than
the atmospheric pressure, drops down when the cork is
released. Excited by the sudden change in pressure, the
free volume close to the bottleneck resonates.</p>

<p>Also since we're well on the &quot;pop&quot; topic, Popcorn makes its sound because of the rapid release of water vapor after the kernel has burst.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Popcorn is the same as the balloon. In fact it's identical as it's a skin that releases the steam in all directions.</p>
<p>The bottle pop from your finger is the opposite of the cork. Pulling it out creates a partial vacuum in the bottle, and the outside air suddenly rushes in, so it's an implosion rather than an explosion.</p></div>		</li>
