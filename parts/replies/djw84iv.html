			<div class="markdown"><p>yea there's always spikes like that.  predictable spikes.  US has the same thing with superbowl.  </p>
<p>residential profiles are typically daily spike in morning before 9am as everyone gets ready,  spike in afternoon as air conditioner kicks in.   </p>
<p>business profile is more like big spike during the working day hours.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are 8000W showers a thing in the UK? I've used those weird electric shower water heater things there before (which don't seem common in other countries, probably because they suck), just never realised their power consumption was that insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heating water takes a lot of energy - &quot;normal&quot; boilers (or kettles) do it by heating the water over a longer time, but if you want to heat your shower water during something like a second while it's flowing through an on-demand heater then you need a lot of power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep this would be one of the close answers.
People thing that the plant is directly exporting 120v or 220v but its not. The transformers on the poles close to your house is so its like adding a little pipe onto the river that flows.</p>
<p>Plus in our case here where its hydro generated power. The turbines are set to spin at 60hz.
They do store the power to sell it to the US :).</p></div>		</li>
