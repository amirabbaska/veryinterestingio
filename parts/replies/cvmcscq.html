<p>You are quite correct about the regolith.  It is very jagged and pointy and not round like sand at all.  One of the side-effects of this is that the regolith had a bad habit of sticking to the space suits they wore on the moon, the couldn't help but tracking the material back in to the spacecraft where they got a chance to smell it.  They all consistently <a href="http://www.space.com/26932-moon-smell-apollo-lunar-aroma.html" target="_blank">described it as smelling of &quot;spent gunpowder.</a>&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to find out more the technical term for the 'soil-like' material above bedrock is regolith, and goes about 5km to 15km deep depending on the area. Since the moon doesn't have tectonic plate movements, or winds/water to move particles around it would have been a very smooth rocky sphere early in its life, and all of the dust resulting from impacts will have been spread roughly evenly over the surface. That's what makes the regolith layer so thick and uniform. Bedrock will be closest to the surface, or protruding, in the deeper of the more recent craters. Elsewhere large rock formations may be found by the surface, but are most likely just giant boulders.</p></div>		</li>
