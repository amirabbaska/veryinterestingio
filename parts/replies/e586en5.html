			<div class="markdown"><p>In market economies, the paper shufflers (banking and finance) allocate most of the wealth and capital. </p>
<p>The idea is that they will do so more efficiently than governments because their profits depend on getting a return on their investments. Hence they are more incentivized to perform due diligence, and will pull their investments in companies that underperform rather than continuing to waste money.</p>
<p>Where the idea clashes with the real world is that salaries and bonuses for executives and CEOs have become skewed towards short term performance, leading to reckless investments for short term profit chasing behavior at the expense of longer term investments for sustainable growth.</p>
<p>It’s turns companies into a game of hot potato, with executives trying to pump the share price then cash out before it blows up.</p>
<p>When everyone starts doing this you end up with a systematic hollowing out of the economy’s foundations, and the whole thing eventually comes crashing down like a house of cards as we saw with the Global Financial Crisis in 2008.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As index funds that track the overall market consistently out-perform the vast majority of institutional investors, doesn't this mean that they actually do a poor job of &quot;getting a good return on their investments&quot;?  And therefore should be paid less? </p>
<p>I mean obviously someone is paid whatever someone is willing to pay them. But given they are out performed by random number generators as well, there isn't a lot of skill in show here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Index funds tend to bubble due to the sheer amount of capital that seeks exposure to them. Look at variance between top 500 companies and top 2000 companies.</p>
<p>Anyway lets say a public company makes 10% bottom line revenue in an earnings period and beats analyst predictions - that 15% ROI on an index fund sounds better, right? Except that earnings period attracts investors and those investors pump stock equity by 10%. Now the company is more profitable than that index fund. There are also other considerations like not paying tax on that equity gain since the stock never traded hands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of hedge funds do not out perform index funds, this is true. This might be a problem if you’re a meritocracy. But try getting an entry level trading job at Lehman Brothers without attending a top tier school and without having social connections. The system is designed not to reward anyone but the capitalist class and to keep the proles from ascending to the capitalist class. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is the correct ELI5, imo. If you control the capital you have the most value in a capitalistic society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s kind of the point of capitalism. It’s far Better and not efficient than to have elected government officials with their own motives control someone else’s capital, or just spread it out among everyone and hope things are equal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting take on the financial crisis that Chomsky had (I'm paraphrasing here) is that the financial crisis of 2008 wasn't the result of irrational thinking from the guys at the top, as some suggest (i.e. it's a bubble and everyone severely overestimated its value).  In his mind, the largest banks knew that if their investments ever totally collapse that they're aware that the government will be forced to cover their losses or risk a total economic meltdown.  As a result, they have greater incentive to take extremely risky bets, because they have uncle sam unwittingly providing collateral.  And since the markets force everyone to compete w/ one another, if you're one of the big guys you can't afford to play it safe if everyone else is taking the big risks.  </p>
<p>So you get into this negative feedback cycle where everyone has to be one upping their competitors, taking on riskier and riskier bets in order to edge out the competition in the short term, knowing that as long as everyone fails all at once (i.e. they're not the only one who way over gambled) then their inevitable losses will be covered at the taxpayer's expense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Part of it is because this stuff can be complex and difficult. Accountancy rules, tax codes, laws, regulations are many and complicated, so it takes a lot of education and experience to be really good at dealing with them.</p>

<p>So why aren't scientists the most highly paid professions?</p>
<p>University professors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because almost every single major company needs lawyers, bankers, and accountants. The demand for scientists isn’t as large. There is a low supply of top tier lawyers, bankers, and accountants because of the education and experience required. As long as the demand for those professionals doesn’t change, they will always make big money.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am sure the top scientists at pharma companies are paid quite well.</p>
<p>Engineering applies scientific principles and also generally pays at least a middle class living.</p></div>		</li>
