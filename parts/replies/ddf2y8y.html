<p>Careful. This is only true for two points in space that are sufficiently separated such that a light beam could never travel between them. The two points may have been causally connected in the past (i.e., a light beam could travel between them), but are not today.</p>

<p>This can be observed through observing galaxies redshifting faster than light can travel[1].</p>

<p>This is the strange nature of our universe. What we see isn't really what's there. Well, at least once you get far enough away. Light has a finite and fixed speed (in vacuum, at least). This means that when a photon was emitted by a star, say a billion years ago, and we see that photon today, the star has moved since the photon was emitted. Hence, we see an &quot;echo&quot; of what the universe looked like in the past. This is why the farther away you look, the further back in time you see. Cosmology is a time machine!</p></div>		</li>

<p>agreed</p>

<p>Correct, space is four dimensional. This comes up sometimes when people ask if you can find the &quot;center&quot; of the universe, but you can't in three dimensional space because it was a four dimensional event. You also cannot go visit what you can see in the night sky.</p></div>		</li>
