			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good, accessible explanation, and is <em>true enough</em>. </p>
<p>In fact, however, gravitational waves do have interactions with matter (or, with static gravitational fields in the presence of matter) which produce self energy corrections analogous to the paramagnetic and diamagnetic effects of electromagnetic waves traveling through matter (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.0408" target="_blank">paper</a>) But as you correctly intuited, the relative magnitude of these effects are negligible compared to those effects for electromagnetic waves, at least on the scales of naturally-occurring materials. It's possible that the effect may be measurable for dense molecular gas clouds on the order of millions of light-years in size, but current experiments (e.g., LIGO) do not actively investigate this. (It's possible that very large BECs or BSC superfluids could also exhibit measurable changes to the speed of gravitational wave propagation, but are quite outside humanity's near-term technological grasp.)</p>
<p>A quick and dirty estimate for this effect in molecular clouds, calculating deviations in the gravitational wave refractive index (n) from 1, implying slower-than-c speeds through a medium:</p>
<p>For small values of (n−1), which are the only physically-relevant cases, n−1=(2πGρ)/(ω^2) ^[<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.9.2207" target="_blank">paper</a> ], where ρ is on the order 10^8 - 10^12, ω is on the order of the speed of light squared, and G is on the order of 10^(-11), giving:</p>
<p>n ~ ( 1 + 10^(-22) )</p>
<p>Which makes sense in an intuitive sense when you think of gravitational radiation as only produced for changing quadrupole moments, which is a second-order effect compared to effects from electromagnetic radiation (changes in dipole moment)....</p></div>		</li>

<p>This means that there's not really anything (that we know of, at any rate) which can really affect the propagation of the gravitational wave. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to add:  this is why LIGO opens up a whole new category of astronomy on universe-type scale. Conventional astronomy (optical,  radio,  microwave, xray and gamma ray telescopes/detectors)  rely on electromagnetic waves, WHICH CAN BE BLOCKED.</p>
<p>Gravitational waves cannot be blocked as far as we know. So they will reveal energetic phenonemon from the far corners of the universe that we currently cannot observe with conventional detectors/telescopes.</p>
<p>The only other astronomy that comes close is neutrino detectors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your explanation, but:</p>
<p>I would be willing to bet the effect is large in the interior of a super nova explosion. Where the density can be so great, even neutrino absorption is responsible for something like 25% of the energy driving an outward shock wave. Super novas are one source of gravity waves. So I would expect those same regions to slow the gravity waves from the core collapse.</p></div>		</li>
