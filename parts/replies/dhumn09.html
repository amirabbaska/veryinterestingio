By the time the radiation is strong enough to impair muscular strength, your vital organs are sterile enough to use as surgical gloves.</p></div>		</li>

Said man had been working for longer than any other to get the job done.<br />
The man collapsed from thermal, not radioactive, heat exhaustion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All those suits you see people wearing in nuclear plants do nothing against radiation itself, it helps to prevent contaminating yourself with radioactive materials.
There is basically nothing we can wear to reduce significantly the radiation dose. Even those lead vest wont protect shit in such situations.
Three basic rules working in radioactive enviroments.</p>
<ul>
<li>time: more time more dose.</li>
<li>distance: more distance less dose.</li>
<li>shielding: tricky... you need 2 meters of concrete to completely stop gamma radiation, but only a sheet of paper to stop alpha radiation. The thing is. If a whole room is very radioactive, Its going to be gamma. And if its going to be gamma theres no way a 10 cm lead vest is going to help you that much. Time will be the key in that situation. In and out in 1 min will get you way less dose than in and out in 2 min with a lead vest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also to answer your question. You dont feel anything at all around &quot;low&quot; doses. When you can actually feel the radiation (starting on puke and nausea) you recieved around 2 sieverts (beeing 8 Sieverts a lethal dose). If your legs dont work you surpassed by far the lethal dose. (Muscles are resistant, internal organs are not. If your muscles give up, your liver and everything in your chest gave up long ago)</p>
<p>PM me for more information about how radiation works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the way that the &quot;bio-robots&quot; (i.e. conscripted clean-up workers) got the job of clearing the contaminated graphite from the roof of Chernobyl. A home-made lead suit, plus a maximum of about a minute on the roof, shovelling extraordinarily radioactive mess off the roof.<br />
They were called &quot;bio robots&quot; because the actual robots made for the job didn't work: the radiation was so ionising that the silicon chips inside them became conductive rather than semiconductive...</p></div>		</li>

<p>The death toll is mostly from first responders who did not realize they were responding to a nuclear incident and thought it was a regular fire.</p></div>		</li>
