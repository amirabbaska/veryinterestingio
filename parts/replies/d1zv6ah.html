			<div class="markdown"><p>The planets and our star in our solar system formed from the same accretion disk, yes. The same gas.</p>
<p>Maybe they are. We'd have to compare our planets to star systems that are &quot;normal&quot;<del>, but so far we have only detected exoplanets relatively close to us, hence, likely to be similar composition.</del> edit: It's unlikely that the stars close to us now were near us when they were formed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly, Earth is as geologically active as it is and has such a powerful magnetic field because of the unusually high amounts of radioactives in the core.</p>
<p>Earth's core is one giant RTG.</p>
<p>Means technological civilizations may be very rare, as it takes a very dynamic biosphere to get such proliferation of life, lots of metals shallow in the crust to form a strong industrial base, and no nearby killer blackholes pumping radiation out.</p>
<p>Edit: source. <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/jul/19/radioactive-decay-accounts-for-half-of-earths-heat" target="_blank">http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/jul/19/radioactive-decay-accounts-for-half-of-earths-heat</a></p>
<p>Half of the heat is gravity, the other half is radioactive decay. </p>
<p>Edit edit: also forgot a baseline ionizing radiation level that makes mutation happen more frequently. All that Radon in the air comes from natural decay.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This question may be vague or otherwise odd, but, I always think of the accretion disk as being made up of small rocks but mostly dust. Is this correct, or are there large chunks of matter/rocks/etc alongside the dust?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, star-forming nebulae are generally thought to have angular momentum (they rotate). When the first really bright stars start shining, their light pressure sweeps away some of the gas. As the mass of the nebula decreases, its gravity can become too weak to hold the group together, and the group scatters. People may someday find a star that was part of the sun's formation group, but it probably won't be close by.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In astronomy, &quot;metals&quot; refer to anything that isn't hydrogren or helium.  So the inner planets are composed almost entirely of metal, and the gas giants have some metals in them as well, albeit ~1% or &lt;1%.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;metalicity&quot; of a star means something different. The word doesn't refer to metals as usual. It refers to anything that's not hydrogen or helium. E.g. oxygen in this context is a &quot;metal&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought Astronomers debate whether or not Lithium should be a metal.  I've read enough articles to know that most of the time when Astronomers say &quot;metal&quot; they mean elements heavier then Lithium (not Helium), and no one adds &quot;excluding lithium&quot; as a caveat, it's just generally accepted.</p></div>		</li>
