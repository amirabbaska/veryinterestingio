			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does; the interference fringes are seen when directing coherent light through a double slit, I do not think it would work with incoherent light because the experiment needs the waves to recombine in order to see the interference fringes. Young used a pinhole before his double pinholes (later adapted to a double slit but he first did it with two pinholes following one pinhole, you still see the fringes this way) this first pinhole ensured that the light coming through was spatially coherent.</p>
<p>I came to this thread a little late but to answer op's and your questions, a pinhole was used to turn sunlight into spatially coherent light</p></div>		</li>
