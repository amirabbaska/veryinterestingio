			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say this is more likely just because the blood is diverted away from your penis to the muscles.  Just like its diverted away form your digestive organs during exercise.  </p>
<p>Pro Tip: Trying to exert a lot of force (like pushing something super heavy, or pushing against a wall) will reverse blue balls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Swam competitively for a long time, up until last year when I turned 18. My strategy was to think of hot babes while I swam so that I'd just have a semi in my speedo. Those things are so tight that there's no chance of getting a boner but a good bulge was always there. </p>
<p>That took care of the shrinkage problem and also it sent blood to my dick and a bit less to my arms/legs, forcing my body to make more blood. Is that how that works? It's like in-body doping maybe? </p></div>		</li>
