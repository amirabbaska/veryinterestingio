			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, and its currently still a bit pricey to extract it.</p>
<p>There are also open air extractors around that I recall, but the return on them is pretty damn awful as far as useful gasses go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that'd be given. The amount of hydrogen used to produce massive amounts of energy is very little, and probably wouldn't produce much helium at all.</p></div>		</li>
