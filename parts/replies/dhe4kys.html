			<div class="markdown"><p>I just happened to have written a (non-scientific) research paper on this topic and found some quirks in my reading.  I found a theory about potential collapse of a primordial gas cloud directly into a black hole without an intervening star phase <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0602363" target="_blank">here</a>.  Also found theories about getting around the accretion rate limiter (Eddington rate) in a few places including <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0405024" target="_blank">here</a>. The physics of the early universe are a bit different than we're used to, so it seems more study is needed for a definitive answer on how SMBH form. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's sort of impossible. The density necessary to get even remotely close to a black hole is going to pressurize the gas so much that it heats up so much that fusion is inevitable. So a gas cloud that coalesces into a single gravitational object is going to become a star before it can become a black hole, regardless of how short-lived it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This threads science lingo is way over my head but I've always been curious about something and you seem like the guy to ask. If the Big Bang was originally a very dense point of matter, doesn't that sound like it could've just been some sort of critical point of a massive singular black hole? And since all matter in the universe is enacting gravity on everything won't the universe eventually come back together? So could our universe just be in a constant loop of expand from Big Bang, collapse from black holes, repeat? I know they say the universe is more rapidly expanding but I feel like maybe we are very early in the &quot;explosion&quot; if the Big Bang?</p>
<p>Again my space knowledge is limited so my apologizes if I am way off kilter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, PBS Space-Time had a great episode about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDmKLXVFJzk" target="_blank">What's Wrong with the Big Bang Theory</a>. He actually points out that it is a common misconception that the entire universe started out the size of a grain of sand. The theory actually doesn't claim that. We can only theorize about the visible universe, and the Big Bang Theory (and all its supporting evidence) only specify that our <strong>visible universe</strong> was compressed down to the size of a grain of sand. The total universe could still be infinite, meaning that the entire early compressed universe would still have been infinite. So whatever happened/caused that starting moment of the Big Bang, there is much we can't explain. Even though we know a great deal about the femtoseconds after that starting moment.</p>
<p>That whole video is quite interesting (as are all of their videos.) Highly recommend!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watch the first two of these lectures for a layman explanation of the early universe. Basically, the big bang model assumes a dense, homogenous soup of particles to begin with. The inflation model sets up the conditions for the homogenous soup of particles. Expansion is a property of space itself. The rate of expansion depends on a number of things such as the density and types of particles within it. Because of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, there are extremely tiny fluctuations in empty space. As the space expands extremely rapidly, these small fluctuations get &quot;stretched out&quot; into particles within that space. This happens essentially homogenously. And the space was expanding too fast for it to collapse again. The rate of expansion in the early universe is pretty crazy, actually. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A bigger question deals with dark matter that aggregates around galaxies. It is currently unknown whether galaxies pull in the dark matter, or if dark matter pulls in baryonic matter causing galactic formation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The current vision on galaxy formation is that dark matter halos formed earlier.</p>
<p>Before the time of the cosmic microwave background, baryonic matter interacted strongly with photons. These photons strongly supressed overdensities in the baryonic matter. Dark matter does not interact with photons though, so these could grow. When photons and baryonic matter decoupled, the baryons could collapse into these dark matter halos, causing the first galaxies to form.</p>
<p>Without the growth of the dark matter halos before decoupling, we would not be able to see the massive structures we see today.</p></div>		</li>
