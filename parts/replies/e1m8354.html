			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of that bespokeness, and an issue of its own, is that satellite tech has to be hardened and shielded against certain conditions of space like cosmic rays, and for that, certain older techs can be better suited for their roles, thanks to wider spacing of circuit traces, wider voltage tolerances, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have ways to shield or protect magnetic storage from that sort of radiation that'll corrupt the data.</p>
<p>I believe ddr4 includes it as an industry standard now, and ddr3 had more expensive variants that included it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about permanent storage, though, but they probably have ways to shield or protect that as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm graduating this summer with a Bachelor degree in Aerospace Engineering. I finished up my capstone last semester where we focused on the conceptual design environment and I was exposed quite a bit to forcasting future projects and technology due to my professor's background. I also have friends working in conceptual design in industry, so maybe I can provide some insight here as well, because the way you described it is certainly not how it always works, especially on really long term projects like the Joint Strike Fighter program (where the F35 came from), which started in the 80s. </p>
<p>Essentially, conceptual design engineers spend a great deal of effort predicting and forecasting where technology will be when they want a program to be completed by. This is done primarily in two ways, as far as I know. Either a specific forecasting study is done for the particular project and technologies or they utilize a forecasting/case study done previously - probably a combination of the two. </p>
<p>For instance, a big part of the conceptual design process includes technology trade studies, which seeks to answer the question, &quot;What if we replaced technology x on the vehicle with technology y&quot;. Sometimes this &quot;technology y&quot; is a current technology, sometimes it isn't. Sometimes it is a technology that is available now, sometimes it's a technology that might be available in 5 years, and sometimes it's something as far reaching as fusion power or a warp drive. That sounds nuts for a multi-billion dollar company to actually invest time and resources into something that might not be available for 100+ years, but at some point it might be available, and having some ground work done previously is certainly advantageous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it would be wild to be involved in a billion dollar project with a major corporation, working alongside very intelligent people, and at some point say, in all seriousness, “but what if <em>WARP DRIVE</em> ? I have no idea what one would look like, but if we put some bolt holes <em>here</em> and <em>here</em>, we could probably mount one to this helicopter.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a much more involved process than you might think. My capstone professor actually co-authored a textbook on future generations of spacecraft propulsion systems and what they might look like properly integrated with a vehicle. The primary focus is on &quot;near term&quot; technologies, but he does cover &quot;far term&quot; technologies, including warp drives and antimatter engines. The idea is that engineers in however many years will be able to look back and have some sort of foundation to start out on, instead of starting with a blank slate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, hsving worked on several space missions the hardware design is fixed but there is a lot that can be done via software updates to enhance performance. The hardware is custom built with a lot of flexibility, high reliability components with protection against radiation and heat are used but it doesnt last forever. Yes backups can be designed and built for critcal items but usually there is not budget or room for that to be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember hearing how the Voyager missions got software upgrades that improved the quality of images returned. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last true software overhaul was in 1990, after the 1989 Neptune encounter and at the beginning of the interstellar mission. &quot;The flight software was basically completely re-written in order to have a spacecraft that could be nearly autonomous and continue sending back data to us even if we lost communication with it,&quot; Dodd said. &quot;It has a looping routine of activities that it does automatically on board and then we augment that with sequences that we send up every three months.&quot;</p>

<p>I haven't found a reference to the image processing / coding upgrades.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Granted the missions I worked are now 12 -15 years old and Image processing is not on-board other than some filtering to put frequencies into bins that allow mapping the analog intensity to a digital 8 bit value. That can be done by hardware. Images are actually black and white and are converted to color. It could be different now to allow more science to be done on-board and the results sent vs raw data. I’d have to defer to someone more current.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though presumably, when we say the design is fixed, different parts of the design get locked into their final configuration at different points.</p>
<p>You do your design studies, and you're relatively theoretical at that point. You start to design your electronics and that's based around a specific family/architecture of CPU, but you can select the final model of chip relatively late in the game when you eventually lock down the final design, or add more memory if higher capacity models have become available in the same architecture.</p>
<p>So in this case, is it fair to say the JWST's design would not have been locked down in 1996 with 1996 tech - they'd have been working through design and engineering studies for at least a couple of years (notwithstanding the major redesign in 2005).</p>
<p>Of course JWST was supposed to launch in 2007, so the gap to turn-of-the-millennium tech wasn't as great as it is now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>higher capacity and more memory models are typically not rad hard (“space rated”) when they first come out and faster CPU means a need for faster memory (or wait states) which again may not be space rated. Faster Memory and CPU also means more heat load which has to be analyzed to see if it can be dumped fast enough by the thermal systems. These things are all inter-twined. It is the role of the systems engineer to try to achieve the balance of all things plus meet the mission requirements, the cost AND all by the launch date. </p></div>		</li>
