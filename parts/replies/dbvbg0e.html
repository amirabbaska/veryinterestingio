			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info! I never knew tea varied so much on how to make it. I do disagree though - I like teabag teas the way they brew (without sugar or milk or anything) but I've probably never tried high end tea either so I have nothing to compare to.</p></div>		</li>

<p>...so maybe don't try it, it's addictive (; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay so I didn't grow up drinking tea and have recently started and have some questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>how do I know what temperature the water is? Is there a special thermometer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sometimes I had tea somewhere with a lovely delicate flavour, how do I get that?</p>
</li>
<li>if I shell out for expensive tea (is it worth it?) how should I store it?</li>

<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tea kettle, like $30 on Amazon that heats water to your desired temp.</p>
<p>The flavor is likely due to some sort of fruit or herbal infusion, which usually isn't tea in the sense that the tea plant is not what's being used but rather fruit.</p>
<p>More expensive tea is generally better tasting and rarer. Some teas are hand picked or rolled into balls, which raises the price.</p>
<p>In terms of storing tea, use airtight containers. Usually small tins. Store them in a dark place where there aren't other things with strong aromas, such as spices.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can get an actual tea maker where you tell it the temperature and time and it does <em>all</em> the work for you. But that's like $250. </p>
<p>You can get an electric kettle where you can set the temperature. Most will even maintain the water at that temperature for 60 minutes. That's like $30-$60 easily. I got myself one of those for xmas because it was on sale at Target (;</p>
<p>But you can really use any food-grade thermometer. I'd been using an oven thermometer, to be honest. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, that really depends - many teas could be considered delicate, so it's really about what you like. In general, green teas will be more &quot;delicate&quot; than anything else (well, maybe white but white are so delicate that they're usually flavoured). </p>
<p>One of my favourite teas is an oolong (monkey picked oolong, to be precise) which is <em>incredibly</em> subtle, to the point where you're not even sure it's there until it hits you (which is, again, subtle). It is ungodly expensive, though, so I never really buy it any more.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if I shell out for expensive tea (is it worth it?) how should I store it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's worth it, and I'd say it's at least worth <em>exploring</em>. Don't like go nuts and spend $500 on loose leaf teas, but you can get some nice samplers for fairly cheap and try it out. /u/Mycelu5 pointed out <a href="http://www.adagio.com/" target="_blank">www.adagio.com</a> which has pretty good deals. </p>
<p>You store them in an airtight container and try to use them within 3 months (they'll still be good, but tea can go stale). </p>
<p>You'll also need a strainer, even if it's a small one to put in your cup. </p>
<p>Good luck! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, you've been using an oven thermometer yet fuss about 208째 vs 212째 F?  Ha!  Oven thermometers have no need to be accurate or consistent within 5 degrees F, and if you're going to splurge on a high end oven thermometer, you may as well splurge on a good tea thermometer as well. </p>
<p>Come to think of it, I don't recall ever seeing an oven thermometer designed for use with water. They're for measuring the air temperature inside the oven. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tea I drank that I thought was delicate tasting was black. Perhaps delicate isn't the right word. It was smooth, not bitter and lovely. I drank like 4 cups and that's more than I usually drink in a week. If I could make it like that I'd warm up my winter. </p>
<p>Thanks so much for your reply, I'm going to look into a thermometer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People may debate the best temperature but by far the most often quoted temperature for the majority of black teas is the boiling point (212째F/100째F). Lest I be accused of being an ignorant American, I double checked with <a href="https://www.tea.co.uk/make-a-perfect-brew" target="_blank">the UK Tea and Infusions Association</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Black tea wants <em>almost</em> boiling water, not not <em>quite</em> boiling (98C/208F).</p>
<p>Plus steeping <em>time</em> is as important as temperature, and different black teas will want different time. </p>
<p>Plus black tea is far from the only kind of tea (: </p>
<p>And tea that comes in bags is... suboptimal anyway.</p>
<p>Also, the British are not a reliable source for tea making. They also add milk and sugar to it! </p></div>		</li>
