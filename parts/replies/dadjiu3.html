			<div class="markdown"><p>Studying audiologist here, can confirm this. Not only is there a risk to poking your ear drum (which really hurts by the way (, all you're really doing is shoving wax in further. Water can't damage your hearing or go past your ear drum, unless there's a hole in it. Use this water syringe! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard many times that I shouldn't use qtips, but sometimes I just <em>really</em> feel the need to use them. Like, my ear feels dirty, waxy and gross, and using a qtip makes it feel better. I realize some is getting pushed further down, but a lot is also getting pulled out, since I can see it on the qtip.</p>
<p>Is it really that bad? What if I only do it once a week? I don't do it often, and I've been doing it since presumably I was a young kid and haven't had any issues until now.</p>
<p>If it's really that bad, should I use the water syringe like everyone is suggesting? (I'd prefer a professional to do it for me, though)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it isn't. Ignored these paranoid hippies. Once a week is fine. If they can't wield a q-tip without maiming themselves then they should do themselves a favor and don't ever pick up scissors, use a knife or mow grass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is always a danger that shooting water out of a syringe can cause damage. Doctors should always warn patients of it and try to discourage regular visits (like more than once every year or so is too much) the syringe method... And instead encourage 'regular' use of mineral water or baking soda water to try to gently break down and naturally remove earwax. And I mean have someone drip it into your ear while you lay down and then after a few minutes, turn over and have it drain out.</p>
<p>Edit: a syringe cleaning does work great but just be aware it's not complete without risk and try to avoid going to that treatment too frequently</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of risk with the syringe. If you aim it at the walls of the canal and not directly back toward your ear drum, it'll make more of a vortex motion and it won't hit your TM directly. </p></div>		</li>
