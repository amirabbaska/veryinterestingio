			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, these are amazing. This is a type of exotic metamorphism - metamorphism is a rock type (alongside igneous and sedimentary) and refers to new parameters being set on an igneous/sedimentary rock such that it needs to change to new minerals/textures to become stable. This happens famously in subduction zones where the rocks are relatively cold with a really high pressure creating Ultra-High-Pressure rocks (like eclogites) where they form distinct minerals under these parameters. Another more common type is contact metamorphism where varying amount of nearby heat and pressure changes (such as a rising plume) will transform pre-existing rocks nearby to pelites, schists and gneisses!</p>
<p>Exotic metamorphism refers to things like lightning strikes and meteor impacts. These are both amazing - fulgurites can be formed most commonly in silica-rich sand and is shocked (commonly) into tubes which are often hollow created by the discharge phase of the lightning. One of my favourite things about this is the study of peleolightning - using historical lightning strikes in the rock record to gain context of early atmospheres and regions. For example, fulgurites found in the mid-sahara tells us that rain used to be much more common here. </p>
<p>If anyone cares at all further, meteor impacts create shock metamorphism, where the kinetic energy is transferred largely to heat on impact. These meteors are common to be travelling well above 10 km/s (I study in Canada, and a northern quebec crater that my supervisor studies on hit going 18 km/s). Upon impact, large ones will instantly turn rock about 2 km below the surface into magma. These create a different texture when looking down a petrographic microscope, the metamorphosed minerals get shocked, and are regrown to look normally compressed and needlelike.</p>
<p>I went on a tangent there, I just think this stuff is so cool!! I study earth science/geology and I love when things like this come up :) </p></div>		</li>
