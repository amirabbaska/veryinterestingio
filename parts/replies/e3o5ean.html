			<div class="markdown"><p>Not &quot;bad&quot; but less beneficial vs fasting.  I know people who still have to track calories because having lost some weight, their BMR dropped a lot in addition to needing less calories for weighing less.  They are always hungry and have even regained some weight!</p>
<p>Fasting is a lot easier and it's something you can continue to use in maintenance while eating to fullness the rest of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right?  I sometimes have breaking-my-fast meal at 2pm, when I'm doing 18:4 and I want to have dinner with my kids.  They don't notice I only have coffee in the morning with them since they are getting ready for school (or, right now, sleeping in...).</p></div>		</li>
