			<div class="markdown"><p>Tidal force is the derivative of gravitational force with respect to distance.  It basically measures how fast the gravity field is changing in an area, or the difference in gravitational force between the near and far sides of an object.  Since gravitational force varies with inverse square, tidal force varies with inverse cube of distance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes tidal forces approximately scale with inverse cube of distance between body centers.</p>
<p>They also scale with radius of body tidal forces are acting on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So gravity itself scales as the inverse square of distance to the object, 1/R^(2).</p>
<p>Tidal force, though, is all about how gravity affects the near side of an object vs. the far side of an object (e.g. the side of Earth facing the Moon vs. the side of Earth away from the Moon).</p>
<p>Here's some math to see how that works out: if we call the distance to the object R and the radius of the object x, then the difference between the gravity felt by the near side of the body vs. the center of the body will be:</p>
<p>[1/(R - x)^(2)] - [1/R^(2)]</p>
<p>To get the same denominator for those two terms, multiply the first term by R^(2)/R^(2), and the second term by (R-x)^(2) / (R-x)^(2):</p>
<p>[R^2 / (R-x)^(2)R^(2)] - [(R-x)^2 / (R-x)^(2)R^(2)]</p>
<p>= [R^2 - (R-x)^(2)] / [(R-x)R]^2</p>
<p>= [<del>R^2</del> - <del>R^2</del> + 2Rx - x^2 ] / [R^2 - Rx]^2</p>
<p>= (2Rx - x^(2)) / (R^4 - 2R^(3)x + R^(2)x^(2))</p>
<p>Now that's kind of ugly, but we can do a good approximation here. So long as x &lt;&lt; R (in other words, the radius of the body is much smaller than the distance to it, as is the case with pretty much all bodies in our Solar System), then in the numerator x^2 is tiny compared to the 2Rx term, and in the denominator the R^4 is way bigger than the following two terms. Setting those to zero, this approximation gives us:</p>
<p>â‰ˆ 2Rx / R^4</p>
<p>= 2x / R^3</p>
<p>...and we can see that the tidal force scales inversely as distance to the third power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're still pretty negligible compared to the Moon's effects. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7t466h/do_any_planets_in_the_solar_system_create_tidal/dta5qye/" target="_blank">See here</a> for my calculation of Jupiter's effect on Earth - it's still about 170,000x weaker than the Moon's tidal force on Earth.</p>
<p>Venus has the strongest tidal effect of any planet when it's at its closest...but carrying out the calculation similar to the above, it's still 7,500x weaker than the Moon's tidal force on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>u/astromike23 youre a good dude for taking the time to inform peeps on astronomy. I learn a lot from people like you and u/andromeda321 and you guys have been big contributors towards my interest in astronomy. I was just curious if you had a twitter account or something else that you make regular contributions to outside of reddit? Anything I can follow?</p></div>		</li>
