			<div class="markdown"><p>These kinds of intrusive thoughts definitely came to a head after the birth of my daughter. </p>
<p>I thought I was secretly and silently a monster waiting to happen but once the exhaustion and chaos of the first few months passed I realized the thoughts served a survival purpose for my child. </p>
<p>They made me super safe and vigilant about her safety and wellbeing.</p>
<p>As I bathed her I imagined what would happen if I suddenly died and she was left to drown; if I was ironing clothes I panicked thinking of the toddler years where she would be crawling around in prime falling iron territory; if I was slicing vegetables I imagined her little arm and hand searching for something and accidentally being hacked off; if I was holding her I imagined if I had a heart attack and dropped her or fell on top of her, oh god the many days of finding the worst case scenario in any situation! </p>
<p>My husband calls me final destination mom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intrusive thoughts? More like &quot;Final Destination Thoughts&quot;. I am a student (Finland) and whenever I am on a plane, well, you may already know what kind of thoughts I have when the plane is in the air. </p>
<p>Also, watching National Geographic's Air Investigation does <em>not</em> help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish I could vote this up ten thousand more times. It's so comforting to know I'm not crazy for having some of the thoughts I've had. When my daughter was born I used to think things like, what if the dog got a hold of her and used her like a chew toy ect. But the worst Intrusive thought was that I couldn't leave her alone with anyone, even her dad, for fear of someone sexually assaulting her. I was molested a lot as a child so I think maybe like you said, it's my subconscious mind trying to remind me to be more protective. To this day she's not allowed alone around pretty much anyone though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was a new mum I had the same thing. It was absolutely terrifying and interfered with parenting. It prompted me to seek therapy and sure enough was diagnosed with post partum anxiety. Much better now thankfully.glad to see you're doing better too!</p></div>		</li>
