			<div class="markdown"><p>The illustration is misleading though because most of those objects drawn as a pixel are actually taking up less than a billionth of a billionth (or much much smaller even) of a pixel at that scale. There’s a lot of material. Sure, but there’s a hell of a lot of space for it to be in.</p>
<p>When talking about asteroid belts people picture how they are depicted in sci-fi having to maneuver through a dangerous dense field of floating rock, in reality you wouldn’t even be able to see one asteroid from another, they are for the most part that far apart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about what's between Earth and Mars, but I do know that the asteroid belt combined is about 5.0 x 10^8 cubic kilometers, whereas the moon is about 2.0 x 10^10 cubic kilometers.  So all of the asteroids in the belt could fit in the moon a little less than 100 times.   </p>
<p>And the amount of debris between Earth and Mars is tiny compared to what's in the asteroid belt.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, quite. It makes what's essentially empty space appear almost crowded. I almost mentioned this but it seemed <em>figure-able</em> so to speak. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>tis quite crowded though, afaik the small size makes it <em>worse</em> not better because theyre harder to detect -- a bit of dust can obliterate something. As I understand it, it contributes a lot to rocket launch delays and such?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes and no, kinda, almost. The rocket could have easily have lifted 15 cars to the same orbit. So it was almost like it didn't have a payload at all. And it's not going to come anywhere near Mars, it's going to the lower end of the asteroid field. So it was more a stunt or just test of the rocket itself and not so much at all a mass simulation or a prep for mars missions.</p>
<p>It's going to cross the orbit of Mars though, but again, it will not come anywhere near the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When a rocket is tested they use a simulated payload, as using a real billion dollar satelite is too risky.  Usually the simulated payload of concrete or steel is left as space junk (annoying but necessary). </p>
<p>On this mission Musk decided to use a Tesla Roadster as the payload, and left it up there blasting David Bowie, so at least we'd have some cool space junk to look at later.  I think it was a wonderful decision as it's brought a lot more attention to the project as a whole and increased people interest in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. In my defense, I was aware of the Falcon launch but to be honest I’m kinda sick of hearing about Musk so I tend to tune news related to him out.</p>
<p>Though now I know why everyone is talking about David Bowie all of a sudden.</p></div>		</li>
