			<div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten two conflicting answers, so I'm gonna break the tie. Type O(-) can donate to anyone, as long as they have never been exposed to another set of red blood cells, aka a person who has never had a transfusion or foreign blood contact. Even if the person in question has only received O(-) blood in the past, there are actually many more markers that aren't widely discussed which can cause antibodies and lead to a negative reaction. This is often a problem for patients who have received multiple transfusions in their lifetime. At a certain point, hospitals begin to test for more markers than just the letter and Rh factor (+ or -), because a severe negative reaction can lead to immediate (acute hemolytic febrile reaction or transfusion-related acute lung injury, for example) or delayed medical emergencies. In addition, the previous post mentioning plasma vs packed red blood cells, etc, is generally correct as well. In the majority of cases though, assuming assuming they have never been exposed to a different type of blood than their own, or been pregnant with a child of a different blood type, an O(-) person can be considered a universal donor without much problem or need for extensive screenings (other than major bloodborne pathogens like HIV).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a doctor, nurse, or a phlebotomist, but I've donated blood several times and I think this question is one I can answer.  You ask two questions here and they're related, so I'll address them individually before giving an overall answer.</p>
<p><strong>Quick answers:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone takes medication daily does that pre clude them from donating blood?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not necessarily, but it could.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>does medication affect blood?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Absolutely!  That's a big part of how most medications work, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p><strong>More detailed answers:</strong></p>
<p>Just like how drinking alcohol will raise a person's blood alcohol content (BAC), the chemicals in medication will be present in a person's bloodstream after the medication is taken.  This is how the medication gets to the part of the body where it needs to be.</p>
<p>Different medications affect the body (and blood, for that matter) in different ways.  For instance, ibuprofen (the active ingredient in the medicines Advil and Motrin) makes the user feel less pain and reduces inflammation, but it also causes the user's blood to clot less easily.  As a result, many medical procedures require the patient to refrain from taking ibuprofen for a few days prior to the procedure.</p>
<p>There are certain medications that will disqualify a person from being a blood donor if the person has taken them.  Personally, at one point in my life, I was prescribed a medication that disqualifies one from donating blood.  The reason for this was that the drug could harm a pregnant woman's unborn baby if she were to take it and the amount of the chemical present in my blood (or the blood of any other person taking this medication) was high enough that a pregnant woman who received a transfusion of my blood risked harming her unborn baby.</p>
<p>However, this restriction only applied to prospective donors who were currently taking the medication or who had taken it in the last few months.  In my case, it has been several years since I've taken it, so no amount of this drug is still present in my blood.</p>
<p>Each time I donate blood, I have to answer many questions about my life and the things that I've done or am currently doing that could affect my blood.  I'm asked what medications I am currently taking and asked about whether I've taken certain specific medications at any time.  Some of them would disqualify me from ever giving blood, but some of them are alright so long as I haven't taken them within a certain time period.  I'm also asked about behaviors that might affect my health in a way that would make my blood unsuitable for donation if I've done them.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> So, taking daily medication doesn't disqualify a person from donating blood, but taking <em>certain</em> medications (and they will ask donors whether they are taking or have taken these) could disqualify a person from donating blood.</p>
<p>Also, I strongly encourage anyone who can to donate blood!  Not everyone is eligible, and not everyone who is can withstand the thought of doing it (it's really not bad).  I try to keep myself at a donation surplus; at the end of my life, I want to have given more blood than I've received.  So far, I've given a lot and received 0 transfusions, so I'm doing pretty good and I'm just banking blood karma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medication itself usually does not, but the reason behind the meds might. A rare exception may be if a person is taking a medication that results in anemia (too few red blood cells) or thrombocytopenia (too few platelets). These can be meds that affect Red Blood Cell production in bone marrow or platelet production, as well as meds that affect the synthesis of liver related coagulation factors. But mostly it's risk of disease exposure that excludes you. Such as a recent tattoo or, as in my personal case, having lived in England during the Mad Cow Disease scare. </p>
<p>TLDR: not really but maybe in some cases.</p></div>		</li>
