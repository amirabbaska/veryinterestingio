<p>Exactly!  This is why corporations should be eager to spring for eye care over tooth care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well vision insurance, at least in the US, is only something that you buy if you wear glasses/contacts. There'd be no point in paying for it if you have good eyesight, because you wouldn't use any of the benefits (i.e. discounts on glasses). If you have an actual serious eye problem, then that would fall under regular health insurance anyway. </p></div>		</li>
