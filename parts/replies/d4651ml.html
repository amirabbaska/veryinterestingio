			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, the cost of maintaining a launchpad and supply chain all the way up in Alaska is not exactly worth the fairly small fuel savings of launching there. There's already a large missile base in Vandenberg AFB (where most polar launches are done in the US), and as you mention it's much closer to a lot of the industry.</p>
<p>It'd also be much easier for Russia to spy on rockets launched that much closer to their borders, which is another consideration for a lot of launches from Vandenberg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really that much easier for Russia to spy on. They have plenty of spy satellites looking at the US.</p>
<p>The bigger reason is because Vandenberg AFB already existed, so they already had all the stuff needed to launch rockets right there.</p>
<p>It's expensive to build a new launch site.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of our polar satellites launch from Vandenberg AFB, but it's important to remember that we do have the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodiak_Launch_Complex" target="_blank">Kodiak Launch Complex</a> that we built for this exact purpose.</p></div>		</li>
