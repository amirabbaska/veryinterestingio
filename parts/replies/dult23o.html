			<div class="markdown"><p>To a degree, yes. Like a spring stretched too far, a magnet can 'let go' and change its own magnetization to match an external field. That a (ferro)magnet retains a field at all is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_hysteresis" target="_blank">magnetic hysteresis</a>.</p>
<p>If you push a magnet too hard into an opposing field, then it can lose some of its magnetization, and even change to match that external field. For most use cases, this is designed not to happen, and that it doesn't depends on good, high-coercivity materials that withstand strong fields without losing much magnetization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The potential energy get turned into heat which changes the &quot;Alignment&quot; Of the field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not by themselves, really. But by exploiting the properties of magnetism, you can use the magnet to store potential energy. When you hold two magnets together with like poles facing each other, you feel them pushing each other apart. This is the &quot;stored&quot; potential energy. Let go of one of the magnets, and it flies away from the other (or maybe flips over and goes towards the other, regardless, work is done.)</p>
<p>This is just like a compressed spring. The spring by itself doesn't store energy, but press on it, and it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the other comment, potential energy is great, you can do the same using gravity. Take ton of water, pomp it higher and release it on a turbine when you need it, that lake is now a battery. It's what some dam does to store energy when there's less demands than production.</p></div>		</li>
