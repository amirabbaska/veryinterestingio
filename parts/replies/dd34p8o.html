			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever you may feel about Trump's executive order, it <em>is</em> an honest and open action in that he tells you exactly what he's doing, how he's doing it and why he's doing it. This makes it possible to fight it if you hate it, unlike e.g. Nixon's spying which was kept secret.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Trump signed a presidential order that immediately changes the rules for Middle Eastern immigrants. The courts now are going to review that and decide if it's legal or not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But how does this address the issue of Constitutionality that OP asked about?</p>
<p>Trump's immigration order may be illegal under the Hart-Celler Act, but it is almost certainly Constitutional. The SCOTUS has (several times) upheld immigration laws that discriminated on the basis of national origin (excluding Chinese &amp; other Asians) and political belief (excluding communists), so it would be a massive reversal to say that this particular EO is <em>unconstitutional</em>, even if it is found to be illegal.</p>
<p>The federal injunction only prevents deportation of the relatively small number of people who are currently caught in limbo due to the change, e.g. people who had valid visas when they hopped on a plane but landed in the US to find that the rules had changed and were denied entry. Going forward, there's very little legal doubt that the EO is constitutional: the government can grant or not grant visas on any random basis they like, even if that basis would be unconstitutional if applied on US soil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible that since he stated there was an exemption in the law for Christians, he might be in violation of the First Amendment.  However the First Amendment states that &quot;Congress shall not make a law establishing a religion, nor to prohibit the free exercise thereof.&quot;  Congress didn't make the law, and it was an executive order.  However he is an elected official who made a rule that gave preference to one religion over another.  <a href="https://www.aclu.org/blog/speak-freely/well-see-you-court-why-trumps-executive-order-refugees-violates-establishment" target="_blank">This is what ACLU is arguing.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IANAL, but I don't think that's a winning argument. It is true that the SCOTUS has never heard an immigration case where the Establishment Clause, in particular, was implicated, but they have ruled that there is no implied right of entry for unadmitted aliens, and have upheld immigration/admission bans on bases that would be blatantly unconstitutional if applied to US citizens or on US soil. The SCOTUS  has consistently exempted immigration laws and rules from any level of Constitutional scrutiny under the Plenary Power Doctrine. Since J. Random Noncitizen from Syria (or anywhere else) has zero legal right to be admitted to the US and no right to due process, so there is no injury in denying entry, and thus no standing to sue. I don't understand how the ACLU plans to get past a preliminary motion to dismiss for lack of standing, but I guess we'll find out when they file actual papers.</p>
<p>The federal injunction the ACLU won, OTOH, merely enjoins DHS/ICE from deporting people under this EO. This is different from the proposed lawsuit because those affected are already on US soil, were already granted visas, and may be entitled to some constitutional protections, unlike aliens overseas.</p>
<p>Reading the linked article, it's long on vague rhetoric and short on precedent or even a real legal argument. AFAICT, all the applicable precedent seems to follow the Plenary Power Doctrine. It's certainly possible that the current SCOTUS could carve out an exception in this case, but I wouldn't bet on it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's very interesting, thanks for posting. So you're saying that something could be ruled illegal but still be constitutional? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, absolutely. For a little reductio ad absurdum, consider that Congress could pass a law making it a crime for federal agents to throw trash on the ground. This is a law that restricts or restrains the executive, but does not implicate any Constitutional concerns. When an FBI agent throws trash on the ground, s/he would be breaking this law and doing something illegal, but not doing something unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Note, however, that the reverse is not true. Something cannot be unconstitutional but legal because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land. If something is unconstitutional, it is, by definition, illegal.</p></div>		</li>
