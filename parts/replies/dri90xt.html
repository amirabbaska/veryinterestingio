			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation. The only thing I would like to add is that what makes calibration needed is that the influx of carbon from space is not constant. It was originally thought to be constant but with solar flares and even the reservoir effect we know it’s not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would that matter though? The ratio of c-13 to c-14 shouldn't change based on how much c-14 was consumed over the lifetime, no?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can only measure how much C-14 is in a sample at the current time. An older sample that started with more C-14 will look the same as a younger sample with less.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it true that it's becoming harder to perform these calibrations since the ban on above ground nuclear testing in 1963 has led to a steady decrease of carbon-14 in the atmosphere?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The “bomb spike” is not used to calibrate 14C dates. What is true is that using the bomb spike to date materials with high precision (usually within a couple of years) to the period of time 1948 and afterwards is becoming less useful as the atmospheric spike approaches background (ie natural) levels.</p></div>		</li>
