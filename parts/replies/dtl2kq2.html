			<div class="markdown"><p>What does an FM radio's station &quot;frequency&quot; mean then? If it is supposed to be broadcasting at 100 MHz, does it actually vary between 99.9 MHz and 100.1 MHz?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. The reference frequency you use when tuning or referring to the station is it’s center frequency, or tuning frequency. In the US for FM broadcast radio, it can actually vary up to about 0.1 MHz in either direction. So if a center fequency is 90.1, that really means a range of 90.0 to 90.2. </p>
<p>Note that originally, TV stations used very wide frequency bands of 6 MHz for analog TV, or 30 times that of an FM radio station. This was due to the technology of the era requiring that. Modern radio technology which is significantly better, can fit hundreds or thousands of channels into what was one analog VHF TV channel. That’s why there was such pressure to discontinue analog TV and reuse those frequencies for other purposes like mobile data, private radio bands, etc. </p>
<p>Eventually the same pressure might come to analog FM radio as well, since each 0.2 MHz band is still worth a lot and with modern tech can transmit a whole lot more data than one audio stream. But there would be a lot of consumer backlash if FM were digitized and changed, so we’ll see. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno. There was a lot of consumer backlash when TV was digitized, and the antenna <em>does</em> cost two hours' pay, which is definitely significant if you live from week to week, but it wasn't the death of television, either.</p>
<p>And we <em>have</em> digital radio, and a lot of it is right now just mirroring analog stations at higher quality.</p>
<p>So maybe not <em>so</em> much backlash. The big thing would be that you're not just replacing the antenna in your car with a digital converter box.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So that's why every station is 2 away....</p>
<p>I always wondered why I can tune into stations at 105.5 and 105.7 </p>
<p>But wouldnt that mean that 105.6 would be a mixture of the 2 stations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. The frequency corresponds to the carrier frequency, a pure tone at the center of channel which the receiver locks on to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty-much. There's spacing between stations to prevent crosstalk. And separate left and right channels.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was more or less how my signals professor described it, only with sound. You can mistake how loud the tone you just heard was because of noise, but noise isn’t gonna make you hear a completely different note than the one they played.</p></div>		</li>
