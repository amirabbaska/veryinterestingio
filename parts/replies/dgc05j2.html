			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.  The idea that beer was used as a replacement for water is <a href="http://knowledgenuts.com/2014/03/03/bad-water-never-made-people-drink-beer-instead/" target="_blank">likely</a> a <a href="http://leslefts.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-great-medieval-water-myth.html" target="_blank">myth</a>.  But beer was seen as <a href="http://history.howstuffworks.com/medieval-people-drink-beer-water.htm" target="_blank">more nutritious</a> than water - people did know it had substance to it.  But people knew where to find clean water, and it was important to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. It baffles me how widespread this &quot;beer was drank because nobody had clean water&quot; factoid is. Beer was not necessarily a water replacement (though it could act as an efficient source of hydration AND nutrition, but it wasn't used as a replacement for clean water). It was drank because it was good and filling, and also because of the alcohol for beer that had a decent alcohol percentage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Articles debunking the theory always seem to refer to the &quot;medieval&quot; period and totally ignore the 400-odd years from early modern times right up to the early 20th century during which we saw increased  population, urbanisation and the growth of local industries dumping their effluent into local water supplies. Sure, if you live on a farm in the middle of nowhere you can get your water from the local river, but good luck if you've got a tannery a mile upstream from you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>by fermenting the water, it was effectively disinfecting it for drinking</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of desinfecting local water, it is better to use clean fresh water for brewing the beer, with the brewery being located on the countryside at a well, then transport the beer in barrels to the city.
The ingredients like hops were produced on the countryside as well, so these needed to be transported anyway. I guess it was easier to transport only the ingredients to a brewery in the city and then use local water from the city, than shipping heavy barrels.</p>
<p>I don't know if this was done historically, i'm just thinking about possibilites here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is exactly why in the middle ages sailors (at least in the Royal Navy) had a 8 pint/day ration of beer; it made up most of their total daily fluids!</p></div>		</li>
