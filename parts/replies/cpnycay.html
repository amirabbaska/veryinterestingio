<p>Shortly before dying, Weiller told emergency medical personnel at St. Luke's Medical Center that he had shot the missile into his nose in the belief that it would travel through his body and out his belly button.</p>
<p>&quot;I've heard some pretty stupid shit in my time, but that has to take the cake,&quot; said Dr. Anderson Hunt, the attending physician. &quot;Why would any kid think he could fire plastic missiles up his nose and expect them to come out his belly button? There's no point in feeling bad about this child's demise, because the deck was obviously stacked against him from the start. What we should feel bad about is the fact that because of him, millions of other children will no longer get to fire the RoboFighter's super-cool Devastator Missiles or soak their friends with its FunFoam WaterBlasters.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the kinder surprises thing is really sad. At first I thought I was just having bad luck, but now I've come to realise that nothing has more than two parts + stickers anymore. They also changed the yellow castors so that you can't separate the halves anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True; but as a parent you still want to share some of your previous excitement with your children. My friends daughter (6 y/o) is an immense fan of teenage mutant ninja turtles (the old cartoons) for example; not because the saw it on TV (we dont use TVs here anymore) but because her dad introduced it to her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but that's besides the point. I can buy alot of cool stuff for him which will make him happy. But there was always something special to me as a child, waiting in line at the supermarket with my dad, and then being allowed to pick two Kinder Eggs. </p>
<p>In Germany they had the slogan that there would be a figure (collectors item) 'in every 7th egg' so I would count them, one to seven, and never take the 7th egg (even though I now realize it probably was arbitrary) to make sure I get something which I could assemble.</p>
<p>Yes, Lego was more fun, and I never cared about the chocolate; but hey, a rump-steak tastes better than a quick grilled cheese - doesnt mean I cant enjoy a grilled cheese anymore.</p></div>		</li>
