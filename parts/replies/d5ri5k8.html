			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that there is a problem with <em>the</em> kilogram.  yes, the one in France.  Despite the fact that it spends all its time sealed in a bell jar, the artifact kg is somehow losing mass.</p>

<p>So it makes sense that they need to replace it ASAP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually quite important. The problem with the kilogram being defined by a physical artefact is that it isn't stable. It's very well-protected but it's losing mass which is affecting the kilogram as a unit (since it is the official definition.)</p>
<p>So instead of it we need something different based on some constant to define the kilogram, and that party is where we'll hopefully decide which of the options (there are a couple) it's going to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that, but once a suitable material is chosen, forming it to the proper dimensions is exacting work.</p>
<p>When you make something, there are tolerances.</p>
<p>Doesn't matter what it is or what measurement system you use.  A door may be 7ft ± ¼&quot;, meaning it can be 7'¼&quot; or 6'¾&quot; and still be considered the same door.  Or a desk may be 1.8 meters ± 2.5mm meaning it can be 1.825m or 1.775m and be considered the same desk.</p>
<p>Hell, tolerances may get as low as 0.005 millimeters for certain high performance research equipment.</p>
<p>But when you're defining a unit of measure based on a pure material in an exact geometric shape (spherical), there is no tolerance.  It's either perfect, or its no good.</p>
<p>And I don't just mean the diameter of the sphere, I mean how perfect it is in sphericity.  It would have to be the roundest object mankind has ever made.  Like, if you expanded the sphere to the size of earth, the tallest hill would be 4meters high.</p>
<p>So... Not easy. </p></div>		</li>
