<p>Then I threw a dart at a log-log graph and realized that of course it's true.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fail to see why Benford's law is anything other than only vaguely related to this post? Benford's law applies to a collection of numbers, not at single number so to speak. Now, pi may or may not be a part of a given collection of numbers that may or may not follow Benford's law. All the four possibilities exist.</p>
<p>Benford's law is interesting nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's why it's related. Someone asks the question &quot;Is every digit in pi equally likely?&quot; Seems like an innocuous question. And the answer seems pretty close to &quot;yes.&quot; But asking similar questions about sets of numbers, that may also be random, one can find different likelihood distributions, especially in the first digit. I mentioned it just to make sure that everyone reading this doesn't walk away with the misconception that all other physical constants, or groups of them, would follow this equal-likelihood rule automatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it does apply to pi in that sense that the set of all unitless fundamental constants is a set that one could expect to follow Benford's law.  </p></div>		</li>
