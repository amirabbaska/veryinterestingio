All of the component networks are owned, either by businesses, non-profit organizations, academic institutions, government agencies, etc.  But when we say &quot;Internet&quot; we are really referring to the <em>shared</em> resource, the thing that is more than the sum of its parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we say &quot;internet&quot;, we mean the whole thing. Which, indeed is not owned by a single person or entity. The concept of it (an interconnected network) isn't owned by a single person or entity either, of course. </p>
<p>Basically the internet is just a fuckton of people (organisations, really) deciding to connect their networks (which they own) to each other using a bunch of mutually agreed-upon rules, and allowing anyone who wants to, to join the fun.</p></div>		</li>
