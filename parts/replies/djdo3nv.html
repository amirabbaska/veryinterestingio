<p>No, those use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezo_ignition" target="_blank">piezoelectric effect</a>. Shock toys use a battery and a capacitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very skeptical of your 'skin has a resistance of 500KΩ' statement.  Just because if a current passing through n centimeters of skin encounters a resistance of xΩ then surely passing through more skin creates a resistance of &gt;xΩ.</p>
<p>Much as a current passing through 2 1Ω resistors encounters twice the resistance of a current passing through 1 1Ω resistor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, we're essentially dealing with something like:</p>
<p>high resistance skin (small amount) - varying amount of low resistance blood - skin again</p>
<p>meaning the resistance is always 2x skin resistance + negligible amount of blood resistance?  So it changes, but not much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock#Body_resistance" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> has a reference saying that the number is more like 100KΩ.  The thing that'll really change it is getting your skin wet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are confused. Increasing skin area LOWERS resistance. Resistors in parallel!</p>
<p>Skin when dry has a resistance of about 100 Kohms at DC.</p>
<p>Touch a 9v to your tongue. You will feel or taste it. Low resistivity of wet skin lets current in.</p></div>		</li>
