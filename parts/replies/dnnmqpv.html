<p>I feel like statistically there are probably just more people born with eye defects in the world than there are people who check all of those boxes, you know?</p>
<p>I think it's not a nice stereotype.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I accidently punctured my eyes with tweezers once... So I can attest, that people usually injure an eye doing stupid things. I lied for about a year and said my dog scratched me. My bf was the only one who knew what really happened. I finally came clean to my friends, who thought it was hilarious. But omg, the pirate jokes were never ending.</p></div>		</li>
