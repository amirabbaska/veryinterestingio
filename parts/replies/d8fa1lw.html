The customer bought the car / is paying for the car, if they're the &quot;one lucky customer who won a free GPS&quot; or something that's completely different. In a matrix scheme, they'd be buying GPS's in the hopes of increasing their odds of getting a car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically. Although you're getting something more than a ticket in return as opposed to a ticket. </p>
<p>Also since raffles are typically done to generate money for a specific group they're not considered schemes. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Matrix schemes also generate money for a specific group (or an individual) ... so do Ponzi and Pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>The difference is in applying the Matrix scheme as a <em>business</em> practice, as I listed in the Dwight example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify a little on Pyramid Schemes, there is another type of business that is a little similar to Pyramid Schemes, but very importantly different. That is Multi level marketing.  There is however a spectrum in between the two, but there exist a number of reputable MLM companies.</p>
<p><strong>Pyramid Scheme</strong> The primary source of income in a pyramid scheme is recruiting new people below you, there is a legitimate (using the term loosely) product, but its vastly outstripped by the money from recruiting new people.</p>
<p><strong>Multi Level Marketing</strong> The primary source of income is in actually selling things (Mary Kay, Longaberger, even Cutco though people have other problems with Cutco, that its door to door, the marketing of it, etc).  With these companies, there is very little pressure to recruit below you, most people are actually selling product for a small income on the side.  There exists people above others, but they are few and far between.</p>
<p>There are of course companies that are sketchier or harder to pin down, ie Herbalife, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are mostly right except every MLM I know of recruits HARD. Some people do sell product but most people spend more time trying to get &quot;downlines&quot; and other such bullshit cuz it makes way more money than selling their overpriced low demand product.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not every MLM, Mary Kay and Longaberger for example don't do a lot of recruiting and would be considered &quot;good&quot; MLM.  Others like Herbalife would be on the near Pyramid Scheme side, and there are probably a lot of others that come and go for a few years that are also on the heavily recruit people under you side.</p></div>		</li>
