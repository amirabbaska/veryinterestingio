			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me ask a slightly different question. Peanut butter is malleable. So is iron. Are peanut butter and iron malleable in the same way, except the iron <del>is much, much less viscous</del> has much higher viscosity and requires a much stronger knife under much stronger forces to spread it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no.</p>
<p>Malleable has a specific definition when talking about materials - it applies to solids only.  However, I understand what you're getting at.</p>
<p>Peanut butter is a suspension of particles in oil, so it behaves a bit like a fluid.  It can be spread like a fluid, and is called a viscoelastic fluid.  That's a fancy way of saying it's viscosity changes when the force changes.  When it sits in the jar it keeps it shape, but when you apply force by spreading it, it thins out easily.</p>
<p>Solids don't have a meaningful viscosity; they undergo a different process called elastic deformation.  They don't spread per se, they stretch until they break.</p>
<p>Molten metals are usually simple liquids, and flow similarly to water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not strictly true... solid polymers absolutely have meaningful viscosity - that's why they are considered visco-elastic materials. The term for materials without meaningful viscosity is just &quot;elastic&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, this isn't strictly right; solids undergo both elastic and plastic deformation, the terms relate to the recovery on removal of force; elastic deformation will recover all strain, plastic deformation will undergo some permanent deformation that remains when the stress is removed (compare an elastic band to stretching some clay). Elastic deformation until breaking is only really seen in brittle materials like glasses or ceramics, most materials will undergo some mixture of the two, with elastic typically dominating initially, but then plastic dominating past some stress known as the yield strength. Worth looking into is also the process of creep, the gradual deformation from an applied load under the yield strength, due to higher temperature (very important issue in aerospace)</p>
<p>While it's way outside of my field, I feel you could probably also argue that all solids will still have a viscosity under sufficient pressure; see for example the spherical nature of planets. Even when they have a nominally solid core, they will still undergo a gradual reversion to a sphere without ever melting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all. Iron forms a crystal structure as it cools, physically changing it's properties when it transitions from liquid to solid. When you bend iron you are forcing that structure to change and it weakens as some of the crystals delaminate from eachother. When you &quot;bend&quot; or spread peanut butter you are merely forcing the particles of peanut suspended in the oil to move over and around eachother. </p>
<p>This is why if you apply enough energy quickly, iron will break. Whereas peanut butter will not. </p>
<p>Sugar or glass are a better comparison but obviously carbohydrate chains and silicon have different ductile properties due to the differences in their crystal phase. </p>
<p>The term viscosity for this reason is mainly used for mixtures, like colloids, as their viscosity is easily changed by the proportions used in the mixture. Solids are not considered to have a viscosity as they are &quot;frozen&quot; much like ice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluids and liquids are not the same thing. This is something that you need to beat out of your head if you're going to talk physics (and several other related fields).</p>
<p>Fluids are things that flow. </p>
<p>Liquids are a state of matter with a certain set of properties, one of which happens to be fluidity. </p>
<p>Solids can be fluid under certain circumstances, but that does not make them liquid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. I'm actually a chemical engineer so I should know better. But I barely use my degree in my job so I forget a lot. That's why I read here so I can keep up on things a little, at least. </p>
<p>Edit: still wouldn't have figured that peanut butter is anything but a solid, maybe I'm too used to the chunky kind! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shear thinning is a non-newtonian behavior specific to fluids. Peanut butter which exhibits shear thinning behavior is a fluid. Even that thicker, health food peanut butter which doesn't flow as easy is likely a fluid, but would be considered a Bingham Plastic, which just means it acts like a solid until you begin to shear it. </p></div>		</li>
