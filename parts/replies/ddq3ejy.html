<p>Your eyes are the main organ which can detect electromagnetic radiation (specifically in the visible light spectrum), but there is another. Skin. Skin is almost like another eye which can detect thermal infrared (aka &quot;warmth&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a variety of tests, for instance to arrange colours in a series of hues from one hue to another (for instance <a href="http://www.xrite.com/hue-test" target="_blank">http://www.xrite.com/hue-test</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnsworth-Munsell_100_hue_test" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farnsworth-Munsell_100_hue_test</a> (although obviously to do it properly you need the right type of calibrated monitor!)), or the ability to discriminate (accurately) between pure colours at a single wavelength, versus mixed colours with the same average wavelength, but different peak positions. Many of the tests are primarily to test for colour deficiency rather than 'super-seeing' but can of course be adapted. </p>
<p>There are colours, that the average person (trichromic) would say are the same, where as a functional tetrachromic person could (repeatably) discriminate between. Whilst a fairly significant minority of women are thought to have a fourth cone (studies give values from 2 - 50% for women depending on the study), as far as I can remember only one woman has actually demonstrated that this leads to an improvement in colour discrimination. There is a paper here (that also describes a particular testing method) <a href="http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2191517" target="_blank">http://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2191517</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Tried it the first time and got 2, then I realized my brightness wasn't all the way up. I got 0 the second time. I wouldn't mind a test for more colors. That was pretty simple, in my opinion. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our ability to see color is a very interesting subject.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about visible light. Different colors of light are actually different wavelengths (or frequencies) of light. So, what we call red light has a long wavelength (low frequency) and what we call blue light has a short wavelength (high frequency), and what we call green light is somewhere in between the two.</p>
<p>Now, there are various reasons why an object might emit or reflect different wavelengths of light at different proportions, but suffice it to say that we can make machines that can measure how much light of each frequency is coming into the machine, and then make a graph of that. So, for example, I can look at the light coming in from our sun and plot a spectrum of the intensity vs wavelength, and find out that <a href="http://www.greenrhinoenergy.com/solar/radiation/images/solar%20radiance-07.jpg" target="_blank">our sun is actually slightly more green</a> than it is red or blue (the reason is looks white to us, though, is because it puts out so much light of all the different wavelengths that the intensity is essentially too high, and the difference between the peak at green and the slightly less high values at blue and red aren't very significant). Similarly, we can shine that sunlight on some chlorophyll and it will <a href="https://bensimonds.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/chlorophyll.jpg" target="_blank">absorb blue and red wavelengths more</a> than it will absorb green, meaning it reflects the green light, and thus it looks green to us.</p>
<p>Okay, so this is what colors things look like to our fancy spectral analysis machine. But what about to our eyes? Our eyes are nowhere near as fancy when it comes to color recognition. We have three different types of cones. Each type of cone is sensitive to a specific range of wavelengths, meaning when a photon within that range hits that cone it will send an electric signal through our optic nerve and into our brain (note, there's some pre-processing steps in there, but I don't know the details and they aren't terribly important to the physics here). What do the absorption spectra of these three cones look like? <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/vision/imgvis/colcon.gif" target="_blank">Like this</a>.</p>
<p>Now, this is interesting. Suppose we shine a laser of light that is purely at 535 nm in wavelength into your eye (please don't do this). We see that our &quot;green&quot; cones will essentially measure 100% signal, our red cones something around 65% and our blue cones around 5-10% signal. Our brain will take those three values, and say &quot;Okay, yeah, that's green light&quot; and then we'll see green.</p>
<p>But, in general, we don't get pure light of just a single wavelength, we get a spectrum of light at all those different wavelengths like we saw in that earlier paragraph. So, when we get light reflected off of chlorophyll, it's mostly green, but it's a complicated continuous spectrum, that then gets reduced to just three numbers: BGR.</p>
<p>So, our eyes end up losing a ton of information when it takes that continuous spectrum and reducing it to just three numbers. What this means is there are lots of colors that can have different spectral patterns but will cause our cones to output the same signal. It's kind of like how we can make $12 out of a $10 and 2 $1s or 2 $5s and 2 $1s, or 1 $5 and 7 $1s or 12 $1s. Maybe instead of that green laser at 525 nm, I instead have three or four or five weaker lasers: one that's 20% at 400nm, one that's 15% at 600 nm, etc. and they combine to output exactly that same signal of 100% green, 65% red and 5-10% blue. To our eyes, this outputs the exact same signal as the 535nm signal did, so the colors would look the same to us, even though they clearly have different spectral ranges to our fancy machine.</p>
<p>So, what happens with a fourth cone? This gives us an additional degree of freedom to help differentiate some colors. Perhaps in our 535nm example above, now this fourth color doesn't have the same signal in both cases. Now we can theoretically tell them apart.</p>
<p>At this point, though, I don't know what happens from here. I don't know if human brains are equipped to process that additional information or not, or what it looks like to people with extra cones. I don't even know what wavelengths that fourth cone prefers.I would add, though, that what colors we see aren't limited just by what our eyes can do mechanically. It turns out so much of our vision is because of our brain doing a whole bunch of work, and in ways that we you would not anticipate. <a href="https://vimeo.com/120808489" target="_blank">Here is a cool video showing the Himba tribe being able to easily tell apart different shades of green that are hard for Westerners to tell apart, but struggling to tell green from blue</a></p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - three cones means we lose a whole lot of information about color. Adding a fourth should increase the information, but at this point It Gets Complicated. Cool video at the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have photographic memory for color. Like I can remember colors for years ago and match the same color. I can even mix paint and match exactly a Pantone that I saw previously. I'm not sure if it's a very useful skill but I have exhibited it since a young age. If there is a job for this I would love it. </p>
<p>Love the Himba video- so cool! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating video. I've read a theory about the development of words for colors throughout our history, and how often the words for a color were tied to when a culture developed a pigment for that color, such as for dyeing clothing. The word for violet or purple was one of the latest words in Western culture, as the dye was one of the harder ones to create.</p>
<p>Wherever I read this, I remember Homer (in either the Iliad or the Odyssey) describing the &quot;wine-dark sea,&quot; a very peculiar way to describe it to our modern sense of color.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more that they can distinguish between more hues. Saying they can see more colours seems to imply that they can see beyond the visible spectrum. For example, two hues which are optimetrically distinct may look the same to someone with only the three typical cones but look slightly different to someone with a fourth cone.</p></div>		</li>
