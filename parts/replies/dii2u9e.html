			<div class="markdown"><p>While I've no concrete answer, so take this with a grain of salt, I'd imagine that this probably isn't the case. From what I've heard, people when using hallucinogenic drugs don't tend to see Infrared or Ultraviolet, and I think it'd be the same for colourblind people.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, there are thousands of colours that a <em>'normal'</em> person can't see. They're all around use every day. Hell, we have 3 colour receptors. Some animals have up to 15. We can't even begin to imagine what those colours would look like.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point is, even when there's more coloure around you to see, I don't think hallucinogenic drugs are the key to unlocking them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also reminds me of how I tried to imagine a new color in a lucid dream a few years ago. It didn't work, it ended up being some kind of greyish blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to understand that color is an internal phenomenon and not external. Thus our machinery is what allows colors to exist in the form they do. Our brains arbitrarily assign color to light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost certainly not. And not only that, but their ability to even perceive color at all would be permanently damaged or distorted due to lack of exposure and neural training. Even if you moved them into a normal color environment, they would probably never be able to perceive or process color the way a normal person would. They would, in a sense, be brain damaged, making such an experiment <em>highly</em> unethical, even if the person was otherwise incredibly well taken care of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're too tightly coupling the physical source of an external stimulus with the <em>experience</em> of a stimulus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why would it be possible to imagine a hue that is completely outside one's experience, to the point where the neurological circuitry to process such a hue may not even exist?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because imagination can be emergent, based upon a combination of previous experiences instead of a single direct experience. I've never seen a horse with duck feet, but that doesn't mean I can't imagine it. Also, it's not necessarily the case that one's neurological processing of hue is fully developed to its greatest extent.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All possible colors and combinations have been experienced and accounted for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The experience of a color is completely subjective. Just because someone has &quot;seen&quot; every possible color doesn't mean they've experienced every possible human experience when it comes to colors.</p>
<p>Color blind people may perceive two distinct colors as being nearly or completely identical. While different wavelengths of color has hit their eye, their own experience is lacking in comparison to other people without their particular color-bindness.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy" target="_blank">tetrachromatic</a> people that have an additional type of cone cell. They would be able to process a wider variety of colors than a normal person would.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Imagining a new physical form is not the same thing as imagining something unreal and subjective like color. Form is real. Color is created in the brain. Given enough time (and enough brain power) it would be possible in principle to realize every possible organization of atoms in a given volume of 3D space. As for color... well, this isn't the first time I've seen this question asked here. I've also seen the question asked in other online forums as well as by people I know in real life. The fact that the question is so common implies that <em>lot</em> of people have tried and failed to imagine brand new colors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Color blind people may perceive two distinct colors as being nearly or completely identical. While different wavelengths of color has hit their eye, their own experience is lacking in comparison to other people without their particular color-blindness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And because of that, their spectrum of possible colors is smaller, and they won't be able to properly imagine what a non-colorblind person sees.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>But would they be able to imagine a brand new color outside the ones they've already experienced? I can't imagine what a true functional tetrachromat sees; would a tetrachromat be able to imagine what a pentachromat sees?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Why? Perhaps the possibility space is more limited with color, but, like physical forms, I may not have experienced every single possible color yet.</p>
<p>Say I've never seen a neon orange (or pick any arbitrary, uncommon color that isn't produced in a neon variety). I've seen neon yellow, neon blue... but never neon orange. Why couldn't I imagine neon orange?</p>
<p>Edit: There is effectively an infinite range of colors that are physically possible even in the limited span of visible light, based upon the combinations of different frequencies and intensities. I doubt I've experience them all.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>The points made were to indicate that one's individual experiences do not encompass what is possible to experience... for if the person's original question was aimed at the whole of humanity, rather than the individual.</p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And because of that, their spectrum of possible colors is smaller, and they won't be able to properly imagine what a non-colorblind person sees.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why not? I think you're begging the question here.</p></div>		</li>
