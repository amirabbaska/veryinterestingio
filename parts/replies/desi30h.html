			<div class="markdown"><p>If you aren't solely interested in the US:</p>
<p>Many jurisdictions don't have anything of the likes. Or at least not in the form, the US does.</p>
<p>In Germany for example a state's attorney can appeal a lost case.  It then goes to a second instance (the court of appeal) and possibly even a third one (court of revision). What these respective instances take into account differs though. Basically, while the second instance is (or can be) a complete retrial, the third instance only considers formal judicial reasons (If the law was applied correctly).</p>
<p>And even after a final verdict is reached (That's the case if either no side appeals, or if the court of revision has made it's decision) there can still be a retrial in specific circumstances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A retrial not in favour of the defendant is permissible after a final judgement,</p>
<ol>
<li>if a document that was considered authentic during the trial was actually not authentic or forged,</li>
<li>if a witness or authorised expert wilfully or negligently made a wrong deposition or wilfully gave a wrong simple testimony,</li>
<li>if a professional or lay judge, who made the decision, had committed a crime by violating his or her duties as a judge in the case</li>
<li>if an acquitted defendant makes a credible confession in court or out of court.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>ยง 362 StPO</li>
</ul>
<p>So, basically your initial question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example if Casey Anthony admitted killing Caylee Anthony now after being found innocent in court?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would permit a retrial in Germany after ยง 362(4) StPO.</p>
<p>Edit: Some wording.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a very similar system in Brazil, though I don't know the technicalities of every instance. Theoretically one can ask for an appeal all the way to Brazilian's supreme court, in reality most appeals are denied at second instance unless there's something clearly wrong. OJ's case for example would probably have a second instance trial (a full retrial).
Also this jury system that seems to be common in USA (where a few selected people witness the trial and then decide guilty/not guilty) is called &quot;juri popular&quot; here and is used in very few cases (compared to the total number of cases). Almost always it's up to the judge to decide if the person being charged is guilty or not, and decide de sentence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about trying them for lying under oath, interfering with a police investigation, tampering with evidence, or something along those lines after a confession is made? In the example of murder, they are significantly less severe crimes but couldn't you try them for as many of those types of crimes they committed and get justice in some form from those convictions? Even if the ones that took place with the original crime they were acquitted for, such as tampering with evidence, couldn't lying under oath be reasonably considered? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is possible but the proceedings can run their course without perjury occurring. The defendant doesn't have to say a word (Fifth Amend.) and his/her lawyer can focus their arguments on how deficient the government's evidence is; relying on the high standard of proof for a criminal conviction. Note that merely pleading not guilty cannot be perjury as the plea is not considered testimony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a criminal lawyer, much of this is wrong.</p>
<p>1) Blockburger does not really apply in the context of subsequent prosecutions, it applies in the context of being punished twice after conviction within the same indictment. An analysis about whether the government can bring a prosecution for the same EVENTS later on a separate indictment is an entirely different analysis, and is a more equitable type of analysis. This is also usually governed by state criminal procedure rules, not just constitutional principles.</p>
<p>In other words, whether you can be punished twice (receive a sentence for each) for separate counts in the same indictment, one which is a lesser included of the other, that would be your time that Blockburger typically comes up.</p>
<p>Whether you can, after acquittal, then seek a new indictment, EVEN if there is no Blockburger issue, is typically equitably estopped by rules which require all offenses known from the same criminal event/transaction to be brought in the same indictment. Of course, there are exceptions and complexities to this analysis.</p>
<p>2) You are completely wrong about the fed/state prosecutions and how they work together. Under the dual sovereignty doctrine, the feds absolutrly can try a person, even after acquittal on the state level, for the same offense and the same facts. No constitutional bar to that. However, there is a federal DOJ policy about when to do that known as the Petite policy. Check it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this. </p>
<p>if you violate a state crime and a federal crime, even if you are found not guilty (or guilty) in a state court, you can be tried in federal court for substantially the same federal crime.  This is up to the discretion of the US DOJ. this is not always exercised but in rare circumstances but the federal government can do so solely upon its own discretion, not the courts.  As policy this usually entails an approval of a high ranking DOJ executive. </p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/P/PetitePolicy.aspx" target="_blank">petite rule</a> </p>
<p>Source 2: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-2000-authority-us-attorney-criminal-division-mattersprior-approvals" target="_blank">USAO policy</a> </p>
<p>Additionally the Feds can charge a separate crime without needing to obtain a petite waiver. This is an easier route but can effectively do the same thing. </p>
<p>For example, you were found not guilty for child molestation in state court. If the evidence supports it, the Feds can charge you with production of child porn in federal court.  Or as another example, you were found guilty of robbery of several liquor stores and received a light sentence, and the Feds can charge you for money laundering if the evidence supports it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. </p>
<p>Very interesting. I did not know a Petite waiver had to come from a high ranking DOJ official. Are you saying that the appointed AUSA can't make the call?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Was just getting ready to question this. The federal government has a separate jurisdiction and can absolutely charge for the same crime. Something if another state has jurisdiction they can charge as well. It only prevents the sake jurisdiction from charging for the same crime after acquittal. </p>
<p>I remember a case where DOJ didn't try the defendant for the same murder after acquittal they charged him with federal gun crimes. They got a hefty sentence but not the negative press of retrying on the same charges. There was talk after OJ as well of whether the DOJ could find federal violations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Say, for example, the killer (for argument sake let's call him Peter) was found not guilty of second-degree murder and testified at his criminal trial stating, &quot;I did not do it.
