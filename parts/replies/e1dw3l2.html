			<div class="markdown"><p>Benefits such as your pension being paid into are only a small part of it. Companies don't just merely want to be profitable, they want to - every quarter - be more profitable than they were before. Employee wages, free parking and a 401k aren't the only things that are so tempting to just cut:</p>
<p>Safety can be very expensive. Cutting out safety is easier if the people who work for you are one complaint from being out. This ranges from not bothering to keep extinguishers in the building to threatning to fire you for poor performance if you take breaks from using jackhammers (hand-arm vibration damage is nasty), to the deliberate coverups of failed tests and corner-cutting that led to the BP oil spill. Safety is always a top consideration in companies: those who think cutting it out might lead to their promotion due to savings take Safety <em>very seriously</em>. As the representation of the first people to get maimed or killed when things go wrong, Unions spend a lot of time negotiating for safety.</p>
<p>There is of course the work environment as well: Unions bargain for work conditions to help ensure that people are being paid overtime for 60 hour weeks rather than being mock-written-up (those japanese &quot;black baito&quot; as an example) for having failed to achieve impossible goals. Or that there be bathrooms that aren't a kilometer walk away. Or that a manager screaming obscenities and threatening half the team every day because it's not going so well at home will at least see a reprimand. We often hear people say you deserve what you're worth, but in reality, no one will pay you what you're worth if they can force you to settle for even less - and &quot;another job&quot; is no less in a race to the bottom if it can be.</p>
<p>Same for Legal affairs: Employees don't always know every little regulation or loophole; wouldn't need legal or accounting departments if it was that easy now would you! What they don't know they can't sue or blow the whistle for. Many industries are often very careful about making sure employees don't truly know their rights - or have been misinformed on what the laws or even court procedures are. Unions are a big help there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've experienced exactly this.  At one job I worked, a new Regional Loss Prevention manager came in and gathered everyone up for a talk about how serious the threat of <em>shrink</em> was, and to scare everyone about how seriously things were going to be run from here on out.  I asked a question about something he said.  He didn't like the question.  I became his target.  I was fired soon after and found out later that he used my termination as an example to the rest of the team of how serious he was and how they'd all better shape up or they'd be next out the door.  Needless to say--this was a Union-hostile workplace.</p>
<p>Much later in my life, I'm working at a Unionized site.  We had a supervisor who was just crazy, drunk with power.  He was verbally abusive to the staff.  He made idle threats and idle promises, things he couldn't actually do--but who was gonna challenge him?  He was a raving fucking lunatic*.  He stood over this old lady and berated her and said to her, &quot;I can be your best friend or your worst enemy. You don't want to see the monster in me.&quot;  Just a little old lady answering phones for fuck's sake.</p>
<p>Well, I drafted a group grievance and sent it up the chain.  He was reprimanded.  He went back to his shit.  I sent a second grievance.  He was terminated.</p>
<p>In the former instance, we would have been completely without recourse.  In the latter, we were able to get this crazy bastard replaced with some reasonable governance--which was better for the employees <em>and</em> the clients.</p>
<p>* - <em>He was also probably a coke-head.  He was certainly manic and had delusions of grandeur.  Also talked non-stop, even spraying spittle while he was going on and on.  Guy phrased everything in metaphors of violence, too. &quot;You're gonna do what I say the way I say until I tell you otherwise, or I'll keel-haul you!&quot;  &quot;If you don't follow my orders exactly, I'll string you up!&quot;  &quot;Such-and-such-concept is the enemy--we'll march together and destroy the enemy!&quot;  Dude never had a single day of actual military service.</em></p></div>		</li>

I was out of work for 14 head punching years, you union rat! I had to wheelbarrow my wife off a cliff. I had to wear two of my kids as slippers as I photobombed my way out of the gutter. And then I had  to keel-haul the slippers because they whined as I stepped on fingers back up the ladder. I'll have you know I'm a summer camp councelor now, and I make balloon animals...out of all the slacker kid's intestines when they whine and bitch about marching together and destroying mother nature. And don't you dare ask me what wheelborrowing means. You'll find out soon enough. I'm onto you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that unions advocate for much more than just negotiating for better pay (and/or benefits). They can protect workers against systemic abuse like unsafe work environments or unpaid overtime and may come to the defense of an employee if there is a case that they have been unfairly treated. Depending on the industry, they may also have a voice in shaping company policy.</p>
<p>What's interesting is that the somewhat adversarial nature of corporations vs unions is a rather American paradigm (though it's the same in many other countries). As a counterexample, Germany has a much different view of unions. The worker's union is  almost a co-equal counterpart of the company itself, representing human and business resources respectively. They view that because the people ARE the company, what benefits the workers benefits the company and vice versa. Sounds rather utopian, doesn't it?</p></div>		</li>

Then they turn around and cry poverty and they need more concessions because they are loosing money.

</blockquote>
<p>Canada chiming in here.  The adversarial nature is very present here as well.  Nearly every post in this thread is presenting the issue from a very narrow viewpoint and completely missing the majority of the issue.</p>
<p>I have been on both sides of the union (both worker and management).  Like every other company or organization, unions are selling something.  Much like an insurance company selling the fear of your vehicle being stolen or the fear of your house burning down, unions are selling the idea of better working conditions, more compensation and fear of being abused by management.  And this is true to... a degree.  Keep reading...</p>
<p>There are MANY downsides to the employer, the least of which is increased wages.  Slight increased cost per hour is usually such a small issue.  It shouldn't even be discussed here, but that seems to be the only thing anyone is talking about.  The union wages are typically set by region and industry because the union fully understands that <strong>the unionized labour must remain market competitive.</strong>  They know this and work with employers all the time to tailor collective agreements to come up with something that works for everyone.  <strong>Wages are very minor in the grand scheme of things, but it's the only thing being discussed in this thread.</strong></p>
<p>There are many, many downsides from the perspective of an employer.  First you lose a large amount of your ability to manage.  See a real hotshot, intelligent, motivated young worker and you want to promote him?  Nope.  Can't do it.  The semi-retarded guy in the corner with his finger up his nose has more seniority.</p>
<p>Also conversely the guy who's <strong>bullying other workers and making life a living hell for everyone has become invincible.</strong>  So long as he walks the fine line he can continue to make everyone's life miserable and the union will back him.  Unionized jobs tend to collect (and promote through seniority) these people.  My experience is that unionized jobs are always FAR worse working conditions, from an interpersonal perspective  for this very reason, despite the usual line about unions improving conditions.</p>
<p>It greatly amplifies the bickering and infighting because the shitbags on a jobsite have been made invincible and given power.  Someone will always make it their mission to become it's the &quot;that's-not-my-job&quot; guy in an otherwise normal working environment.</p>
<p><strong>That's not my job.</strong>  Are the steps icy and the lady in HR just slipped coming in to work?  Think you can spread some salt or sand to keep somebody from breaking their neck?  Think again.  If you see that and decide to do something about it you get to enjoy a union grievance.  You just did a thing that could have been performed by a labourer.  Want to give your buddy a lift from the worksite to the parking lot?  Another grievance.  That's the job of a teamster my friend, you just did work that's performed by the teamsters.  See some old guy struggling because he's carrying scaffolding and got it hooked?  You think you can take 1 second to unhook the scaffold tube and help the guy out?  Think again.  That's the job of a scaffolder.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that there's the political aspect from a union management perspective.  Everyone could be well compensated and happy at your site, but the union has to maintain the <strong>perception</strong> of being the defenders of workers rights and always fighting for a better deal, so they'll get everybody wound up over issues, real or imaginary, with the intention of having a strike.  Once they strike, then they can go another couple years having demonstrated that they still have teeth.  Perception is key.  Who the hell wants a union who has never had a strike?  Why are why even paying these guys?  What have they ever done for me?</p>
<p>There are a lot of other challenges when dealing with a unionized workforce from the perspective of an employer, but these are some of the highlights from my own experiences.  Keep in mind that Canada is VERY different from the US.  People in the US have almost no legislated protections and I totally get why they need to protect themselves.  Canada employees have many more protections, legislated at the federal level.  Either way  I have a small company now.  I would close the doors if my company became unionized, and I honestly mean that.  I refuse to deal with that level of continual, unnecessary nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The most frustrating thing I ever saw was when a non union truck wanted to drop something off at our loading dock.  Everyone was on break at the time.  The truck driver needed to leave, but nobody would hop on a fork lift to get the skid off the box truck.  </p>
<p>The driver, got on the forklift himself, dropped the skid off, and left.  He had other drops to make that day.  In the process of doing this, he was cussed out for &quot;taking food out of kids' mouths&quot; for doing the fork lift drive himself.  </p>
<p>I have been a union worker since I bagged groceries in high school, and I will always advocate for unions, as the benefit to bullshit ratio is heavily in favor of the benefit side.  But I have to be honest when I say, there is bullshit to unions.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is very much a thing. I had a friend who worked as an Electrician in a union shop years ago. This is how he described their day:</p>
<p>Arrive at 8:30 AM.</p>
<p>Spend 30 minutes getting out tools.</p>
<p>Work til 11:30</p>
<p>Spend 30 minutes putting away tools.</p>
<p>Half hour lunch break</p>
<p>Spend 30 minutes getting out tools.</p>
<p>Work til 2:30</p>
<p>Spend 30 minutes putting away tools.</p>
<p>Take 10 minute break</p>
<p>Spend 30 minutes getting out tools.</p>
<p>Work til 4:30</p>
<p>Spend 30 minutes putting away tools.</p>
<p>Total actual work time from an 8 hour day?  Just under 5 hours. This was how the union insisted the Electricians work and he would get in trouble if he didn't do this.</p>
<p>Another time he was asked to look at a machine that wouldn't work. He determine the motor needed a relatively simple fix, so he disconnected it and put it on to a cart to take back to the shop. The union Steward came up and cussed him out for doing that!  The motor had to sit at that machine for 2 days until a handler was finally &quot;available&quot; to take it 30 feet to be repaired, then sat in the shop for another day until one was &quot;available&quot; to take it back.</p>
<p>Total lost production on that line was about 4 days for a problem that could have been fixed in an hour, maybe two.</p>
<p>I totally understand why companies don't like many unions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What?  Not in my experience at all.  Internal politics happens in every workplace (which is mostly what you're talking about) and no one would be reprimanded for addressing an immediate safety concern that was technically someone else's job.  The person who neglected safety would be reprimanded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once they strike</p>

<p>I don't know how frequent strikes are up in Canada, but unions very rarely strike in the US.  And if you look at something like the teachers' strike in West Virginia or the Verizon strike a couple years ago, you can see that it is <em>far</em> from a drummed up, petty grievance that got those workers out on strike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The full story is rather simple, really: Alongside the labor movement was a functional political left wing in late 19th-century Europe that advocated for workers' rights on a political level. For many countries, social democracy (and later socialism) were more acceptable and commonplace. As a consequence, the view of unions in continental Europe, even today, is far more sanguine (though in decline due to free-market economics taking over most mainstream political parties).</p>
<p>In the United States, however, both left-wing politics and labor movements has historically been considered anathema. A combination of a history of slave labor driving the economy (and the subsequent racialization of class), rampant nativism, machine politics, and just flat-out capitalism meant a blatant hostility towards any worker advocacy in politics. This led to many violent skirmishes between companies and their workers up until the 1920s and 1930s that were essentially a small-scale civil war. On the political level, both Democrats and Republicans made considerable efforts to make sure socialists never took the reins of power, creating arcane political laws at the state level that have both calcified the political system into what it is today and stifled political thinking in America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The downside is that they’re easily taken over by undesirable people, such as mobsters; then, the Union can become corrupted, and  a tool for exortion, bribery, and other illegal things.</p>
<p>This was and still is a problem in the northeast, most notably with the Longshoremen’s union, who coerce employers into putting people on their payroll who don’t actually perform any work (and sometimes don’t even show up on the site).</p>
<p>Unions that are too much more powerful than the organizations their members work for can also have bad implications as well. The point of negotiation is to find an equitable solution that both parties agree to; unfortunately, with public sector unions, there’s a tendency to ignore the fact that there are other things at play. For example, teachers’ unions tend to go a bit overboard when asking for raises - absent more money from the state, the only way for the district to pay teachers more is by levying further taxes on the citizenry, which of course gets the citizenry annoyed at them. In my state, we have the most expensive education in the world, per capita, and every year the teachers demand raises that exceed inflation - to the point that property taxes have had to go up by almost 50% in some towns in just a few years in order to pay for their demands. Not only does this get people pissed off, but it also ‘prices out’ less fortunate families from an area.</p></div>		</li>
