			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a lot of sense and should probably be the top comment. Here in Ontario the Fall temperatures are reasonably cooler and so we can harvest during the day (except for icewine). But most wineries have cooled tanks or ferment in a refrigerated room to control that fermentation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this because the grapes have to be frozen when harvested?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Essentially, yeah! If I remember right, the temp to begin picking grapes for ice wine is -10 Celsius. I'm very tired at the moment but as far as I recall, the fact they're frozen increases the sugar content during processing, making it a really sweet wine. Nice on ice cream!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 methods for making ice wine. The most natural is waiting until the first hard freeze, in some regions the temp is actually mandated by law, before picking and extracting the juice as rapidly as possible before the grapes warm up and the other is cryoextraction, where the grapes and juice are kept cold via artificial refrigeration. These two different methods produce significantly different flavors, even when using grapes from the same vines. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also a Napa winegrower here.  I agree with reasoning but not percentages.   We have grown for a sparkling producer for decades Night picking is not unusual but is also very expensive because of lights needed in the vineyard.  Our crews arrive and stage well before sunrise for morning delivery to winery.  This way fruit is still cool from the evening and doesn't have to be refrigerated at the winery. Bruised fruit, heat, fermentation, traffic delays, etc are major concerns and irritating to winemakers.  Experience has taught me to never make a wine maker mad.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Santa Clara Valley winemaker here. 100% of our grapes are picked during the day. We de-stem them right away and are put in bins or tanks in the cellar right away. Pickers pick early and most of the grapes stay cool enough not to be effected by the sun. They refrigerate themselves enough most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of the workers will still wear a headlamp, but they also have large light arrays mounted on a tractor to light up the area where they are picking. Partially to see, but also for safety. A crew can have dozens of people walking along the rows picking, and multiple tractors driving through towing the large bins that the workers are filling with grapes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you pick by hand you need to see the grapes and not cut yourself in the process. that's easy with a simple headlamps and sooo many shadows.</p>
<p>if you go full automated you basically work as long as possible since it matters little for the machine and driver's.</p>
<p>main difference is machine hours are cheaper if you run the machine a lot... and humans don't work better at night but cost more.</p>
<p>it least that's the thing for Germany, might be different in really hot climate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As always I'm late to the damn party!! I'm an Aussie grape grower and winemaker, but you're right. We machine harvest at about 2am and handpick the old vines about 7am. It's a balancing act, machine harvest takes two people so at 2am who cares, hand picking at 7am takes about 30 people so more viable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, many wine grapes these days are harvested by machine instead of by hand. The machines shake the vines to remove the grapes and in the process, many of the grapes fall off of the clusters and break open. This means there is a lot more of the juice and sugars exposed to the air while the fruit sits in bins waiting to be delivered to a winery for processing. If this was done during the heat of the day, as mentioned by u/Secomav420 , you would start to get fermentation happening before you want it to. So we pick at night when the weather is cooler. </p>
<p>I am the third generation of my family to grow wine grapes in Sonoma County, and have driven our grape harvester for the last few years. I'll see if I can find some photos of our machine to share. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was thinking about this as well - the machine harvesters only run at night.  Here in Lodi there's a lot of that.  If you drive around at night you can see the lights in the vineyards.</p>
<p>I buy very small lots 1/2 - 1 tons.  Those are all hand picked in my macro bins.  But I REALLY like grapes to be as cool as possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah with the machine harvesting you pretty much have to pick at night, at least here in Sonoma County. There is too much loose fruit and juice in the bins to pick when the air temperature is warm. If it is really late in the season and the days are getting cooler you can do some machine harvesting during the day, but we try not to if we can help it. Last year we did have to do some day harvesting, but that was because our vineyard was inside a mandatory evacuation zone during the wildfires. The sherriff would let us in to pick, and then come back 2 hours later and tell us we had to leave. Ended up taking four different shifts over a week to pick the last 10+ acres of Cabernet. </p>
<p>It is also much cheaper to pick by machine. We run one machine, two tractors, a leaf/debris picker on the gondola trailer, and a manager and mechanic at the loading area. So, 6 crew total. We can pick as much fruit with the machine as 25 skilled hand pickers. The cost of the machine pays for itself many times over in the labor costs that are saved. And it gets harder every year for growers to find labor for hand picking, anyway. We still have to hand pick on the hills, the machine is only safe to drive on relatively flat ground. I'm sure Pellenc or another high-end machine company is hard at work on a machine that can run on steeper terrain. </p></div>		</li>
