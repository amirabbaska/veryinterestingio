			<div class="markdown"><p>Increased demand in the summer actually doesn't affect prices much anymore - actual demand for gas is pretty constant year-round nowadays. The price goes up in the summer because refiners switch to a summer blend which is more expensive to make. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that petrol prices not used directly for commercial/farming purposes should be higher than what we pay at the pump. I think that far to much unnecessary driving is being done, there are so many alternate options for general purpose transportation. We're not really paying the full amount that our fuel consumption will cost us as a society when we have no choice but to reverse the impact it's having on our environment. Worse still is that this will have to be acomplished at a time when this very effective and mobile fuel source will have become more scarce and more costly to extract. This will make the job that much tougher for any construction required for any carbon capture solutions we may develop. Plus the more we release, the more we must remove.</p>
<p>Unless this fuel is going in a tractor, a freighter or something else of vital importance to our daily lives we should be paying a few more dollars per gallon at the pump. You don't need to drive by yourself to work or down the road purely for the convenience. There are busses, trains, car pooling, even mopeds or pushbikes. </p>
<p>I think if fuel cost more, then people would think twice before wasting it needlessly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about people that do not live in areas with public transportation? Where I live there are no buses, only industrial trains, and I have never seen a taxi. It's a 30 minute drive on county roads to work. I should not be forced to pay more for fuel becuase I don't live in an area where it's possible not to drive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it is necessary to drive, then drive. I'm not some crazy person advocating that cars should be outlawed. If you're lucky enough to be able to afford to live in a lovely country area away from the noise and pollution of urban areas where the majority of people live because they don't really have a choice, then I can't see why paying a little bit more for fuel is some horrible burden for you.</p>
<p>If your job required you to work in remote areas, then sure I see that fitting in with my definition of driving being a requirement of your commercial activities. If it's a case where you work in the city and you chose to find your own peice of paradise with no practical purpose aside from enjoying a peaceful lifestyle, then why shouldn't you be contributing towards the damage caused by the carbon emmisions that facilitate your ability to have such a good quality of life?</p>
<p>If you have the means to support such a nice lifestyle, then I'm sure you have the means to support the preservation of the environment so that the ability to live this kind of lifestyle is a possibility that future generations can aspire to obtain.</p>
<p>I'd have more sympathy if you were working for minimum wage with a few kids trying to afford a tiny apartment and you needed cheaper fuel to pick your kids up from school.</p>
<p>Why is it that it feels like I live in a world where the more someone can afford to contribute, the less they are willing to do so?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You made the choice to live in an area without public transit. Why should the rest of the country have to subsidize your polluting lifestyle? If you want to live somewhere where you have to drive, you should have to pay the full price of the gasoline including the cost of all of the environmental damage and the cost of all the wars fought to secure the oil supply.</p></div>		</li>
