			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheese is usually lactose free. <a href="http://milkfacts.info/Milk%20Processing/Cheese%20Production.htm" target="_blank">The cheese production process</a> uses bacteria that feed on lactose, to help in the coagulation of the milk-- the lactose in the cheese making process breaks down into glucose and galactose by the end. You can read the nutritional label of your cheese to see if it has any lactose in it: lactose (from the suffix -ose) is a form of &quot;sugar&quot; (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate" target="_blank">disaccharide</a>), and must be listed on the nutritional label of a food under &quot;carbohydrates&quot;. The carbohydrate content of most cheeses is under 5% (5g/100g of product), with most hard cheeses (cheddar, tasty, edam etc.-- i.e. excluding cottage cheese, feta, french soft cheeses etc.), having only trace amounts of carbohydrates (and therefore <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactose_content_of_foods" target="_blank">trace amounts of lactose</a>). Check the nutritional label of the cheese in your fridge, or next time you're at the store, to see what I mean. Just because &quot;65% of Chinese people are lactose intolerant&quot; does not mean &quot;they can't eat cheese without gastrointestinal discomfort&quot;, since cheese (by and large) does not contain lactose. </p>
<p>TL;DR Lactose intolerance does not automatically mean dietary aversion to cheese, since most cheeses contain trace or no amount of lactose. In fact, if you're intolerant to cheese, you're almost certainly intolerant to dairy protein instead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest problem is that most cheeses aren't naturally fermented and producers tend to cheat and can leave up to 30% of the lactose still in hard cheeses. My wife is lactose intolerant and can have pretty much any of the cheeses that people would consider expensive artsy cheese, but if we go to the mass produced aisle, she probably can't have any of it without taking and artificial lactase enzyme.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get ya. As a student I had to be extra-prudent with the bulk bricks of cheese I bought. Luckily we live pretty close to a dairy, so our local supermarket did 1kg bricks of tasty cheddar for $10, with &quot;&lt;0.1g of carbs&quot;. Not as cheap as the homebrand, but definitely less painful. Not to mention wayyyyy tastier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Natural, aged cheese (such as Cheddar, Parmesan and Swiss) can be digested by many people with lactose intolerance. During the cheese making process, most of the lactose is drained off with the whey (a liquid portion). The small amount that remains in the curd is changed to lactic acid during ripening (aging) of cheese. Only trace amounts of lactose remain.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even the cheapest, mass-produced cheese doesn't have much lactose. A slice of Kraft American cheese has less than 1g of lactose, compared to 12g in a serving of milk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. The mass produced cheese is plain old cheese mixed with some additional oils and an emulsifier to keep them from separating from the cheese. No lactose is added when turning cheese into processed cheese.</p>
<p>The unholy abomination known as imitation cheese also contains no lactose because it's just vegetable oil with cheese flavoring added.</p></div>		</li>
