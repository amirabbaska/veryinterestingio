			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm starting to think explain something saying &quot;it's evolutionary&quot; is as lazy as &quot;because God made that way&quot;.<br />
Can be right, but just kill the question, don't really answer it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution doesn’t really have a why, except increasing (or not decreasing) fitness within / outside the species. It’s pretty easy to explain why’d you’d get better fitness from oversensitive pattern recognition, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, there is always another way to explain something without running to &quot;because God/evolution made that way&quot;.<br />
For example:        </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every time your brain gets input from senses it compares to what you've experienced before so that you can understand what's going on. If you're experiencing something you've never experienced before your brain might try to link that new experience to something you've experienced before despite it being unrelated.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my understanding as well. Pattern recognition helped us survive so became a useful inherited trait. If you're in an arid place, and see birds flying South, being able to make the association birds need to drink -&gt; birds fly towards water -&gt; there's likely water over there, was really helpful.</p></div>		</li>
