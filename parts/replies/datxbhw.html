			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to call BS but you are indeed right and that is very upsetting. Dinosaurs are not nearly as large as I thought, and whales are way bigger than I assumed.
With a name like SUPERSAURUS you'd really think you'd be bigger than a typical blue whale, I mean that name isn't even that cool. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently went to an old whaling port set up as a museum/tourist attraction, and they had a blue whale skeleton inside this massive warehouse, and it was phenomenally larger than anything I had imagined, it was astounding. </p>
<p>I then read the sign closer and realised it was a pygmy blue whale. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some that are technically larger, but they're much, much less heavy. Amphicoelas fragillimus is an example... including an insanely long tail, it's estimated to be 200 ft. (60m) Blue whale is 80-100 ft. (30m) The tail's cheating a bit but it was still HUGE.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How sure are we of this? Is it unlikely that there could have been some deep-water ancient monstrosity that we just just haven't found fossils of yet?</p>
<p>EDIT: Apparently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shastasaurus" target="_blank">Shastasaurus</a> is the largest ancient sea creature we know of, and it was ~20m long, compared to the blue whale's ~30m. I'd be curious to know what the odds are (if such things can be estimated) that there wasn't a larger creature out there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really my field of expertise (more cellular biology) but I'd assume its possible for a larger animal to exist if there was an ideal niche in the food chain and environment for it. Essentially its all about optimizing, size and characteristics via evolution. There's no point going too large and then not being able to survive if being too large turns out to be an impediment  </p></div>		</li>
