			<div class="markdown"><p>They appear to have made it through previous magnetic field shifts just fine, which implies they have some mechanism for dealing with this.</p>
<p>Most animals use multiple methods for navigating.  For example, birds are known to follow roads and fish utilize scent.  Because of this, they may have lots of other options for navigating.</p>
<p>Plus, using magnetic fields for navigation doesn't even require that they remain stable over long time  spans.  Imagine a goose flying north...it's following a series of known landmarks, but hits a big fog bank.  It could use a magnetic field, whatever the direction the field was facing, to continue in a straight line.  The only thing that would throw it off is the field changing while it was in the cloud.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Curious, what evidence do we have through this? The parent post cited &quot;no mass extinctions during magnetic shifts&quot;, but it's not like magnetic field dependent species are overwhelmingly common. Isn't it possible that plenty of these species die off every time the field shifts, but we just don't know about them?</p></div>		</li>

<p>the magnetic fields are shifting very slowly</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Power grids won't be effected.  A current is only induced when a conductor is in <em>relative motion</em> with a magnetic field.  As slowly as the earth's magnetic field is likely to change, there will not be any noticeable effect.  I'm an electronics technician who does large scale electrical grid analysis.</p>
<p>I would be more concerned with navigation than the electrical grids, but I'm not familiar with how our GPS and communications satellites orient themselves.</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> As per Wikipedia (and I'll gladly defer to an expert, should one appear) there appears to be little concern with regard to GPS satellites being adversely effected by a reversal of the Earth's magnetic field:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation</a></p>
<p><strong>edit2</strong> I specifically meant that the power grids won't be affected by the collapse of the Earth's magnetic field.  Once that happens, there could be other issues.  I address CMEs further down in the post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll use the example of a coronal mass ejection (CME).  There was a blackout in Quebec in 1989 due to a coronal mass ejection.  You can read more about it here:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1989_geomagnetic_storm" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_1989_geomagnetic_storm</a></p>
<p>The interactions between the magnetic field generated by the CME and the Earth's magnetic field caused Geomagnetically Induced Currents.  You can read more about that here:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetically_induced_current" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetically_induced_current</a></p>
<p>It was the <em>relative motion</em> between the Earth's magnetic field and the power grid that induced those currents.  I honestly don't know if the GICs would have been worse had the Earth's magnetic field been weaker, and I would only be speculating if I said one way or the other. <strong>edit</strong> With a lack of Earth's magnetic field, I would speculate that the GICs would be entirely dependent on the size, magnitude, and speed of a magnetic field generated by the sun, and that the effect would dissipate once that field has passed.  <strong>/edit</strong></p>
<p>I'm not a physicist, and there are a lot of variables at play here.  For example, does the earth have any other methods for keeping out radiation?  I feel that other forms of radiation would be more detrimental to humans biologically than detrimental to the power grid.</p>
<p>We typically get notifications from NOAA when an event is anticipated.  There are also GIC monitoring stations attached to the grid to give us notice of when the levels begin to rise.  </p>
<p>It would depend on the type of radiation, and how large the magnetic field ejected from the sun really is.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading that an increase in solar radiation reaching deeper into the earth's atmosphere and reaching the surface may be among the most serious consequences of a weakening of the earth's magnetic field. That would risk damage to the telecommunications and electronic infrastructure.  It also might harm -- though not to the point of extinctions -- life on earth, particularly humans.  (For example, higher cancer rates, higher rates of mutation, shorter life expectancies....)  I don't know if the fossil record is precise enough to show an increase in mutations and/or speciation or other effects of increased radiation levels from past magnetic pole reversals. . . . Any thoughts anyone?<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>An initial reading of Wikipedia seems to say that satellites use geo-positioning rather than relying on the Earth's magnetic field for their navigation, so it seems that there's no need to worry there, either, but I'll leave that to someone more knowledgeable than myself.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That's not <em>entirely</em> true. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenz%27s_law" target="_blank">Lenz effect</a> generates an induced emf (and, by extension, an induced current) which opposes a change in magnetic flux. If the Earth's magnetic field weakens rapidly enough that the induced B-field subsequently induced a high enough emf to exceed the tolerances of the hardware in question, it could cause significant damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm completely in agreement with what you said.  A collapsing magnetic field <em>would</em> induce a current, and is considered to be in relative motion with a stationary conductor.  This is how transformers work, since the windings are electrically isolated.  My whole point is that if it takes 1,000 years for the Earth's magnetic field to collapse, it wouldn't be shifting fast enough to induce any significant current on the grid.</p></div>		</li>
