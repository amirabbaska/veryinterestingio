			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's amazing! I was super amazed when I heard about Washoe the Chimpanzee who expressed sadness at a trainer's child passing away. I don't know why we aren't funding the hell out of things like that. We can literally communicate with a non-human and comprehend what it's saying. It's not a one way street. It's astounding. </p>
<p>I read a bit on Washoe real quick and she taught her child Loulis about it. Was that the chimp you worked with? </p>
<p>I'm so fascinated by stuff like that! Would love to learn more about the research and such. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently even inventive and communicative chimpanzees <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate_cognition#Asking_questions_and_giving_negative_answers" target="_blank">never ask questions, nor answer a question with a negative</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questionsâ€”unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny's house? Where puppy? Sarah never delayed the departure of her trainer after her lessons by asking where the trainer was going, when she was returning, or anything else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It would be fascinating to find out why that is. Does this reflect an important difference in how humans and chimpanzees think? Could we teach them to ask questions if we tried hard enough?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I remember, it's because they don't have the capability to assume that others have knowledge that they don't have. So the concept of asking questions doesn't even arise </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is astounding!  Takes my breath away everytime.  To see them name their artwork, or ask to be let out of the cage, or beg for cheese, or get excited about the holidays... it never gets old.  </p>
<p>As to why we aren't funding this: all this cross-fostering and language research took place in the 60s and 70s - we now feel differently about the ethics of raising a chimp in captivity just for our own intellectual amusement.  Between that and Terrance ruining it for everyone else, funding has dried up for this sort of research.</p>
<p>I didn't do research on them (ended up switching to a different supervisor) but I know a fair amount of the research into language acquisition and comparative cognition studies as well as general primatology if you have any questions.  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side story not really relevant but entertaining... I went to UNR and was lucky enough to meet Allen Gardner who taught Washoe sign language with his wife Beatrix (who had passed away 10 years prior) In any case, they used to be set up in the middle of a residential neighborhood in Reno before moving to a more rural location south of town (off California ave by the Raleys if anyone knows the area.) It wasnt uncommon for a chimp to escape, and one time a chimp captured a neighborhood woman and she was set free when she was traded for a bananna. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Evidence&quot; would probably be a more appropriate word to use here.  Though not specifically in the context of communication, I found <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v399/n6737/abs/399682a0.html" target="_blank">this</a> when I googled &quot;culture in chimpanzees&quot;.  There appears to be already some degree of scholarship on the subject.  More tantalizing, however, is a bit of something I recall reading about a short while ago here regarding <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mysterious-chimpanzee-behavior-may-be-evidence-of-sacred-rituals/" target="_blank">the possibility</a> that chimps might have a concept of spirituality or religion.  As something abstract that is distinctly &quot;non-animal-like&quot;, I find this much more compelling than observations about specific variations in the way one primate community eats when compared to another.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some different groups of chimpanzees have different tool techniques. One group might learn that they can smash a rock over a hard shell to get the meat inside, while other groups might learn to use sticks to fish for termites. There are even some primatologists that argue that chimps have different dialects. Different groups have different vocalizations, and apparently, if you take chimps from one group and put them with another, they can't communicate as effectively at first (but they learn the new calls quickly).</p></div>		</li>
