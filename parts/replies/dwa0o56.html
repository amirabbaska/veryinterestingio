			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™d also add that the case of mercury saturating ADH would only really be an issue from high dose acute mercury exposure in those drinking lots of alcohol, which is a very specific example of synergistic toxicity. The more relevant biochemical pathway for why mercury is dangerous at realistic exposure levels is oxidative stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its more that the ethanol would not be metabolized at the normal rate rather than it building up (in that hypothetical example). </p>
<p>The first figure on this page shows how blood ethanol concentration rapidly rises following the consumption of ethanol and then gradually reduces over time. </p>
<p><a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa35.htm" target="_blank">https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa35.htm</a></p>
<p>Metabolism of ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) is the main (but not only) way that alcohol is eliminated from the body. </p>
<p>If most of the liver's ADH activity was inhibited, the rate at which blood alcohol levels drop (around 10 mg% per hour from that graph) would be much slower and blood alcohol concentrations would remain elevated for longer. </p>
<p>It would also lead to much higher peak blood ethanol if the person drank over a long period of time (say one drink per hour for 8 hours), so in that situation you would have more of a build up. </p></div>		</li>
