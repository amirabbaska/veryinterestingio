			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can assess and react fast enough. But I would highly advise from using your bare skin, it wouldn't be wise to expose yourself to someone's blood. You never know. </p>
<p>Find a bandage, gauze, or something else to apply pressure. Which can also act in absorbing blood, your hands cannot do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, direct pressure should be the first thing to do to stop/prevent bleeding, though if possible try to use something sterile to apply the pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily on it, place pressure just above (or below, think about how blood flows from the heart and try to slow it). Pretty much any external wounds on the limbs are handled this way at first. The torso and neck are exceptions because... Well usually you want to stop the blood loss given the types of injuries that can occur here and it's really hard to reduce blood flow by applying pressure elsewhere. Think trying to slow water loss in a long straw vs. trying to slow water loss in a barrel. It's probably easier and more effective to plug to hole for a barrel first where a straw would be best handled by pinching it up stream and sealing later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the wound and not real heavy pressure. Just firm and enough to halt the blood loss. Also try to use something sterile. Not just your dirty hand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the wound. If you have a cut push it closed and hold it down as tight as you can. I learned this from movies idk if it's  the right answer. Makes sense to me though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's way more boring than people think it is. It has a very romantic title, but in reality most of the time we sit here doing not very much, or maintaining our equipment. That being said, boring is good. We are a very safe mine compared to the rest of the industry and our skills are not called on very often. I have more interesting stories working with road crash teams in the outback than I do from underground!</p></div>		</li>
