			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this relate to the Iberian peninsula? Seems like the combo of Spain and Portugal could be considered “mainland.” Size-wise it’s about 1/3 the area of Alaska, but significantly larger than the Alaskan peninsula. Does the border between Spain and France where the land necks down have something to do with the definition?</p>
<p>Edit: border, not boarder</p></div>		</li>

<p>So the start of the peninsula was demarcated by the river.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly am not sure. A lot of it was down to the cartographers and those drawing borders and naming the land areas. I believe the Iberian Peninsula was named during the Greek era, and people have stuck with it. It is a significantly smaller landmass off of France, which was likely a factor.</p></div>		</li>

<p>France: 640,000 km^(2)</p>
<p>Spain+Portugal: 600,000 km^(2)</p>
<p>You need a larger part of Europe to make the Iberian peninsula significantly smaller.</p></div>		</li>
