			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, the important part of 'washing' the sweet potatoes is they did it in the ocean, and it wasn't for cleanliness. Saltwater was the key ingredient here; they learned salted foods taste better so dipped the potatoes in the ocean after each bite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imo (whose name means &quot;potato&quot; btw) initially started potato-washing in a river for the purpose of cleaning sand off the potatoes. The behavior propagated through the group mostly from younger monkeys to older and differently between males and females, with older monkeys and males less likely to pick up the new behavior. The potato washing was eventually practiced in salt-water, at which point different monkeys in the group used the behavior either for cleaning, for seasoning, or both seasoning and cleaning.</p>
<p>Imo was also the first in the group to figure out a clever technique for gathering wheat that was sprinkled by the researchers. Instead of eating the grains of wheat one by one, she would grab a bunch of wheat and sand together and throw it in the water, then skim the wheat as it floated. A real thinker!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And it was <strong>dropping</strong> the potatoes that was her invention. For the primate to let go of her food and catch it again as it sank was a step forward because it would fully clean the potatoes and you had to actually let go of the food knowing it wasn't gone forever. </p>
<p>I read this story as a sign of culture for primates other than humans in Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors. But I don't remember clearly - I think there were older males who refused to adopt the practice and didn't eat as many. </p>
<p>Great book by the way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close but not quite. They learned ti use the water to seperate the rice from the sand. The rice floated so they could easily scoop and eat only rice, no dirt or rice. This behavior was then also applied to sweat potatoes. We have no reason to believe they like the salt flavor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The monkeys originally used fresh water, but over time switched to salt water, and the original research describes two distinct behaviors/purposes: one for cleaning the potatoes of sand or dirt (in both fresh and salt water), and one for dipping the potatoes every few bites as they were being eaten (only in salt water), which is assumed to be for salt seasoning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From an <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/laelaps/2007/12/04/the-milk-mystery-and-imitation/" target="_blank">article</a> on cultural transmission in blue tits:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A similar problem arises in the case of Imo, the famous Japanese Macaque (Macaca fuscata) that washed her potato before eating it, supposedly founding a culture of potato washing that spread through the population. While it is true that other members started to wash their tubers, the rate of recruitment was very slow, a new “washer” only showing up on the average of every two years. Furthermore, the keepers of these monkeys provisioned them with the food, giving preferential treatment to monkeys that washed their food over others because people liked seeing the macaques wash their food. Given these considerations (plus the fact that the data is sparse given that the researchers were not studying cultural transmission), it’s difficult to say whether the other monkeys were really imitating Imo, whether each one was learning on its own based upon what Imo was doing (like the Blue Tits), or whether they were simply washing to get a reward in a more simple Skinnerian model. The overall trend suggests that it was not imitation (imitation usually occurring very fast as more and more modelers are present, thus more individuals observe the behavior), although the information seems insufficient to say precisely what was going on.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So technically we could nudge species in a certain direction by implanting new techniques?</p>
<p>In the future we could create a mechanical monkey with skins of a deceased monkey from the tribe (sorry its a bit morbid) then get the monkey to do something like start a fire, teach the skill to new monkeys and over a period of time they will all do it.</p>
<p>Then introducing other behaviours like cooking sweet potatoes over the fire with the same mechanical monkey setup.</p>
<p>Could we technically even get them to evolve speech? Or nudge them enough they will develop the physiology to start pronouncing words over multiple generations?</p>
<p>In essence nudging them towards the state which our ancestors turned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in a few million years will they stay the size of a raccoon? OR become Rocket raccoon size? Or will they evolve to be like Cat from Red Dwarf and just look like us but have pronounced canines and maybe real dark eyes?</p>
<p>Surely they will have to get smarter at foraging, maybe evolving to be able to barter with people in a common tongue...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are similar areas of the brain in non-humans, but they don’t seem to be wired the same or associated with communication. I’m not sure how many centuries or millennia it would take to be able for non-human primates to evolve speech. <a href="https://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/brocas-and-wernickes-areas" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>
