			<div class="markdown"><p>You'll certainly believe that Comcast is a person when you try to sue it for something.</p>
<p>If it wasn't a &quot;person&quot; then there'd be no one to sue for institution-wide crimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sadly Comcast's corporate personhood will be a short-lived blessing. Your case will immediately be diverted to individualized arbitration (per the terms of your contract), which will cost you more than you can possibly recover anyway. You will die sad and penniless, cursing Comcast with your last breath.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really? I assume your talking about the US, but surely companies are found liable for criminal acts all the time via vicarious liability. </p>
<p>The wikipedia entry seems to indicate this:
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_liability_(criminal" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vicarious_liability_(criminal</a>)</p>
<p>I study English law so can tell you with certainty that within the UK at least, a company can be found criminal liable for a crime without it going defunct, see the Corporate Manslaughter Act 2007, where the punishment is a fine iirc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comment is incredibly divorced from reality. Corporations are routinely found guilty of crimes, from financial fraud to environmental destruction, and continue to exist with impunity. Worse, the executives that make the decisions that lead to those convictions are often shielded by the 'corporate veil,' which even when pierced almost always leads to light touch punishment.</p>
<p>The convicted corporations that go away do so because the market leaves them, not the other way around in most cases. </p></div>		</li>
