			<div class="markdown"><p>You covered this very nicely but I'd like to add that modern crossbows have longer power strokes and use a compound system to overcome all these shortfalls. Plus carbon arrows to be light and withstand the shock of being shot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No argument there. Those technologies have helped both crossbows and bows become more efficient, but they definitely have done more for crossbows and closed the gap considerably.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you just wanted to break all the records you could make a crossbow with a longer power stroke than any man could pull and a very high draw weight. It would just be really long and wide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always think of a crossbow as the “shotgun” of archery. Great if you want to look tough but only effective at short notice / distance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It simply comes down to aerodynamics. If you could get their drag somewhat equal the rate they fall to earth would also equalize. That would make the speed difference a larger factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you used a modern crossbow?  The &quot;bolts&quot; look just like arrows and you can buy them just as light. People get heavier ones because at accurate ranges for hunting they will drive a huge expanding broad head deeper than a lighter one from the same crossbow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the force, but the energy in the arrow that gives its effectiveness. An arrow on a longbow spends more time being pushed by the string so there's more time for it to gain energy.</p></div>		</li>
