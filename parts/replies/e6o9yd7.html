			<div class="markdown"><p>One way of answering that question would be to precisely define the terms &quot;hot dog&quot; and &quot;sandwich&quot;, then determine if the characteristics applied to &quot;hot dog&quot; belonged to the set of &quot;sandwiches&quot;. This would be the traditional discrete approach.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could create a scoring system where different features were weighted in various ways so that some object could be more or less of a &quot;sandwich&quot; and then process the features associated with a &quot;hot dog&quot; to determine how much of a &quot;sandwich&quot; it was. That would be a fuzzy approach.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, this is exactly what machine learning does. :-) Nothing in machine learning is ever absolute. You can fake absolute things by setting thresholds and such, but ultimately everything is on a continuum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I read the question, I wondered if fuzzy math is what I learned as fuzzy logic. It appears that it is. Or at least, fuzzy math is how you achieve fuzzy logic. Is this correct or is fuzzy logic in any way different?</p></div>		</li>
