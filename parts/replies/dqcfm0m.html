			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it looks like the velocity of propagation <a href="https://liquifun.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/how-fast-does-a-bubble-burst/" target="_blank">isn't nearly as fast</a> as I had supposed.</p>
<p>I only claimed that it could not be <em>faster</em> than the speed of sound, but I was still expecting it to be very close (or even equal to). I think the value reported in the article I linked is a little slow, but it seems that the velocity isn't much more than 100m/s, if even. Whereas the speed of sound in water is nearly 1500m/s, and probably close-ish for soap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a thought, but it sounds like the speed should equate to something to do with speed of sound traveling through the liquid.</p></div>		</li>
