			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of factors. First is that wood contains a fair amount of water. This can be either trapped in pores in the wood, or bound chemically as (-OH) groups on the cellulose molecules that make up its structure. When you burn wood, some of the heat from combustion gets sucked away to heat up and boil this water. By pre-heating the wood to make charcoal, you can get rid of this water, so when the coal does burn, it burns hotter than it would have before.</p>
<p>Related to this is the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adiabatic_flame_temperature" target="_blank">adiabatic flame temperature</a>. The hydrocarbon and carbohydrate portions of wood produce water as a combustion product, and since water &quot;soaks up&quot; some of the heat produced from the combustion, burning those results in a &quot;colder&quot; flame. When you remove the hydrogen and oxygen from wood by heating it in a low-oxygen environment, you leave behind relatively pure carbon. When carbon burns, it produces only CO₂, which makes a somewhat hotter flame.</p>
<p>As an afterthought you might ask, &quot;then why does burning pure hydrogen result in a hotter flame than burning pure carbon? There is another factor still, which is that before the fuel can be burned, it has to be chemically broken down. The energy to break it down gets subtracted from the heat released by burning it. It is much easier to break apart H₂ molecules than it is to break apart the carbon-carbon network bonds found in coal, which means more heat left over for the flame. Carbon-hydrogen bonds are almost as strong as carbon-carbon bonds, so burning hydrocarbons takes losses both to bond-breaking and producing water as a combustion product.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't this more related to the fact that they both burn in a 80% Nitrogen and 20% Ogygen atmosphere - so CO2 as an end product compared to H2O will require 4 times as much nitrogen gas to also be heated up for the same amount of oxidized fuel atoms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Charcoal burns much hotter and cleaner than wood. If you want to, for instance, smelt a metal from ore, you need a forced air furnace running a high-heat fuel. Wood is great for low temperature fires but it's full of water, sap, and all kinds of compounds that retard the combustion. You burn or evaporate all those volatile things off and you're left with basically carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So charcoal production inherently requires burning off the other stuff.  That's still a lot of energy in there though, so what do they do to make use of it?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back then, nothing, just let it go, because it was done in a number of small batches as a cottage industry.</p>
<p>In more modern times (19th century) they would do the same thing with coal, and use that gas to light street lamps and houses.
The remains would go to smelters to power their fires.</p>
<p>Wood gas can be burnt in an an internal combustion engine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing, really.  </p>
<p>The goal of charcoal isn't to use the fuel more efficiently, it's having a fuel that can burn hotter and cleaner, for uses like smelting ore.  There's less total energy, as energy is lost in the production of the charcoal, but since wood is a common resource, it doesn't matter.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooooo! I actually have an answer here! Paper mills in some areas will also produce charcoal with the bark products that they cannot use to make certain types of paper (in my experience, white copy paper) that the mill specializes in. They will use these furnaces to generate electricity and, depending on their production, can be completely off the grid for most of the year (excepting annual shutdowns). </p></div>		</li>

<p>A carbon charcoal briquette made out of carbon-based wood burned by a carbon-based man for something he cooked out of...carbon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are right to flag up the water generated in combustion in the hydrogen stage but I don't think its retards combustion, instead I think the problem is that the water soaks up the heat and reduces the maximum temperature you can achieve from the energy generated. This is why ethyne (acetylene, C2H2 + 3x02 -&gt; 2xC02 + H20) burns hotter than ethane (C2H6 +2.5x02 -&gt; 2xC02 + 3xH20), less energy is produced burning ethyne but less water is produced that would soak up the heat per degree rise in temperature.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To ELI5 this:</p>
<p>Pretend hydrogen wood is cooking oil. It'll burn, but it's not that great at it.</p>
<p>Pretend charcoal is like gasoline. It burns pretty well.</p>
<p>If you mix the gasoline (charcoal) with the oil (hydrogen wood) then the mixture is suddenly worse at burning. It may burn, but it won't be as hot and it won't be as even/consistent of a burn.</p>
<p>But if you can first burn/cook the oil (hydrogen wood) away, then you're left with pure gasoline (charcoal) which will burn hot and smooth.</p></div>		</li>
