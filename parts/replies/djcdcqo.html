<p>1) I personally am working with Mesothelioma. but groups around the world are using it/or exploring the use on a wide array of solid tumours. (melanoma, prostate, lung, etc)</p>
<p>2) there are actually a couple ways. one way is that the cells have a way to signal to the immune system to come and destroy me. this sometimes doesn't work if that pathway is effected by the cancer or if the cells breaks that stop it from activating against self are strong in that tumour. the other way, and the way most research is going, is the idea of neoantigens, basically new-targets... as mutations occur in the cancer this can lead to different protiens looking different than the immune system has seen before which can taken up by dendritic cells and presented to t-cells so they can go out and find more tumours.</p>
<p>3) intravenous is most common way these drugs are normally administered but that isn't to say some can be done other ways. The work we do does not use viruses. viral immunotherapy (which I think is what you are refering to, correct me if I am wrong) is genetically modified viruses that present new targets to the immune system to fight off the cancer... sort of like a custom cancer viral vaccine. There are lots of other types of immunotherapy (I would even argue more types) than this approach. Right now immune checkpoint blockade drugs are really popular (like anti-CTLA4) which take the breaks off the immune system and drugs that target OX40 which puts the gas down. outside of that there is  Interleukin 2 therapy which is also worth a google. </p></div>		</li>
