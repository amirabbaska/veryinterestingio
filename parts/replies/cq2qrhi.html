			<div class="markdown"><p>You should take everything anyone says about particle physics as if they started with &quot;Assuming the standard model is true:&quot; </p>
<p>We can only speak from the theory we currently have, so I will say electrons are fundamental. I can't tell you about some theory which we don't have yet.</p>
<p>We do have reason to think most of the fundamental particles we currently can measure, are indeed fundamental. However things like the higgs are actually less certain on those grounds. However I will always speak from the perspective of the standard model, which assumes it is fundamental. Maybe it isn't but if it isn't I certainly cant tell you what it is made of, because we don't know yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, The higgs boson is made of the higgs field. It is one of the fundamental things.</p>
<p>The electron is made of the electron field. </p>
<p>You can't say the electron is made of anything else, there is nothing else possible to say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP, this guy is the correct answer I think. It's one of those particles that's so fundamental, it's not really made of anything. We usually use <em>it</em> to describe other stuff. The only way we can define it is as an excitation in a field that spans the whole universe. When you get down to it, that's all that any of the fundamental particles are.<br />
It always helped me to know that you could bring any of the particles into existence by causing an excitation like we've been describing.</p></div>		</li>
