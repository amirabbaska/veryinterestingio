			<div class="markdown"><p>A site wide shadowban is a ban from admins (employees of reddit) that makes all of your posts get removed silently and immediately.  Other people also can't view your profile.</p>
<p>In the past the admins used to regularly ban people using shadowbans from the entire site.  They never listed exact criteria, but I've seen them happen to people who are harassing others constantly, evading subreddit/mod bans, spamming, and those sorts of things. </p>
<p>Within the last year they've built up some better tools to identify spammers, bots, and others who are causing trouble and have seem to have drastically reduced the number of shadowbans they use.  I don't know how you can get shadowbanned today, as it's so uncommon (this is the first such person I've seen in months).  But the admins have said they use it for spam bots, although those rarely frequent ELI5, since you can't post links here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to add to this that sometimes archaeological sites are known pretty far in advance of actual excavation or exploration. For instance, in Ireland there are some locations that we know are the remains of churches from a thousand years ago and that would certainly benefit from archaeological exploration. However, archaeological research is incredibly slow and also pretty expensive, especially when we don't actually know what might be found. Take Sutton Hoo, which is probably most well known from the ship burial mound, and which was excavated off on and throughout the 20th century. It's one of the most significant archaeological sites in England, and it hasn't even been completely excavated yet. People get excited about flashy archaeological discoveries, and archaeologists try their best to get funding to do their projects when the public gets excited by flashy gold objects or ships or weapons. The public is, perhaps understandably, less excited by archaeologists sifting through ancient rubbish piles or reassembling skeletons of average people over the course of several decades, and the funding for such projects often needs to come from government funding bodies that can be quite stingy.</p></div>		</li>
