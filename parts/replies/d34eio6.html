			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think I quite understand: you mention that we should ignore the trampoline model, but then go on to describe it as a 'conical defect'.  These sound like the same thing to me, so I must be missing something in your explanation.</p>
<p>is &quot;locally nothing of interest actually happens&quot; the part I'm missing? Is it really as simple as that, once you go to 2+1 dimensions 'black holes' don't do anything like what we'd expect them to do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they're not the same thing. The trampoline fails to depict spacetime curvature, instead only giving an approximate picture of the spatial curvature. This is pretty serious as it's the former, not the latter, that causes gravitational attraction.</p>
<p>Also, a cone is not curved, unlike the space (and spacetime) around a 3D black hole (or star). It's flat. For a 2D black hole, if you take a snapshot at constant time, you get a 2D representing space; this surface is a cone, and is flat. It's very easy to prove: get a sheet of paper, cut a triangular wedge out of it, then glue the two new edges. You obtain a cone. The sheet of paper was originally obviously not curved, and since paper is not elastic the act of folding it up in a cone cannot change its intrinsic curvature, its intrinsic geometry (the one that actually matters for people living <em>on</em> the sheet of paper!) does not change. It's still flat. If you draw a small triangle on the cone, its angles sum to 180°, proving that we're still (locally) doing geometry on the Euclidean plane.</p>
<p>If your triangle is big enough that its sides wrap around the whole cone, things change, but that's a global effect, and that's what differentiates the cone from the flat plane. Locally they're the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The purist in me dislikes the trampoline analogy. The physics teacher of 15-year-olds knows the value of it, though.</p>
<p>Pasted from what I said below:</p>
<p>I'm a physics teacher. I use the trampoline analogy. I love talking about it, even though, while a cursory look at (Newtonian) gravity is in the curriculum, the idea of spacetime and GR is not at all in the curriculum. You know why I love talking about it? Because the kids get a kick out of it. Is it a perfect analogy? Heck no! But a 15 year old that is forced to take physics is not going to sit there as I explain the math behind it. It is faaar to abstract for them at this point. So, I make them realize that the world is much more complex than their video games and tumblr make it seem. I <em>do</em> explain that this is just an analogy and that it is much more complex, but I leave it at that. The analogy is enough for them at this point in their lives.</p>
<p>The idea is that 15-year-old grows up not hating science, and may even grow into a 20-year-old that <strong>is</strong> interested in learning the math behind black holes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some unexpected and richer phenomena in 4+1 gravity regarding black holes. Here is one of the more recent discoveries:</p>
<p><strong>Short version:</strong> Black holes in 3+1 gravity must be spherical. In higher-dimensional gravity, they can have much crazier topologies, like that of a doughnut.</p>
<p><strong>Longer version...</strong></p>
<h2>Event horizon topology in 3+1 gravity (Hawking's black hole topology theorem)</h2>
<p>First consider spacetimes in 3+1 gravity with the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>asymptotically flat</em>: this means that far away from some region, the curvature approximately vanishes and spacetime is flat. It's essentially a way of saying that all of the gravitating mass is contained in some bounded region of space.</li>
<li><em>stationary</em>: this means that there is a coordinate system in which all components of the metric are independent of the time coordinate. (Precisely, the spacetime has an asymptotically timelike Killing vector.) This essentially means that nothing about spacetime is changing over time. A Kerr black hole (rotating black hole) is stationary because nothing will ever change about that black hole; it just keeps merrily rotating. The metric describing the cosmology of an expanding universe, however, is <em>not</em> stationary because spacetime itself is dynamically changing.</li>
<li><em>event horizon</em>: this means that there is a region of spacetime that has some sort of &quot;causal disconnection&quot; from the rest of spacetime. The precise definition is in terms of trapped null surfaces and causal future and causal past and all that jazz. What it boils down to is that there is a region of spacetime that cannot communicate with the rest of spacetime.</li>
<li><em>dominant energy</em>: again, this is a precise mathematical definition, which says that the for any future-pointing causal vector field, some other vector field must also be a future-pointing causal vector field. What does that mean in laymen's terms? It means that mass-energy never flows faster than the local speed of light. For a (perfect) relativistic fluid, it means that the mass-energy density ρ and the isotropic pressure <em>p</em> (which describes the <em>flow</em> of energy and momentum) satisfy the inequality ρc^(2) ≥ |p|. (This condition, in particular, also implies that mass is always non-negative.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, so we have 4 rather technical-sounding, although natural, conditions on a spacetime. For simplicity, just think of the conditions as meaning, respectively,</p>
<ul>
<li>all the mass is in some bounded region</li>
<li>nothing is dynamically changing (e.g., no expanding universe)</li>
<li>there is an event horizon somewhere</li>
<li>there is no negative mass and mass-energy cannot flow faster than light</li>
</ul>
<p>To talk about the event horizon, we consider some slice of spacetime at constant time <em>t</em>. This gives us 3D-space. The event horizon is then some 2D-surface sitting in that 3D-space. (Alternatively, you can think of the event horizon as some 2D-surface that exists for all time, which lets you think of the event horizon as a 3D-hypersurface in 4D-spacetime. But the more common thing to do is to think of the event horizon as 2D since that's where the only possibly non-trivial topology is.)</p>
<p>It then turns out that the event horizon is <em>always</em> spherical. This doesn't mean that the event horizon is an actual sphere (that's actually a coordinate-dependent notion), but that its <em>topology</em> is spherical. That means the event horizon can always be deformed into a sphere and vice versa. Think of the surface of an ellipsoid (football) or a cube. Both of those surfaces are spherical because they can be continuously deformed into a sphere <em>and</em> continuously deformed back to their original shapes. Precisely, the event horizon always has topology S^(2). So, for instance, you can't have a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) event horizon. Nothing crazy. Everything is just plain Jane spherical topology.</p>
<p>The statement that I have described is Hawking's classical <em>black hole topology theorem</em>. (For the interested reader, there is a stronger theorem known as the <em>topological censorship theorem</em> which implies Hawking's theorem in 3+1 gravity. However, the censorship theorem drops the assumption of stationarity. It also replaces the dominant energy condition with the so-called <em>null energy condition</em>, which is considerably weaker and does not preclude the existence of negative mass. Also, the censorship theorem is true for all spacetime dimensions ≥ 3, but does not say anything about black hole topology for dimensions ≥ 5.)</p>
<h2>Event horizon topology in higher dimensions</h2>
<p>In 4+1 gravity, Hawking's theorem is no longer true. (That makes sense since the theorem uses the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, which only applies to compact 2D-surfaces.) Higher-dimensional black holes are still an object of current research and only recently have non-trivial higher-dimensional black hole solutions been discovered.</p>
<p>First, some comments on higher-dimensional gravity in general. If the dimension of the spacetime is <em>D</em>, then the event horizon is a (<em>D</em>-2)-dimensional manifold. Again, we think of a slice of the spacetime at constant time <em>t</em>, which gives us (<em>D</em>-1)-dimensional space. Then the event horizon is a hypersurface in space.</p>
<p>For a long time the only known higher-dimensional black hole solutions all had event horizons with topology S^(D-2), i.e., spherical. There is a classical theorem that the event horizon <em>must</em> admit a metric with positive (Ricci) scalar curvature, but it still wasn't known whether there could be non-spherical horizons. Recently a non-trivial solution called the <em>black ring</em> was discovered. It is a black hole in 4+1 gravity whose horizon has topology S^(2) x S^(1). (The notation S^(1) means a circle.) (See <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3471" target="_blank">this paper</a>.) <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.0490" target="_blank">This mathematical physics paper</a> offers proofs of the currently known relevant theorems about the possible horizon topologies in 4+1 gravity. <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/five-dimensional-black-hole-could-break-general-relativity" target="_blank">This recent article</a> is more accessible to laymen and was written in the wake of the recent computer simulation of the black ring solution. (Don't pay too much attention to the clickbait title.)</p>
<p>What is so interesting about the black ring solution is that its event horizon is non-trivial (i.e., not spherical) and, in fact, is not simply connected! So the event horizon has some sort of underlying ring-shaped or doughnut-shaped topology. Evidently, the topology of black holes in higher dimensional gravity can be quite bizarre.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not stronger or weaker.  The idea of a gravitational force disappearing occurs in relativity theory regardless of how many space-like dimensions you have.  The idea is that you move in a straight line.  Gravity just alters the the direction of &quot;straight.&quot;  This is really hard to say in simple words.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't quite what rantonels is talking about. In 2+1D gravity you literally do not have local degrees of freedom for spacetime to wiggle around; e.g. there are no gravitational waves. There is only nontrivial curvature precisely in locations where there is also matter.</p>
<p>More specifically, in n dimensions (where n also counts the time dimension) you can show that the curvature of spacetime is fully described by n^(2)(n^(2)-1)/12 numbers. The mass-energy content on the other hand is described by a symmetric nxn matrix, which is given by n(n+1)/2 independent numbers.</p>
<p>In 3+1D the former is 20 and the latter is 10: so even considering the matter distribution to fix 10 curvature numbers (according to Einstein's equations), empty space has 10 remaining independent degrees of freedom to it. This means it can nontrivially bend due to nearby matter (which is not <em>at</em> the same location), flex due to gravitational waves, etc. All good stuff.</p>
<p>In 2+1D the former is 6 and the latter is...6. So after you've specified the matter distribution, which determines six of the curvature degrees of freedom as well, there is nothing left to say. There is only one solution, wholly described by the matter at every point. In empty space this is flat; zero matter = zero curvature. Empty spacetime cannot bend in 2+1D gravity.</p></div>		</li>
