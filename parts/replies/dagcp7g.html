			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right, I would just like to add a bit of detail on the actual source of the color observed in each case. When you are burning the tires you release a large number of combustion byproducts. When you have incomplete combustion you tend to end up with a slog of carbon-containing byproducts collectively called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soot" target="_blank">soot</a>. This mess of compounds in the soot can absorb most visible light, giving that tell-tale <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/79/Diesel-smoke.jpg" target="_blank">black smoky appearance</a>. </p>
<p>In contrast, in the case of burnout, the white appearance is not caused by absorption, but rather by scattering. During burnout you are heating up and vaporizing a slew of organic compounds as well as water. As the vapor re-condenses, it will clump into patches of small droplets, similar to regular clouds. Because these droplets have a size similar to visible light or larger (hundreds of nanometers to micrometers), they will scatter light through a mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering" target="_blank">Mie Scattering</a>. This mechanism scatters light across the visible spectrum with roughly the same efficiency, which is why the product of burnout like clouds looks white. Acrobatic airplanes also use a similar approach of releasing oil vapor in order to let it recondense and create visible <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PCTHaJ0.jpg" target="_blank">smoke trails</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then that raises another question, why do tires set on flame smell the same as tires vaporized in a burnout?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tires are being heated in both cases, and the volatile organics that produce the smell enter your nose just the same. My guess is they there is a slightly different smell, but the most potent of the compounds is released after the tire is heated, whether combustion actually occurs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get car tires for burnouts that burn off colored smoke. It's very much a novelty but I thought it was a creative idea and had no clue how the color smoke mechanism works because generally it's just white. It seems as if the companies that make these have certain proprietary recipes for different colors that they don't divulge. Having wilder and brighter colors than the next guy is a business advantage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So these kinds of tires are real? I thought they were just some stuff the in GTA 5. I just figured making something like that would be illgeal due to the need for &quot;excessive acceleration.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way that colored smoke bombs work is to have a pyrotechnic charge that burns- same as any white smoke grenade- but with a dye added to the pyrotechnic. As the charge burns, the finely divided dye is aerosolized, and colored smoke is produced.</p>
<p>I have no particular insights as to how colored smoke tires work, but I would suppose a manufacturer could add a colored dye to the tires during manufacture, and that in turn results in colored smoke during a burnout.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was confused by the reference to Mie scattering as requiring a large size parameter. Apparently, googling it, it's sometimes referred to this as such, in contrast to Rayleigh scattering; strange that I've never seen it referred to as such in textbooks. Mie scattering/theory is just study of scattering of light by spheres where near field effects are negligible, encompassing both the other meaning of Mie scattering and Rayleigh scattering. I wonder which disciplines use which meanings, I know that physics and astronomy use the latter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Overly simplified</p>
<p>In relationship to visible light...</p>
<p>Rayleigh - smaller particles (atmospheric gas) = sky blue</p>
<p>Mie - larger particles (pollution, dust, smoke, water droplets) = white clouds, red sunset</p>
<p>Non-selective MUCH larger particles = haze</p>
<p>Or higher energy stuff.</p>
<p>Thomson scattering = occurs in plasma</p>
<p>Compton scattering = light hitting a  free electron</p>
<p>Inverse Compton (bremsstrahlung) = electron suddenly decelerating after hitting a metal foil and creating x-ray or gamma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that white tire vapor combustible? I know that when you burn a candle, the part that actually burns is vaporized wax. If you blow out a candle you have a few seconds in which you can re-light it by holding a flame to the trail of white vapor still rising from the wick. My guess is that the vaporizing tire, being made from hydrocarbons like a candle is, could easily go up in flames given a slight spark nearby.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually if you're doing a big burn out you actually get through to the steel belt on the tire which makes sparks against the road. I've never seen the tires catch fire from it though</p></div>		</li>
