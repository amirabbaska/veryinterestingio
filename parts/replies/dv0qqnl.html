			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we're talking about cars, I'll explain my side of the argument where I buy cars with cash.</p>
<p>Cash in hand opens the market where I can buy across state lines and from private sellers. I make a wish list down to model, year, options, color, mileage, etc. I start a nationwide search, and a few months later I find what I'm looking for from a motivated seller. With my current car, I paid $19k for a vehicle you couldn't find on any lot for less than $28k.</p>
<p>I also have mobility to sell at any point should I need to. When interest is on a car loan, it's stacked so that most of the interest is paid in the first couple years. This generally keeps loan payoff higher than the depreciated value. This scenario's never happened to me, but I like the peace of mind knowing that if a major expense came up, I could sell my car and buy a cheap one until I'm out of the woods.</p>
<p>That said, I did break this trend last year when my wife needed a new car. We decided to buy brand new for her car, and with 0% interest on top, none of my above applies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, taxes used to be a big factor for me too. I was able to skirt sales tax. With my last purchase though, I got a rude awaking when the DMV hit me with a $3k bill when getting plates.</p></div>		</li>
