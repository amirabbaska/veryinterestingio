			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation.  One thing though.  I'm not sure if this is a regional thing, but in the United States when we refer to a knuckle ball we are actually referring to a ball with no spin.   It comes from the baseball term.  It makes the ball look like it is moving all over the place as it floats through the air.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further, it got its name from the position of the hand when throwing one. The fingertips are held against the ball, which elevates the knuckles and is the prominent feature a batter looks for when trying to read the pitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow brazilian and soccer player here. For clarification Trivela and tres dedos are not the same as a knuckle ball.<br />
Its not called knuckle ball because of your &quot;knuckles&quot;, that term comes from baseball, where pitchers can throw a knuckle ball with no spin using their knuckles to hold it.</p>
<p>Trivela/tres dedos/outside the foot shot is a shot that curves outward. A knuckle ball is when the ball is hit dead center and with little to no follow through so no spin is added to it. Trivela has a lot of outward spin (Roberto Carlos shot).</p>

<p>Also, if you can edit to say toes instead of fingers so it won't confuse people when we're talking about kicking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this answer was definitely missing from this thread, OP asked how soccer players make a ball curve not why is the ball curving or something like that</p></div>		</li>
