			<div class="markdown"><p>There's something I don't understand, perhaps you could help me understand.</p>
<p>Why would the prices of goods (or work hours, or whatever) within China (in yuan) remain constant?
Wouldn't the free market determine the &quot;correct&quot; value regardless of currency manipulation?</p>
<p>Let's say I'm a Chinese worker.
I really like to eat baguettes, which cost 1 dollar to import.
If I don't get at least 10 baguettes per workday, I'm gonna move to France.</p>
<p>Today I'm willing to work for 10 yuan/hour, since 1 dollar = 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the value of the yuan goes up and now 1 dollar = 5 yuan.
I would now be willing to work for 5 yuan/hour because all I care about is 10 baguettes per workday.
Since the price of employing me has just doubled, my American employer fired me, as the value of my work is no longer worth it for the price. Since I'm unemployed, I seek any job that pays above my minimum, which is now 5 yuan/hour.
The American employer is happy to employ me for 5 yuan/hour, and I go back to work.</p>
<p>Wouldn't the entire economy simply adjust to whatever the exchange rate between currencies is, in a manner reflecting the 'true' worth of goods/services? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Markets don't work on assumptions only on supply and demand of resources. If there is no more dollars or yuan in circulation (supply) because the government is hoarding it then it doesn't matter what is going on in the world. In China you can put your hand on only so many dollars. Period.</p>
<p>Also the fact that government is having huge influence in the media and Internet - therefore distorting information that gets to the market - and is able to impose laws and execute them (for example punishing everyone who &quot;cheats&quot; the exchange rate) has a huge influence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does it really just come down to &quot;artificial&quot; interference with the free market beyond just inflation?</p>
<p>I understand that the real world is not truly an ideal free market and there are <em>many</em> other forces involved.</p>
<p>But am I correct in thinking that for an ideal free market, inflation of currency (A) in relation to currency (B) does not change the exchange rate of good produced in country (A) vs. good produced in country (B)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading through this thread makes me wonder where most people get their information on economics and financial markets from. People are talking about quantitative easing, while China has done very little in terms of pressing money, especially compared to Western economies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. While they have been engaged in money creation at an unprecedented scale - which they <em>had to do</em> because otherwise their peg would collapse too - they were doing it below the actual market rates and were hoarding the reserves in large amounts.  In other words the Chinese were under-selling their economy while the West (and countries such as the US and the Eurozone) is over-selling it. </p>
<p>But then again it isn't without a fault - even outside of financial markets - because China is hoarding the income there is no internal (domestic) market developing <em>properly</em> and a lot of the internal stimulus in poorer regions comes in the form of a wasteful and pointless public investment.  People usually don't grasp the idea that China might not be developing the right way because the sheer scale of the market (a newly created middle class in China is larger than the whole population of the US) confuses them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you please explain to me why my country's currency exchange rate (Kuwaiti Dinar - KWD) is very high.I doubt it is in high demand as it is useless out side the country. Oil is probably around 90% of all exports. so If I understood correctly your previous comment, because oil is in high demand thus KWD exchange rate is high ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't know much but I checked quickly on Wiki. KWD was introduced to replace a former British monetary system. Apparently Kuwait was a British protectorate or colony - I presume.</p>
<p>If so then it would be the case as with every former British dependency - they'd have their own monetary system start with the old British system and the old British system meant Pound Sterling - which was even after WW2 worth more as a currency than the dollar.</p>
<p>Afterwards some countries devalued their currency - including Britain - but some didn't. Kuwait seems to be the same as Malta and Cyprus - both former British dependencies - which have very high exchange rates too.</p>
<p>Also you are confusing two different things: the relative strength of the currency when it goes up or down against other currencies and commodities in the market and the nominal value which can be as high as someone wants. I can start a currency which will be worth 1 PHARMACEUS = 1000 USD. So what? It really means nothing on its own. Context (the markets, the trend, the fluctuation) is what matters.</p></div>		</li>
