<p>As for this planet, spectroscopy is not out of the question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this was asked in another part of the thread, the problem is that because the distance is so huge the broadcast would have to be incredibly accurate to the point that the broadcast would have to have been specifically sent to earth. Being 1 degree off from us from their perspective ends up being over a light year away from earth.</p>
<p>Also I am not sure of the quality of the radiowaves after 1400 years, things get distorted in space.</p>
<p>Also I assume that a couple of antenna (or maybe a dozen) can cover the whole sky in terms of detecting radio signals</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its a safe bet that SETI will be doing a complete survey of this solar system soon.  Although at this distance, if any intelligence there developed powerful radio technology 1350 years ago we would still detect nothing since any signals still would not have reached us, yet.  Additionally, due to the inverse square law even if there is a <em>them</em> and they've been transmitting for millenia we still may detect nothing discernable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, if it was dedicated to that, but I don't know what fraction of its time will be devoted to exoplanets. The ideal method would be to look at thousands of stars at once, like Kepler does, so we have as large a sample size as possible. The best use of JWST is probably to make more detailed observations of planets that are discovered in large scale surveys like Kepler.</p>
<p>Within the next few years it will become possible to verify the Alpha Centauri planet, so that's pretty sweet.</p></div>		</li>
