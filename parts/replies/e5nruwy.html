			<div class="markdown"><p>In the original appearance of the Joker, in Detective Comics #27 (1940), he was basically a serial killer who used his &quot;Joker Venom&quot; on his victims so they would die with their faces locked in demonic rictus. I remember reading this comic when I was a kid and I want to say that the venom was identified as strychnine, but it was a long time ago and I just do not recall. BTW, I read the story in the 1970s; it was in an anthology of comic character origins that I had purchased.</p></div>		</li>
