<blockquote>
<p>The sense of musical beauty and emotion is created by the presence of tension and release.  I'll explain how this plays out in the domains of harmony, rhythm, and melody.  </p>
<p>When we talk about harmony we are are talking abut how different pitches (musical notes) sound when combined.  If we play two pitches at the same time and look at the ratios of their frequencies, the ones with simpler ratios such as 1:1, 1:2, 1:3, 1:4 sound pure and restful.  Those with more complex ratios sound less so, and in some contexts may even sound ugly.  We call this restfulness consonance and the opposite dissonance.  It varies from culture to culture and over style periods exactly where to draw the line between consonant and dissonant, but in general movement from complexity to simplicity results in a feeling of tension and release. </p>
<p>In rhythm, we are dealing with placing musical notes in time, so imagine this as being the horizontal axis of music.  Most music has the concept of the pulse or beat.  Patterns of beats create a feeling of strong and weak beats which when manipulated give a sense of motion and direction.  Think of walking; before you can take a step you must first lift your foot.  At the moment your foot is in the air, it is like a weak beat in music, and when it comes down this is the string beat. Just like when your foot is suspended in air, there is a natural urge for it to come back down, so is the urge for the weak beat to progress to the strong beat.</p>
<p>Melody, or the tunefulness of a musical passage, is created by the interaction of dissonance and consonance and the weak-strong beat structure.  We also take into consideration the melodic contour. Generally speaking, a rising line builds tension and a descending one releases it.  Wide leaps create more tension than stepwise motion.  For example take the tune &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow.&quot;  It begins with the leap of an octave, which is a wide interval so we start the tune of with a dramatic expression that builds tension, followed by progressively smaller leaps in the 3rd and 5th measures.  The phrase resolves with stepwise motion leading back to the same note it begins on.</p>
<p>With a bit of quick explaining of the mechanisms behind what makes music work, I hoped to share what is actually going on from a musical perspective.  I cannot really speak to the biological response because I am not a doctor or scientist, but it is my belief as a musician and music teacher that these processes can be understood intuitively, and the pleasure we feel when playing and hearing music is from the mind being subtly engaged in tracking all of this beautiful order.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be theoretically correct, but can you create a new melody on the strength of your knowledge and analytical ability?</p>
<p>I would think not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you are familiar with some schools of music composition in the past 50-60 years you would probably be surprised by the degree to which this has been attempted; but no, most musicians aren't thinking in about ratios or frequencies etc, they are just hearing it.  </p></div>		</li>
