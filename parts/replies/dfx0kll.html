			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had a burning question for ages now. Maybe you can help me. </p>
<p>We seem to believe that light is the fastest thing in the universe, and we make all of our observations based on this. Light, though, still has an upper limit on its speed, meaning that it doesn't instantly travel distances. </p>
<p>My question is this: could it be possible that light is only the fastest thing that we can actually observe? Our powers of physical observation are limited to how we perceive light, right? As far as I know (and I could definitely be wrong), all of the instruments that we have ever created to measure speed etc. have been created assuming that the upper limit on speed is that of the speed of light itself. Would it even be possible for us to observe something, or to create an instrument to observe something that could measure the speed of something that's faster than light? If we could, how would we know where to find this &quot;faster than light&quot; thing, and thus measure its speed? </p>
<p>Could it be possible that there are things faster than light that simply are beyond our abilities to observe? Sort of like perceiving time as an additional or &quot;fourth&quot; dimension that we perceive linearly, but only because that's how we've evolved (or been created) to perceive it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In its current state, quantum theory seems to be doing a pretty good job of explaining physical phenomena on very small scales. So if tachyons are truly as game-changing as that guy says, we probably would have found some evidence of them by now if they existed at all. Of course, anything is possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading that the idea with Tachyons is that they are permanently super-luminal, for a Tachyon slowing down to c requires infinite energy just as normal matter requires to speed up to c. Is that idea still valid? Of course Tachyons are just hypothetical fun particles with no real basis for them actually existing but the maths showing that Tachyons cannot move slower than c would also preserve causality? </p>
<p>Like I said this was something I read maybe 4 years ago so it might have just been a fanciful article.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes fair enough. I think the article was coming from am SR standpoint and didn't even mention the QM ramifications.</p>
<p>Anyway, fun to think about - highly, highly improbable but if in someway ever detected it would certainly create a bit of work for the theorists!</p></div>		</li>
