<p>Coral &quot;bleaching&quot; is the algae having left the &quot;coral&quot;. That is, the coral itself is literally the skeleton, so being &quot;bleached&quot; is literally to be dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a fact correction, coral bleaching does not mean that the coral is dead, it means that the polyps of the coral have expelled their symbiotic internal algae. While this is correlated with the eventual death of the coral polyps, coral can recover from bleaching.</p>

<p>Carbon dioxide acidifies water. Warmer water has lower saturation points, so the exact opposite.</p>
<p><a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01861a033?journalCode=jacsat" target="_blank">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01861a033?journalCode=jacsat</a></p>
<p>However, the difference in the amount of CO^2 the oceans will hold due to increased temperatures is very minor, since a few degrees of temperature has fairly minor change to saturation, but radical changes to the ecology. It's also important to note that it's surface waters that are crucial, but the same applies to both temperature and CO^2 content/acidification. CO^2 that reaches substantial depths can largely be considered &quot;sequestered&quot;. Mind you, I'm not sure if a lower saturation point changes the acidity level, either. It may be that proportion of saturation is what counts...?</p>
<p>From spot research, it doesn't seem nitrogen <em>directly</em> affects acidity. It leads to acidification by either chemical reactions resulting in acid rain, or by creating an unsustainable biological &quot;bloom&quot; that depletes the oxygen. However, read the sources for more information - my knowledge is, at best, surface deep, and at worst, flawed (I skimmed them).</p>

<p>It is my understanding that atmospheric nitrogen isn't rising, rather it's being injected into the soil and run-off waters. The top article will also clarify that not all nitrogen is equal. Ordinary nitrogen (N^2 ) is, by itself, mostly harmless. Mankind is producing &quot;reactive nitrogen&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, yes I meant that increased temps increased acidification by raising the saturation point.  However, you point out that that is not the case (though your post leaves me unclear if the warming oceans have a higher or lower saturation of CO2 in them, and what role that plays into Carbonic acid.  I'll read your links tonight though, thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general warmer water is not able to absorb more gas; the relationship between gas solubility and temperature is generally in the opposite direction, although it does reach a maximum and a minimum solubility at some temperature.</p>
<p>This is a table showing the dependence of CO2 solubility on temperature.

<p>And this article talks about the temperature dependence of gas solubility in general.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for explaining what bleaching really is! Didn't know it's the exposure of the corals skeleton and that the algae actually left the coral. But it makes perfect sense that the coral doesn't produce the white color itself and it's due to the lack of micro organisms on it. </p></div>		</li>
