Oops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, thanks. I was never super overweight, but when I hit 175 (at 5’9”) it was kind of a wake up call.<br />
The great boob panic of 2016 happened around when I got down to 135. And that’s how I decided that I’d lost enough. </p></div>		</li>

From there:
A physical examination will typically reveal a firm lump (mass) in one of the testicles. When the health care provider holds a flashlight up to the scrotum, the light does not pass through the lump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I came here to say something similar. Do a breast exam regularly. What I am saying is fondle your breasts regularly.  Get good and handsy with them, don't be afraid. You need to become very familiar with them to notice differences especially small differences so you can hopefully catch an abnormality early. </p>
<p>From personal experience, you will notice something abnormal very quickly if you are familiar with your baseline bumps. </p>
<p>Guys, I already know that most of you are familiar with your testicles but you should get handsy with them and also your own breasts. Men can get breast cancer too. </p>
<p>Also, get handsy with your lady's or man's breasts it is not uncommon for men to notice differences in their significant other's breasts. </p></div>		</li>
