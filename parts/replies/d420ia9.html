<p>As the voltage drops as the batteries die the quartz vibrates at a slower speed, so the internal clock of whatever device is controlling the sound is slower. The pitch lowers as a result. </p>

<p>No</p>
<p>Crystal oscillators are very stable and insensitive to voltage oscillations. That's what they're good at</p>
<p>However, electronics sometimes rely on cheaper oscillators (usually only relying on resistors and capacitors). Those are not stable</p>
<p>Not to mention things that rely on electric motors, these will spin slower if the juice is running out</p></div>		</li>
