<blockquote>
<p>ROME, NOV. 11, 2006 (Zenit) - Here is a translation of a commentary by the Pontifical Household preacher, Capuchin Father Raniero Cantalamessa, on the readings from this Sunday's liturgy.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>On this occasion I would like to treat a theme that is of definite interest not only to widows and widowers but also to all those who are married, especially during this month in which we remember the dead. Does the death of a husband or wife, which brings about the legal end of a marriage, also bring with it the total end of communion between the two persons? Does something of that bond which so strongly united two persons on earth remain in heaven, or will all be forgotten once we have crossed the threshold into eternal life?</p>
<p>One day, some Sadducees presented Jesus with the unlikely case of a woman who was successively the wife of seven brothers, asking him whose wife she would be after the resurrection. Jesus answered: &quot;When they rise from the dead they will neither marry nor be given in marriage but will be like angels in heaven&quot; (Mark 12:25).</p>
<p>Interpreting this saying of Jesus wrongly, some have claimed that marriage will have no follow-up in heaven. But with his reply Jesus is rejecting the caricature the Sadducees presented of heaven, as if it were going to be a simple continuation of the earthly relationship of the spouses. Jesus does not exclude the possibility that they might rediscover in God the bond that united them on earth.</p>
<p>According to this vision, marriage does not come to a complete end at death but is transfigured, spiritualized, freed from the limits that mark life on earth, as also the ties between parents and children or between friends will not be forgotten. In a preface for the dead the liturgy proclaims: &quot;Life is transformed, not taken away.&quot; Even marriage, which is part of life, will be transfigured, not nullified.</p>
<p>But what about those who have had a negative experience of earthly marriage, an experience of misunderstanding and suffering? Should not this idea that the marital bond will not break at death be for them, rather than a consolation, a reason for fear? No, for in the passage from time to eternity the good remains and evil falls away. The love that united them, perhaps for only a brief time, remains; defects, misunderstandings, suffering that they inflicted on each other, will fall away.</p>
<p>Indeed, this very suffering, accepted with faith, will be transformed into glory. Many spouses will experience true love for each other only when they will be reunited &quot;in God,&quot; and with this love there will be the joy and fullness of the union that they did not know on earth. In God all will be understood, all will be excused, all will be forgiven.</p>
<p>Some will ask of course about those who have been legitimately married to different people, widowers and widows who have remarried. (This was the case presented to Jesus of the seven brothers who successively had the same woman as their wife.) Even for them we must repeat the same thing: That which was truly love and self-surrender between each of the husbands or wives, being objectively a good coming from God, will not be dissolved. In heaven there will not be rivalry in love or jealousy. These things do not belong to true love but to the intrinsic limits of the creature.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been a while but the way I would describe it personally...</p>
<p>Relationships in life are like light/fire. The love of your spouse in life is a bonfire right next to you. Bright, hot, passionate etc. Throw in other relationships and their fire analogies however you want. </p>
<p>Then you die. You go to God. Suddenly, that bonfire isn't the brightest fire you've encountered. God's love is like the sun. Like, literally, being next to the sun. You can have that bonfire next to you and it's still a bonfire but... Come on, compare a bonfire to the sun, scale just goes out the window. </p>
<p>This analogy I prefer because it doesn't diminish the bonfire but it keeps the perspective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why has the sun kept me at such a distance for my entire physical/earthbound life? </p>
<p>My husband has supported me through the worst experiences I've ever had, and been the person holding my hand as I experienced the most joyful feelings I've ever had. I do not look forward to someone's version of heaven if his and my bond becomes meaningless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a Catholic perspective, the whole point of marriage is for you to help make your significant other a better individual through love. Emperor Karl of Austria told his wife on their wedding day that they would now have to help each other get to heaven. Marriage, in a Christian sense,  is meant for that one purpose. Overall, Catholics believe that if you die in a state of grace, you shall live fully to witness the beatific vision, which is God, who is love and from where all love we can ever experience or conceive of on this earth originates. Marriage shows us a finite version of that love.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see that &quot;meaningless&quot; term as bad theology on their part (one pastor even claimed that the saints in heaven have no real memory of earthly existence, which to me destroys much of the point.) I see the eternal presence of God as making all good things perfect. So, I can only see it as any goodness in past earthly relationships remains a cherished thing, even if the relationship itself does not carry over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People can lose perspective in front of the veil. Everything that has ever been will be unlike what will ever come after it. this is now, enjoy it. What comes after this will not be anything like this and will not be anything we can describe better than the one. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To all the atheists arguing in the comment string below, keep in mind that just because someone is speaking on religious doctrine, it doesn't mean they're trying to 'biblethump' or 'spew nonsense'</p>

<p>Atheist here, I liked your explanation.</p>
<p>Naturally, I don't have to believe the bits about God; but as an answer to the question, it was really informative.</p></div>		</li>
