			<div class="markdown"><p>When your grandparent uses the same phone they've had since 2002, it's running 2g. When you are in the middle of nowhere with phone signal but no data, chances are it's 2g. It's a slower service only really useful for text and some voice (as we're really good at making voice not use much data), but still very useful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah - 2G occupies the lower range spectrum (800-1000mhz), and in the U.K at least still makes up a part of the backbone of the network. The equipment can be upgraded to be more efficient, and to bring improvements in capacity and speed within the limits of 2G. So better backhaul (underground lines that provide transmission to cell sites), modernising servers in switching centres, and better kit on the actual mast.</p>
<p>ELI5 for the spectrum in use would be that lower frequency means better longer range coverage (often used in rural areas), but less capacity. So it wouldn't take many users in the area before o started noticing your Reddit articles taking longer to load.  Higher range frequencies (e.g. 2600mhz which a lot of 4G runs on) have a lot of capacity but less long range coverage. Because there are more waves in a short area, more people can attach to the waves being beamed out by the mast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was notified by AT&amp;T that one of my devices was 2G and would no longer be supported, and was offered a free 3G replacement.  I don’t remember the last time I saw “EDGE” in my signal meter on my iPhone.  Have they started to get rid of their 2G signals?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really..... the bands individually can be used for pretty much whatever, so the carriers retained ownership and converted them for other services.  AFAIK, 2G backwards compatibility remains, though, where appropriate, so a 2G phone should still work even though a 1G phone will not.</p></div>		</li>
