<p>Humans have only worn clothes for, I think 170,000 years, which is only 30,000 after we developed into what is considered &quot;modern&quot; humans. Before that is the obvious evolutionary stages, with the various species of hominid migrating and crossbreeding and what not.</p>
<p>While I can't say HOW it happened, I know religion played a huge part in our sexual taboos (especially in America, which was settled by what amounted to religious exiles from England [read something a long time ago saying that even they were considered prudish by English standards lol]). Another factor is also probably the varied environments we inhabited in; most every one where we developed was at least somewhat harsh. The deserts of Africa and the Middle East required clothing to help mitigate some damage to the skin (UV rays damage our DNA), while farther north civilizations required heavier clothing to stay warm.</p>
<p>The only environs I know of that didn't require that much clothing are the South Eastern and some of the Midwestern United States and most tropical locations. Again, I can't say why as I don't there's much information on why or how religion developed (or at least none I've seen), but from the amount of stuff I've read relating to naturism that about sums it up lol.</p></div>		</li>
