The Imperial Irrigation District (most of California's Colorado water) sell water to the farmers for $20 per acre foot (about $60 per million gallons), delivered to their fields. They irrigate by flooding the fields, losing lots of water to evaporation (Imperial Valley is one of the hottest places in the country). </p></div>		</li>
