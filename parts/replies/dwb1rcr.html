<p>There's no conclusive evidence for this. This whole thread is begging the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>conclusive evidence for evolutionary traits is generally hard to come by, being discrete events in the past. Even the agent of change itself hardly knows the reasons it is responsible for or responding to. We have to resort to reason and induction.</p>
<p>Evolution is, in some aspects a science of begging the question: The concept that &quot;the fittest are what survives, and what survives is what is fit&quot; is begging the question so hard its tautological. </p>
<p>Among the many physiological reasons why cold water may be perceived as tastier than room temperature water, it is a given that it is either evolutionary beneficial or else at least not disadvantageous. Certainly a predilection for warn or stagnant water has obvious disadvantages given any common knowledge of survival. </p>
<p>so it is fairly safe to say that the best answer for op's question is indeed evolutionary advantage. nothing is ever 100% proven for all of time; science is merely taking the best we can think of and running with it until we learn better.</p></div>		</li>
