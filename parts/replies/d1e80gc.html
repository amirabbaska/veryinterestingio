			<div class="markdown"><p>They're talking about the sum of 1/n, n:={1,2,3,4,...}. The individual terms get smaller and smaller as n gets larger, but the sum still diverges (meaning it grows without bound). Many similar series do not diverge, for example the sum of 1/n^2 . If you leave out any numbers with a 9 in the denominator, the sum converges. Think about it this way: as n gets bigger and bigger, a greater and greater proportion of numbers have a 9 <em>somewhere</em> in their decimal representation. Leaving out these is enough to make the sum converge. The same would be true for any digit, not just 9, by the way.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is similar to how almost all numbers contain the digit 3. Numberphile has a fun little video proving this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The harmonic series is a divergent series, 1+ 1/2 + 1/3 + ... Never converges. On the other hand, if you cut out every summand that has a 9 anywhere in the denominator it will converge. The harmonic series in a sense is &quot;barely divergent&quot; so that if you change it only slightly it will converge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a mathematical description of what barely divergent is? Like, if you were to remove every nth term, it would still diverge. So what degree of polynomial or class of function is necessary that describes the relation of number of terms removed to the position of a term in the series. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whups, I think you misunderstood there.  The smbc comic is not explaining why the golden ratio is showing up, it's saying people attribute things to the golden ratio even when it's not really there.  </p>
<p>For instance, the golden ratio is about 0.618... which is about 0.5.  But whenever people see a pattern of similar things where the next thing is about half the size of the previous thing, they jump to the conclusion that they are seeing the Fibonacci sequence, because they want to.</p></div>		</li>
