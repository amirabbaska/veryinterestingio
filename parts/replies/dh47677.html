			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're looking for a black and white answer. But the reality is very complicated and if handle improperly could have detremantel consequences. For example, not all evidence that is obtained illegally or becomes inadmissible, is because actual intentional malice by the police. Lack of experience, incompetency or misunderstanding of law can be cause for evidence to become inadmissible or the search illegal. But neither of those are criminal in nature and the intent is not there, and thus is why guilty people get away with crimes. So now if they state or courts decided that in those instances, the police would be charged criminally. Then you would have a situation where very few people would be getting convicted or arrested, because the police would be in fear of getting prosectued for improperly gathering evidence. </p>
<p>Also before you say, I would prefer if things were that way. Less people arrested or in jail ect. Just because you haven't been the victim of a crime or know of family that have, doesn't mean you shouldn'tâ€‹consider that. There a lot of crime victims that never recover from certain crimes, from an emotional standpoint. Now imagine, if a loved one was victimized in some way. But the police weren't diligent in collecting evidence for fear that if it was improperly gathered, even by accident, they could face jail time. You could then say well the police were incompetent in their evidence collection, but whose to say they didn't try their best, which is what there Union or attorneys would say.  </p>
<p>It's almost a catch 22 type of situation, which is why the best policy is to not prosecute the police, but instead let the guilty man walk. </p>
<p>For some further research on the correlation between the police, DAs and courts. Look at the current events in Baltimore, before and after the Freddy Gray incident. Baltimore has always had crime, but not to the levels it currently has had, ever since the 6 police officers were arrested. Arrest by the police have plummeted and police are a lot less pro active in there day to day work. The results have been a soaring homicide rate and the current Mayor asking for the FBI to assist. There are other social and economic factors at play in Baltimore, but the change in the way the police act since Freddy Gray cannot be dismissed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I don't think it will affect much either way, but you would need to prove intent in a case like this. so pretty much your first argument is pretty invalid. police unions have damn good lawyers, and if they did not do it intentionally it should be pretty hard to find intent. The 2nd argument relies on the first, and it can also be considered a good thing. Police officers should have more liability for their actions. They have the power to put people in jail, and potentially end a person's life as they know it. If they gather evidence illegally it could have been tampered with since the officer already showed a lack of moral character. If it means they have to be more careful then I don't see an issue with that.</p>
<p>for the whole emotional appeal to victimized families, it's already the case. As a large majority of violent crimes go unsolved in the us. If you think giving victims closure is more important than ensuring the guilty party is actually guilty than I believe you have your priorities a bit mixed up. I also don't think prosecuting law enforcement for this will do much good, but I also don't think it would do much bad either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to add to that there is the effect of the &quot;Blue Wall&quot; Where a police department will stonewall all investigation to protect its own officers. </p>
<p>To even if you bring in an outside agency like a state level police, or even the FBI the department is likely to become more tight lipped than the mafia.  </p>
<p>The Captains and the Chief of Police are motivated to stonewall because having officers committing illegal acts under ther watch makes them look bad, could even see them fired or prosecuted right along side the offending officer.  They have almost no incentive to cooperate and every incentive to make it &quot;go away.&quot; </p>
<p>And the officers, if one guy is doing it, they all are.  They have incentive to cover for each other because the guy facing charges might know times they themselves  have committed questionable acts.  The officers have a stressful enough job in their mind, and so they will readily agree to present a stonewall if it means not having to be looking over their shoulder every day for &quot;procedure crap.&quot;  Its also basic human nature.  Humans are programmed to be loyal to their group, and to pressure others to maintain their loyalty.  </p>
<p>This is why its very, very difficult to officers disciplined when they commit even the MOST egregious and permanent violation of rights: they kill a person they had no cause to kill.   </p>
<p>But throwing the evidence out of court is much softer, easier, and far more effective system.  It completely side steps the blue wall factor and removes nearly all of incentive to violate the rights.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemical spill is a good example of shady compagny... There was/is a law that say that the fine can't be higher than 1 million dollard, including the cleanup cost. The shady compagny emptied a few citern of chemical, over a long periode of time. They got caugh 3 times. Each citern cost a few millions to dispose of proprelly. They saved a shitload of money by draining it illegally.. At the third confiction, the judge said that the next time it would be jail time. I do not know if they continued, the article said that the jail time may not be legal actually...</p></div>		</li>
