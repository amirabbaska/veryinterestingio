			<div class="markdown"><p>From the west to the east. It wasn't in the same plane as the equator since it launched from Florida. That means even if it moved due east at launch it would still wind up at an angle relative to the equator. (If you ever see diagrams of orbits on TV or in movies that's why they look like sin waves across the map).</p>
<p>Most things in orbit will go from west to east because that's the direction the Earth rotates so spacecraft have a bit of a 'natural boost' in that direction. To go truly polar they have to cancel it out, and to go retrograde (from east to west) they have to cancel it out and add it back in the opposite direction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also though if you look at the center of mass its slightly towards the shuttle compared to the engines center of thrust meaning that the slow curve to sideways is more natural, reducing the energy required to put it in that position</p></div>		</li>

<p>That way the tank (which is going to break up and fall in the ocean 8 minutes after launch) eats most of the wear and tear while protecting the orbiter, which is far more delicate and contains even more delicate humans in it.</p>

<p>It doesn't really work like that.  The Shuttle flew upside in order to have a net positive load factor.  Don't forget, the wings are also generating lift.  Since the Shuttle flew upside down, it had to rotate varying amounts depending on the desired orbital inclination.</p></div>		</li>
