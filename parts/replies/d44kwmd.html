			<div class="markdown"><p>Still lower, much more of your energy is converted into forward movement. Humans are very efficient at walking but that still requires balance you just don't notice because you are used to it.</p>
<p>Also in any gate a large portion of energy is required to get the other foot in front so you don't fall over, in skateboarding you intermittently push and do need to expand energy to take advantage of the push you just coast.  That's where the savings comes from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something i havnt seen talked about is hills.  Going up a hill on inline skates(the proper term. Rollerblade is a brand, just like kleenex is to tissue paper), or a bicycle uses more energy than walking depending on the grade, because you have to overcome fluid, rolling friction of wheels instead of the solid, static friction from feet.  On the contrart, goinging downhill on skates or a bike is vastly more effecient, and uses less energy than walking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, if the rolling resistance of the ground is high enough or the terrain terrible then yes it would be more efficient to walk/step up a hill, for moderate grades  most likely encountered on a commute that is not the case as with a gate you have to expel energy every step to put a foot infront of you vice intermittently pushing and rolling. Of course going down hill (or downwind) can take little to no energy as gravity+ wind will push you.</p>
<p>It's all pretty intuitive to a human too if you're trying to ride your bike up a steep hill you'll generally get off and walk it if it feels like less work, that's the cross over point.</p></div>		</li>
