			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I also remembering correctly that birds nesting in branches and near the trunks of large trees gain some benefits from thermal radiation from the tree itself? I believe the line of thought was that near the trunks of cedar/spruce etc there is some heat loss during cooler temps as the tree gives off a little bit of heat absorbed by the sun that day. I didn't consider it to be a sweat box under there for a Chickadee but I could see the logic behind it and with fluffed feathers, torpor, and a cozy nest in some spruce branches near the trunk where sunlight shines all day, it certainly seems preferable to nesting in an exposed deciduous tree for the winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also how many hummingbirds survive the night even in places where it's not necessarily freezing. Their little metabolisms are so fast that they can starve to death within hours if not constantly feeding. Torpor makes it possible for them to sleep through the night without dying of starvation by morning.</p></div>		</li>
