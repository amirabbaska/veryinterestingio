			<div class="markdown"><p>While I absolutely respect Harari and genuinely enjoyed &quot;Sapiens,&quot; I think he's demonstrably wrong about humans making the jump from prey to predator overnight.  Everything from the fossil record and what we know about non-human primate behavior indicates that our ancestors were opportunistic omnivores for hundreds of thousands of years at the bare minimum, but probably much longer.  </p>
<p>Add to that the fact that every single large predator you mention would have been a prey species not much earlier than the late Pleistocene at latest --when there were much bigger versions of wolves, bears and lions-- and you can see Harari's argument doesn't really hold much water.  (University of Montana Biologist/historian Dan Flores, for example, convincingly argues that North American black bears instinctively avoid unforested land not out of fear of modern grizzlies or wolves --which might chase them off, but hardly see them as prey-- but rather as a genetically encoded response to the presence of giant predators such as the short-faced bear or the saber-toothed cats.)     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats very interesting I didnt know about that. I suppose it might be more accurate to say that its on a purely biological level? Because the predatory advantage of humans is numbers and tools - but alone with no weapons...? I dont know, Im really not educated enough on this topic to be completely honest. </p></div>		</li>
