			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes exactly. Often, it's not the pathogen itself that causes all the damage and horrible symptoms, it's the body's immune response. The immune system produces inflammatory mediators to enable other immune cells to get to the source of infection quicker and generally help protect the body from further infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So should I be blowing my nose or just let it drip out and catch the drips?  Does the constant production of mucus slow the the immune system?  Also I should be drinking extra water ?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Staying hydrated is important overall and you can blow your nose if it improves your overall comfort. </p>
<p>Most over the counter medicines you take work at helping you relieve the symptoms you experience, but don't actively &quot;fight&quot; the thing you are fighting. </p>
<p>As others have pointed out, there are bugs that can swim through this mucus, but it will capture most and then expel it as it drips out.</p></div>		</li>
