			<div class="markdown"><p>So to a human male, a given testosterone level offers various benefits and impediments depending on the situation, right? Should a guy worry about actively maintaining a theoretical optimum level of testosterone? (Too low and perhaps it affects your competitiveness. Too high and it starts to impede your logic functions (like the game theory example you gave)). Is this even the right way to think about this subject? (I am no way knowledgeable on these things so this may sound pseudoscience).
Edit: actively maintain testosterone via diet and exercise; not direct intake in any form (pills etc)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's an interesting way of thinking that testosterone offers benefits and impediments-- what I'm describing are general trends, correlations between testosterone and behavior.</p>
<p>In the fatherhood study that I mentioned, these were babies. I don't know of any studies done on paternal involvement in kids or adolescents. But evolutionary, perhaps testosterone offered a trade-off; men with higher testosterone were more likely/better able to defend the family, but men with lower testosterone were better caretakers and nurturers. I think the idea of an &quot;optimal&quot; level of testosterone is a little beyond the scope of what I'm saying.</p>
<p>Also, testosterone fluctuates. I mentioned that men with higher testosterone preferred more feminine faces. This experiment tested the <em>same</em> men across two weeks (I think? Its been a while). So the same man, when he had higher testosterone levels, preferred more feminine women. This is to say that testosterone levels vary naturally anyways, and what I'm describing are again just general trends. A cool fun fact about this study btw is the men were also asked to rate the attractiveness of male faces, and changes in testosterone didn't affect how attractive they percieved more/less masculine male faces to be.</p>
<p>Anyways, I don't think it's fair to say that any of these are &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; things. For example, is a more competitive/confrontational demeanor bad? Who's to say? </p>
<p>Sometimes extremes can be bad for people. Men with hypogonadism (lower functioning testes/less testosterone) have low libido levels, which is bad, but this is fixed through giving someone testosterone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A big thankyou for indulging us with these detailed comments. On the &quot;whos to say&quot; part, yes i agree but with the question i had that led me to ask this i am having difficulty in translating the idea in my mind into text. Anyways, another topic: mystics. You know how in many mystic practices you have to deny yourself everything. It had occurred to me before that since their self-denial will lead to low levels of testosterone (and other things that make a mystic less suspectable to emotions and hormones), perhaps there is a link between the idea of mystical &quot;enlightenment&quot; and the  ability to be more logical (having perfect game theory). Perhaps there is a clue here that denying yourself of hormones/emotions may have some benefits like giving you extreme logical/mental/observational prowess. Again very pseudoscience and not really a question. But what are your views that perhaps self denial may have certain extreme benefits in the brain department.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will read this but before i do, should you push its levels? It clearly makes it more likely that you will sometimes make illogical decisions (bad game theory). I have read your other comment where you mentioned that it makes you take risks. This again causes concern because it is not always logical to take risks. I am purely speaking this with game theory in mind. (Not a commentary on societal practice).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was originally going to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm going with: probably!</p>
<p>The same way that if you blast your pump-up-music of choice while lifting you'll also get better gains.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But then I thought:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Music will increase adrenaline, which will improve short term &gt;performance.  But I don't know if testosterone level <em>during</em> lifting matters at all, and I suspect the level <em>afterwards</em>, during recovery matters more to producing gains. #notabiologistorendocrinologist</p>
