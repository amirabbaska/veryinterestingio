			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine an atom located near, but not inside a strong magnetic field. Now, a photon hits the atom, bumps an outer electron off and sends it flying so that's it's motion is perpendicular to the magnetic field. </p>
<p>Originally the electron had a known spin, which was also perpendicular to the magnetic field, but once it enters that field it will change to be either up or down with respect to the field, effectively rotating the electron 90 or -90 degrees. </p>
<p>I would assume that the rotation of the electron would take some amount of energy, correct? Where does this energy come from? Is it provided by the magnet, and if so, how does the magnet know how much energy is needed to rotate it so that it aligns with the field? I am still assuming that the energy required to rotate the particle is dependant on how much the particle is rotated (rotating it 30 degrees would require less energy that rotating it 60).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever energy the electron gains during the process comes from the photon. If there’s a spin-flip in addition to knocking the electron out of its bound state, and the degeneracy of the magnetic substates is broken by a magnetic field, then there will be an energy absorbed or released by the spin flip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An electron's spin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics\)#Direction" target="_blank">is <strong>always</strong> either parallel or antiparallel</a> (opposite direction) with respect to <em>all</em> directions. This is independent of any magnetic fields, that may or may not be present. The spin is never at a 90° angle (or 30° or 60°) to anything, but it <em>can</em> be in a superposition of parallel + antiparallel, with some complex amplitudes.</p>
<p>If the spin is parallel in the X direction, it is in a superposition of parallel+antiparallel in the Y direction. If it's parallel in the Y direction, there will be a superposition in the X direction. That's what's known as uncertainty principle: not all observables are determined at the same time by the same state.</p>
<p>So when the electron enters the magnetic (gradient) field, the dipole moment of the spin will result in a force on the electron, sensitive to the spin state along to the field lines. In general, this will be a superposition, so the parallel-spin component of the electron experiences a different force than the antiparallel-spin component. The electron will be in a superposition of two different trajectories. The spin is not &quot;rotated&quot; though, the spin state of the electron stays the same when entering the field. Only after a measurement the state of the electron spin will be purely parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field, and the &quot;true&quot; trajectory of the particular electron is determined.</p>
<p>A great demonstration of these effects is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment" target="_blank">Stern-Gerlach experiment</a>. It is usually implemented with an uncharged particle though, to make the deflection less complicated.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Isn't this only true with respect to attempts to measure the spin in a direction?</p>
<p>Clearly in a permanent magnet the spins must be aligned with the bulk magnetic field and so have a single direction?</p></div>		</li>
