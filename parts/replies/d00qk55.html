<p>But most ceramics have very low thermal conductivity, making them unsuited as a thermal conduit to transfer heat from the radioisotopic core.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is inconsequential. Because energy is conserved, if the radioactive core outputs 100 W of heat then the entire sphere must output 100 W of heat, ceramic or metal. (Assuming the rate of radioactive decay is not affected by temperature)</p>
<p>The only thing that would be affected by thermal resistance is the temperature gradient in the sphere, as described by the equation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conductivity" target="_blank">q = -k grad(T)</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, no doubt there are plenty of ceramics that can achieve higher melting points. Would density factor in though? Are these ceramics denser than tungsten? </p></div>		</li>

<p>Design scientific probes capable of operating inside molten iron. Use nuclear explosives (!) to create a large borehole down to the mantle, and quickly dump several thousand tons of molten iron into it (before it collapses). Hope that the blob of iron sinks down to the core, carrying the probes with it. Alas, nobody's been willing to fund such research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't using enough nuclear explosives to displace enough crust to get to the mantle (5-40km) send a shitload of earth into the atmosphere, ushering in an ice age? Doesn't sound like a very well thought out plan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read a paper on this a while ago.  It was estimated that it could make it something like a few hundred km into the mantle, but not the core.  Also it wouldn't be a hole, because it would fill in as it melted down.  Still really impressive though.  Has been proposed as a way to dispose of highly radioactive waste  It's a great idea actually, but try selling melting down into the earth with a huge radioactive ball to the public.  They would probably think it would cause earthquakes or volcano eruptions or some stupid shit like that. </p></div>		</li>
