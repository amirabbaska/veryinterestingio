			<div class="markdown"><p>That gross blob is congealed blood :) It's not a liquid, it's gelled up, that's coagulation. Blood is mostly water though, so it can dry out, but it's not drying out that stops the bleeding, it's the clotting action of the blood, which works even under water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't seem to work <em>as well</em>, though, probably because the blood is carried away as it comes out instead of drying?</p>
