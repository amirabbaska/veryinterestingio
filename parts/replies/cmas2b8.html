			<div class="markdown"><p>Just as with the Doppler effect with sound - it's a shift in frequency, not speed. The sound of a moving siren changes in apparent frequency to a stationary observer, but the speed of the sound hasn't changed. For example, the sound of a car coming toward you is still traveling at Mach 1, not Mach 1 + 100 km/h.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Colour is frequency in light, not speed. Like sound Doppler effect, when you move relative to a frequency source, you experience that frequency shift, regardless of the overall propagation speed. Your velocity affects how the frequency is perceived.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And increased frequency represents increased energy. And coincidently just the right amount to account for the energy increase due to the emitter already moving, thus keeping with the conservation of energy.</p>
<p>Everything ties together...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the Doppler effect doesn't actually rely on differing relative velocities of the wave in question. The relativistic Doppler effect is just the same equation that applies to sound waves, with an additional factor to correct for time dilation. When the relative velocity is small, this factor vanishes.</p></div>		</li>
