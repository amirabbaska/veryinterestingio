<p>The claim is that there's so much specialized knowledge in Dentistry that it would be a waste of time to spend years on rotations through the other hospital wards when you could be studying advanced periodontics or removable or whatever else</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably the most concrete reason. Most med students don't know what they want to practice until they get through their rotations. By spending four years to gain a foundation of the entire human body and US medical system, you're prepared to take on whatever residencies you can qualify for. With dentistry, you're saying from the get-go &quot;I only give a shit about teeth, and I know I'll only ever give a shit about teeth, so don't give me the four year grand tour&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol not even close. That's like comparing a car mechanic to a car washer. The med students KNOW they want to study the entire body PLUS specialization. You can't separate the two, you have to know your area plus the entire body, this is how medicine works. Dentists, well, they know the teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. Dental school focuses heavily on medicine. You cannot be a competent dentist without knowing anatomy and physiology. Quite a few dental schools are fully integrated with medical school and you take all the same classes for the first two years. </p></div>		</li>

Seriously, if I need brain surgery the government will cover it 100%, but if I have a dental issue, without my private insurance I could be paying $1000 out of pocket for that shit easily. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>BC tried a gov't-paid dental plan in the 90s and it went bankrupt in 2 years. Many people seriously neglect their teeth and the cost of rehabilitating them can be tens of thousands of dollars. If everyone put honest effort in to their hygiene then you could socialize dentistry, but I have not seen the will-power on the part of patients to even floss regularly. I have seen patients who have not been to the dentist at all in 15+ years and their teeth and gums are perfectly fine because they are meticulous with their homecare.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're essentially comparing a stereo installation place with a car mechanic.</p>
<p>Its easy to know that your stereo installation is going to cost $200, cause for the most part all the factors have been accounted for. You have a cavity, you either fill it, or you extract the tooth.</p>
<p>A diabetic patient coming into your office cause &quot;his chest hurts&quot; is like going to a mechanic and saying &quot;my car is making a noise&quot;.</p>
<p>You expect to come to the mechanic and say &quot;my car is making a noise&quot; and for him to tell you that it's going to be $500 to fix the problem without opening the hood?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost. A dentist in my experience charges for an exam to find out the treatment required. For some reason it's much cheaper than getting a mechanic to diagnose a problem, something that appears to be impossible most of the time. They end up replacing shit until something fixes it and half the time break something nearby in the process. I am glad the two are not aligned in my experience or I'd have no teeth left by now, possibly with an aftermarket jaw. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right that dentistry is less diagnosis and more hands-on work, which is why a lot of people who are in dentistry are indeed in it (they want to work with their hands on a daily basis), but that doesn't mean that it isn't involved. We don't rely on patients to come in to tell us what they want, because most of the time, patients can't really tell what's going on, or misinterpret what's happening inside their mouth. Comprehensive treatment planning can get quite complex, and especially with certain fields of dentistry like orthodontics, you're paying the dentist more for their ability to plan your treatment properly than the physical work being done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was kind of weird reading this as a Canadian, I've always thought of the dentist as expensive, but for people living in the U.S. it probably is pretty reasonable compared to other medical care. There is a big difference in perspective, I think &quot;man, that dental appointment was $100&quot; while someone else might think &quot;at least that appointment was only $100&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of but not quite. Dental Therapists would theoretically be allowed to do operative all by themselves, which means administering anesthesia, drilling on teeth and then filling them. In some cases, they would even be doing things like extractions of baby teeth and pulpectomies which are pretty invasive. Currently, expanded function dental assistants can place amalgams, but can't prep teeth and can't administer anesthesia. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Physician ~ Dentist</p>
<p>Physician's Assistant ~ Dental Therapist</p>
<p>RN ~ Expanded Function Dental Assistant</p>
<p>Nurse ~ Dental Assistant</p>
<p>(Hopefully nobody will be offended by the comparisons. I'm probably wrong but I expect the clarification will be enlightening.)</p>
<p>Edit: Looks like I should have put &quot;Nurse Practitioner&quot; in place of &quot;RN&quot;. I told you I'd be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just out of curiosity. What's your take on expanded function techs? I'm currently an EFT in the military, but i'm seperating in July and will be moving on to finish up some core courses for a year before applying to as many dental schools as I can reasonably afford. Would I be able to get a job pretty easily in the civilian world as an EFT, or even just a regular assistant with my 5 years experience in the field? I just think it would be helpful to have that secondary income along with my GI bill while finishing up my pre-req's.</p></div>		</li>
