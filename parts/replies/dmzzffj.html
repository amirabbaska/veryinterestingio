			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to put my dog to sleep recently. He was old and his heart was weak so the injection took a lot longer to complete the procedure.
The Vet checked for a pulse and noticed it was still going even after my dog stoped breathing. The Vet assured us my dogs brain was gone but I can't help but wonder if that was just a well intentioned lie to spare us more pain. I shudder to think what he would have been like without sedation. </p>
<p>Thank you for you job, I can't imagine it's easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was actually fairly common.  It's hard for the vets at the shelter, but for sure I imagine it's harder for them to do at a clinic when the owner is there because they want to make it easy for the pet and the owner, but sometimes the pet is stronger.  </p>
<p>Sorry for your loss.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had to put our 18 y.o. Schnautzer - Kees cross down a few years ago. He got up seconds after the injection, started puking like crazy, ran around howling, clearly in pain, his neck got all swollen, he started excreting foam from his mouth until the vet finally stepped in and gave him the lethal dose right on the spot. It was the most horrifying scene I ever witnessed to that day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was there when my neighbor put her dog down. I saw panic in his eyes, but he was immobilized. I really don't think it was peaceful for him and there was nothing to do but try to soothe and reassure
the dog as it happened and hope the whole process completed as soon as possible. I really don't think she even noticed it and I would never tell her that I suspect that's what happened.</p></div>		</li>
