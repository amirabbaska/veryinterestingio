<p>Real question: how long would this proccess take before it became a full tree again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tree doesn't really grow back in to a full tree. The core of a tree is dead anyway so any extra growth is going to be small branches from the sides of the stump. The tree will become more of a bush.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not necessarily the case.   Each of those sprouts can (in most species anyway) grow back to be a full sized tree if given enough time.  </p>
<p>On the college campus where I work, for example, there was a big wildfire in the 40's (before the college was there).  It burned a number of oak trees down to the roots.  Now their descendants are full grown oak trees, and you can still see how a cluster of 3-4 trunks emerge in a cluster around where the original tree was and all merge a bit at the base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever visited a redwood grove, you may have noticed that the trees often grow in circles, called fairy rings. These are the result of an ancient tree that died, but a ring of stump sprouts formed around the old trunk from the still living root system and eventually several of the sprouts grew into huge trees in their own right. In the best groves, you can sometimes even find evidence of multiple generations of this kind of ring growth, tracing back possibly several thousand of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interestingly, this regrowth behavior will even occur in saplings. it's most noticeable in a beaver-inhabited area - after the beavers have chewed down saplings, they will sprout several new limbs and regrow foliage. makes the tree's appearance pretty crazy if it survives. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coppicing and pollarding are two similar techniques that take advantage of this, they were used for a long time to make thin straight branches for fences. You can go to Europe and still find trees that show evidence of being coppiced a long, long time ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay I’ll try to explain but I’m not so good at it, water is pulled through the stem through the ‘sticky’ nature of water molecules anywhere where there is evaporation in an enclosed space like a tube the water molecules will pull the next one along so essentially if you have any evaporative surface the water will be sucked out of the tube. There is also a small pushing power that helps from water entering the roots. Generally leaves just create a higher surface area and are an adapted surface for water and gas exchange. </p></div>		</li>
