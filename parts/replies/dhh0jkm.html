			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, if you have a Rolls Royce, it is unlikely to be your only vehicle, so you can deal with a little less reliability. You are also probably (hopefully) ponying up for the high dollar service to maintain it, so you are probably not going to be sitting on the side of the road waiting for AAA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father in law used to own a Rolls Royce, and apparently the one time it broke down, it was picked up in 20 minutes and put into the back of a covered lorry. Most cars get towed away, but you'll rarely see anything that costs upwards of 100k on the back of a tow truck </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about them being unreliable. They're fairly easy to work on - pre 2004 anyway. There is surprisingly little to them apart from the craftsmanship of the interior and the overall fit and finish. But compared to an equivalent model year of just about anything else, they are luxurious but low tech.</p>
<p>Even the spiritual successor, the Bentley Mulsanne, isn't jammed with tech in the way an S class is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always necessarily a &quot;work of art&quot; but always low production numbers. If the production numbers are low, then the labor force used in manufacturing is likely not too big. Machines require people to maintain them as well, and the labor required to do that is twice as expensive. So what do ya do, employ 150 hourly employees (also a decently significant local employer) or switch to robots and take a significant PR hit, spend ten's of millions on machines, and hire/retrain at least 20 more operators that are then twice as expensive as the previous labor force? Machines still use electricity too, and a hell of a lot at that. It's not worth it in the end.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly it. You're paying for creativity and craftsmanship. </p>
<p>Not just cars but look at the diy sub here. A robot could never create the one of a kind creations people are doing there, at least not yet. Sure, it could create the most perfect flat board, but selecting a beautiful piece of lumber with just the right grains and edgings for a coffee table are what makes it a work of art and valuable.</p>
<p>The warranty bit I do disagree with some. There's a episode of 'comedians, coffee, and cars' where Seinfeld and Leno are cruising in a 50s hand hammered Porsche. Obviously no warranty and super expensive, but you'd never find that today. Hence the price tag and also extremely limited quantity. </p></div>		</li>
