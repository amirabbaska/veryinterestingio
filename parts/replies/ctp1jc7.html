			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew a cashier at a lunch diner who was blind. If I remember right we just told him what we were buying and he entered the prices in his register. Nobody was a dick about it. If he was handed a bill and told it was more than a dollar bill, he'd hold it up ask those around him. &quot;Bill check!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's a five, Harvey!&quot; could be heard around the room. Good system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard the stories of how he had all of his bottles marked and organized.  There's still some pictures hanging in the place of the old bar (it's a pizza shop now) and you can tell there was some kind of system in place.  He also apparently could tell any whiskey apart by taste.  Anyway, I'm assuming he dropped a shot or two of real whiskey in an empty bottle and filled it up.  </p></div>		</li>
