			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat different, but this reminds me of the Miller-Eurey experiment which recreated in small scale the conditions believed were around when life was created. So despite your glass dome sounding like a terrible idea, chances are that it would be possible and would be of scientific merit!</p></div>		</li>
