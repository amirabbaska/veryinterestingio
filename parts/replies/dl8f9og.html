			<div class="markdown"><p>So, gravity would be like a curve in the road? Like, of two people had the same distance to cover in a race, but one person's track had a huge bend, they'd end up taking longer to finish, despite both racers' start and finish line being the same distance?</p>
<p>Edit: Hell, just another crazy thought to add. The distance is still technically the same, right? So we could conceivably measure the distance of the racers' tracks by segments of concrete, and while each one has say, ten segments that make up their track, the gravity-bent track is still longer, despite the same number of segments to it, complete with cracks you don't step on lest you break your mother's back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly right, yes. The only difference is that we don't actually see the curve, it still looks straight to us.</p>
<p>Edit - I've just seen your other comment about ageing. If the track in the road represents a persons life then the bend would slow them down, relative to a straight road, and they wouldn't age as quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. And, just to confirm, continuing with this racing analogy, even if both racers' started at the same time, they wouldn't finish at the same time, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bit lost with this. Just because my frame of reference is different from yours, if I'm traveling at the speed of light, wouldn't we still age together? While it seems minutes for me and years you? All that's changing is our perception of time, right? Or does that also mean we will age in the normal time within our respective reference frames?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Say you have 2 people, one on Earth and therefore inside Earth's gravity well and one outside Earth's gravity well. Would time pass at different rates for each person? Like would 5 minutes perceived by the person outside Earth's gravity well be different than 5 minutes perceived by the person inside Earth's gravity well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The experience wouldn't differ for each person, but the idea is that time dilation alters how long, say, a minute lasts. Interstellar had a scene take place on a planet near a black hole, and an hour on the planet was like seven years up in orbit. They spent three hours on the planet I think, but to the guy up on their ship, he had to wait years for them to come back, yet a hour was still an hour to him.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, time would run differently.  The GPS satellite clocks run faster then ground-based clocks.  (They gain about 38 microseconds per day)</p>
<p>You sometimes hear that the GPS system needs to take this difference into account, but that's a myth, as GPS receivers don't have atomic clocks.  (Google &quot;gps relativity myth&quot; to see the details.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but only dramatic speed differences begin to be enough for us humans to see or sense it. We know that even someone in an airliner experiences time differently than someone on the ground, albeit an incredibly tiny amount. The faster you go, the more your mass increases, and the bigger that difference becomes. Your personal 'space/time' slows relative to someone not going that speed. So, go fast enough to reach even the nearest stars in a few years, thousands
will go by for those you left behind who are standing (relatively) still.
Everyone involved still 'experiences' time the same as always. Strange but true. Its a wacky Universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a beautiful explanation, and it's also completely wrong. (I created a reddit account just to write this comment). Though (roughly speaking) close to a massive object the time slows down AND the distances are expanded, it is only the time slow-down that contributes to the ... time slow-down. (non-eli5: the space-time metric is approximatively -(1+2Φ)dt^2 + (1-2Φ)dx^2, where Φ is the potential, which is negative) </p>
<p>It's actually the time slow-down that causes the gravity, i.e. the time slow-down will make other objects to accelerate towards our object, as they try to move along a straight line (geodesic) in the space-time. (For objects with high speed the space expansion also contributes to the attraction, but for bodies in the solar system it's negligible (except for the bending of the light rays)).</p>
<p>tldr: Don't believe beautiful eli5 explanations without further investigation - they may be upvoted purely because of their beauty and not because of their truth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you explain this further?  I don't get it, and since you are absolutely refuting OP (saying he has it backwards, right?) I wish I could get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/6p0f9i/gravity_and_the_curving_of_space/dklqz4d/" target="_blank">explain</a> it in another thread. Anyway, I can confirm that mrwth is right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try: a &quot;straight line&quot; ( = a geodesic) between two points on a curved surface (say on a sphere) can be described as the curve  that it shortest among all the curves connecting those two points (a piece of the equator would be a geodesic on the surface of the Earth). </p>
<p>In general relativity it is the space-time (a 4-dimensional space combining the space and the time) which is curved. [This would require more explanation to make it understandable.] A particle becomes a curve in the space-time (the positions of the particle at all times; the points of the space-time are called &quot;events&quot;, as they are positions together with a time), which is called the worldline of the particle. If a particle is freely moving, its worldline is a geodesic. The &quot;length&quot; of this geodesic between two of its events is the time that elapses for the particle between these 2 events in its life. For not-so-important technical reasons (the geometry of the space-time is somewhat different, being &quot;pseudo-Riemannian&quot; rather than &quot;Riemannian&quot;) a geodesic will have longest (rather than shortest) possible &quot;length&quot;, so it will prefer to stay farther away from the massive body (because close to the body the time is slowed down), so it's worldline will be bent towards the worldline of the body.</p>
<p>I understand that this explanation is incomplete (it just makes no sense without understanding how the &quot;experienced&quot; (= proper) time depends also on the speed of the particle, i.e. that large speeds also slow down the proper time, though for small speeds this dependence is small). It's not an eli5. What I really wanted to say it that OP's explanation is simply wrong - even though it is very eli5ish. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get why time has to slow down.</p>
<p>If two light beams are fired, and one gets affected by gravity to curve towards its final destination (some receiver/detector) and the other is fired straight unaffected by gravity, I can see how distance increases due to gravity.</p>
<p>But why does time have to slow down? Why can't it just be that the light affected by gravity arrives later because it covered more distance?</p>
<p>C = 300,000kp/s</p>
<p>D1 = 330,000 km (with gravity-induced curve)
D2 = 300,000 km (straight line)</p>
<p>It takes 1 second for light to cover D2 and 1.1 second for light to cover D1 - but that's because the distance is longer, not because time had to slow down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a difference between the actual distance travelled and our observer perception of how much distance has been travelled.</p>
<p>The actual distance is longer than the perceived distance, we don't perceive the curve. To make up for this difference, time has to slow down for the observer.</p></div>		</li>
