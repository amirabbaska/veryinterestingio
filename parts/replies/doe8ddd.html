			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has, on occasion, hosted a WebEx session for someone in India, who in turn is controlling a server in the U.S, - light speed lag is very real<br />
For clarity, here's the path my mouse click takes in those scenarios:   </p>
<ol>
<li>From me in Texas to the WebEx server somewhere probably in the Northeast.   </li>
<li>From the WebEx server to the opposite side of the world in India.   </li>
<li>From India all the way back around the world to the server here Stateside.  </li>
<li>Then back to India again.   </li>
<li>Then back to the WebEx server.   </li>
<li>Then back to me.<br />
One mouse click and it's response, traveling the equivalent of around the planet - twice.<br />
The lag is lethal<br />
Yes, sometimes there are better ways to do this, but occasionally network firewall rules prevent all of the saner options.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, due to TIR (Total Internal Refraction), the speed of data in a cable is not 3x10^8 m/s^-1 but actually 2x10^8 m/s^-1 ie. about 2/3 of the speed. When you take this into account, you get pretty close to the actual ping times we see in practise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(nitpick: <em>m/s^-1</em> simplifies to <em>ms</em>. I think you went one too far there.)</p></div>		</li>

As for pc, quake1 sniping with 800ms ping was quite an experience, definition of leading shots.</p></div>		</li>
