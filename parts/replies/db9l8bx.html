<p>However you can still get Eye Fatigue (or Tired eyes) by spending too much time in front of the PC. It can be considered bad eyesight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is a good point.  It doesn't have to be the far off distance or anything (for clarification).  Just looking around the room and having your eyes focus in and out on things will break up the straining monotony of staring at the screen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes you are quite correct. TV screens do not permanently damage your eyesight. You must look at something far away to make eye strain go away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep totally agree with this theory. I drive as my job and at the end of the day my eyes are always fine. Spend a bit too much time on the laptop or phone, anything with a screen really and I get vision ghosting and a noticeable decline in vision</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This raises the question of how did people see for the millions of years before eyeglasses were invented.  Were they just nearsighted/farsighted and just hunter/gathered without needing any precision?  Did they just die?  Or is the modern lifestyle and use of spectacles fixing but also causing the problems?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gotta say, my nearsightedness is pretty fucking bad, but you learn to adjust. I can't be as certain as I am with my contacts, but I can usually figure out what I'm looking at by the kind of blurry it is.</p>
<p>They were also probably more likely to be gatherers, for kind of the same reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had the same question. I read that there is a lot more nearsightedness among young adults now than there used to be, and that lack of exposure to sunlight during childhood is now thought to be responsible for the rise in nearsightedness, as children spend lots of time inside at school and at home on indoor play. The sunlight is theorized (or maybe proved by now) to play an important role in the development of the eye. The Philippines started a public service campaign to encourage children to study outdoors for this reason, and if I recall correctly they've seen good results so far. The previous thought was that close-work was responsible for the rise in nearsightedness (such as looking at the tv and other things that aren't very far away, like the walls of your house), but that thought has now been replaced with the sunlight one. I wish I could find the original article because it was very good.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Farsightedness in young people is relatively rare.  Nearsightedness in hunter-gatherer societies is also rather rare.  Both rates are low enough that social supports generally accommodated affected individuals.  </p>
<p>As countries modernize the rate of nearsightedness significantly increases.  A correlation with literacy rates led to a theory that significant time reading caused the increase, but a number of studies have failed to prove that link.  </p>
<p>Another theory is that there is something about spending lots of time outdoors that supports development of healthy vision in children.  The correlation here is pretty good, but they are still investigating what exactly it could be about being outdoors that helps vision, so we still are not really sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The film, Unforgiven really points out quite a few things.  One, the young bounty hunter has shitty eyesight.  Westerns always make the heroes laser-precise in vision/aim.  They probably were more like stormtroopers, and only the talented and very lucky ones survived.</p></div>		</li>
