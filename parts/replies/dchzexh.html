			<div class="markdown"><p>You can use anything as long as the mass is sufficient. Lead is used because it's relatively easy to make and use a lead apron, for instance, and since lead has a high atomic number it will block a lot of radiation per unit of volume. </p>
<p>But really in theory you could construct a wall of french toast to protect you from gamma rays, it would just depend on how much radiation we're talking about (and of course how much french toast). </p></div>		</li>

<p>How much french toast would I need to protect myself from an xray machine?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm submitting my proposal to the government today.   Except I'll call it &quot;freedom toast&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Industrial radiographer here, I X-ray airplane parts and have also done some gamma work with iridium and cobalt isotopes.  We use primarily lead because you can get away with thinner sheets when working with x and gamma radiation.  We also use concrete, leaded glass, beryllium glass, other  dense metals, etc.  half and tenth value layers are how you would calculate the reduction in dose vs thickness of shielding.  Oftentimes tungsten is used to collimate the radiation beams to control and aim the radiation as isotopic sources emit gamma rays 360 degrees</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To shield against electromagnetic radiation below energies which can produce electromagnetic showers, you just want something with high Z. X-rays will interact primarily via the photoelectric effect. They could use leaded glass to attenuate them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are standards for radiation from sources to workers and the general public. The manufacturers of these detectors have to keep that in mind while designing a system to ensure 10cfr20 limits or other applicable limits are met. This means shielding around the X ray scanners along with occasional maintenance which includes a check of how much radiation is escaping the device. </p>
<p>In the nuclear power industry, we have much stricter controls for radiation exposure. At my plant we actually have radiation badges attached to the side of the X ray machines which get checked regularly to ensure there is no unnecessary exposure outside of the machine. We have security continuously manning the X-rays just like at an airport. The X-ray scanners are just well built. </p></div>		</li>
