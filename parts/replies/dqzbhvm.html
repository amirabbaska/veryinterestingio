			<div class="markdown"><p>To add a bit more, some parts of the world apparently recognise 3 or 6 seasons.</p>
<p>In some tropical regions, they classify: wet season, dry season, and mild season.</p>
<p>In parts of India, Hindus often refer to: spring, summer, monsoon, early winter, and prevernal (late winter).</p>
<p>So, this would appear to back up the argument for how arbitrary the definitions can be, and how different the climate can be just on one planet.</p>

Many people like this &quot;season&quot; the most since snowmobiling and skiing is the most fun at that time of the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, my city of Calgary gets warm winds in the winter called chinooks that can swing our temperatures ~20 degrees C sometimes, in the span of a day or so. They're just warm weeks in the middle of winter to counteract the times it snows in the middle of summer.</p>
<p>So while we're subject to earthly seasons in the grand sense, there's also random local variations of climate</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in area that is widely regarded by locals as having 5 seasons: winter, spring, summer, monsoons, fall. It's like summer got divided into 2: the first part is 90-100F, sunny and bone dry. All of a sudden on a certain day, there is a dramatic shift in climate - BOOM, thunder, accompanied by torrential rain and 70F. The rain continues for 6 wks and then stops like clockwork, trees change color and then we are in fall.</p>
<p>It's such a clearly delineated 5 seasons, and there's such universal agreement on that point around here, that when I moved here it made me stop and think about why we perceive it as 5. And then I realized: it's 5 <em>wardrobes.</em> 5 sets of clothing. Different enough temperatures and climatic conditions that I need to switch pants, tops, shoes and jackets 5 times. I suspect the switch in wardrobe is what delineates them psychologically as &quot;different seasons.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flagstaff Arizona. We get the &quot;burst-break&quot; style of monsoon where there's thunderous downpour in the afternoons/evenings but then it clears in night &amp; morning. It's due to a seasonal shift in wind that starts bringing air from the Gulf of California. When I first moved here I was shocked what a clean predictable cycle it is - like, the start of monsoon season was predicted <em>to the day</em>, it was weird.</p>
<p>I later learned that a lot of tourists get into trouble because of this because they assume Arizona is always bone-dry. They go out hiking, starting out in the morning when it all looks clear, and then by the time monsoons hit in early afternoon they're way up a canyon or on a mountain peak, and they get caught in flash floods or struck by lightning. </p>
<p>And it's largely what makes Flagstaff a forest instead of a desert. (that and the altitude)</p>

<p>It's hot and wet for a while then there's a tepid period then back to hot but dry then transitions to a prolonged period of cold... whatever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could observe this if the planet had an axial tilt (like the tilt which causes seasons on Earth) and had a highly elliptical orbit, enough that the distance from the sun caused temperature changes.</p>
<p>You could have normal Earth seasons, but also super-winter in one hemisphere with short daylight due to axial tilt and extreme cold and dim sunlight due to orbital distance, meanwhile the other hemisphere is not in summer like usual but is going through a half-winter with long summer-like days but a dim, distant, not very warm sun. And super summers, and half summers, and weird springs between super winter and kind of still winter, or crazy springs between super winter and super summer...</p>
<p>You can play with this a lot by adjusting how the axial tilt aligns with the ellipse - major axis for super winters, minor axis for super summers, elsewhere for weirdness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earth's orbit is elliptic enough for this to be apparent. It makes northern seasons more mild, and southern seasons more extreme. But balancing that is the large amount of water in the south, which moderates climate generally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that's interesting about elliptical orbits is that you spend more of your time in the more distant parts of the orbit where your orbital speed is lower, and less time in the part of the orbit closer to the sun where your orbital velocity is higher. So whichever season is closest to perihelion is much shorter than the season that's closest to aphelion.</p>
<p>This is a big factor in how seasons work on Mars. The Northern Hemisphere has long summers with the solstice just after aphelion and short, mild winters around perihelion. The Southern Hemisphere meanwhile has long cold winters and a short hot summers (which coincide with the planet's dust storm seasons).</p>
<p>As I understand it, the differing distance from the sun has a only a relatively small effect on the temperatures experienced. The differing lengths of the axis-based seasons is much more important. The net result of the differing seasons is that the Northern Hemisphere is significantly warmer on average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranus has got this in our solar system.  It's rotation axis is almost on the same plane as its orbit (most planets in the solar system have a rotation axis much closer to perpendicular to their orbit).</p>
<p>The seasons would be weird, like you say, if that was Earth.  The north and south pole would go through 2 seasons per year; sun, and not sun.  The equator would go through 4, but they'd be hot/cold/hot/cold, rather than just having one hot/cold cycle per year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if the planet was part of a binary star system you would have it orbit one star and that would be the regular sine wave</p>
<p>then on top of that sine wave would be a second seasonal shift: as the other star got closer or farther away, probably on a much longer period (but it would &quot;loop back&quot; as it overtook our orbit or we overtook its orbit, so not even a straight sine wave) it would get REALLY hot</p>
<p>so like a planet with regular seasons then every 60-90 years everything burns in armageddeon</p></div>		</li>
