			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see what he was going for. And your analogy isn't quite right either. Because we can see the elephant pretty clearly. So you'd think we'd be able to see the fly just as clearly.</p>
<p>But it's the light. </p>
<p>So let's say it's night, and you turned on a good flashlight from 100 feet away. I could see that light pretty clearly. But let's say 10 feet away, there's a book on the ground, but it's in the dark. You won't be able to see it well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has a lot to do with it.. It's evidence that spatial distance can be relatively irrelevant due to other factors that influence your senses. Can't hear someone close to you when it's too loud, and you can't see something close to you when it's too dark.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congratulations, this is the Grand champion of awful analogies: Not only dutifully exhibiting complete and total lack of comprehension of the subject from which the comparison was drawn, but magnificently obscuring its fundamental concepts leading to the reader being <em>more</em> confused, as opposed to less. </p></div>		</li>
