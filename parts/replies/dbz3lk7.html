			<div class="markdown"><p>The medicine is mixed with it. Things like this were popular for humans before prohormones were scheduled as an illegal drug. You could take things like 1-Test and 4-ad among others and apply them topically which was much more effective than orally.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough but, by that logic, you also can buy all kinds of crazy stuff at regular stores. You can buy nitrate-based fertilizer at TSC, mix it with the diesel you bought at a gas station, load up your saddlebags and ride your horse bomb where ever your damn please. </p>
<p>Indeed, you can buy DMSO on Amazon if it makes you happy. Thankfully, due to the FDA, the government control the use of substances like things that uneducated consumers buy to protect people from themselves.</p></div>		</li>
