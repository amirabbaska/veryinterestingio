			<div class="markdown"><p>Your problem was the main draw of this specific app was because of the rating system; those shitty ones don't live long.</p>
<p>Plus now I can create my own personal bliss mix which would basically never happen in real world (each effect with it's own volume control and position in relation to the other noises)</p>
<ul>
<li>Underwater Waves, Carport Rain, and Dishwasher Rinsing (listened to for 22 days... haha, never knew they recorded the time spent)</li>
</ul>
<p>-Sleep Fan (there's like 20 different fans from the old that would slice your finger off to the new that basically are silent but deadly farts), Tent Wind, Thunder/Rain - 20 days</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Server Room, Indoor AC Vent, Old Hotel AC, Box Fan, and Rain on Car Roof - 13 days.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>White Noise by Tmsoft.  To get the noises without having to log in, you can get Whitenoise Market and then import those downloads into the main app.  </p>
<p>edit: They are kind of pushing a Pro version when this app I am using now WAS the Pro version and it sucks.</p></div>		</li>
