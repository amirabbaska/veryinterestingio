<p>There are actually multiple competing hypotheses about this. The hypotheses that have hot Jupiters forming at a greater distance from their parent star (around the ice line) and then moving closer are the more accepted hypotheses.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why you make the claim this is &quot;likely&quot; - these are two competing theories, and in situ formation is generally the less favorable of the two since it requires exceptionally high inner disk densities to operate. In situ formed hot Jupiters would also be frequently accompanied by nearby non-resonant planets, which so far have <em>not</em> been seen in observations in such numbers.</p>

<p>It sounds like you're suggesting a gas instability scenario here for in situ formation, which is <em>very</em> implausible given disk conditions - there's just not enough gas density that close to compensate for the fast rotation period. See section 2.1.1 of the paper that /u/nhammen provided.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normally the theories are split into late and early formation theories rather than in situ and migration. Do you have a paper about in situ HJs having nearby companions because this is not normally thought to be the leading problem with in situ formation (it is the timescales of formation that cause serious problems).</p></div>		</li>
