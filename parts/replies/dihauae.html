			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with zoning as an issue. Also avocados.</p>
<p>Houston, TX has repeatedly refused to adopt zoning laws. There are very few restrictions on what can be built, where. Housing is very affordable. Also, avocados are very inexpensive in Texas.</p>
<p>However, there are many other consequences to not having zoning laws. A large apartment complex can pop up in a neighborhood where schools lack the capacity to absorb the new students faster than the Board of Education can address school overcrowding. Parking and traffic engineering can be decades behind housing development, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is an important part that a lot of people miss. Smart transition to higher density development is difficult. Not just logistically difficult, but politically difficult. It's much easier for local politicians to fall back to appeasing their constituents by promising their roads and schools at least won't get overcrowded if they limit new development, and they don't have to navigate convincing people it's worthwhile to invest in new transit options and new services to serve higher density communities. And since new development will of course tend to be initially on the higher end of the market, it's easy to fall back on simplistic arguments that new development is only going to be for higher income families anyway and pass off nimbyism as social responsibility, while in reality screwing over everyone who won't have the means to enter the artificially limited supply of housing.</p>
<p>I think the big thing is that renters need to get more involved in their local political processes. Historically homeowners are the ones who go their local neighborhood meetings and public hearings, and while many of them (myself included) may be totally open to new development, their main concern is that their politicians don't screw over their communities by adding a bunch of new residents without properly addressing the needed updates. The pressure needs to be more on keeping up with the times and less on trying to keep everything the same as it was when some of these people bought their houses 20+ years ago while ignoring the consequences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you have to keep up with the times not only with respect to housing capacity, but to all of urban planning. </p>
<p>Using Houston as an example, neighborhoods like Bellaire and West University area adding a ton of rental properties. These neighborhoods are popular in part because they offer an easy commute to the medical center, galleria, and downtown areas and great public schools; factors that appeal to renters and homeowners alike. If you were to add too many housing units in the area, both groups lose their easy commutes and some of the kids are bussed to worker performing schools. Everyone loses. </p>
<p>If they could time the development of housing units with the ongoing construction, reconstruction and expansion of schools and traffic infrastructure, everyone wins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what do they do when population exceeds capacity? Does the state necessarily send enough money to build a new school, expand existing schools, hire new teachers and administrators, etc? And does it do so fast enough?</p>
<p>Or do children get bussed to neighboring towns/cities that had. I say in the rezoning?</p>
<p>How does it work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was going to bring up Houston. I moved here from Massachusetts and my rent was 1/3 as much for a larger, nicer place. Ended up being able to buy a house after saving for 18 months. No zoning is fantastic, especially as you can still get neighborhoods to deed restrict if you want.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hells yeah. People used to complain about our lack of zoning. But, I think most people are happy with what we've been able to do.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What does this mean exactly?  Historically, when I think of deed restriction, I think of the original neighborhood covenants that were all over the country that kept out black people.  But that can't be what you meant here cause that's obviously not a positive thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>HB1 &amp; SB6 - Let's fuck the Unions</strong></p>
<p>House Bill 1 (PDF: Vote History) will make Kentucky a “right-to-work” state, which means employees are no longer forced to join unions if they work in a union shop.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 6 (PDF: Vote History) prevents unions from collecting dues without written consent of an employee.</p>
<p><strong>HB2 &amp; SB5 - Let's make women feel real bad about that abortion they need, even though there is literally one or two abortion clinics in our entire state</strong></p>
<p>House Bill 2 (PDF: Vote History) will require a woman undergo an ultrasound before having an abortion.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 5 (PDF: Vote History) bans abortions beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>HB3 - We don't really need a minimum wage in all situations</strong></p>
<p>House Bill 3 (PDF: Vote History) repeals Kentucky’s prevailing wage. Prevailing wage refers to the minimum wage set for some classifications of positions for work on state contracts.</p>
<p><strong>SB3 - Let's open up the books (this one is actually great)</strong></p>
<p>Senate Bill 3 (PDF: Vote History) makes the pensions of all former and current state lawmakers available to anyone filing an open records request. Currently, that information and state pension information for other workers is kept private.</p>
<p><strong>SB12 - The governor gets to pick the board members for one of our biggest state colleges U of Louisville.  Our governor is a religious lunatic from Lexington that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/21/opinions/kentucky-ark-costello/index.html" target="_blank">supports the state-tax funded recreation of Noah's Ark construction in Eastern Ky.</a>  He also wanted to send literal <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2017/06/01/kentucky-gov-matt-bevins-plan-combat-violence-louisville-prayer-patrols/364043001/" target="_blank">prayer patrols to the crime-ridden West End of Louisville to &quot;stop the violence&quot;</a></strong></p>
<p>Senate Bill 12 (PDF: Vote History) restructures the University of Louisville board of trustees. The 17 member panel will be scrapped to make room for a new 10 member board. Those members will be nominated. Governor Matt Bevin will select new trustees who must be confirmed by the Senate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think HB 2 &amp; 5 are abhorrent.  Some people are some primitive in the US, it still feels like the 1800s.  WTF is the libertarian branch of the republicans doing while these get passed.  </p>

<p>I personally would support these.  The only time I have been a union, I was forced into 1 as a teenager working in a retail environment.  I earned very little money, and the union took dues to fight causes I didn't believe in.  </p>
<p>I am in Chicago, and Union relationship with the government is bankrupting the state.   Unions are amazing for private industry, especially where there is no employer choice.  Unions for government jobs are bankrupting the country.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right, voting doesn't mean anything when nobody running is worthy of a vote. The thing is, the Boomers vote and Millennials don't. If we don't vote in the primaries AND on election day then we will never have elected officials on our side. Nobody in office will fear reelection if we continue not to vote. Trump is president because 8.4% of the voters voted for him in the primaries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In most of the UK, these zoning laws are seen in their &quot;greenfield&quot; regulations. Basically, it was fine a few decades ago to build in a lot of fields and such. But now, the existing tenants (boomers) don't want to lose their views and weekend strolls, so no new building can occur there. When you so severely limit the available land for building, you horribly distort the market.</p></div>		</li>
