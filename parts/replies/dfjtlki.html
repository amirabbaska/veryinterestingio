Not unlike what facebook is doing, and what google is keeping to themselves. </p>
<p>Now, if they are actually selling private individuals browsing data, you might as well give up on the internet right now, seriously, you're all fucked..
Forget about getting a job, because your new employer bought your browsing history and is refusing you work because you visit porn sites, or googled a competitor... or you get fired for looking at other companies websites or talking to someone on linkedin.
And if you try to VPN it, you're obviously doing something untrustworthy, otherwise, why would you try to hide it. </p>
<p>yep, you're fucked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anybody with the cash. I am sure each company will be different but it will not just be advertisers buying the data. It's an absolute goldmine. </p>
<p>The political power of this information alone can and has swayed elections. Do some research on Cambridge Analytica. This data will be beyond comparison.</p></div>		</li>
