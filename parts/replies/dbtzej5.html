			<div class="markdown"><p>Energy isn't the limitation. The only time you run in to total depletion of glycogen in muscle is after hours of continuous use without rest. The reason you couldn't full on sprint a mile is because of how the sarcomeres in non-oxidative fast twitch muscles degrade quickly after intense use. Actin and myosin stop cross-bridge cycling and you can no longer generate tension in the muscle. Oxidative fast twitch and slow twitch muscle dominates after the non-oxidative fibers have been exhausted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But don't they stop because of lack of ATP? That's why I said energy was the limiting factor. I mentioned fueld such as glycogen and fat but I didn't mean to put them as the main fuel in this type of exercise.</p>
<p>It seems to me the main question was about maintaining exercise in a certain intensity (sprinting), so what I meant is that energy (ATP) was the limiting factor to keep you at this pace. Like someone else said, even if you have glycogen and fat, you still need to turn them into ATP before you can use them, and this takes time, so ATP is your energy in the end.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These fuels come in many types and include fat, glycogen (a storage form of glucose), and ATP</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For clarification, ATP is the fuel. Fat, carbohydrates, and protein (and even alcohol) are merely potential energy; substrates that when broken at certain places produce the energy necessary to reform ATP molecules. They're like fuel's fuel in that sense. So yeah, ATP is the fastest because it's the only one that can actually be used as fuel, as-is. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also for people that are interested, lactic acid is one of the primary &quot;fuels&quot; of brain astrocytes. And during recovery from exercise, lactate represents the liver's main gluconeogenic (glucose generating) substrate. In other words, lactic acid/lactate are not nearly the &quot;waste products&quot; we once thought of them as. In fact, lactate can be infused into the bloodstream post-traumatic brain injury to very significantly mitigate neuronal crisis.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I know lactate can be reutilized through the alanine-pyruvate cycle, were you talking about this or is there some other pathway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a biochem lecture a few years ago talking about this,  I think the professor mentioned that during a 100m run you would use most of your ATP supply within the first 1-2seconds.  Its pretty crazy, really stuck with me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never memorized the numbers, but I trust your professor. If you try to lift weights at about 80% of the maximum you can take, you should feel your muscles weaken around the second to third repetition, and you probably won't be able to do more than 6-7 reps. It's really crazy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you don't use up most of your ATP supply. You never use more than 50% of your stores, the exhaustion primarily comes from your body's inability to convert ATP to energy fast enough for usage.</p></div>		</li>
