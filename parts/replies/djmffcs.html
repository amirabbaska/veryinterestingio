			<div class="markdown"><p>DMT isnt taken orally because the gastric acids break ut down before it can be synthsized...which is why it is smoked...EXCEPT with Ayuhuasca...because some genius shaman figured out if you add another plant (and cook it or whatever it they do) inhibits your body from breaking down the DMT which is one reason smoked DMT has abiut a 20 min trip, but ayuhuasca taken orally set you off for hours.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't isn't &quot;naturally occurring&quot; in the body, the precursors are there but it's never been proven to be made In vitro. Here the real ELI5  it's not produced in the body naturally, and even if it was people take it because it causes a strong hallucinogenic effect due to the substances activity on serotonin (and vaguely other) receptors  </p></div>		</li>
