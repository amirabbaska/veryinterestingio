			<div class="markdown"><p>Blueberry flavor isn't one chemical, but a combination of dozens of chemicals. And yes, many plants share many of the same chemicals. The proportions of the various chemicals change the flavor characteristics of the material, although some chemicals give a characteristic aroma by themselves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have the answer to your question, but I'll note that there are some things that smell alike which aren't chemically the same. For example, most thiol compounds (containing sulfur) smell like rotten eggs, even if the rest of the molecule is quite different.</p>
<p>Most artificial flavors use the main chemical from the natural thing they are imitating - things like limonene, vanillin, and carvone. The natural smell usually contains hundreds or thousands of other components which can make a richer smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember hearing a 420 speaker say exactly this years ago. It's possible to isolate blueberry smell and flavor (the chemicals or whatnot) from that strain family of marijuana. Would be interesting to have something blueberry flavored that the flavoring was derived from it.</p></div>		</li>
