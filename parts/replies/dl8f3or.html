			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess ultimately what I'm trying to wrap my head around is how people/things can end up with different ages depending on the gravity of something nearby. I'm terrible at math, so physics edges me out real quick, despite loving it so much. When I think about time, I try to think of it as the logical progression of molecules and whatever in the universe, so in that regard, I wonder how two people could end up at different points in the aging process. Hell, I might be thinking of time wrong in that sense, even. I suppose my thinking was that, without a clock, or the sun and moon, the closest thing to gauging the passage of time, or even the flow of it, would be, like, decay...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well again you're exposing something at the core of Einstein's relativity! Where the other hot buzz in physics - Quantum Mechanics - concerns itself with the extremely small, general relativity is about the big picture. They're complementary: Space-time and gravity is in which matter and energy take place (take time? :P), so relativity doesn't say much about the miniscule, nor will you understand space-time or gravity by looking at single particles.</p>
<p>Things like this take a lot of frustrating sessions to even come close to grasp, and every time you do, it's a matter of time before you find new questions to feel stupid about. For now, I recommend distinguishing these two realms of the small and large, of matter/energy and space-time/gravity. Most, if not all physicists, are doing the same :)</p>
<p>The following is purely for conceptual purposes (physicsts please don't flame me!), but look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity#/media/File:Spacetime_lattice_analogy.svg" target="_blank">this image</a> where space-time curvature is visualised. Now imagine that space itself has some power to &quot;let time pass&quot;, well then if there's the same amount of space, but more matter to 'work with', maybe you can imagine that little bit of space or reality just takes longer for one 'timestep' to pass ;) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, when I'm thinking of progression on a molecular level, I just mean like as a way to see that &quot;time is flowing,&quot; like ice melting, a radioactive substance decaying, or a person aging. Not exactly trying to get into quantum shenanigans :p</p></div>		</li>

<p>he ages 1 year while i age 50.</p>
<p>will i see him in slow motion this whole time?</p>
<p>do heavier stars last longer because gravity is stronger in them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it in terms of information.  Nothing happens until you realize it has happened.  Time is relative to that information.</p>
<p>Imagine you're in a futuristic subway train flying really, really fast past a long station.  Right as you fly past the middle of the station, a mad bomber sets off a pair of bomb at each end with a single button push (so at the same time).  You're going so fast that you almost outrun the explosion behind you, and you're heading rapidly towards the one in front of you.  If someone asks you later if both explosions were simultaneous, you would say they weren't....because the information (in this case, the light and fire and shockwave) from the one in front of you reaches you faster than the one behind you.</p>
<p>You see and feel the one in front, then a short time later the one behind catches up to you.  You could &quot;do the math&quot; and realize that the one behind you might have happened the same time, but you certainly don't experience it that way and your &quot;shields&quot; for example would need to react as if they weren't simultaneous.</p>
<p>A person standing in the middle of the station would argue that they were simultaneous, and you would argue that they weren't.  That's called &quot;frame of reference&quot; and two people with different frames of reference experience time differently, although they tend to be very close in agreement with each other.</p>
<p>Now imagine there's only the bomb behind you and your subway car is moving 99.999% as fast as the shockwave of the explosion.  You'll get very, very far away before it catches up.  You might have finished eating dinner before you realize the station behind you blew up.  It happened seconds ago to you, but 60 minutes ago to the people on the station.  If you turn around and go back you'll wonder how come you didn't make it back in time to help...but to them you're 2 hours late even though you were like right there when the bomb went off.</p>
<p>Now imagine that you're going 101% of the speed of the explosion's light and fire...it never catches you.  You can look back and not only does the information of the explosion never reach you for you to discover it, if you think about it carefully you're catching up to the information that left it before you did.</p>
<p>If you're faster than the radio signal playing from a tower at the station, you won't hear the song playing normally.  Each pulse goes out in a shell, concentric globes like a giant jawbreaker moving away super fast, but you're faster.  A guy sitting down next to the tower feel note 1 pass, then note 2, then note 3 and so forth, as they pass through radio and he hears them just like normal.  They continue to spread out.  But you, you're inside the shell and passing through it backwards.  You'll pass through note 3, then catch up to note 2, then note 1.  You'll experience the information backwards.  Time for you is reversed.</p>
<p>That's relativity: all time, space, and information is relative to to the observer.  How you receive information determines how you perceive it, and two people experiencing the same information in 2 different ways will have two different experiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is a great analogy. i'm still just a little confused. so the moving observer A doesn't see the bomb until 60 minutes have passed because it takes longer for the explosion to reach him. but because the bomb actually went off 60 minutes ago and not mere seconds, observer A has only aged mere seconds while the mad bomber has aged the full 60 mins?</p>
<p>and its even more confusing when i think about how the bomb went off at different &quot;times&quot; for both the observers yet it was only detonated once. and both observers are correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how would you explain aging? Both for that people on the train and the people on the station 60 minutes passed and they aged 60 minutes, while according to relativity, they should have aged differently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rather than trying to think of time as a defined, quantifiable <em>thing</em> within which objects change, try to think of time as the <em>byproduct</em> of things changing states. Energy causes subatomic particles, and thus atomic particles, thus molecules, thus everything to change, moving, speeding up, slowing down... Time is the byproduct through which we perceive these changes. If we didn't perceive time, things would instantly teleport from one place to another (which they do, given a small enough length of observation).</p>
<p>More mass means more gravity, more gravity means more curvature and change, which means more 'time'. A bit more ELI5 would be to think of time as the result of reality processing changes. Time is the universe's memory buffer - the more you throw at it, the more it slows down to handle the load.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this explains it better than those upvoted pointless answers. Must be higher. Now that I think of it, time is indeed a byproduct of the atoms changing their states - for humans a small portion of time might be measured as a number of neuron signals that passed through the time-registering part of the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you had a live feed video streaming between someone on Earth and someone near a black hole.  How would the perception of time play out over the video feed vs. the actual differences of time between the two?  I always wondered when watching Interstellar what each party would see when that one group went to the planet where time passed reallt quickly, if a live feed video link were observed.  Would the people in the spacecraft be moving in slow motion to those on the planet?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we run into a problem because the radio waves sending the feeds would be subjected to the same time dilation that the people on the planet are subjected to. Like, it takes time for us to get information back from deep space satellites, right? I s'pose if it was a live feed from the planet to the ship in orbit, it'd have some serious buffering problems...?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... gravity is a stronger force than time......... Is what you're saying. Correct?</p>
<p>I mean, makes sense I guess. </p>
<p>Maybe time is created by gravity some how? That's just wild speculation based on nothing though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah woah let's be careful with such metaphysical interpretations! When it comes to the fundamental aspects of reality, you gotta be careful! Gravity isn't really a force as it is currently understood, nor does it compete with time. Space, time, gravity, all are at the foundation of our knowledge at the moment, unsure what really lies underneath. </p>
<p>Science often tends to describe, not explain. The math of general relativity describes the relations between these physical features of reality, but not much more. Perhaps they're all aspects of the same thing, who knows? :) </p></div>		</li>

<p>We could all be existing in an infinite loop of artificially created life creating artificial life, by a computer simulation. Fuck that, the only reason we exist is because we think we exist.  What is existence? Nothing is a paradox, there can't be nothing because that makes it something.</p>
