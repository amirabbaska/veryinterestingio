			<div class="markdown"><p>So does this just not work if you are a sleep walker? I've seen my younger brother act out his dreams, once he hopped like a bunny to the front door, opened the door and started hopping down the driveway before I stopped laughing and was able to drag him back to bed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep paralysis is technically a REM sleep parasomnia, even though you experience it when you wake up. During REM sleep, your body tells major muscles to chill out for a while. Sleep paralysis happens when your sleep stages get jumbled up and you end up awake but also unable to move as if you were in REM sleep.</p>
<p>Building some good sleep habits can help a lot of people with sleep paralysis, and you can also talk to a doctor or see if you can get into a sleep clinic if it starts to be a problem :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never had an &quot;episode&quot; of sleep paralysis, but I've had moments where I wake up and can't move for a few seconds, but my eyes are always closed and I can't see / hallucinate anything. Is there a difference here or am I just lucky that my eyes are always closed / I don't hallucinate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Paralysis during REM sleep is thought to prevent accidents if you were to act out your dreams.  Most dreaming occurs during REM.  Becoming conscious during REM body state is what you are referring to.  The point being that paralysis during REM is normal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleeping seems really strange if you stop and think about it.  Every night, the majority of people spontaneously fall unconscious and turn off all their senses, and when we start moving again, we have no real conception of passage of time, etc. Some hypothetical humanoid alien race that never needed sleep would probably find it weird as hell. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, sleep isn't like bat wings where the bone structure looks like human hands and arose independently.  We sleep because our primate predecessors slept. Birds sleep because their dinosaur ancestors slept. In cetaceans that can't stop moving, <em>half the brain goes to sleep at a time</em>!  Go far enough back and you will find a common ancestor that first had brain function high enough to require sleep. We are all descended from it. </p>
<p>An alien that didn't sleep would have to be from a planet where the lower life forms didn't sleep. </p></div>		</li>
