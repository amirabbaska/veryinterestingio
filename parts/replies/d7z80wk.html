			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, I'm posting this here in hopes that you will cut/paste it into your response.  Although your answer is correct, it really wasn't eli5 style.  There are other decent answers too.  Only the one way at the top is bad, but I think people liked it because it used an analogy.  I'm hoping that you'll cut/paste it into your response because 1) I want you to get the upvotes so people understand my motivation is to do damage control for this sub as opposed to getting karma for myself and 2) I want to keep my top post about Wigglytuffs.  I hope someone appreciates that I'm using my final moments in Japan writing this instead of playing PoGo like I came here to do...</p>
<p>So I guess I'll make an analogy too.  Comparing voltage to pressure is often done so I'll keep that.  Let's say that the pressure is created by a horde of zombies pushing against a fence though.  Now let's say we want to use up our zombies, so we electrify this fence which is (sort of) analogous to putting a load on your battery.  Now if you electrify it a little bit, the zombies directly against the fence will start to die slowly, but they'll still make some pressure and as they die one by one the zombies behind them can move them out of the way and continue making pressure.  Now if you electrify it a lot the zombies in the front die instantly so that they no longer make pressure.  They also make a limp squishy wall between the other zombies and the fence, through which the other zombies can't make their own pressure.  Now if you turn off the electricity the zombies up front will eventually get trampled down into mush and the zombies behind them will again be able to make pressure on the fence.</p>
<p>OK, hopefully 5yos like zombie analogies.  To go a bit farther and bring this back to the real world, I'm going to assume that 5yos can read graphs (and really, none of us are actually 5yo here).  Here's a picture of a typical discharge curve for a lithium ion battery -&gt; <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/UkodS.gif" target="_blank">http://i.stack.imgur.com/UkodS.gif</a></p>
<p>Because of the localization effects that you described in your post, and using the zombie analogy you can see that the pressure decreases faster as the load increases to the point of where you don't get all of the pressure from all of your zombies.  If you stop discharging at the cut off voltage, however, and let the battery &quot;relax&quot; for a few minutes you absolutely can get the &quot;lost&quot; capacity back, however.  Oh, if you go discharging at 18C again you'll only get ~80% of that &quot;lost&quot; capacity again before you have to shut down of course, but it's not like that capacity was really &quot;lost.&quot;</p>
<p>OK, now I'm throwing away the whole eli5 thing and talking about work.  About 15years ago I wrote the firmware for what is to this day the most common UPS in the world.  I started with a State of Charge algorithm that was written in assembly and translated it to C, and I added a few of my own things to it, but I think this graph shows some of the issues I faced when doing that.  How happy would you all be if you discharged your UPS at full load and it counted down from 100% to 20% and then shut off?  How would you like it if your electric vehicle did that (I've made those too)?  So, instead I made it count from 100% to 0% for the &quot;available&quot; capacity at the given load.  However, this means that once the load is removed and the battery relaxes a bit the State of Charge pops up a bit which I think is what the OP noticed when he asked the question.</p>
<p>Anyway, hopefully if you put this explanation in your post you'll climb to the top.  Of course the other guy could decide getting a good answer to the OPs question is more important than his Karma and gold and just delete his post :(</p>
<p>Edited to Add:  Also to the OP, although batteryuniversity.com doesn't sound like it'd be a reliable source for information, it's actually fantastic and used by engineers in the battery industry all of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This does work. You are redistributing the reactants by shaking the cell, which will get the concentrations at the electrodes high enough to function faster than just waiting for diffusion to get them there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having modeled batteries in UPSs for 10+ years, designed LiIon batteries for electric vehicles/airplanes/grid storage for 2+ years, and now designing active balancing solutions for LiIon batteries, I must say your explanation is not only clear but correct.  The most upvoted response is neither clear nor correct. </p>
<p>The OP should just read the Principles of Operation from the wiki page though: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battery_(electricity</a>)</p></div>		</li>
