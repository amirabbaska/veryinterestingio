			<div class="markdown"><p>If you can't pay you still can worship, just not in that location. Churches aren't given buildings for free either, they have to pay for them. Even without property taxes churches change buildings all the time when they can't afford their space for one reason or another. Church is the community, not the building. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your religion might be about worship. Other religions are about communal gatherings to worship together.</p>
<p>Most churches pay for their buildings with voluntary donations and don't expand into a full building until they're confident in enough income to pay for it. Often they will use public gathering locations or space given for free until they can pay for a building.</p></div>		</li>
