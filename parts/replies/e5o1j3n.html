			<div class="markdown"><p>ISS atmospheric conditions very closely match those on Earth at sea level. This is probably done not only because of crew comfort, health, and technical reasons (low pressure would require high oxygen concentration which causes some other issues), but also because they're doing research on effects of prolonged microgravity environment, and in any scientific experiment you want to isolate the variable you're measuring and eliminate the effects of any other variables.</p>
<p>In this case, since they want to know about the effects of microgravity, they don't want to have the results possibly contaminated by effects of different atmospheric pressure or gas composition.</p>
<p>As for crew comfort and health, natural atmosphere is what human deal with best. Low pressure environment could introduce the risk of altitude sickness to an already challenging environment, and dealing with altitude sickness complications in space could be very uncomfortable and potentially fatal.</p>
<p>And, of course, high oxygen content atmosphere tends to increase the risk of fire.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree with nearly all of your post, but just want to point out that altitude sickness is just mild oxygen deprivation. It has nothing to do with the overall atmospheric pressure.  It's just that on Earth, the partial pressure of oxygen goes down with atmospheric pressure. This could be easily compensated in the ISS by holding the partial pressure of oxygen constant while dropping the total pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I'm not entirely convinced of your &quot;of course&quot; statement.  What matters in combustion is the absolute concentration of oxygen, not necessarily its relative concentration.  If normal air is 20% oxygen at 1atm, and you change it to 100% oxygen at 0.2atm, you have not increased or decreased the concentration of oxygen in the space at all.  There would still be the same number of oxygen molecules in the air to react with whatever combustion reaction is going on.  Now, couldn't find any obvious sources with a quick google search, but would the extra nitrogen molecules really &quot;get in the way&quot; of combustion?</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the other hand, some vulnerable people suffer altitude sickness at 1,000 metres, in 0.9 atmospheres of pressure. So there's no single number that can answer your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Translation: The air was being pushed through a small hole, and wasn't being pushed that hard. Either pushing harder, or making the hole bigger, would cause more air to leave at a time.</p>
<p>If the air going through the hole made it bigger, then more air could have fit through at once without having to push harder, and that could be bad (if the hole was made big enough). But that didn't happen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Air pressure surrounds is, after all. It's not a direction thing (mostly. There is with, but that's small).</p>

<p>First paragraph of that article. Air does escape faster with a higher pressure difference. Which doesn't mean the station's air would have depleted faster, but the force on the hole would have been bigger because of the higher air density.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's basically impossible, under normal atmospheric pressure.  If water was going through the hole, it would have more force at the same pressure, but even then it's really just a pretty small pressure difference.</p>
<p>If the hole was say a foot or wider, it would cause air to rush rapidly from the entire station, and those winds could pick heavy things up that might break the hole open wider.  Air would be emptying out of the station so quickly that it would be a secondary issue, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that it'd be possible with only 1 atm of pressure delta.  The absolute pressure difference is just so low, you need more force along the edge of the hole to wear away metal.  </p></div>		</li>
