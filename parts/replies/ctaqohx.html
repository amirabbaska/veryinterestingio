			<div class="markdown"><p>That might even be the fucking reason. I just opened a video, explicitly switched to 720p, let it cache for a while, stepped forward within the cached range a few times - it did (apparently) NOT download any of that again.</p>
<p>Just did the same with another video that was on auto-480. No re-caching.</p>
<p>I am sure that I had re-caching problems with the YouTube player in recent months, then I stopped caring. Maybe they changed something. I am sure that its behavior was as super-retarded as OP's question insinuates.</p></div>		</li>
