			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall a teacher in my video games course telling me about a hack to represent a massive cave system in an early 2D dungeon crawler game. They wanted to be able to represent a massive lair with customised rooms, but couldn't afford the space to ship that, let alone bring it into RAM.</p>
<p>Instead,the built a procedural cave generator algorithm, poked around with different random seeds until they found one they liked, then placed down sprites of furniture and monsters in suitable places. When the game ran, it would use the algorithm with that specific seed to generate the area of the cave around you, then check if there where any sprites in range that needed to be placed based on their specified coordinates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pitfall for the Atari 2600 was similar to this...it used a random system...with a fixed seed to make the same 256 screens/levels while not actually storing all that data.  </p>
<p>Technically a Linear Feedback Shift Register...this is the start of a (rather technical) blog series that dives into it, if you're interested: <a href="http://samiam.org/blog/20130606.html" target="_blank">http://samiam.org/blog/20130606.html</a></p>
<p>The whole game was 4k.</p></div>		</li>

<p>4 8x8 tiles made one 16x16 block, which also means that your image could be done as hexadecimal values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the risk of being pedantic, I'll point out that this isn't the reason.  Hexadecimal values are really just a mnemonic, since the machine sees everything as binary.  Number systems are interchangeable.  </p>
<p>The real value in requiring powers of two bitmaps is related to optimization and the implicit nature of working with binary data.  Powers of two textures are easy to filter, mipmaps are easily done, transformations and scaling are simpler, etc.  Guaranteeing that your dimensions are always divisible by two also means that some operations can be simplified into bit-shifting instead of more costly algebraic instructions.</p></div>		</li>
