			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to grease temperatures, but I know that piston ring and front ring groove temperatures are often limited to 260 C (500F) in automotive applications because the engine oil will begin to breakdown above that temperature. </p>
<p>232 C (450F) is also a common max recommended operating temperature for silicone seals. Might have something to do with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to chine in with my lubricants experience. ASTM usually has 450 F as the Max temp to report for most fluids for flash points. I have done MANY flash points, and this is due to the standard, economical  mercury thermometers and the standard flash point apparatus that are in used in most (not all) fluid testing laboratories. </p>
<p>Check any FR fluid's Safety Data Sheet and it will list flash point as &gt;450F instead of a precise temperature if it is above that temp. </p></div>		</li>
