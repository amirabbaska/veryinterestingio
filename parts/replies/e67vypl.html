			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, there's a concept called &quot;Wet bulb temperature&quot; which is the temperature of air cooled to saturation (100% humidity).  If the air is already at 100% humidity, the wet bulb temperature is just the normal temperature.  At lower humidities the wet bulb temperature can be significantly lower.</p>
<p>This has relevance to living organisms, since we cool ourselves by evaporative cooling (sweating).  If a human is ever in an area with a wet bulb temperature greater than ~95 F (35 C) they can't significantly cool their bodies even with complete evaporation, and so will eventually overheat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh it is. Once air conditioning became a thing the population really started taking off. The funny thing is the city literally makes it hotter. Once you get even a mile outside town you can feel the temperature drop. </p>
<p>The scene from Arrested Development where Michael gets out of Sky Harbor and immediately complains about the heat sums it up. And of course he touched the door handle without thinking. That’s Phoenix in a nutshell. But I still love it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! In Arizona the midsummer wind is just hot. There’s no cooling effect. It’s like standing in front of an oven some days. </p></div>		</li>
