<p>I've done a bit of tracking here and there, and it really is a hard thing where you have to observe <em>very</em> closely and piece together a lot of diverse information to figure out what went on. </p>
<p>You have to not only figure out what print is from what animal, but what the gait patterns mean (which is a seriously complex skill to decipher gait), how new or old the track is, contextualize it within the larger ecosystem and figure out what the animal may have been doing, piece together other incidental clues like scat, nibbled leaves or grass, urine, hair, etc. </p>
<p>It really is quite a feat to develop many of these skills.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This alone seems like a massive feat (assuming smell isn't also being used). As someone who frequently hikes in bear territory, with sattelite weather reports and information from other hikers - I often have trouble gauging the age of tracks due to rain/snow/wind/weight considerations/speed of movement/etc. - and this is with &quot;high quality&quot; human eyes. I don't know how other animals would fair processing this while staring at white-on-white snow for hours on end. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There are so many people who argue that this one thing led to our big brains: tracking or throwing rocks or something. Me, I think we developed our brains for doing what we do with them now: getting along with other people. Science is cool. Less than .01% of human thinking is science. Less than .01% is tracking or throwing rocks. But we sure do think about other people a lot. About what they are thinking, about how to get them to do things, etc. Human brains exist to think about human brains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have different parts of the brain for logical processing and social interaction.  Generally people don't appreciate you using too much logic when it comes to being social.  Your ability to socialize is much more tied to your ability to feel complex emotions and to sympathize and empathize - something more than a few other animals can do (e.g. elephants, some birds, dolphins, some other primates, dogs) as opposed to your problem solving skills (significantly rarer in other animals).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read something interesting about just that, scientists studying the brain have been able to see that our ability to read letters and symbols are processed in the same place as we use to track animals and recognize footprints and visual ques. So while we were still hunter gatherers we may not have had a written language (that we know of) but developing our hunting senses over many 100ds of thousands of years directly contributed to our ability to even recognize writing. And I think our ability to do science is pretty reliant on both writing and pattern recognition to piece together/invent new things (wheels and coggs etc.).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also the part of brain associated with face recognition, and pattern recognition in general. It feels pretty far-fetched to single out tracking, something that most members of most human societies we know of (even &quot;primitive&quot; societies) never do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watch The Hunt on Netflix the first episode have several examples of predators thinking through problems: orcas trying to wash a blue whale calf off of their mother, polar bear approaching a seal through ice holes while staying out of sight, wild dogs choosing a prey that they can run down. I think the clearest example is the highly intelligent orcas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am I wrong thinking that there's only a superficial difference here? To me, an animal tracking another via visual cues would be virtually the same thing as a wolf tracking via olfactory cues. </p>
<p>If a wolf picks up a scent of a prey animal, they still need to process &quot;What animal am I smelling? Is it worth the chase? Does it appear to be injured?&quot; in the same way that a predator relying on visual cues would have to. </p>
<p>Their considerations are certainly more instinctually driven whereas a human would have to apply critical thinking to make a decision, but that's just as a result of our lack of sensory ability.   We don't have the same degree of sensory information availible to us as an animal which can see UV light or that can smell a very scant amount of blood</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a superficial difference, because that's not a good description of how humans use footprints to hunt.  They don't follow them like an animal follows a scent.  Instead, a human builds a mental picture of that time in the <em>past</em> when those prints were made, and then fast-forwards through time, putting together all kinds of information.</p>
<p>Animals have senses that get triggered, and they follow those senses in the direction of the stronger sensation - whether the sense they're using is smell, sight, sound, electromagnetic, etc.</p>
<p>When you start to appreciate that difference, you'll see that there are very very few examples in the animal world that even come close.  What a human does while hunting is light years apart from what animals do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with this is you're not appreciating what generations of evolution alongside a single prey species can yield. </p>
<p>For example, Kestrels track their prey by <em>visually</em> detecting the UV footprint of their prey's urine and feces. By following these footprints, they know they will eventually arrive at their play. </p>
<p>We do not have the sensory capabilities of the animals that were talking about. Just because we have to make critically thought out decisions in our hunts doesn't mean that a predator would have to as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smell has a definite qualitative difference from sight.  At least in humans, smell translates complex chemical signals into quickly apprehensible impressions almost subconsciously.  Apart from a few subtle poisons, something that smells good to eat will be good to eat.</p>
<p>By contrast, inferring the shape of a pig's foot by a print in mud gives you much less information about the quality of the meat than sniffing the pickle jar.</p></div>		</li>
