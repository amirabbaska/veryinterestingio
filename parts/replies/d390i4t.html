			<div class="markdown"><p>Soooo....where is the original post?  I'm having trouble finding it via the super sick Reddit search function.  </p>
<p>But seriously, what is the point of calling this out as a repost if you don't provide the original post for those of us who didn't see it?  Is Mr. Bot just trying to be a dick?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, just saw this and stopping by to provide some insight as to how the bot works and why it doesn't leave links sometimes. (pinging /u/hawkonthehill since he might be interested in this explanation too).</p>
<p>There are two ways a question is flaired as a repost. 1. automatically by the bot and 2. manually by a moderator</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically: the bot attempts to extract the keywords from every new question seconds after it's submitted. It then uses those keywords to run a search. If the search gives quite a few results, the question is automatically flaired as a repost and the bot leaves a sticky comment <strong>which includes a link to the search it performed</strong>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4jjib9/eli5_what_makes_bad_words_bad/d3746s2" target="_blank">Example</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The bot sometimes sucks balls at extracting the keywords properly, especially in long titles such as this question's. Because of that, its search doesn't find much and the question goes by without being flaired as a repost. Enter case 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>A moderator spots a repost which the bot missed and manually flairs it as a repost. In which case, the bot also leaves a message, but without the search results. Why no search results? Because if the bot had gotten a nice list of search results, it would've flaired the question automatically and left a link to the search (case 1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Needless to say, this is not a perfect system and it comes with its flaws - I coded it myself and I am always looking for ways to improve it (ideas welcome). </p>
<p><strong>tl:dr</strong> dumb bot couldn't run a good search and find results so a moderator had to manually flair this is a repost</p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>Bot:</strong> THIS IS A REPOST! BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME USING REDDITS IMPOSSIBLE SEARCH TO FIND A QUESTION THAT HASN'T BEEN POSTED IN YEARS. <em>removes it</em></p>
<p><strong>Anyone Else:</strong> <em>Asks previously posted question</em></p>
<p><strong>Bot:</strong> Hello there, kind sir or madam. It is unfortunate that you appear to have posted a question that has been posted before. But it's okay, everyone makes mistakes, so we'll let this one slide. Have a wonderful day, user! </p>
