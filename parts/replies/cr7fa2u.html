			<p>If you are using Iphone, I'm afraid I can't help you. I am not familiar with blocking ads in iOS. Someone more qualified would be able to offer assistance.<br><br><strong>For Android</strong><br><br>If you are using an Android phone and rooted, then <a href="https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.adaway" target="_blank">Adaway</a>. Just Install it and do the initial update it'll run smooth. Don't ever worry about it again.<br><br><br>Now if you are using an Android phone and it is not rooted, then <a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/android-install" target="_blank">Adblock Plus</a>. This needs some<a href="https://adblockplus.org/en/android-config" target="_blank"> configurations</a> in the WiFi settings.<br><br>Both these apps are not available through the Google play store. So you will have to download the apk packages and install them manually. This involves going to Security settings and allowing the 'Installation of apps from Unknown Sources'.<br><br>Or you can install an alternate app store line <a href="https://f-droid.org" target="_blank">F-droid</a>, and then installing the apps through the store.<br><br><em>Last Note: If you are using a phone like One plus One with Cyanogen mod on it, then it's already rooted (So just go ahead and install Adaway)</em><br><br>Hope this helps.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Adfree, bigtincan.<br><br>That'll take care of a lot of app ads too.<br><br>Now, onto your browser.<br><br>Try firefox.  You can install desktop extensions/etc on the mobile browser.  So, go get uBlock and Ghostery as well.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>If you're using a mobile browser that supports extensions, like Chrome or Firefox, then I'd imagine you'd be able to block ads there as well. <br><br>For mobile apps though, highly unlikely. </p>		</li>

			<p>If you're on iOS you can install iCab Mobile as your web browser, which has built-in ad filtering.</p>		</li>
