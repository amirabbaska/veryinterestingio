			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post:
The other thing to consider is that if you throw both of them into a recycle bin the aluminium can is going to get recycled and probably fairly locally. The plastic bottle may not end up recycled and may be shipped great distances.</p>
<p>This is a political problem, not a scientific one.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Following up on this, (because OP forgot that soda can also come in a glass bottle, and also because I want to know): is it possible to give a (general) ordering of environmental-friendliness between the following packing materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>glass (with or without deposit),  </li>
<li>cardboard,  </li>
<li>aluminium,  </li>
<li>plastic ?</li>
</ul></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of after-product I’d probably rank them like this, from best to worst, given the caveat any of these could be re-ordered depending on any types of toxic paints, glues, etc. used. In other words just because it’s made of paper, doesn’t mean it’s not toxic - cardboard being the one to watch out for here.</p>
<p>Cardboard
Glass
Aluminum
Plastic</p>
<p>In terms of acquiring the material, based on BEST as in most environmentally friendly methods:</p>
<p>Aluminum
Glass
Cardboard
Plastic </p>
<p>And here I’m ranking cardboard lower because we shouldn’t really be devoting forest products to cardboard, even if it’s “renewable”,</p>
<p>Aluminum highest because of the high potential for recyclability.</p>
<p>Glass, high potential for recycling but likely increased production negatives (SO2 gas production).</p>
<p>Plastic, unsure if 100% “renewable” plastic exists yet, so can’t really think of any positives. Anything that’s derived from petroleum should be eliminated.</p></div>		</li>
