			<div class="markdown"><p>CYP3A4 is the normal problem with furanocoumarins - A <strong>lot</strong> of drugs primarily use that pathway, from statins to benzos to some opiates.</p>
<p>Caffeine, however, is primarily metabolized by CYP1A2 - But furanocoumarins <em>also</em> suppress that pathway.  So yes, grapefruit juice would somewhat increase the effects of caffeine.  In humans, we have an amazingly high tolerance to xanthines (such as caffeine), so that's not a major concern.  In our pets, the same isn't true (for example another xanthine, theobromine, is the reason a small amount chocolate can kill your dog).</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It seems like about half the responses to me have latched onto the chocolate thing, so let me be more specific... Theobromine becomes toxic in dogs <a href="http://veterinaryclinic.com/chocolate/calc.html" target="_blank">at around 20mg/kg, and potentially lethal over 100mg/kg</a>.  Your average Hershey-bar-quality chocolate has 50-70mg of theobromine per ounce; bulk no-name Easter candy has even less than that (down to &quot;zero&quot; in some cases), and unsweetened chocolate has 450mg/oz.  So if you have a 75Lbs (34kg) German shepherd, it can eat roughly 11oz (312g) of Hershey bars before it starts to show symptoms of xanthine toxicity.  If your 33Lbs (15kg) border collie gets into the &quot;good&quot; chocolate, two ounces is toxic and ten is possibly fatal.  And if your 8Lbs (3.6kg) papillon beats you to that <em>single 1oz square</em> of baking chocolate you dropped - It's a goner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am amazed every day at the amount of information people know on here.  </p>
<p>I have heard the chocolate thing, but my tiny chiwawa-sized dog got into my kid's halloween candy and ate an entire regular sized Snickers bar.  We only knew after we were cleaning a week later and found that wrapper behind the couch, clearly eaten by her.   Never even git the shits! My daughter blamed us for stealing it too!</p>
<p>There have been other times that she has eaten  chocolate without issue too.  Could certain dogs be immune to it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coffee is not just caffeine; it also contains substances that greatly increase the potency and addictiveness of various other psychoactive substances, including caffeine.</p>
<p>These so-called ß-carboline alkaloids are inhibitors for human monoamine oxidase enzymes, MAOs.</p>
<p>There are two types of MAOs, MAO-A and MAO-B. Both are very important in breaking down brain neurotransmitters, and inhibiting their activity causes brain neurotransmitter levels to rise.</p>
<p>Since these compounds inhibit both types of MAO, MAO-A and MAO-B, they increase the levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline and adrenaline. They do so by binding to the MAO enzymes, making them unable to bind to the neurotransmitters to break them down like they normally do.</p>
<p>This means that any other drugs that work by releasing these neurotransmitters, or inhibiting their reuptake into neurons, are going to have a more substantial neurological effect. This essentially means that every mind-altering substance known to man will have its reinforcing effects potentiated by coffee – and tobacco.</p>
<p>Ever wonder why the smell of coffee and tobacco is so easily perceived even when the surrounding air is always full of other scents? The answer is that the molecules that cause the smell-sensation also have a profound effect on our brain chemistry.</p>
<p>These chemicals are called heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs for short), a subgroup of which our new friends beta-carbolines are. The typical beta-carboline is called norharman; some others are called harman, harmalol, harmaline, harmine, tetrahydroharmine, et cetera. As a group, they also called Harmala alkaloids.</p>
<p>Some of you may recognize the name; and indeed, it comes from the plant <em>Penganum harmala</em>, an ingredient of the psychedelic brew Ayahuasca used traditionally as a sort of psychiatric medicine by South American shamans.</p>
<p>What's so interesting about these so-called Harmala alkaloids is that they all tend to inhibit the activity of MAOs. Some of them are biologically active at nanogram dosages per kilogram body weight. Tobacco smoke and coffee are the two most significant sources of these alkaloids in the human diet. </p>
<p>Since they directly increase the effects and addictiveness of all kinds of drugs – even common, &quot;mild&quot; ones like nicotine and caffeine – they are very reinforcing in themselves when administered regularly.</p>
<p>Some people have an increased susceptibility to coffee and tobacco addiction due to genetic differences in MAO activity; there are several genetic variants of both MAO-A and MAO-B, which cause all of us to have very different rates of metabolism for the key neurotransmitters detailed above.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I absolutely love the smell of cigarette smoke and I always have since I can remember. I have smoked, but gave up about 10 years ago. Whenever I talk to ex smokers, most of them say they hate the smell now, but I still love it. Could that be because I'm more probably more genetically susceptible to it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As u/ribnag says the CYP3A4 route is only one enzymatic route, and there are other similar pathways that can metabolise compounds. That's why I put &quot;mainly&quot; in my original answer as I didn't want to complicate matters in what is already a complex system. CYP3A4 is the main one however, so it's inhibitors have the greatest effect, and you can think of the others as back up pathways. A good analogy is using the small backup country roads vs the motorway (interstate for those of you in the US). The body is an amazing thing with a LOT of backup redundancy. You also see this type of alternate pathway in the likes of blood supply (check out the intestinal arcades and genicular anastomoses), two kidneys, the fact that you can suffer a stroke and your body relearn functions and so on. On the flip side why other systems DONT have this built in redundancy, I frankly have no idea. Personally I find it really quite fascinating; hence my profession. The human body is an awesome but imperfect creation/evolution. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>FUN FACT!</strong> The original study aimed to investigate the effect of alcohol consumption on the bio-availability of a drug. The researchers needed something to cover the taste of alcohol so that control groups didn't know they were getting boozed... they chose grapefruit juice (because it's bitter).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the points the other people are making: you are also relying on the interaction of two different compounds which don't directly interact with each other so the amount of things that could go wrong also pretty much doubles. Also, grapefruit usually doesn't have a controlled dose of the compounds that inhibit P450 so it's hard to measure what exact effect it would have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to determine your metabolic rate of certain drugs via genetic testing of CYP enzyme genes. So, theoretically, if you knew your personal metabolic profile and could measure the exact amount of furanocoumarins in a given volume of grapefruit juice, you would get the same benefit with fewer drugs, but would fail to decrease the incidence of side effects, providing the drug you use is in its active form. There are drugs that require activation via CYP enzymes, which basically means that grape juice would inhibit their activation resulting in decreased effect. </p></div>		</li>
