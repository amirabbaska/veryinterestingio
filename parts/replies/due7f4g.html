			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic write up -- the human body is crazy complicated and it's interesting how all these things came to be.</p>
<p>Though, two thing: I believe it's &quot;clarion&quot; call, not &quot;carrion&quot; call, and the two links at the very bottom appear to link to the same page.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, Fixed! I think I originally learned carrion instead of clarion and then I justified it as like how the stink of carrion calls to vultures or something. I appreciate you letting me know, I've been using it wrong for a LONG time and no one has ever corrected me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually made sense the way you were using it -- the stench of carrion attracting buzzards, for instance. But yeah, I'm reasonably certain it's 'clarion,' as in clear and ringing. No worries, and glad you didn't take offense!</p></div>		</li>
