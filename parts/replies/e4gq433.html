			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a look at wikipedia to get an idea of the relative intensity of sunlight and moonlight (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight</a>)</p>
<p>Daylight hits about 10,000-100,000 lux (unit of luminescence) on the surface it lights, depending on how direct it is. By contrast, direct moonlight from a full moon is less than 1, or less than 0.01% than the lower limit of daylight. So again, the amount of energy being delivered is quite negligible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this doesn't change the answer, I'd like to point out that it is inappropriate to use lux as a measurement in this case as it is a measure of light intensity weighted to the sensitivity of the human eye. Instead, we should be using something like radiant flux (neutral measurement) or photosynthetically active radiation (weighted to the absorption spectra of chlorophyll).</p>
<p>Edit: While no one seems to use this, there is another weighting which seems to me to be the best measurement to reflect real-world performance of plants. I don't think it has a name, exactly. You can see the graphs by searching images for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=quantum+yield+of+photosynthesis" target="_blank">quantum yield of photosynthesis</a>. It's a more flat line with only a slight dip around 550nm and a sharp drop-off at 700nm.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This has a nice table giving the relative brightness of the light received by the sun vs different kinds of lighting, including the moon. We are still only talking about a fraction of a % to a few % of ordinary daylight so the energy being delivered is still quite negligible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hate to be that guy... But the sun is about 0.000<strong>0</strong>16 light-years away. Off by a factor of ten.</p>
<p>Light takes 8ish minutes to get to earth, there are 365x24x60 minutes in a year (525,600)</p>
<p>8/525600 ~ 0.0000152</p></div>		</li>
