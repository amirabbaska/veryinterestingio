<p>An argument could be made that since coal and fossil fuels are being used to generate the electricity that the cars use, that would also mean they really are dirtier when combined with the above (false) arguments about vehicle construction but the fact is that renewable energy has been leapfrogging the other methods, particularly in the last few years.  In the end it makes battery vehicles better for the environment and every year with the shift towards renewables, it keeps getting better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>and its irrelevant. use coal oil power to charge the car and toss the batteries in the ocean when you are done and its still orders of magnitude better for the world than gasoline.</p>
<p>consider this. an electric car is SO efficient (88 to 95% efficient grid to wheels) that a gasoline car uses more electricity per mile than an electric car does.</p>
<p>think about that for a moment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm doing a lot of research into fleet electrification right now, and I'm all for it... but that's a very ambitious assertion.   Are you talking about the electricity embedded in gasoline production and transport?  Can you back it up at all?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most of it can be recycled, it will be a great supply of lithium for new batteries. I say will be because we still don't have any used batteries and probably won't have for a long time.</p>
<p>Most of the car companies are expecting to buy back (or in some cases reclaim, as those are effectively renting) batteries and use them as a grid stabilizer like Tesla is doing in Australia. Used batteries will have less capacity but will still be useful. The lower capacity per kg will make them less suitable for  powering EVs but still useful for sitting in a warehouse and provide grid stabilization. We don't know exactly when or even if they will lose their usefulness in that role. The battery degrading curve seams to level off at 80 something percent so we probably won't start recycling batteries until the metals in them become a cheaper source then mining.</p>
<p>The point is the propaganda has people believing that after 5 years of use in an EV, the batteries have to be recycled and we can't recycle them. But that's just not true. It's more like after the EVs lifetime you can sell the battery to be used as a grid srabilizer and eventually that facility can sell the battery to a recycling plant which can sell the raw metals to a battery production facility.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the source of the electricity and a number of other factors.    The only way it would really work is if the gas car is scrapped which if the car isn't at true end of life probably isn't going to happen.   For a gas powered car most of it's footprint over it's lifetime is from the burning of fuel not from the manufacturing.   So it may be better to scrap a car and buy an EV as it would reduce the overall footprint.  But again if a car still has life in it someone will probably sell it and it would keep driving.   </p></div>		</li>
