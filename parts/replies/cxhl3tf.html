			<div class="markdown"><p>The websites don't give adequate specs unfortunately. The laser is Nd:YAG so wavelength is 1.064 um. It also says it is Q switched, which is a way of making high power pulses. But it doesn't say how much energy (J) is in each pulse, or how the optics are focusing it. That's critical to knowing what damage the beam can do.</p>
<p>I used to work with a 300 watt Nd laser, continuous wave, and there's no way I would have stuck my hand in the beam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A $15 green laser pointer is 5 miliwatt</p>
<p>A $200 high end blue laser pointer capable of burning through tape and garbage bags is around 1000 miliwatt</p>
<p>Where as a 100,000 miliwatt industrial laser is a few hundred thousand dollars depwing on the design.</p>
<p>The above guy is talking about 300,000 miliwatt.</p>
<p>But power â‰  cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lighter skin reflecting more light makes no sense to me....lighter skin is light because it scatters visible light, it tells you nothing about the infrared. Water, and therefore our body, actually absorbs pretty strongly in the infrared, so it should get heated up. </p>
<p>That said, I have no idea why that laser isn't burning his fingers. Most likely he's moving it too quickly to matter. Even if it isn't focused that tightly, that's a lot of power over a very small area.</p>
<p>Another possible place to look for answers is that the light is absorbed so strongly it doesn't go past the first layer of skin/fingernail. For example,1550 nm lasers are considered eye-safe even though the light is absorbed more strongly by our body than 980 nm. This is because it gets absorbed so quickly that it damages the cornea, instead of making it's way to the retina. In this case, I'd still be looking for visible signs of damage on the skin, so I'm not sure if that's the right answer...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think lasers impart that much energy from infrared. The material heats up or burns off because the light energy is absorbed by a darker material and turned into heat. </p>
<p>I think we need a real scientist to weigh in here. But I think the above statement is correct. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since we can't see any light from the laser in the video, and it's a diode-pumped laser, I'm pretty confident it's an infra-red laser. The most powerful diode lasers operate around 980nm, 1064nm, and 1480nm.</p>
