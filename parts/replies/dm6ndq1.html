			<div class="markdown"><p>Never been hunting so I will take your word for all this. But I was under the impression that turkeys were one of the dumbest creatures to ever live. I was shooting a .22 at a tree with my brother in law on the East coast and a big fat turkey walked out of the woods and walked under the bullets going into this tree, mere inches above its head. We didn't have hunting licenses nor the particular interest in cleaning and dressing some huge freaking bird but it sure seemed tempting to aim a few inches lower at this deranged (and like you said delicious) animal. </p>
<p>Must be one of those things that if you set out to hunt for them suddenly they seem like the most clever and evasive adversary around.</p>
<p>Isn't there something about turkeys being known to drown when it rains because they look up in fascination or something weird like that? That one could easily be an old wife's tale I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turkeys around populated areas often grow accustomed to people and once they figure out people won't hurt them, they become cocky, even violent.    </p>
<p>The drowning turkeys refers to domesticated turkeys, which have had all the brains bred out of them for larger breasts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both explanations make a lot of sense, thank you. I don't think any animal that gets accustomed to gunshots will have a very long lifespan though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only licenses, but be careful if the bird is legal when you do. For example in California depending on the spring or fall season we might only be able to take a bird if you see it's beard (the black almost horsetail-like protrusion from its chest). Your luck at seeing the bird probably rested on the fact you were near its nesting area and it must have been at the end of the day...out here in CA my husband and I can have a heck of a time even seeing one if we positioned ourselves too far away from where they likely were sleeping, but we've gotten better at calling and now have a hen decoy we call Floozy lol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but you'd also hope if someone is targeting a deer they've got a scope and are looking at their target</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me think... I dont use scopes for deer hunting. ... Is it considered unsafe??? (for my hunting grounds. Super close trees and why have a 3x when hes 25 yds out?... I thought... </p>
<p>I hunt in a smaller wood with essentially about 75yds possible projectile distance. </p>
<p>Im a safe hunter and spend most of my time making sure im not following the sounds of a bow hunter as many of them move in my hunting zone (North MN, almost Canada). </p>
<p>Now, I keep my gun at &quot;ready&quot; meaning finger off the trigger but ready to aim at anything approaching. I've nigh dropped my sights on several rustle-them-up hunters. Most of the time i just triple tap on the tree trunk with my canteen or spare mag and signal that im there... More of a &quot;What the fuck are you doing on my god damned land?&quot; than anything else... ((3 taps or concurrent sounds in the wild is considered a survival technique. It alerts people to things that dont normally happen. Most of the time its leaves rustling but 3 taps of a 308 mag on timber lets the person know you are there and they'll almost always look, instinctually, at you. </p>
<p>but in the field of hunting... Orange means &quot;Stop&quot;. even targets that have active tracking (where ya hit it and it makes a color) are yellow background. If i go to raise my gun due to deer-like sounds... The first thing im doing is looking for orange. After that the rest is based on rules 2, 3 an 4. </p>
<p>Edit: To explain the rules to non-shooters there are 4 rules for which ALL negligent discharges and non-intentional deaths can be blamed. Every accidental death from firearms will be caused by ONE of the following. I learned this at about 8-10 years old and my father would not let me touch a gun unless I could explain WHY each rule exists. </p>
<p>1: ALL GUNS ARE ALWAYS LOADED-- this included guns you've cleared. your buddies have cleared etc. its fucking loaded. Trust me... its loaded. Even unloaded. Its loaded.</p>
<p>2: Keep your finger off the trigger until youre ready to shoot. -- This is actually the most important one (in my opinion... granted I always assume rule 1). You naturally, at first, want to rest on the trigger. thats a HUGE no no. -- your finger should always be parallel with the barrel and usually crosses over the trigger guard. Its like you're pointing at your muzzle. </p>
<p>3: Never aim the muzzle (or barrel) at anything you do not wish to destroy. This includes your head, your upstairs toilet and your mother in laws' shitty cooking. -- Be especially wary of times where you clean and maintain your firearm. You WILL, at some point, accidentally aim it at yourself. Once you do, you will correct that behavior immediately. </p>
<p>4: Know your target and what is beyond. -  You know you want to shoot that deer but what if theres a home behind it, or a damned hermitage where they make the tastiest brews? Dont hurt em. -- this is why Deer stands are great. Downward angle, clearer line of sight and youre out of the way for other potential side-fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're fine and probably better than I- my husband is the one who usually deer hunts while I do mostly upland game birds and waterfowl. I would say you know your area best, and your Hunter safety course probably emphasized how to be the best in your area. We don't do stand hunting or blind hunting where we go in California otherwise we'd always come up empty. 100 yards tend to be the opening argument when my family has hunted deer (mostly mule), so scopes tend to be an essential item.</p>
<p>All the rules you list are an absolute given, and my family always tacks on to &quot;harvest as much as you can&quot; from the animal. We are the kind to actually eat what we kill.</p></div>		</li>
