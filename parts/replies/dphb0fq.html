			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of them like nuclear launch codes. They have a certain chemical structure which is extremely compatible with the &quot;fuck up my shit&quot; buttons in your brain. </p>
<p>It's like letting a little kid into the nuclear launch room. Just because he's small, doesn't mean he cant run all over the place and press all the buttons. </p>
<p>But not only is the kid small, he also has just the right chemical structure as to know just which buttons to press to cause a nuclear meltdown. This is in comparison to the adult engineer who knows not to press things he shouldn't. This is like the adult engineer having the wrong chemical structure, so even if you flooded the room with large quantities of adult engineers, they would not be able to cause a nuclear meltdown as fast as just a single kid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's designed to be very, very potent. Small does not equal harmless. </p>
<p>It's like the difference between a glass of 100% alcohol and the same amount of regular beer (~5% ABV). They are two &quot;doses&quot; of the same size, but one is going to have a huge effect on your body, probably make you ill, and one is going to have a minimal effect on your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>12 ounces of Everclear makes me want to vomit just thinking about it. That's... roughly the equivalent of like 20 shots of your standard booze, if my mental math is correct...</p>
<p>Non-mental math; 12 ounces of regular beer is worth 1.5 oz of 80-proof distilled spirits (40% alcohol), so each 100% alcohol shot is worth ~2.5 regular shots; 8 shots is 12 ounces, and 8 shots of 100% equals 8 /* 2.5 = 20 shots of booze.</p>
<p>Yay mental math!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This goes back to Avogadro's number. Even a tiny amount of a substance has more molecules than you can imagine. 100 micrograms of fentanyl (a standard dose in a medical setting) looks very small, but for a molar mass of ~340 g/mol, that's almost 180,000,000,000,000,000 molecules. Our brain has maybe 100,000,000,000 neurons (about as many stars as there are in the Milky Way.) Only some of those neurons are studded with little mu-opioid receptors, and fentanyl is just absurdly good at sticking to them. Activate enough, and the brain may not keep telling the lungs to breathe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not generally considered safe but the one of the main risk factors when mixing cocaine and alcohol are the cocaine metabolites reacting with the alcohol (or alcohol metabolite, I forget which) and this forms a very toxic substance. Adderal and alcohol don't have the same effects but mixing both is still not a good idea. </p></div>		</li>
