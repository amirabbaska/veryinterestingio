			<div class="markdown"><p>I am 45 and had my hearing checked two years ago because I started needing closed captioning on the TV. Was told could have hearing aids which kinda shocked cause felt like I was young for that. I haven't gotten them yet because not mentally ready. But I'm probably gonna make an appointment soon. Isn't this pretty rare? My doctor didn't seems to have much to say about it. I felt the need to share this story. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If your doctor says your need hearing aids, you should ask him what options there are. There might be some very minimalist ones out there that would work for you.</p>
<p>No shame, man.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They're much much smaller and better than they used to be - you can probably get one that's not at all noticeable unless someone is staring directly in your ear hole.</p>
<p>Not being able to hear is also considered to be a possible causal factor in cognitive decline - not clear why that is, but theories include that it cuts you off from easy contact with people and other activities so you withdraw and become less engaged over time / get less cognitive stimulation. Ain't worth it, you got half your life left.</p>
<p>I've been wearing glasses since high school. You just need glasses for your ears. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ </p></div>		</li>

<p>Unlike birds and fish, humans and other mammals are generally incapable of regrowing the cells of the inner ear that convert sound into neural signals when those cells are damaged by age or disease.</p>
