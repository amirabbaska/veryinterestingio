<p>Multi-core processing has really improved the quality of computing. A computer runs a lot of processes at once, even with a high GHz processor it still can't accomplish multiple things simultaneously. These multi-core processors are great! I recently upgraded my pc rig to include an 8-core 3.4 GHz. I never thought I could do some much at one time!</p>
<p>Don't forget RAM as well. Having a lot of available RAM really helps to power through these processes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not <em>just</em> the multi core processors that have improved but it's the multithreaded software getting written. Sure, one begets another, but one is only useful with the other. If software isn't purposefully written to take advantage of multiple cores it will not use them. </p>
<p>Note: an OS is a piece of software guys! Your OS letting you run a ton of programs and taking advantage of multiple cores is within the scope of this comment!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but even if all of your software is only designed to work on a single thread, having a quad- or octa-core allows much better performance just by being able to spread multiple single-thread applications across separate cores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can have parallelization within the software, and that's one way to make use of multicore processors, but there's also always the OS-level parallelization of putting different tasks on different cores. In the old days of single core, multitasking was done by allowing each task a tiny slice of time and then stopping the task and giving control to another task. </p>
<p>The problem with this so-called preemptive multitasking is that switching the context from one task to another introduces overhead. But if you have multiple cores, you don't have to do that anymore. (Or, at least, not as frequently).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is multithreading doing anything beyond improving single-core performance?  I use R for a number of applications, and without using the Parallel library, models run on my 3610qm (4 cores/8 threads, 2.3 GHz) tend to converge <del>must</del> much faster than my FX-8350 (8 cores/8 threads, 4.4 GHz).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clock rates are still a very important characteristic of a CPU's performance. You just have to recognize that comparing clock rates across different processor families doesn't really tell you anything.</p>
<p>Clock rate is very important, however, when comparing CPUs of the same family. A 7th gen core i7 at 2 GHz is going to definitely be slower than a 7th gen core i7 at 4Ghz.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, most tasks aren't CPU-bound. A 2x increase in clock rate won't translate into 2x faster execution for the majority of what you do on your computer.</p></div>		</li>
