			<div class="markdown"><p>The ice crystal can be assumed to be in a homogeneous supersaturation environment. This is to say that the pressure, temperature and water vapor available is constant around the ice crystal. Therefore the crystals should grow the same way, even branching at the same time. However this is not always the case, sometimes if there is a collision with another ice crystal, an arm can fragment or fall off. Additionally, another ice crystal could stick to it and then that would grow equally as well. So basically, even though the arms growing do not &quot;know&quot; how the other arms are growing, they still grow the same due to the homogeneous environment around the snowflake.</p></div>		</li>
