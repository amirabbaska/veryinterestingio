			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of corrections about the Running Machine.  </p>
<p>The very first version of the bicycle had no handlebars, no seat, and wasn't steerable. It was invented in 1790 and was called the Celerifere. While not a bicycle by modern standards, it is the very first vehicle which moved under the rider's power, and also consisted of two wheels arranged linearly. It wasn't until 20 years later that we saw the Running Machine.   </p>
<p>The Running Machine, a.k.a Draisienne, Laufmaschine, or Hobby Horse was invented around 1816. It improved upon the original design by adding a steerable front wheel and handlebars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things like the &quot;running machine&quot; were variously also called &quot;velocipede&quot; or &quot;dandy horse.&quot; Pedal-less but encompassing two wheels.</p>
<p>Now there are versions for toddlers called &quot;balance bikes.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably one of the best answers in this sub I've seen.
Innovation is similar to evolution, it comes with trial and error, a lot of errors in fact, before we get something slightly better. Repeat over hundreds of years you get what we have today. </p>
<p>It never amazes me to just imagine what our world would be like in 50 years time, I sure hope I live that long to find out myself, or future medicine would help me survive till then! </p></div>		</li>
