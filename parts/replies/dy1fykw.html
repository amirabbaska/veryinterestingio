<p>The first is that they form close to their parent stars, and the second is that they form beyond the frost line and migrate inwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A bit more on this:</p>
<p>No matter where you form a giant planet, you're going to need to start with an initial solid core that's 5 - 10 Earth-masses; anything less than that, and there's simply not enough gravity for the protoplanet to hold on to hydrogen gas that eventually leads to its runaway growth.</p>
<p>Now if your giant planet forms far out in a solar system where it's cold enough for ice to form, it's relatively easy to assemble that initial solid core, since you can build it from both rock and ice. On the other hand, if you're close to the star where it's too warm for ice to form, then forming a 5 - 10 Earth-mass core from just rock alone is pretty difficult, and requires an inner disk density that's unusually large.</p>
<p>In general, this is why the migration theory has been favored over hot Jupiters forming in place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any example of a rock and ice planet that is 5 to 10 Earth masses?  I am having a hard time accepting this cause as far as i know ice cannot sustsain them kinda planetary pressures/temperatures.  Wouldnt it all melt and evaporate or simply form oceans?  I'm getting lost in my thoughts....help?   How does ice allow for such large planets instead of rocks only planets?</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the contrary, we're fairly sure that a substantial proportion of Jupiter's current core is made of ice. In spite of reaching central temperatures around 30,000 degrees, the internal pressure is so phenomenally high that ice is actually quite stable there...hot, exotic ice, but ice nonetheless.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Because building a core from just rock alone limits the core mass to whatever rocky material is nearby. Building from ice as well increases the upper limit of that mass since you can now tap into two different kinds of nearby materials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water is peculiar compared to most other substances in that in conditions familiar to us it expands as it turns solid, so indeed you cannot get ”regular” ice (ice 1h) by adding pressure. But water has other solid phases with more compact crystalline structures. And you don’t need a giant planet for that; even the mantles and cores of the ice-rich moons and planetoids of the outer system are largely comprised of exotic phases of ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also important to note that when astronomers say &quot;ice&quot; they aren't necessarily talking about water ice. They're talking about solid not-rocks. Water forms an ice, but so do ammonia and methane, for example. The important thing about ices is that, since they are clumpy, it's easier to have them clump together to form massive objects. Once they are clumped together, they don't necessarily need to retain their solidity so long as there is enough mass for them to be self-gravitating.</p>
<p>So you can have the same materials of water, ammonia, methane, and rocks in the inner and outer solar system, but in the inner solar system the water, ammonia, and methane are gaseous which means you need to have some hefty gravity to start collecting it in the first place. But there is an outward radiation pressure which blows these gasses away, making it a race against time to clump up enough rocks to grab the gas. In the outer solar system, you have ice instead of gas, and now if a rock runs into the ice they have a chance of sticking together, making it much easier to collect. You also don't have the same problems with radiation pressure, which means the material you need to grow the planet sticks around for much longer, again making it easier to get large.</p>
<p>Uranus and Neptune are about 14 and 17 Earth masses, respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, just to make sure I understand correctly. This Theory is based on the idea that Jupiter formed a massive core due to ice. This caused it to move inward. As it moved inward, the core began to melt, and as it shrank, it moved farther out, until it reached a middle ground and fell into something resembling its current orbit</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.</p>
<p>Close to the Sun, there's just rock and gas....and that includes a lot of water vapor, which is also a gas. Rocky bodies grow somewhat slowly in this region, since they only have other rocky bits to gravitationally attract and add to their size.</p>
<p>Out at 3.5 AU and beyond, though, it was cold enough for water vapor to condense out into ice. That meant any rocky objects that were gathering up other rocky bits in their path could also gather up icy bits, too. That allowed them to grow larger and more quickly. </p>
<p>These distant ice &amp; rock bodies were able to grow large enough to hit that magical 10 Earth-mass threshold where suddenly they could now suck up hydrogen gas to add to their size along with all the rock and ice. That starts a very rapid feedback loop - since there's a lot of gas, they're suddenly able to grow very quickly, and the bigger they get, the more gas they can suck up. This is how a gas giant planet forms, and they end up with about a 10:1 hydrogen-to-rock/ice ratio.</p>
<p><em>Some time later</em> this newly-formed Jupiter planet migrates inwards - all the stuff whizzing around it saps the planet of its orbital energy and it spirals inwards. It would continue to do so, but it suddenly hit a resonance with Saturn, which caused a transfer of orbital energy through tidal effects, and both planets begin to then migrate outwards to their current locations.</p>
<p>At no point does the core melt. My whole point in talking about high-pressure ice was that even as the core is forming (say, when it reached 5 Earth-masses) the ice will stay as ice because it's still under incredible pressure, even as the interior of the forming core heats up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When Jupiter is at its closest to us right now, some 4.2 AU away, it's angular size is some 0.83 arc-minutes across (where 1 degree = 60 arc-minutes). By comparison, the Moon is about 30 arc-minutes across.</p>
<p>Now as a general rule of thumb, if you have have very good vision then anything larger than about 1 arc-minute will look like more than just a point source - so as of right now, it's still just a bit smaller than that threshold and we see it as a single point of light.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Jupiter orbited the Sun at a distance of 1.5 AU, then its closest approach would be just 0.5 AU away, which means it would have a maximum angular size of about <del>7 arc-seconds</del> 7 arc-minutes. At 1/4 the size of the Moon in the sky, that's definitely big enough to be seen as a disc. At that size you could almost certainly make out the two major dark brown cloud belts (the Northern and Southern Equatorial Belt) with good vision, but probably not much more than that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean 7 arc-minutes, not seconds, right? Also just curious where you got your numbers from. This is clearly your specialty here so I'm deferring to you because I got different results with the same math. I used 31 arc-minutes (1860 arc-seconds) for the moon's angular diameter and 3.97 AU for Earth-Jupiter closest approach from the October 2011 opposition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, in terms of brightness Jupiter in Mars's place would be 10 times to Earth at closest approach and about 3 times close to the Sun. I believe that means it will be 3^2 * 10^2 times as bright, so about a thousand times. That's about 7.5 magnitudes making it about magnitude -10.5, comparable to the brightness of a half Moon. We wouldn't feel Jupiter in Mars's orbit, but we sure would see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If Jupiter orbited the sun at 1.5au, The theoretical closest distance to Earth would be 0.5 AU. For comparison, the closest recorded distance between Earth and Mars was 0.37 AU. The closest Jupiter ever gets to Earth is 3.97 AU. At that point, it has an angular diameter of 49.6 arcseconds, which is about 1/37th the diameter of the moon which has an angular diameter of 1860 arcseconds.</p>
<p>At 0.5 AU from Earth, Jupiter would have an angular diameter of 316.8 arcseconds, or about 1/6th the angular diameter of the moon. It would be very bright (I havan't done the math on the brighntess) with the disc easily visible and it might even be possible to make out some detail with the naked eye.</p></div>		</li>
