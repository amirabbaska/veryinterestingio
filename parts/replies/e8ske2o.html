<p>Also, the technical term for Black boxes is Flight Recorders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I thought it was FDR (Flight Data Recorder) and CVR (Cockpit Voice Recorder)? Is Flight Recorder just a blanket term for both?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FDR  and CVR are different systems that are stored every flight. This information is sent to the black box but the black box only records a small church of time like 30 minutes so its continually updating and in some jets ejected before a crash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about a situation where some systems of the plane keep operating after a crash and deceive the black box to keep overwriting? Wouldn't the last 30 minutes be after the crash and not help at all?</p>
<p>How does the black box knows to stop writing data?</p></div>		</li>
