			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to look at it is the lie detector is simply an advance interrogation technique. Make the public think there is a magic machine that can tell truthfullness, hook them up to it, act like the gobbledygook noises mean something legitimate and then tell the applicant the machine doesn't believe him on pertinent questions and see if they change the story. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup.  Actually you can throw off the galvanic skin response with any muscle flex, but the butthole is easy to conceal...  You can also set it off by recalling a memory that induced strong emotions, which is even easier to conceal, but takes a little longer sometimes to trigger the response.</p>
<p>Neat note, it is also called the &quot;startle response&quot; because any time you hear a loud noise or &quot;bang&quot; or get startled, it triggers this reaction. I used to test my devices by hooking people up to them and having a conversation and over a couple of minutes talking slower and quieter then suddenly yelling loudly....  works 100% time.</p>
<p>The lie detector as a whole (being complete bullshit) on the other hand... is more like 60% of the time, it works every time. lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree that they're bullshit - at least in my experience having taken several polygraph tests. The more accurate ones included control questions. One was by a retired policeman who didn't give me any control questions and falsely concluded that I was lying. Control questions help a more skilled examiner know that my ANS and neurotransmitter activity is unique and a polygraph exam can't be used to reliably determine by veracity.</p></div>		</li>
