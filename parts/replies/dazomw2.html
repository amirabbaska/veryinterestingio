			<div class="markdown"><p>There really are two reasons. The first is on a molecular level. It is fundamentally <strong>wrong</strong> when you say glass is clear because it is structured. The reason a sheet of glass is transparent is because it's <strong>amorphous and has no long range order</strong> in its molecular structure and therefore repeated absorption of a specific wavelength of light cannot occur which would otherwise give glass a specific colour i.e. <em>it is so unstructured that it does not absorb light.</em></p>
<p>The second has to do with the number and angles of the surfaces involved in scattering of light.</p></div>		</li>
