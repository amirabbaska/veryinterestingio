			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I've always thought that plain carbonated water tasted peculiarly different from regular water.  I used to always simply attribute it to the fizz, but it is probably the acid I'm sensing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I can't stand the taste of carbonated water. I think some people are just more sensitive to it than others.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's just an acquired taste. I always despised it, but in the last couple months I've become seriously obsessed with Topo Chico and crave it constantly and prefer it over regular. But Topo Chico is something special </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they aren't correct. The water becomes more basic as it gets flat. That's why it tastes different. *co2 leaves, bicarbonate protonates, which removes free protons from solution causing an increase in pH. More basic,  meaning an increase hydroxide ions</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, but it starts off acidic, so it doesn't necessarily reach neutral pH, let alone go past it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I agree if you are strictly meaning basic is above 7. Basic here refers to hydroxide ions. So, more correct then would be to say an increase in  hydroxide ions and a decrease in hydronium ions. I was trying to keep simple(r) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it is still not that acidic I believe. A lot of those answers aren't entirely accurate I assume to give a simple explanation. It has acid in it but it doesn't mean it has a high pH. I actually performed a few analysis last month in my laboratory on a carbonated water drink for a company. The pH was about 6.3 which is close to a neutral pH ot 7.</p>
<p>Edit: changed the pH value to 6.3</p></div>		</li>
