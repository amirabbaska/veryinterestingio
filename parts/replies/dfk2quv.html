<p>Kickstarter was based on the idea of &quot;I have an idea and a design, but I have no capital to produce my first line of product. If you invest in me, you'll get one of the first products I make.&quot; </p>

<p>even this is incorrect, kickstarters are the exchange of capital for a promise. The promise can completely frigging fail and the funders can get nothing. It doesn't usually happen, but it happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pedantically correct. But that doesn't change the fact that the original promise was one of the first production models.</p>
<p>The creator can break that promise, but it doesn't change what the promise was or what the purpose of the website is.</p>
<p>Kickstarter vets their projects for this exact reason. If you promise a teleporter to your customers, Kickstarter probably won't let you post it on their site because it isn't feasible. They don't believe in your ability to deliver, so they'll kill the project before it's posted. You are supposed to come to them with some sort of proof of concept that shows you know what to do and all you need is money to do it.</p></div>		</li>
