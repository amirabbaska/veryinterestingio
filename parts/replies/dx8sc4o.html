<p>It's really common in wine too. If you point it out when wine tasting the person pouring will either not know what you're talking about, or shoot you the &quot;oh, they know what they're doing&quot; look. That look may also be a little sheepish since it's not always a desired outcome.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, there's the <a href="http://www.camparigroup.com/en/brands/liqueursothers/cynar" target="_blank">Cynar</a> liqueur as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You see, cheese, meat and chocolate are often accompanoed by red wine. This is because fatty food enhances the flavor. The actual mechanism is escaping from me right now, but I believe it were the tannines that break down fat, creating a whole new taste experience!</p>
<p>Whilst I am not sure if its the Cynarin acid as /u/btribble mentioned, but an acid none the less.</p>
<p>Retired from bartending after many countries and maaany different restaurants. Red wine is my favorite pass time drink too.</p></div>		</li>
