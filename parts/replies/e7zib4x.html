			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as we can tell it's all a strictly biological process.  Your body receives input from its environment (light, sound, pressure, etc.) through specialized neurons that react to that type of stimuli, those neurons cause other neurons in your brain to react, and depending on how all that works out other sets of neurons leading to your muscle cells react, causing movement, AKA your &quot;ability to do this and that&quot;.  We experience this as thought, but the thought doesn't enter our brain of its own accord it's just a reaction to the environment.  We absolutely 100% have not observed thoughts that aren't a reaction to some physical process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But what about really abstract thoughts that have nothing to do with the here-and-now? If I’m sitting on a bus and looking out the window, but I’m thinking about the nature of reality, or critiquing art in my head, or something equally abstract, how is that the result of what my brain is being fed at this moment while I look out the window?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A computer converts 1s and 0s into tangible information for humans to understand. Eg:1 and 0 go through a chip in the order 01101000 and it converts it to decimal 104. The computer knows that the standard ascii value for h is 104 and displays that. Do you mean that the brain does not convert it's information but instead our consciousness is just 1s and 0s?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could I have clarification? You seem to be implying that all thoughts require external input. I doubt that is the case, and i doubt  there is unambiguous and unanimous agreement that it is the case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The general answer is &quot;computation&quot;. Computation is the process of turning patterns into other patterns. In the case of your mind, you can think of this as the process of turning the patterns of your sensory input-- what you see, hear, taste, smell, and so on, right now and at every point in your life up until now-- into the patterns of how you act.</p>
<p>Your thoughts are intermediate patterns that connect these things. Ruminations on what's happened to you, what it means, what matters to you, what might happen next, and ultimately what you will do about it. New patterns being extracted from the patterns of your experience, which in turn guide the patterns that are your behavior. </p>
<p>Now for neurons. What is a neuron? Basically it's a cell that can fire a little electrical pulse-- or not-- based on whether it's currently being stimulated by another pulse. This encompasses what a transistor can do-- basically pass or block a bit of information based on another bit of information. A tiny, microscopic &quot;if/then&quot; statement. </p>
<p>It turns out that it's possible to do <em>any computation</em>-- any conversion of one pattern into another-- with networks of transistors plugged into each other. Even more powerfully, there are some networks that are mathematically equivalent to a kind of information-processing device called a Turing Machine. Turing Machines-- and the networks that implement them-- are single devices which are in principle capable of doing every possible computation, if given appropriate input. Your computer or phone are examples of Turing Machines made out of electrical transistors. </p>
<p>Your brain is almost certainly another kind of Turing Machine, one made out of networks of neurons, which are at least as good as transistors at processing information-- turning patterns into other patterns. Your brain is doing some absurdly complicated pattern finding, developing complex and nuanced reactions to what's happening to you; those reactions and internal brain-patterns being your thoughts, emotions, and intuitions.</p>
<p>Exactly <em>what</em> computations the brain is doing we don't yet know. But we are starting to untangle all the neural connections in the brain, and meanwhile we are using computers to simulate more and more advanced AIs that can extract more and more nuanced patterns on their own. Someday in the future we will no doubt develop a good model of precisely how the brain does what it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a bit of a difference in that there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuronal_noise" target="_blank">noise in the system</a> - this is thought to be inherent noise, and not just &quot;external signals we haven't identified&quot; - meaning that neurons are probabilistic computational devices with some element of randomness, not strictly deterministic computers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there general agreement that the brain is a Turing Machine? I feel like consciousness (a by-product of the brain's workings) is a Turing Machine in the sense that we can run through any algorithm in our head at the conscious level (albeit super slowly). However, at the neuronal level, what reason do we have to believe that you can run any computation in a generalize-able manner?</p>
<p>I think the distinction matters because the latter implies that you can create consciousness using a computer if you had sufficient computing power. To believe the former you would need to believe that you can simulate a Turing Machine with a non-Turing Machine.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm just confused and all this is semantics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Christ, but you’re asking an insanely complicated question. The experts who’ve studied for years in high academia can’t explain it, you won’t find an answer here. The best information I can give is that the brain seems like a pattern recognition machine. But how thoughts, ideas, fantasies form out of that - I don’t see that ever being eli5 </p></div>		</li>
