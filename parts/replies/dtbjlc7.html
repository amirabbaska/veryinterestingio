			<div class="markdown"><p>Bullseye stopped making chromium green decorative glass in 2016 because it was carcinogenic. Chromium also shows up in modern green ceramic glazes. Many chromium compounds are vibrantly colored and do not fade with heat and time, but also try to kill the artist.</p>
<p>At the risk of making things up, maybe this was their way of representing poisoned swords? The soldiers themselves were unglazed so they didn't just put it on everything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to corrosion protection, chrome plating also adds wear resistance, which would be appropriate on weapons like swords. Today, chrome plating is used for high-wear applications, like seat-belt buckles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that I have any evidence to the contrary, but I don't think chrome plating would be valuable on swords for the purpose of wear resistance.</p>
<p>After all, you smash them with hammers and grind them on a stone to restore their combat value after a battle, and I'm pretty sure any type of plating will mostly just flake off on impact with armor/hard surfaces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a properly plated chrome coating, dents and dings would not make the coating flake off. Having chrome flaking off after deformation of the substrate would indicate an adhesion test failure.</p>

<p>Hypothetically (because this never happened in history) the edge would not be chrome plated, but the body would be, to allow for sharpening. </p></div>		</li>
