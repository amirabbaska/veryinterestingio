<p>Determination of a fire normally starts by examining the area of the least damage and working your way in towards the area of the most damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what I've heard a couple times in the last couple/few months on the news when they were interviewing whomever about investigating some fires.</p>
<p>It struck me as the opposite of what I previously understood to be the method, where they find the most burnt area, and start investigating there to determine how the flame started.</p>
<p>The outside-in method makes much more sense to me: ensure nothing around/outside the area OBIVOUSLY caused the fire, <em>before</em> going onto the really hard to investigate parts (ie: where it's most burned).</p>
<p>Is this a new method/approach, or have I just had my brain clouded by fiction for so long that it seems new?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes you might feel like that, but I have been in situations where we were <strong>SURE</strong> the fire happened one way while the residents insist: </p>
<p><em>&quot;No Mr. Fire Investigator it could not have happened that way.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Further investigation resulted in the resident being vindicated.</p>
<p>Listening to what your witnesses have to say and then testing the hypothesis is very important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Freshman year, a girl in my class died in a trailer fire. Cause was concluded as her falling asleep without turning off the straightening iron that was on carpet next to her mirror. I've always been curious- imagining that she was home alone and there were no witnesses to her using the straightening iron (and that the iron uses buttons rather than switches to control the on/off), how would they have determined this?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be as easy as finding the area of origin and there being nothing else there except the curling iron. </p>
<p>You can also send the item out to a lab to have an engineer X-Ray the device to determine if it was on or not.</p></div>		</li>
