			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally though, baking soda works. I once went out of town for 3 weeks, and my fridge broke down during that time. When I came back, my frozen meat, homemade sauces and other preserved food had been sitting in a warm fridge in a tropical country for 3 weeks. You cannot even begin to imagine the smell. I threw everything out, got the fridge fixed but the smell wouldn't leave. So I put some baking powder on a tray in the middle of the fridge and some in the freezer and left it overnight. </p>
<p>Removed the baking soda in the morning and a LOT of the odour was gone. Wiped down the fridge with vinegar, let it dry. Good as new. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's great for a one-off treatment used the way you used it (large surface area, exposure time short so it absorbs smells before it is rendered useless by moisture).</p>
<p>The other good one for doing this is newspaper. Clean/wipe out the fridge like you did, then pack it with loosely crumpled newspaper and leave overnight. This is also great for removing that new plastic smell from any food storage boxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm someone that used to clean fridges as part of my job.  3-4 a day and many of them were full of moldy stinky food, a good portion of it would be spilled under the crispers at the bottom of the fridge and left for the better part of a year. (University students are gross)</p>
<p>My secret: Soap and water followed by an antibacterial cleaner.  </p>
<p>Since the smells are created by bacteria, a good cleaning followed by a rub down with something like bleach or ammonia (never both, they react with each other). Process removes the food for the bacteria and then kills those that stick around.  Problem solved.</p>
<p>Oh, also. Unplug the fridge first for a couple hours so that your freezer does not cause the water you are using to just freeze onto surfaces, and lay out some towels at the base of your fridge because step one should be done with a sloppy amount of soap and water.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does work to a degree because when I was little I tasted baking soda that was in the fridge for who knows how long. Needless to say it tasted like everything in the fridge and I learned a lesson. Baking soda is disgusting, baking soda in the fridge is truly disgusting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should hold off on that since he's not correct.  The most potent smells that can come from your fridge are usually organic acids or amines.  Both of these react with baking soda to make compounds that don't smell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But there can be a lot of smelly molecules in your refrigerator, more than will happen to drift past the baking soda. Something that would aid this process is a LARGE SURFACE AREA.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's still absolutely right.  He's not saying that baking soda is useless.  What he's saying is that the baking soda doesn't work as they sell it, and if you did spread it out, it would just get moldy and smell anyway.  In other words, it doesn't functionally work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Arm &amp; Hammer actually sells boxes with  mesh filters on two sides. You remove the cardboard covering each side prior to use. This greatly increases the surface area and odor absorption. They cost maybe $1.</p>
<p>Activated charcoal probably does a better job, but it's also a bit more expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the entire box was mesh, the soda is still in block form, giving almost the lowest surface area to weight possible. </p>
<p>As an aside, where I come from baking soda in the fridge isn't &quot;a thing&quot; and the fridges smell fine. Just keep it clean, don't fall for the marketing. </p></div>		</li>
