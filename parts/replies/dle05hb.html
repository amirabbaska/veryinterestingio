			<div class="markdown"><p>It would entirely depend on your spark method.
The light emitted by hydrogen burning is at a constant frequency so you would get <em>Something</em> but what it would look like i am as curious as you are.</p>
<p>Just spit balling, If you pushed an arc into the gases you would see nothing because it would be lost in the brightness of the arc.</p>
<p>If you fired electrons into the chamber you might see something in the microwave spectrum from the hydrogen and light blue from the oxygen if you had enough power going into it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>endothermic reaction</p>

<p>Wait, I don't think that's right. The enthalpy of combustion is -286 kJ/mol. This is negative, so the reaction is exothermic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The combustion of hydrogen in an oxygen atmosphere is not just exothermic, but tends to be <em>violently</em> exothermic, under most circumstances (although, if you get a jet of pure H_2, it burns nice and calmly in air) .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reaction is endothermic and there's no heat to excite electrons to start the reaction. The gasses would just stay there if you didn't <em>make</em> them burn. The spark is there to start the fire. The problem is that H and O reaction isn't self sustaining, especially at those temperatures, so you would need to provide a constant flow of excited electron to make H and O atoms react. an arc is the cheap easy way but I theorize it would ruin OP's experiment since the flame is his primary purpose.</p></div>		</li>
