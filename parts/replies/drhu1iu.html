			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotally, when I've taken karate classes and done a lot of kneeling on wood floors, I had to cut my toenails like every week, as often as I cut my fingernails. Not sure how to treat which of these theories is responsible, since heavier use will mean more blood flow.</p></div>		</li>
