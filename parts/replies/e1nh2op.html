			<div class="markdown"><p>First, I’m pasting many of these from a Google Doc, which is is why these may go up quickly. </p>
<p>In general I think it’s better if research is open rather than closed. Especially for publicly supported studies, there is no obvious reason to restrict the results to affiliates of dues-paying organizations rather than the general public. In many cases it’s difficult even for us to gain access to all relevant articles for a given project; I can only imagine how frustrating it must be for people who aren’t similarly affiliated. In my opinion, the only publicly funded research that should not be made public is that which clearly falls under the definition of “information hazard”: true information that if disseminated can cause harm. Blueprints for nuclear weapons and dangerous viruses certainly qualify. </p>
<p>As for open science, I support going further than open access and changing incentives to encourage pre-registration of research plans in select subfields, because the current system of closeted research is tremendously wasteful: we never learn about studies that don’t pan out, so we often go down the same blind alley. It’s also impossible to know if we’re wasting our time pursuing a project that ten other labs are working on. Better to intelligently decide to collaborate or compete and easily find collaborators. But it’s also unwise to radically change a critical complex system all at once; better to start small, try it out, and scale up if appropriate. So I support public pre-registration of all research plans involving gene drive, and we’ll see how it goes from there.</p>
<p>I don’t think this changes the role of scientists; we’ll still be the ones who do this for a living, but I’d welcome help from anyone remotely interested in helping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way, thanks to everyone for raising this to the (current) top post. I spend most of my time trying to get people to care about this. I believe the future of our civilization will be primarily determined by the technologies that we invent and the wisdom with which we deploy them (or refrain), so determining how best to safely ascend and explore the tree of knowledge is perhaps the most important question we face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have yet to see a physics publication which isn't freely available. This is because they submit their papers to classical journals like &quot;Physical Review&quot; (peer-reviewed) and also upload the same paper to <a href="https://arXiv.org" target="_blank">arXiv.org</a> (not peer-reviewed, but free).</p>
<p>Then they always cite both, like this for example: &quot;Our results were published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.96.122002" target="_blank">Physical Review D <strong>96</strong>, 122002 (2017)</a> and are of course also available <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02222" target="_blank">at the arxiv</a>.&quot; (from <a href="http://www.xenon1t.org/" target="_blank">xenon1t.org/</a>)</p>
<p>Maybe thats also a good model for other fields? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. We post all our manuscripts as preprints on bioRxiv. And it's working: more and more labs accept preprints as legitimate contributions and give credit for them. Notably, our<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2016/06/06/057307" target="_blank"> daisy drive</a> <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/21/115618" target="_blank">work</a> <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/02/06/104877" target="_blank">is</a> still entirely preprints (likely to change soon, after nearly 2 years waiting around on various journals) despite playing a major role in discussions of gene drive. That's largely because there are few other reasonably efficient ways of making a localized gene drive system out there, but it's still a good example of growing acceptance, defined above all by the willingness to cite preprints. So I do think we will win on preprints in the life sciences. I'm more skeptical of our chances for pre-registering and peer-reviewing research plans before experiments, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/gene-editing-can-drive-science-to-openness-1.20043" target="_blank">save perhaps for fields like gene drive</a> where there are ethical reasons to require it: since it's intended to affect the shared environment, closeted gene drive research effectively denies people a voice in critical early-stage decisions intended to affect them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this whole heartedly.</p>
<p>How could us upandcoming and expert scientists  alike generate an online model to both keep the critical peer review process but lose the pay to view/submit and proprietary impact factor system? </p>
<p>Let's say a trusted understudy designs a beautiful online forum, how will you get leading researchers like yourself to submit hard earned results there instead of Nature? Perhaps if it starts on an ivy campus and grows from there? A difficult part is that publishing in Nature boosts your career, but if suddenly <em>all</em> Harvard research went through a free forum for Harvard labs, and it was also open to others, you would not risk submitting amazing work to an invisible forum. Then suddenly you have UCLA follow with a similar online journal, then another, and they are receiving the same cite index as the biggest pay-to-submit journals.</p>
<p>How could we accomplish it?</p></div>		</li>
