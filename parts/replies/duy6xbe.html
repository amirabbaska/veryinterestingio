			<div class="markdown"><p>The part about low oxygen environments quickly incapacitating people is why oxygen sensors are installed in areas where oxygen can be displaced by other gases.  In the area where we store the stem cells collected from patients for autologous stem cell transplantation, an oxygen sensor triggers a warning light if oxygen levels fall too low as there have been deaths in this setting.  </p>

<p>The cells are stored in vapor phase liquid nitrogen and if cells are being frozen or if a number tanks fill at once, despite the enhanced ventilation, the O2 concentration can fall.  My office is outside our lab and when I see the warning light on I always open the door to the lab from the hall and check the lab staff, just in case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These sensors are basically used everywhere liquid gases that aren't oxygen are used. I've seen them in a research facility around liquid helium &quot;generators&quot; and nitrogen-cooled electromagnets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily actually, depending on the ambient oxygen ratio. Your body doesn't use all the oxygen it circulates from a single breath. So  a surprisingly high level of oxygen would still be bound to hemoglobin when it returns to your lungs. If you took a breath and the ambient air had no or very low oxygen then you may actually off load oxygen back into the environment. There would be no way of know in the heat of the moment but breath holding would reduce chance of losing consciousness in no oxygen environments. However, as you breath hold your CO2 will climb which can also produce issues. Really either way you have seconds not minutes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a practical scenario, I doubt it. I've had luck with breathing slowly (4 breaths per minute) in treating high altitude headaches. Although it could have just been that the relaxation and lower BP did it.</p></div>		</li>
