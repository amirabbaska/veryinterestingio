			<div class="markdown"><p>This is over generalized to the point of almost not being true, at least not the answer I would have given (source: game developer with 11+ years experience who's been though 3 console generations).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You anticipate developments and design a game for hardware that doesn't yet exist. A big developer will also get engineering samples prior to their sale to the general public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrong, most devs do not know what new tech is coming out until a year or less before it hits shelves.  For instance, as a dev at a major studio, we did not know anything about the XB1 until a few months before its public unveil.  What did we know? A few ideas about specs it may or may not end up with (general storage quotes, numbers of cores, etc...).  We only got our hands on actual dev kits around 8 months out from launch.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don't release for hardware that is brand new, but release for hardware that is a couple years old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also not true - launch titles are made to be working on brand new tech.  Even if you were talking purely PC this is also not true, you don't develop to the tech in that case, you develop for the rendering platform (directX, openGL, etc...) which is the middleman between your game and the tech.  So as a developer, you really don't care what new graphics cards are coming down the line - you care a lot more about tech in consoles (memory, CPU, etc...) than you do video cards, for sure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but in the later stages of development your minimum hardware requirements are the current state of the art/most expensive hardware, and by the time you actually release your minimum requirements are now common hardware.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also not true - again, if you're a launch title on a new generation of consoles, the requirements are for hardware that is not all that common.  If you're developing for PC, you tend to target minimum requirements that are a bit lower, not for any timeline of development reason, it's simply good economics to not require people to upgrade their system to play your game (since PCs have more upgrade jumps).</p>
<p>So, now that I've torn that all apart, how do developers really develop for technology growths?  It's 2 things: modular design and over designing.</p>
<p>1) Modular Design - nothing in your game should be so connected to other aspects that if something were to have a major tech breakthrough, you start all over.  For example, if say, rendering techniques for lighting suddenly got better tonight my company would not scrap it's current game to start all over - we would merely update the lighting engine and move on with a now better looking game.  It's the same for any major component to a game.</p>
<p>2) Over Designing - so modular design explains how you upgrade, whereas over designing explains where you set the bar.  We might not be able to, say, render 100 guys on screen right now, but that's our vision and that's where we start.  We throw 100 guys on screen, the game runs at 10fps for months at a time, and you do your best.  Why? Because FPS doesn't mean anything when you're developing, nothing is optimized yet.  At some point, after you've crammed in all the content you want for the vision, THEN you worry about FPS and optimizations begin.  This is a huge give and take aspect - art will cut back on polygons until they're not comfortable with cuts, engineering will optimize code until they feel that's all they can do, etc...  So at some point your 100 guys on screen now renders at 47fps and we've done everything we can to optimize what's there, well then there's only one place left to give, content.  Your 100 guys becomes 77, and you're at a smooth 60fps.  But it doesn't stop there, now QA gets involved and finds that if you stand just right the fps drops to 55, so you strip out a few more guys, and so on, until eventually you end up with the shipped version of 62 guys on screen.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, this all works because YOU the consumer don't know what you didn't get to see.  My 62 guys on screen looks epic because we pushed ourselves to a goal well past anything you've seen before, AND you never saw it with 100 so it doesn't look 'scaled back'</p>
<p>I've shipped 5 games in my career and never once have we designed to some imaginary concept of future tech.  We simply set the bar beyond anything we know we can do (now or in the future) and then make smart cut backs as the ship date approaches and the reality of what's achievable sets in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was really informative. Thanks for making the effort to explain all that. Honestly, I always has the concerns that OP had, thinking that newer games for current-gen systems were made for last-gen, and thus not as good as they could be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the industry since 8+ years and you are right. I have a counter example of a project I worked on where we decided to have a 60FPS before even doing the Alpha. You have to know that the console was already released so we all knew the real limitations. Still, the mandatory 60FPS was a pain to keep but it was a very nice bonus that helped us reach the gold master. Still this is only a counter example and you are totally right that most AAA don't really care about FPS until we reach the later stages of production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh for sure, if you scope early you can walk across that gold finish line.  And of course you do optimizations and stabilizations along the way for demos.</p>
<p>But in the grand scheme, when it comes to games it's usually easier to strip out last minute (no matter how painful) then it is to scramble to fill a void.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A good example of a company doing this is CIG with Star Citizen. Despite having released components for moden computers they have stated very vehemently that they are building for the top end systems now, so that when they do release next year, they're kind of future proofed. They are already pushing out 4k+ textures and have begun early implementation of VR.</p>
<p>Needless to say people with slightly older computers, like mine, have to listen to it cry out in pain every time I want to blow up some space ships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>cause I trust the opinion of a guy by the name of /u/weed420lord...</p>
<p>But, to counter your point, they just released two massive updates in the last month. It added more ships, more game mechanics, polished things more. Not to mention that people at PAX East got their first taste of the FPS module. They just opened a new studio that harbours a ton of former Crytek employees, so they can further refine the games code. Chris Roberts has in fact just flown to the UK to start MoCap shooting for Squadron 42 and other in game assets.</p>
<p>Nope, nothing of quality coming out of that studio at all... nope.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasn't Crysis made specifically to test the bounds of the Crysis engine? I'm pretty sure it came out of the gate in beast mode because otherwise it wouldn't have fulfilled it's original purpose. I mean, yeah, if you can make your benchmark a top of the line shooter and test your product WHILE recouping costs, then why not? Sure it's a little overboard, but it sure made waves when it launched. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With Crysis, Crytek tried to predict the market and failed. The engine was built to take advantage of monster single-chip GPU's with fewer, more powerful cores. Instead, the market swayed towards multi-chip GPU's, a larger focus on SLI setups, and more cores with less relative power.</p>
<p>And of course it was made to test what the engine can do, but the fact that it ran like shit even on lowest settings (while looking worse than <del><a href="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/taPUMcudgew/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">Half Life 1</a></del><a href="http://crytekfiles.com/files/9296_screen_6c3226986b4cce2eebc99e74771f5851.jpg" target="_blank">Half Life 2</a> as it did) is more of a tech miss.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br />
That first picture was probably the result of running a modded game. I replaced it with one of Cryteks official screenshots of Ultra Low configuration. It's not as bad as I remember it, but the performance still wasn't good. That I remember checking.</p></div>		</li>
