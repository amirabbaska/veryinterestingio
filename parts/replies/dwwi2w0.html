			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-custodial parent or grandparent kidnappings are the major driver of child kidnapping. Whether or not the child is actually in danger is questionable those cases. </p>
<p>Overall, the number of stereotypical stranger kidnappings is vanishingly small  in the United States, something like 100 cases per year in the entire country. Also that number has been stable since the 1970s.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An Amber alert report from 2013 shows that of 196 alerts, involving 243 children, minus the 47 that were false or hoaxes, 95 % were recovered in 72 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does data exist for what the recovery rate for comparable situations would be absent an Amber alert? Does issuing an alert cause a significant change?</p></div>		</li>
