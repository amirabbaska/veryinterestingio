<p>Stuff is cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, he only mentioned part of the story. Namely the absorbed lights gets immediately reemitted in the form of longer wavelength light. </p>
<p>For example a white shirt only absorbs a little light and therefore reemitts only a little infrared light. A black shirt however absorbs a wide array of frequencies and reemitts it as a lot of infrared light. That's why you heat up in black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean everything emits infrared constantly but an object won't necessarily be spitting out infrared photons 1:1 for every one it absorbs. Otherwise things wouldn't heat up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why we see color, because that red apple is absorbing most of the incoming light, but reflecting the &quot;red&quot; wavelength back outward, where our eyes pick it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's still a rather short time. Mostly because the speed of light is so fast compared to every day distances. If two mirrors are 10 meters apart, it takes light only 30 ns (nanoseconds) to go from one to the other.</p>
<p>In a milisecond, that's 33000 bounces. Even if the mirror reflects 99.99% of all light each bounce, that still only leave 3.7% of the original amount after 1 milisecond. And 99.99% reflectivity is very high for a mirror, that's very specialized stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any other sorts of mirrors that aren't physical mirrors?</p>
<p>Or another way to ask the same question is:<br />
Is there any way to reflect light without a physical reflective surface, and what efficiency might be possible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if a surface is reflective, do the photons literally bounce off it, rather than be absorbed/destroyed? </p>
<p>If so, what property of the material causes that? </p>
<p>To me it seems easier to think of a shiny surface just reflecting waves, but seems more difficult if we talk about photons. </p></div>		</li>
