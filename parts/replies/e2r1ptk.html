			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect and not how shades work. You don’t produce darker shades by just lowering brightness. The way light actually works, you lower brightness, increase saturation, and hue shift toward the nearest hue with a lower luminosity. You’re getting different colors because your methodology is incorrect. </p>
<p>Yellow, Cyan, and magenta have a higher luminosity (or perceived brightness) than red, green, and blue. This is why when you view a black and white image colors like yellow are closer to white than ones like blue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, but cyan and magenta should be just as bright as yellow, but magenta seems to be the darkest, and yellow the brightest, and cyan in the middle</p>
<p>additionally blue seems a lot darker than green</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not true.  The colour sensitive cones in our eyes come in three types of differing sensitivity.  The medium (green) sensitive cones are the most sensitive, followed by long (red), followed by short (blue).  So for red, green and blue light sources of equal luminosity, green will appear brightest to our eyes, and blue will appear darkest. We see yellow when our two most sensitive cone types (long+medium/red+green) are stimulated.  We see magenta when the two weakest types (long and short/red and blue) are stimulated.  So for yellow, cyan, and magenta sources of equal luminosity, people with typical colour perception will always see the yellow as the brightest, and the magenta as the darkest.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be because our eyes are less sensitive to shorter wavelengths of light.</p>

<p>As far as colors like cyan, magenta and yellow being brighter than red green and blue, you have to consider that they're reflecting more light since it absorbs less color spectrum</p></div>		</li>
