<p>The windows &quot;troubleshoot&quot; basically does some ping tests to the default gateway, does a /flushdns and a /registerdns, refreshes DHCP (if enabled), and disables/re-enables the network adapter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Often my troubleshooter fails to do these things and suggests ridiculous solutions like changing some random coffeeshop wifi network from another city to &quot;always connect.&quot;</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to <em>force</em> the reset-the-adaptor process and skip all the other baloney?  99% of the time that's the solution anyway.</p></div>		</li>
