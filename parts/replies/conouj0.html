			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>THAT IS THE CORRECT ANSWER.</strong>, Coca Cola used to use coca, which is where cocaine comes from. At that time it needed far less sugar because coca extract is much less bitter than caffeine. To cover up the bitterness of the caffeine, you need boatloads of phosphoric acid, citric acid, malic acid, and/or sweetener. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coca-Cola still uses coca leaves, with the cocaine removed. </p>
<p>They have always had caffiene, from the Kola nut which is an original ingredient as well.</p>
<p>A major spike in sugar content came when switching from the more expensive cane sugar to high fructose corn syrup, due to rising sugar prices. HFCS was cheaper and more abundant, and thus most all soda companies simply added more, because customers liked the taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong, but I think that the caffeine extracted is even more bitter than the caffeine naturally in a coffee crop (where it is balanced more naturally), plus the roasting and brewing process (&quot;extraction&quot;) of the beans is basically what makes coffee less bitter if done right or more bitter if done poorly. Higher caffeine coffee is ALSO more bitter than lower caffeine varieties.</p>
<p>Also, coffee, even with your 2 spoons of sugar, is far less sweet (and more bitter) than Coca Cola. It's just that coffee gets &quot;bad sweet&quot; very quickly so we never get it as sweet as Coca Cola. Adding creamer/milk is adding additional sweetener essentially as well, which must be factored in if you do. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The extra sugar is needed to balance the high acidity of soda. Coffee is acidic but it isn't as acidic as soda.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and coffee tastes very bitter. You know what tastes bitter too? Caffeine.</p>
<p>Caffeine is a strong bittering agent. Try putting some directly on your tongue. Cola isn't supposed to be bitter, whereas coffee is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually doesn't take much sugar to cover the caffeine. I sometimes make a heavily caffeinated light lemonade, into a 4 liters batch goes a cup of sugar, a cup of lemon juice, and about 1.2 grams of caffeine. That's about twice as potent as mountain dew, and about 1/3 the sugar. Tastes great. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just use powdered caffeine then? I tried this with crushed caffeine pills and although I could cover up the bitter taste with sugar, there was still a lingering sickly medical ingredient taste. Maybe I used the wrong type of caffeine? (Are there different types?)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a direct source for that? I didn't see it in the sources. It looks like the pH of vinegar is around <a href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/acidsbases/a/phtable.htm" target="_blank">2.2</a> or <a href="http://www.culturesforhealth.com/testing-acidity-strength-vinegar" target="_blank">2.4</a>, and the pH of coke is around 2.52 <a href="http://www.livescience.com/7198-acids-popular-sodas-erode-tooth-enamel.html" target="_blank">[1]</a> <a href="http://www.selah.k12.wa.us/soar/sciproj2005/marshaln.html" target="_blank">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>It really suprises me that they are at all similar and makes me wish that someone invented a sweetener free coca so people could taste what it is like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're analysis is right (though I would mention that temperature also has an effect on perceived sweetness)- but I will say I don't think Coke needs anywhere near as much sugar as they put in it. I make my own cola syrup and while not the same flavor profile as Coke- it's just as acidic and I use half as much sugar.</p>
<p>GUS (Grown Up Soda) makes their soda similarly- and it's so much more refreshing than Coke is.</p>
<p>Having said all that- the important thing about Coke is that it's not Pepsi :)</p></div>		</li>
