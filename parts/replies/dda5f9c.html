			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Most black holes are so-called &quot;stellar mass&quot; black holes. The result of a single star or a binary pair collapsing. They are only as massive as the stars that collapsed to form them.  &quot;Supermassive&quot; black holes are many, many, many times more massive than a single star and were formed quite early in the life of the universe. Either from the coalescence of primordial gas clouds too massive to form stars or from the merger of very many stellar-mass black holes or, more likely, a combination of the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that expansion, gravity, while an incredibly powerful force up close, it crazy weak at large distances. Or at least, weak compared to other forces. It relies on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">inverse square law.</a>. So as you get further away from a black hole (SMBH or regular), it's gravitational affect is not just proportionally weaker as you get further away, it's <em>exponentially</em> weaker.  </p>
<p>This is why the image some people have of black holes &quot;sucking up everything in their wake&quot; is super incorrect, and realize black holes are like inside-out stars that can have an orbit, trajectory, and gravitational influence on other objects in the same was as if they were just a star.    </p></div>		</li>
