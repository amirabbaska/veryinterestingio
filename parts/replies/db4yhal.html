			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any understanding of how &quot;the plan&quot; for the colony is stored? I probably worded it wrong (meaning, I know there is no explicit plan) but do you see what I mean? I see an ant colony as fundamentally different from, say, a snowflake because the ant colony has utilitarian and pragmatic value (and perhaps the effectiveness of the design has evolved over time) where a snowflake is just random. </p>
<p>On that point, it would be interesting to know if any colonies from a million years ago were less developed than they are now - perhaps they are fossilized somewhere.</p>
<p>I just found this which is kind of interesting: <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/ants-swarm-like-brains-think" target="_blank">http://nautil.us/issue/12/feedback/ants-swarm-like-brains-think</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a swarm intelligence - how do they find that cup of soda on your counter? A thousand ants spread out, and the one that finds something sets down a path for others to follow. </p>
<p>The same way, an ant just moves one grain of sand at a time, causing tunnels to just grow. </p>
<p>Lightning does the same thing - hundreds of little currents flow in all directions until part of it connects with the ground, and then a current is established and BOOM. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you are saying and appreciate the response. I'm just not sure, though. Moving one grain of sand at a time would account for a random series of tunnels, not ones with purpose. The lightning thing is also completely random too.</p>
<p>For example, in our backyard, we have mountain beavers (<a href="http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/mtn_beavers.html" target="_blank">http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/mtn_beavers.html</a>). Their tunnel systems include what are effectively eating areas and, away from those, latrines. It seems to me that the form for design (or preference) must somehow be passed down through evolution but I have never found a genetic trace of this. The fact that they keep the food away from the latrines is interesting to me because it represents design, not randomness. It would be thought provoking to get a set of mountain beavers who have never had to build a tunnel system and see if they copy the same design that is common among that animal. I dunno. /shrug</p></div>		</li>
