<p>Whoa, that figure is actually wrong, and based on old, bad spectroscopic retrievals.</p>
<p>In general, the entire planet is covered in ammonia clouds, and we cannot see the lower ammonium hydrosulfide cloud deck. In places that there are rare upper ammonia cloud clearings (near the equator), there's enough clear air that Rayleigh scattering creates blues in those regions, not browns of the lower cloud deck.</p>
<p>Again, almost everything you see when you look at Jupiter is ammonia clouds, which on their own are bright white. Some latitudes are regions of upwelling (zones), and have high ammonia cloud-tops, while other latitudes are regions of downwelling (belts), and have low ammonia cloud-tops. In between these high and low heights sits a thick brown hydrocarbon haze, very chemically similar to smog. The cloud-tops in the zones are sticking up above most of the haze and thus appear fairly white. The cloud-tops in the belts, though, lie below the haze layer, and thus appear colored brown by the overlying haze.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/YbhrNrM.jpg" target="_blank">This diagram</a> is considered far more accurate these days. Notice how there are no breaks in the upper ammonia cloud except for the equatorial hotspot, which would appear blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea what the diagram is showing (is that multiple diagrams stacked on top of one another, or are there really multiple hard lower-cut-offs in the pressure axis? What even do the shaded regions mean?) On the other hand, the caption is pretty easy to understand.</p>
<p>What's kind of funny about the article you link, though, is that all academic writing is more complicated than necessary, including that paper. For instance: &quot;However,  most  of  us  can  likely  recall  having  read  papers,  either  by  colleagues  or
students,  in  which  the  author  appears  to  be  deliberately  using  overly  complex  words&quot; could be written as:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean the new images of the poles show that the ammonia clouds stop at a certain latitude or is there something else (a different haze) that supersedes them at the pole?</p>
<p>If we don't know yet because the data is too new, what's the current hypothesis/hunch to explain the new images?</p></div>		</li>
