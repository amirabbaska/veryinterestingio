			<div class="markdown"><p>At Four Corners Nat'l Monument, there is a monument built right where the 4 states of Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico all meet at right angles.   There's a plus sign in the center of it, and the lines represent the borders.  So if you stand on all fours, you can be in 4 states at once.  I've wondered what they would do if a murder was committed on the memorial.  Which state would prosecute?</p></div>		</li>

<p>They'd have to have a detective from each jurisdiction investigate it together, in the style of the European TV series &quot;The Bridge&quot;.  The detectives would of course have to have wildly divergent personalities and peculiar habits.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If borders where 'thick' then all crime would take place there because no one would have jurisdiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm wondering if the OP is thinking of an actual drawn line (with pen, pencil, paint etc) and that actual, physical line having a thickness. Obviously the answer would be that the line is just for our reference and the technical border is the exact center, but nevertheless the line itself would have a width that could be measured. I'm just assuming that's what they meant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and the parent commenter even alluded to a line being drawn. No matter where a line is reproduced it will have thickness. A conceptual line on the other hand can be spaceless </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the crux of this, borders are imaginary lines. That being said, I'm sure plenty of borders have rules about them, x amount of feet on ether side can't be developed, or this area is used for security or such and such. It's all made up and there aren't any natural rules about it what so ever. </p></div>		</li>
