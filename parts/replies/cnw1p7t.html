			<div class="markdown"><p>Limiting magnitude is going to depending on the filter. In the optical filters, the depth is limited by stellar crowding as opposed to detection above background, so the depth is a function of radius within the galaxy. </p>
<p>If my memory serves, the limiting magnitude in the outer disk corresponds roughly to stars of around 1.5 solar masses, but I could be remembering that bit incorrectly. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's been bothering me about this image is that Hubble does not have enough resolving power to see individual stars in Andromeda. </p>
<p>0.05&quot; resolution is about a factor of 1000 off of what you would need to see Betelgeuse at 2.5Mly (using small angle approximation so that angular diameter is just d/D and d ~= 2.1E9 km ). So what exactly am I seeing in this picture, because it doesnt seem possible that it's individual stars....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're calculating is the angular resolution needed to resolve features <em>within</em> the star, not the resolution to separate stars as distinct objects.</p>
<p>If two stars are 10 light years apart (in the component tangential to the line of sight), their angular separation is (10 ly / 2.5 Mly) ~ 1 arcsecond. So you could resolve them in principle.</p>
<p>You're right that you couldn't see details on a star at that distance: they'd be indistinguishable from points. But if they're bright enough, they're still visible points.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I recently wrote a few paragraphs about this image and the general idea behind photometry for an askscience thread, but to answer the core question, &quot;How many of those pixels are stars?&quot; I sort of dodged the question. Could you offer some feedback on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/2rrdz3/is_every_speck_of_light_in_this_picture_a_star/cnik8o6" target="_blank">this comment here</a>, did I more or less get the idea right? </p>
<p>I'm sure there's a better answer, I just don't know what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I'm not an expert enough on image processing to comment there as I am a radio astronomer. I will say tho my understanding is they were taking these pics from further out edges of the galaxy where you would have far fewer stars per pixel than the center. </p></div>		</li>
