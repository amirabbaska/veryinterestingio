			<div class="markdown"><p>Humans are large predator animals, which are actually some of the only animals to have front-facing eyes.
It all comes down to efficiency. Large predators spend most of their time hunting and stalking prey. Front facing eyes helps a lot with that.
Wide fields of vision are great for detecting potential threats, but large predators don’t have many. They spend more time hunting than being hunted; hence forward eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't make much of a difference for us humans. We are built for endurance, not speed, so we can't hope to outrun predators like say a hare can. This means that if there is something hunting us, we can't really expect to escape it even if we notice it. </p>
<p>In addition, we are also social creatures, so for the majority of human history, we've technically had dozens of eyes on the lookout at any point in time.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd wager us evolving from apes would have a factor as well, since depth perception is much more vital to an animal that actually covers vertical ground as compared to something that lives solely on the ground.</p></div>		</li>
