			<div class="markdown"><p>There may be no surviving female-line-only descendants of Denisovans or Neanderthals if there was selective pressure working against the Denisovan and Neanderthal mtDNA in particular.  That is, it's possible that ~2% of normal DNA from Neanderthals is fitness enhancing but the mtDNA (which comes as a basically irreducible unit) is fitness reducing, and so the latter was bred out of the population over the past 100k years.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One hypothesis might be negative epistasis between non-Homo sapiens mtDNA and our gDNA. In fact, if interbreeding is as common as some think, it might the strongest explanation. One would think that if the average European has 2% Neanderthal DNA, surely some mitochondrial lineages should have survived.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don’t need any complicated hypotheses.</p>
<p>You’re looking at at bare minimum 1,750 generations (assuming a conservative 20 year generation time) from the very last Neanderthal to now.  All you need is one single break in the female-female lineage.  That’s a high probability anyway, let alone starting from such a small initial hybrid population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the probability works that way, but I'm happy to see math if you have it.  Random fluctuations are usually exponentially suppressed in fluctuation size, so for a large population I could easily see a very high likelihood that the fraction of the population with such mtDNA stays within certain bounds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't sound surprising.  If there were certain features of the mitochondrial DNA that were constant for long enough the nuclear DNA might have evolved to rely on those regularities in some way, such that different behavior was deleterious for individuals with majority homo sapiens genomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To simplify this a bit:</p>
<p>One thing people miss in quickly mentally modeling these events is the role of survivorship. While we're pretty sure cross-species mating occurred, we're less sure that long-run descendants are still with us. There have been a number of genetic bottlenecks in human history (disease, war, starvation, competition), and it's hard to quickly imagine just how few bloodlines have survived out of the total ever produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Eve Hypothesis (using mtDNA analysis) estimated a common ancestor (Eve)  lived \~100,000 years ago.  This is a surprisingly recent result, and suggests a bottle-neck.  However, this might just be a mtDNA bottleneck.  One mtDNA variant may have been selected for, while Neanderthals and Denisovans sequences, previously incorporated into the human population, have survived longer, and are still evident. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, important point. And the specific bottlenecks may have disproportionately affected Neanderthal communities, or hybrids. If marriage was done out of desperation, lineages with Neanderthal mtDNA started out in worse shape than average.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genetic bottlenecks are one of those &quot;space is big&quot; problems. Yeah, you know in a very abstract way that space is big, but you can't remotely conjure the absolute scale. Your brain just doesn't have room for a version of big that's that friggin big.</p>
<p>As recently as 7,000, we see a massive Y chromosome bottleneck, and that appears to just be a global phenomenon when a period of massive clan warfare occurred for some reason. That's just one set of events, and it has a major influence on our DNA today.</p>
<p>Multiply that over hundreds of thousands of years, and then picture many more events occurring within small populations. The Black Plague alone was a radical enough event that it may have created the groundwork for modern civilization.</p>
<p>It's hard to fully picture just how many human bloodlines were wiped out.</p>
<p>And that's before you even factor in the idea that Neanderthals were probably subject to the same racist/bigoted tendencies all humans are. It's doubtful our ancestors were more altruistic than we are today. I think we especially underestimate the role that competition against visible genetic competitors plays in bottlenecks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, some long-run descendants are still with us. I mean, it's generally accepted that some Europeans have inherited some Neanderthal DNA. That doesn't mean it was unbroken father-to-son or mother-to-daughter, obviously, but there's a bit of Neanderthal descendants running around.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>And common and rare is somewhat relative here. It may be that when H. s. s. and Neanderthal populations met, they would intermarry. But those would still be rare events; there were never many Neanderthals, and fewer Denisovans, and they lived in different environments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We also don't know if the subsequent hybrid generations, F2, F3, ... would eventually become sterile.  A lot of hybrid mammals can still breed as an F1 or F2, but lose the ability in future generations as they develop hybrid incompatibility.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It could if the presence of Denisovan DNA in humans came from Neandartal-Denisovan hybrids instead of or in addition to directly from Denisovan individuals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of probably being rare events, it's believed that H.S.S migrated in waves over time and each wave would, more or less, replace the previous wave.  Sort of like how the original inhabitants of the British Isles were dark skin and dark eyed.  Even if H.S.S and Neanderthal interbreeding was common, they were likely displaced by a future, pure, H.S.S. wave of migration, over time diluting the Neanderthal genes. </p></div>		</li>
