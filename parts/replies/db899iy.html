			<div class="markdown"><p>And we're talking about the NSA. These are people that have legal and complete access to all traffic passing through international cables. If only they could afford a hard drive, they'd be able to record a little bit of meta data from that access. </p>
<p>They probably haven't thought of that, but imagine if they did and we're even smart enough to record every single bit going to/from high value targets like government agencies and political organizations. </p>
<p>Really if you think about it, the volume of internet traffic is unimaginably huge, but 99.999% of it is very easily identifiable. Once you exclude cat-videos, porn, pirates movies, Netflix, etc. you are down to a much smaller sample set that can be sorted and stored for later analysis. </p>
<p>And, remember that the FBI knew of this attack AS IT WAS HAPPENING and notified the DNC. So, they coulda pressed the record button at that time too. </p>
<p>The trump claim that we can't know who did this is ludicrous and just demonstrates why he should attend security briefings. </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's really hard to exclude based on content. However it is easy to include based on ip</p>
<p>I think it's fair to assume the DNC and HRC's mail server weren't hosted on a IP that is shared with popular-high-traffic-site.com</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not really. This type of content is very easily recognizable. The first 200 bytes of the file clearly identify something as a video, etc. and you could easily just look at the first 1000-5000 bytes and identify which movie this is. The number of movies/videos/etc is finite and 99.9% could be logged and identified with a single low-end PC.  </p>
<p>Also, any &quot;hack&quot; is not going to consist of a hacker sending gobs and gobs of data. That's not going to actually hack anything at all - there needs to be interaction and as soon as that requirement is put into place the number of things worth recording drops enormously. </p>
<p>But the specific original question was about spoofing IP addresses. Well, you can't just &quot;pretend you have another up address&quot; or the data you send won't come back to you. You have to hack someone else, then use that hacked server to relay for you. </p>
<p>Well, someone with access to core routers can see the &quot;hack&quot; coming from that location and start lookin at all traffic from the location. Now they see that every time the bogus up sends data, it also receives data from another ip.  Coincidence?  I think not. So then you start recording everything in/out of THAT ip.  You can hid behind multiple layers like this, but someone with core access can also backpedal through multiple layers like this. </p>
<p>But the hack we are talking about is not even that complicated. It was phishing (from what is being reported in the news.). Some retard clicked on a &quot;change your password&quot; link that linked to the hacker's server and then entered their password into that server. The &quot;hacker&quot; then just logged into moron's email with that password and pressed the &quot;save&quot; button. That's it!! </p></div>		</li>
