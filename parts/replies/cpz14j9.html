			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the specific members of the Pseudomonas at work in the Deepwater Horizon Spill evolved because petroleum has been constantly seeping into the ocean for almost as long as petroleum has existed on earth, giving life ample time to adapt, so it doesn't technically count as an evolutionary adaptation to environmental changes caused by human action. However, Pseudomonas do demonstrate that with enough time* and a large enough population, bacteria can adapt to eat theoretically anything.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lab I work in deals with degradation of aromatic hydrocarbons that are found in crude oil, but our bacteria (in my case, Geobacter daltonii strain FRC-32) do it anaerobic ally, which we found happening in the Gulf. Interestingly, FRC will drift REALLY really, meaning that it'll &quot;evolve&quot; into a lab strain very quickly and therefore can &quot;eat&quot; just about anything we throw at it. This has became a problem because it can be difficult to figure out what the wild type is capable of and what the lab strain is doing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It has been a few years since my course, so the specifics of its functions have left me. Granted, synthesized plastic is much more complex than  crude oil, but we discussed how the microbe could still break it down. I do remember that my prof stated that the reason landfills are the size that they are is because it is an aerobic microbe, and that there isn't enough Oxygen for it in regards to the buried garbage. This means the buried garbage doesn't decompose. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This is why organic food stuff should be composted and not thrown in the trash.  Compressing it and removing oxygen greatly increases the amount of time it takes to break down.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the main reasons a lot of landfills have retroactively added air injection systems to push air into well heads drilled into the landfill. They also cover the top of the landfill and collect the methane for energy generation. </p>
