<p>A lot of these new battery technology are developed in labs, which are often in ideal settings, so researchers have to make these products able to handle the world.</p>

<p>This! Imagine a battery leaking or short circuiting just because it got handled a bit 'too roughly'. I imagine getting certification for safety is a huge barrier to new battery technology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cost has a huge impact on this since all the additional safety testing increases the price to get the battery approved. Currently, there is amazing battery technology available for medical devices both non-rechargeable (pacemakers/ICDs) and rechargeable (some chronic pain stimulation therapies), but a medical device costs thousands vs a smartphone which costs ~$500.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Imagine that a 32 hour long battery was developed but was released to the public without much testing. It could overheat the phone and break the phone, maybe you dropped the device and it cracked open the battery and now you have battery acid all over the device... Hell, maybe it explodes if dropped in water! Point being, the tests are quite important. <del>Oh, and then theres the FCC that has to approve of it in the end.</del></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Battery Acid&quot; isn't really a thing you find in consumer electronics type batteries. Sealed lead acid batteries like those used to start cars, and found in UPSes are pretty much the only place your average person will find battery acid today. And as the name implies, they're sealed, so there's no convenient way for it to leak out. </p>
<p>Not to say there aren't hazardous things in other battery types, but it's not acid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus setting up manufacturing facilities. Creating a prototype in a lab is one thing. Creating a small, portable, inexpensive, and durable model that can be mass produced may be a bit more difficult. If the market for the new battery doesn't significantly outweigh the costs of building a new facility, training employees, buying new raw materials, developing new equipment for the new manufacturing process, and all the research involved . . . why bother? People are still buying lithium batteries. </p>
<p>That doesn't mean we won't see a new battery in the future. Accountants just have to be satisfied that it's worth the investment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That new battery may last an extra 4 hours but it costs twice as much compared to the old battery. Lets say an old battery lasts 6 hours, it would be more cost efficient to just buy two old batteries which would give me 12 hours while the new battery would cost the same it would only provide 10 hours.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet in reality, people would HAPPILY pay for the second battery!  </p>
<p>You see this in Tech constantly - 3TB Hard-Drive for $200 or 4TB for $400? People buy the larger one. Double the price - A fraction more capacity.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. Because who wants to dick around with 2 drives? Pain in the ass. I'd also buy the more expensive battery that adds 75% to the duration for 2.5x the price because I don't want to have to swap batteries. I find that part of the answer to be pretty weak. Sometimes convenience trumps cost/performance or cost/kWh considerations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but there is a limit to this, a phone battery that last 24 hours is useless to the average consumer as there will have been significant periods there where they could have charged the phone so the extra battery juice was redundant but taking up space.</p>
<p>I very rarely find my phone completely runs out of battery, only in out of the ordinary circumstances, where as i would notice if it was twice as bulky or more expensive than its competitors when i was deciding which to buy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness there's something else to take into consideration: space and effort. I can definitely see a situation where I would pay 2x as much for a battery/HD/whatever for 1.5x the performance. Sure buying two would be better value for money but having to carry around a spare and swap it in when needed would be irritating, especially if this behaviour was applied to every technical device I had.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree economic scalability and physical durability are both valid concerns.  Other people ITT have also mentioned, and rightly so, that batteries have been improving year on year, but our power consumption demands have gone up faster resulting in an apparent issue with batteries.<br />
But all these are concerns with tech are only half of OP's question.  The answer to why they read stories every few months about battery tech without seeing progress has as much to do with hazardous incentives in journalism as it does technical concerns.  That is to say hazardous because it's easier to get clicks or to sell papers with sensationalized content rather than reasoned pieces which place the subject in context, because of that moral hazard we tend to end up seeing more distorted pieces than helpful.  This happens more as the readers understand the content less.  Because of this reporting on cutting edge science in main stream media can be fairly atrocious.  The journalism problems have as much to do as the economic or technical considerations of batteries themselves in answering this question.</p></div>		</li>
