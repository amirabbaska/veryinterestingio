			<div class="markdown"><p>I am genuinely inspired by your movement to phase out capital letters. Unfortunately, I am browsing reddit on mobile and my phone keyboard is set to automatically capitalize as it feel necessary. I would love to disregard capitalization while typing on a computer keyboard. Hopefully you were not bwing sarcastic. I noticed you didn't use sarcasm quotes...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think capital letters significantly improve how easy it is to read text. You can glance over text and still see where sentences begin and end. Especially long text with little paragraphs benefit the most from this I believe. </p>
<p>I agree with your point though. Just use &quot;who&quot; and use &quot;whom&quot; if you're really sure. Don't worry so much about it. Nobody cares about those people who want to correct you for using &quot;who&quot; instead of &quot;whom&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could get rid of them as part of sentence-casing, but not acronyms or names, and we'd actually <em>improve</em> comprehension of a few rare sentences (where the first word could be a proper noun or something else, and which it is changes the meaning).</p></div>		</li>
