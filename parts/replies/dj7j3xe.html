			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that obscure scientific professionals can just--with perfect timing-- emerge from a trap door under Reddit and give insight to the interesting thing I didn't know <em>I wanted</em> to know is one of the things that keep me coming back to this place.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How lethal are they typically? Here in the north there are few venomous animals, and almost none are dangerous to humans. What would happen if you were bitten?</p>
