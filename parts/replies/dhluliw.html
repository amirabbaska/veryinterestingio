			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a huge assumption. The island of stability probably only means stability slightly greater than expected for elements of that size but still much shorter than millions of years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would we have? First off you need very high energy collisions to create them, and then they exist for a fraction of a fraction of a second. As they decay, they'll emit characteristically high energy alpha particles among other decay chains. The thought is, and the work I am familiar with, is detecting these high energy alpha emissions immediately after heavy nuclei collisions. But that takes extremely sensitive detectors that have been improved iteratively over the last 30+ years so they can discriminate between different particles. So we could imagine how but we didn't have the technology or means. Hope that answers your question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most estimates of the island of stability elements predict a half life of minutes or maybe days, even if those elements are produced in supernovae they would still decay in a cosmic blink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The next question is, if super heavies are made after supernovae, then would we see evidence of them as they decay? What would they decay into? how long would they last? Would this have any effects on the stellar remains?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We probably can't see any evidence of it from here. I guess after a supernovae we might be able to measure some of the cosmic rays and maybe make some assumptions about the heavy nuclei which emitted some of them. But cosmics may just be nova ejections rather than decay emissions in which case I'm wrong. The heavy nuclei will shed lighter particles (betas, alphas, EM), until it becomes stable.   There are certain elemental abundances that dominate after the R and S processes in nova and I would assume super heavy's decay to the same elements although I do not remember them. They radioactive elements will survive according to its half -life, usually not long. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As op said, they are searching for an island of stability.</p>
<p>It's believed that at some point they become stable again so there could be super heavy elements that are stable enough to not disappear, so we can use them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's an overstatement. While people hope there is an island of stability where some of them will exist slightly longer, there is essentially zero chance that any new element will be stable enough to collect an appreciable quantity of it. It's always seemed like a purely academic venture </p></div>		</li>
