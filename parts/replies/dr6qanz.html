<p>As to whether there are species with more than two sexes, yes. But they tend to be extremophiles. I believe some slime molds do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually many fungi have large numbers of &quot;mating types&quot;, which are essentially sexes.  The number of mating types depends on the species of fungus: some only have two, but some have thousands.  To reproduce successfully, the fungus just needs to find someone with a different mating type than itself (which makes sense given the earlier discussion of genetic diversity).  <a href="https://blog.mycology.cornell.edu/2010/06/02/a-fungus-walks-into-a-singles-bar/" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>I like how this phrasing applies to humans too: to reproduce, any individual who is not the same sex as you will do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha, yea I had almost mentioned that I thought funguses do too, but I really don't remember that portion well. It was the densest chapter in the book, and I remember having an &quot;aha&quot; moment about it, but it was a while ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your response seems to mostly be about sexual reproduction. It seems to me that it could be possible to have a species with sexual reproduction but only one gender - there would have to be some mechanism to prevent self-impregnation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nick Lane has suggested that the reason for two sexes (large &amp; stationery gametes vs small &amp; mobile) is so one can pass on undamaged mitochondria while the other's are destroyed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, Nick Lane suggested this as the route cause for anisogamy (having gametes with different sizes) which is the fundamental definition of a sex (males have small, females have large).</p>
<p>However, it does not answer the question of why anisogamy is so prevalent in most sexually reproducing species because if the aim is to only pass on undamaged mitochondria then both parents could do this (occasionally we do see isogamous species but they tend to be fairly simple organisms like algae).</p>
<p>So we need to answer the question of why only one of the parents passes on their mitochondria. The reasoning for this is actually quite simple. Nick Lane's group did some computational modelling of what happens to cells with different &quot;strains&quot; of mitochondria (being from different parents). They found that assuming these different &quot;strains&quot; compete (very likely as they are not a clonal population), the host cell will be at a disadvantage. This means that cells with isogamous parents are at a disadvantage to cells with anisogamous parents. They found that in relatively few generations, anisogamy would always predominate over isogamy and therefore you always end up with (at least) two sexes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sex also leads to sexual selection and inter-sex competition which has associated and varied energy costs (think species with brightly colored males and other such dimorphisms)</p>
<p>Having more than one sex would further complicate this already complex set of interactions and therefore there's probably a certain amount of break-evenness in the number of sexes in the selective advantage it brings against the costs of inter-sex competition costs.</p></div>		</li>
