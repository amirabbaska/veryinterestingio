			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot if instances where real cigarettes were smoked before any laws were put into place but yes, after that they smoked herbal cigs/etc. </p>
<p>But since you forgot to include a source when you called many other comments wrong, here's an article built around the last time this question was asked on Reddit:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really depends on a lot of factors. You are correct technically, but not all movies have the budget for those kinds of props, which are VERY expensive.</p>
<p>Actors who already smoke off-screen will likely smoke cigarettes on-screen as well.</p>
<p>Depending on the shot (close up, wide, master), faking it might not be possible.</p>
<p>As Michael Caine says though, don't smoke on camera unless they MAKE you. It's hell on you, and the varying length of your cigarette from take to take will absolutely destroy the continuity of your master shot.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I smoked herbal cigarettes in a short film.  Ended up smoking nearly two packs of them over the course of the shooting day for continuity.  Some people do that regularly, but for a non-smoker it was absolutely horrible.  </p></div>		</li>
