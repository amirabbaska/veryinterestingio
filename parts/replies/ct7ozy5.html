			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it on clearer terms, you resist every urge to move, including swallowing, blinking, and scratching an itch. After a while, your brain will be confident you are asleep, paralyze your body and begin dreaming.</p>
<p>Since you are aware, or lucid, you can control your dreams, and become better at it with more experience.</p>
<p>This method is known as Wake Induced Lucid Dreaming, or WILD.</p>
<p>Edit: in the event you are in sleep paralysis and want to get out, what I do is try to shake my had back and forth while I breath irregularly. The brain eventually realizes you're awake and un-paralyzes you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I can confirm this, I've had many lucid dreams. I can control the dreams as such where my every thought is formed into 3-d visual action in my mind. I've attempted to do it many times in waking normal life, but it doesn't quite work as &quot;fluidy&quot; as compared to a lucid dream.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Surely that would be the other way around? It wants to check you're in sleep paralysis before it puts you asleep where you might start having dreams?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it wants to make a sure you are asleep before it paralyzes you. Otherwise you would be awake and couldn't move. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened to me 2 years ago. Woke up, couldn't move, swear to God it felt like something was standing right next to me. After about 10 seconds that felt like an eternity, I could finally move and proceeded to scream like I was 7 years old.
That shit is scary as hell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People who claim to have been abducted by aliens from their bed likely were a victim of sleep paralysis while still being awake. Your brain kicks into overdrive trying to explain why this horrifying thing is happening and it will latch on to any explanation, real or not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's ducking awful until you know what it is and learn how to control it, snap out of it, or use it to induce lucid dreaming. Used to happen to me all the time when I was younger. It made me afraid to go to sleep :(</p></div>		</li>
