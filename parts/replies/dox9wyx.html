			<div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s probably worth mentioning the system was designed with a single car (program) and more lanes were added at a later date. Then the car cannot magically split itself into two half cars (sub processes) to take advantage of more lanes. </p>
<p>So if you were to have a 16-core processor but your application was only designed to run on one core then the additional cores provide no benefit over a single core processor.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The irony of such an example is that Minecraft is actually a game that has higher hardware requirements than many that were made to look very shiny, such as NFS:Carbon. Minecraft takes a very simple thing and gives you millions of them to make it look nice, where NFS:Carbon takes very shined up things and uses only about 50 per frame. Millions of things take time, shiny stuff much less so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bringing to the same analogy: it's like a family traveling together, some could even be split around different cars with some coordination but the effort to do it is such a hassle that's better to put the 5 of them on the same car instead of having mom and pop calling semi-deaf granma on the other car with the kids to figure out what to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As for thread count on sheets: thread count measures the number of threads in a square inch area of fabric.</p>
<p>Fabric is made of threads running vertically and horizontally across each other. Imagine a rope one inch across. You'd fit 2 threads per square inch. It would be a very bumpy piece of fabric, more like a net than cloth! There'd be a lot of space between the threads to catch hairs, rub on skin, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Now imagine a rope half an inch across. You'd fit 4 threads per square inch with this. The threads are finer, and the resultant fabric is going to be more comfortable than what we started with.</p>
<p>And keep going! 600 threads per square inch mean that in the space of an inch, there are 300 threads going across and 300 going up and down. To most people, that's much more comfortable than even 400 threads per square inch.</p>
<p>The higher the thread count, generally the smaller the threads are, and thus the smoother the fabric becomes. Past a certain point it stops mattering, but where that point is is really up to personal sensitivity and preference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For thread count on bolts: it's best to show you with an experiment! Take a wooden dowel and put just your index finger on the side at one end. Now spin the dowel slowly and move your finger up at the same time, such that you're tracing a spiral along the outside of the bottle.</p>
<p>This is what a bolt with 1 thread looks like. There's just one point at the tip of the bolt that &quot;bites&quot; into the thread you've cut into your material.</p>
<p>Now take two fingers and put them on opposite sides of the dowel, and do exactly the same thing. You're cutting two identical spirals up the side of the dowel, and they never meet! This is a double-threaded bolt, and there are two points at the bottom where the bolt can &quot;bite&quot; into the thread you've cut into your material.</p>
<p>As for what makes higher thread counts better, it honestly depends on your application. More threads means that for each complete turn of your bolt, it moves that much further in or out, but may lead to a loss in strength.</p>
