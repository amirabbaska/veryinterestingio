			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly it, back in the day you maybe had 30 vfx shots to do and could dedicate one studio to the whole thing, now you have 300+ shots that have to be outsourced to 27 different studios that will do it the fastest and cheapest while still making it look passable. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even with being able to spot lots of vfx shots when watching movies if it's done really well lots of times you don't notice, which is the point of vfx a lot of the time. If you do your job really well nobody will notice. But on the the other hand as soon as I see a little bit of sloppy work it makes me cringe and it doesn't necessarily ruin the movie for me but it does make it less believable. For example, while watching civil war I'd say about 90-95% of stuff was done really well but right in the opening scene when falcon uses one of his wings as a shield it's rally jittery and bounces around a lot, it makes it look like a huge tracking error that was overlooked and when it's done in the opening shot of the entire movie it makes me think it's a little careless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's your answer.  All the really detailed stuff was practical effects and the CG was distant and used for only quick shots and fast moving objects like the Galli's and the Raptor vs Trex at the end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CGI was also used to replace a stunt doubles face when she looked up during the scene where Lex fell through through the floor.</p>
<p>I read that...as a caption on one of the photos from Jurassic Park: The Junior Novelization...I think. It was 23 years ago, so my memory might be unreliable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm shocked they even risked a stunt double there. Seems like a dummy would have been a better choice considering how close that raptor got to her. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. Well, half right I think. In the behind the scenes documentary, one of the editors actually showed the scene in question and explained that they had to replace the stunt double's face with Lex's actress'.</p></div>		</li>

Or cheap? You know anybody who can network 8 connection machines and debug 2 million lines of code for what I bid for this job? Because if he can I'd like to see him try. </p></div>		</li>
