			<div class="markdown"><p>To further work on their example: the brain, being a very efficient machine, takes a LOT of shortcuts. It remembers patterns more than specifics, that's why you're able to guess what people are trying to say before they finish, because they're following a string of coherent patterns.</p>
<p>When you glitch out and say the wrong thing, your brain is jumping to the wrong predicted pattern and following a pattern you probably do more often, or did more recently, and thus was deemed more likely to occur again by your brain.</p>
<p>Edit: changed 'following a math' to 'following a pattern': I was redditing in the middle of a math lecture, and since your brain can really only focus on one stream/pattern at a time, it switched streams while I looked up and I didn't notice. perfect example ._.</p>
<p><strong>Edit TL;DR</strong> Your brain is a neural network, which means it's a bunch of tiny, individual decision-makers all working together as a literal hivemind. They're interconnected and each one reacts to things differently, and together they communicate and filter input, like hearing/reading/memories to create output, like writing/thoughts/speech. For as long as you've been living, this neural network in your head has been trained with countless inputs and situations: everything you've ever thought, heard, read, seen, etc is processed into language, and your brain finds systems, patterns, and reasons for it to make sense, rather than taking a dictionary approach. <strong>In short, your brain is literally the most complex predictive text system ever.</strong> When you synthesize information (speaking, writing, etc) your brain is running through all of your collective memory to determine what the 'most correct' next word or phrase is, and like any predictive system that takes shortcuts, sometimes it messes up.</p>
<p><em>edit edit edit: yes I know the tl;dr is longer but it is encapsulated in one bold sentence for you.</em></p></div>		</li>

<p>Your brain doesn't just take shortcuts, it cheats and lies.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_blindness" target="_blank">Change Blindness</a> is pretty cool, but gets downright terrifying in its implications.</p>
<p>Basically, your brain can't keep track of literally everything around you all the time, there's too much. So it decides whats important and ignores the rest. </p>
<p>The fun happens when you suddenly decide that something it was ignoring is now important. You focus on something your brain has been ignoring. Rather than being caught out, your brain just goes &quot;What? Oh yea, its always been like that.&quot;</p>
<p>Related is that every time you blink you are temporarily blind, your eyes are closed after all. You spend about half an hour a day blind in fact. But the lights never go out, because your brain lies. It fills in the split second of blackness every blink with what you can already see.</p>
<p>So if changes happen during this time, you are really likely to not notice as your brain just keeps on with the 'it was always like that' lie.</p>
<p>This isn't just for small shit either. You can rearrange text on a page while someone reads it, and if you get your timings right they never notice. There's videos on youtube, you can stop someone, ask them for directions, half way through have something obstruct their sight, and swap the person you are talking to. About half don't notice the swap. </p>
<p>Experiments on change blindness basically amount to trolling people, and some of them get just freaky. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an example (without meaning sarcasm), look back at your post title and notice that you typed &quot;thought&quot; instead of &quot;though&quot;.  This was your brain telling your fingers to get the words you were thinking communicated to the internet, but you naturally typed a word more commonly expressed in language by default.</p>
<p>In short, you answer your own question in an ironic way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I regard the brain more like a procedural approximation compression engine that isn't really like using lossy compression, but deconstructs  everything we take in into components that allow for a rebuild of the information our brain thinks is relevant.</p>
<p>Lossy compression still stores everything we feed into it, but removes some detail.</p>
<p>Procedural approximation just stores the details it sees as relevant and uses experience of the world around us to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>People with autism are well known to have peculiar detail focused memory skills.</p>
<p>This isn't because their memory is particularly great, it's an extension of one of the greatest problems people on the spectrum have.</p>
<p>They have great difficulty filtering out sensory inputs that &quot;normal&quot; people block out naturally, from sounds to visual information to personal clues.</p>
<p>People on the spectrum are often thought to be shitty at reading body language and facial expressions, but they aren't really.</p>
<p>They are overloaded by the massive amounts of information they receive and are with that slower in instantly responding to body language, etc.</p>
<p>Retranslated to what I first said, people on the spectrum deconstruct sensory inputs into a whole lot more information then normal people do and that can take more time, but also often means that with the right skills, they can recall much more of what they experienced, once it is all processed.</p>
<p>People on the spectrum often need their alone time after social gatherings, to wind down. During this time the brain catches up processing all they experienced before.</p>
<p>With that, you have a lot of perfect recall, photographic memory, etc, in autistics. It's not that their memory is great, but that their brains don't filter out the 99% of crud that &quot;normal&quot; peoples brains do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, there are also different parts of your brain trying to do different things at the same time.  Exactly how this works is still being figured out, but one part of your brain might be like, &quot;I want to eat right now&quot; and another part might be putting words together in a sentence.  Another part is keeping your feet moving because you're walking.  Some other part of your brain has basically gone to sleep.</p>
<p>So these different parts of your brain are just doing different things, and sometimes they don't agree.  Sometimes they're kind of fighting it out, or they get their signals crossed, and you do something kind of whacky.  You try to say one word, but then another part of your brain might be trying to do something else, causing your tongue to make some weird motion.  The result is a weird pronunciation.</p>
<p>And another thing, related to your brain being &quot;cheap&quot;, it takes shortcuts.  It doesn't remember everything exactly, for example, it just picks out important patterns and throws the rest of the information away.  Sometimes those shortcuts means that it doesn't quite do the right thing, but instead does the easy thing.  The easy thing normally works out fine, but every once in a while, the easy thing is the wrong thing.</p>
<p>This applies to speech and thought patterns too.  We get in the habit of saying certain words or phrases.  We get in the habit of thinking certain things.  It's much easier than having to figure out what you're going to think and say all the time.  You get used to one sound following another, and so when your mouth starts to make that first sound, it immediately starts saying the next sound out of habit.  Your brain hears it happening and goes, &quot;Wait a second, that's not what I meant to do!&quot; and tries to correct things.  The result is a little stutter or weird pronunciation.</p>
<p>(Sorry if that's not 100% right.  I'm not a real expert.  I know enough to know these things happen, but I'm speculating a bit on how these phenomena relate to speech.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A funny thing that happens to me from time to time, is that I'll be writing a message on my phone, and there's someone talking in the same room, or there's a TV with someone talking, but it's really just background noise. At some point my focus will gradually shift away from what I'm writing to the talk happening in the background (I guess to check whether it has some relevance to me). By the time I phase out of that and re-focus on my phone, I'll see that I've unconsciously written down parts of what I was listening to, mixed with parts of what I was intending to write originally. It makes me chuckle every time, because I'm reminded of how feeble and unreliable our brains are when it comes to multitasking, despite probably being the most sophisticated biological construct in the known universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  To give another weird and slightly embarrassing example, I once bought a small piece of food-- I think it was some kind of candy, maybe.  The guy behind the counter handed me the candy and my change.  Then, without consciously thinking about what I was doing, I proceeded to put the candy in my pocket and put the change into my mouth.  Right as a quarter hit my tongue, I got totally confused and freaked out a little.</p>
<p>I'm not sure exactly why that happened, but I think it was something like: When I buy something, I usually take change into my right hand and the thing I bought into my left.  The guy behind the counter somehow handed it to me so that wasn't possible, so in this instance I took the candy into my right hand and the change into my left.  But then, that whole action was so habitual that my brain just short-circuited and still acted as though things had happened in the regular way.</p></div>		</li>
