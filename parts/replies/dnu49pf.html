			<div class="markdown"><p>I've heard this about Italian, but ... French? I speak a variety of French, reasonably well, and I've not run into any French variation that's not understandable. Maybe Creole, but anybody speaking French is fine. It's a bit like trying to understand someone with a strong regional accent in English - you may need to ask them to repeat themselves a bit. It may take you some time to get the hang of their accent, but it isn't another language. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know enough French to corroborate. I was just going off of my French teacher (who learned in Lebanon for some reason) and studied in France and Canada and she said she can hardly understand people who speak Belgian French specifically, and some of the French dialects of Africa where they choose marginally different words for common conversations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Belgian really isn't that different from standard French. I'm startled at the idea that someone could understand France french but not Belgian. </p>
<p>It is harder to deal with accents and dialects as if you're working in a second language. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hmm, maybe it's a bit like in English - many people have regional slang and a casual way of speaking that people from outside the region might not follow.  But if you're speaking English to someone not from your country, you know which words to use and which to avoid, and you enunciate more. </p>
<p>I'm sure there are regional speakers of French, who, speaking among themselves, would be unintelligible to me - but I think the same is probably true of English. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The government of China may want people to believe that all Chinese languages are just a single language, but linguists say otherwise. Wouldn't you trust a person who has studied languages more?</p>
<p>Basically, the English words &quot;language&quot; and &quot;dialect&quot; are not really appropriate to apply to the Arabic world or China, and the words used in those languages are not accurate translations of &quot;language&quot; or &quot;dialect&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same just different accents. The only minor misunderstanding I see would be if they both spoke their version of slang Spanish, but even then they will easily manage.</p></div>		</li>
