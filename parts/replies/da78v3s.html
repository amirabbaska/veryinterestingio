			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not a lawyer but as I understand our rights (in USA), it's not recommended to use fingerprint unlocking on any technology. Police and national law enforcement have legal power over your fingerprints and therefore can compel you to unlock fingerprint locks. They do not have the legal power to compel you to give up passwords.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't claim to be a security expert, but I have done work on facial recognition systems, read the principles, understood the processes, etc. As I understand it, biometrics alone are not at all secure.</p>
<p>A system that you are trying to access needs to know two things: who do you claim to be, and are you that person. The first one is typically called identification and the second one is verification, though sometimes other words are used. These are independent systems even when using the same metrics.</p>
<p>For example, a facial recognition system used as an <em>identification</em> system may be looking at faces in the crowd and presented with the question, &quot;Who is this?&quot;. That is an <em>identification</em> question, and the system needs to search through a database of many people looking for a best match to make a claim on who it <em>probably</em> is, or to claim that the person is unknown.</p>
<p>A facial recognition system used as a <em>verification</em> system is presented with a face as asked, &quot;Is this John Smith, CEO of X Corp?&quot;. It only has to compare the face to <em>one</em> set of metrics in the database, that of John Smith. (To be fair, a <em>unique</em> identifier is required and name alone doesn't do that, hence the CEO reference.)</p>
<p>For a login, we use a username to identify whom we <em>claim</em> to be, and then use a password to verify that we are that person. Simply using the username wouldn't work since anybody could <em>claim</em> to be me. Using the password alone wouldn't be of value either because then all a hacker needs to do is guess a password that <em>somebody</em> might have and will get in as whomever has that password. Neither is secure. You need both.</p>
<p>So which role does biometrics perform? Is it identifying whom you claim to be, or is it verifying that you are the person claimed? Either way, you need a second input to perform the role of the other. For something like a mobile phone, we might assume that the phone has a record of the own, that by attempting to log in you are claiming to be that owner, and it is therefore performing the act of verifying. Fine, but then <em>both</em> are very weak.</p>
<p>Why are they weak? Well, your identity claim is now based on possession of the phone, and lots of people can get physical access to the phone, from friends and family to thieves or somebody finding it when lost. The odds of somebody physically having your phone and knowing your username is much smaller, particularly people that you don't want accessing your phone.</p>
<p>The biometrics for verification is weak because you can't change your biometrics. Biometrics can verify that you are who you say you are, but you have no control over the verification. A password as a verification can change. If your biometrics are compromised, such as a duplication of your fingerprint, iris pattern, or facial features, there's nothing you can do to stop someone from gaining access. You can't change any of these things, so they are permanently compromised. You can also be forced or coerced. Somebody can hold your finger on the scanner against your will.</p>
<p>For most people on the street, this probably doesn't matter. Unless you are a spy or get arrested, the convenience of simply using your finger outweighs the probability of anybody forcing you to log into your phone for them. But, if it <em>were</em> to come up, it's too late.</p>
<p>I prefer the username and password, even if inconvenient.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Lawyer here.  This is not entirely correct.  You can be compelled to give a password in some circuits under the theory of foregone conclusion.  An easy example is &quot;we have a warrant for your phone, we know generally what is on it, and we know you know your password&quot;.  At that point, if you fail to provide your password, you can be held in contempt and sit in a jail cell indefinitely.</p>
<p>This area of law is fairly fluid, but we're seeing it more and more with passwords and phones.  In some circuits you might be safe, in others not so much.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, so that would mean growing a &quot;proper&quot; identical clone would be basically impossible if we only used DNA. To go the full way and not just create a twin, you'd actually need to <strong>manufacture</strong> a clone, starting with DNA but changing bits along the way on purpose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, and its not just the skin.  Basically every organ in your body is grown to a pattern like skin.  So although the clone would look very similar to you on the macroscopic level, it would also be different in every organ.  Blood vessel layouts would be different, so would the folds in your lungs, and the various detailed features of every organ.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this doesn't even touch the more epigenetic factors. DNA is stored by winding around little containers called histones, and it is unwound when it needs to be read. How tightly it is wound affects how easily it is to turn DNA into a thing, and various environmental factors can affect how tightly the DNA is wound</p></div>		</li>
