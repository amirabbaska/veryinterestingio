			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, I make my own microwave popcorn and I've found I have to use a plate or it doesn't work right.</p>
<p>For the record:</p>
<ul>
<li>put a heaping quarter cup of popcorn kernels in a brown sandwich bag, but keep the bag folded flat</li>
<li>put popcorn salt in bag to taste (I don't measure it, but it's just enough to see inside the bag; it kinda looks like a slightly frosty morning)</li>
<li>place 1 paper towel, folded in half, (or two half-size paper towels on top of each other) on top of a microwave-safe plate</li>
<li>put 1 tablespoon of liquid cooking oil (canola or whatever) inside the bag</li>
<li>give the bag a good shake to distribute the oil and salt over the kernels</li>
<li>fold over the top of the bag and pierce the fold with a bamboo skewer to hold it closed</li>
<li>place the bag on top of the paper towel with the folded bottom pointed up</li>
<li>place the plate, paper towel, and popcorn bag in the microwave</li>
<li>microwave on high for about 2 minutes</li>
<li>remove the bag (careful, it'll be hot) and empty the popcorn into a bowl</li>
</ul></div>		</li>
