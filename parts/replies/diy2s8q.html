Successive generations push north through the summer, and then a single one returns south to overwinter, hibernate in mountain forests, and then begin the trek north over again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your link is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantala_flavescens" target="_blank"><em>Pantala flavescens</em></a> which is known as the globe skimmer, globe wanderer or wandering glider. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-eyed_darner" target="_blank">Blue darners</a> are a completely different species.</p>
<p>Dragonflies are all incredible but <em>Pantala flavescens</em> is something else! Are there any other species which have such global populations but where <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0148949" target="_blank">gene flow still occurs</a>?</p></div>		</li>
