			<div class="markdown"><p>Debit card protections are not as good as credit card protections. Fraudulent credit transactions can be reversed almost instantly once reported, and fraud protection laws make you liable for much less. Fraudulent debit transactions will not only drain your account of funds before you're likely to notice (and therefore impact your ability to access money you should otherwise have) but it can take several weeks to investigate and reimburse you. You're also potentially liable for a higher portion of the fraudulent amount.</p>
<p>Honestly you're better off getting a credit card and using it instead of your debit card and just paying the statement amount every month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a (not so) hypothetical situation.</p>
<p>I have a pay-pal debit card, with a $0 balance at pay-pal, in turn I have the pay-pal card linked to my checking account the same way a traditional debit card would be. If I use the pay-pal debit card, there's usually a day or two before the money comes out of my checking account, but pay-pal notifies me immediately for each transaction.</p>
<p>So... If someone were to take the information from my pay-pal card, and make a fraudulent purchase, would I be able to spot the charge and dispute it with pay-pal <em>before</em> the money came out of my actual checking account? Would this provide a layer of protection from losing cash that a traditional debit card does not? I try and use the Pay-pal card because they offer cash back and my bank doesn't, but it's be nice to know if it carried protection as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a family member make a hotel reservation  and used a debit card.  I have a pretty strict policy about this but lapsed this one time.  I normally do hotel stuff strictly on Amex.</p>
<p>This time, I got double charged.  I paid on Amex when I checked out, but the hotel also charged the debit card.  The hotel claimed (to my bank) that they had no record of the extra transaction, and I spent hours on the phone with the hotel and with the bank trying to resolve this, to no avail.  I'm out the money.  Family member has been appropriately re-educated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before I had a credit card, I would always run my debit card as &quot;credit&quot;. This would route the payment through the Visa/MC network, and I wouldn't have to enter my PIN. Do you know if this option gives the enhanced level of protections as a credit card?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Yes in that banks are also going to be monitoring for fradulent charges. Yes in that all the same confirmation numbers and rules appear.  But, there's still a reason people say credit is safer: your debit card is a check card, so if something goes wrong, that money is actually taken right out of your account, wheras with credit you elect when to pay the bill. Debit fraud can actually bleed your bank account directly,  resulting in overdraft charges or worse. Like, say you have rent due but your account has been emptied. Usually fraud's resolved quickly, but if for some reason there is a deeper investigation, or you have to argue the claim yourself, that money is gone for thar time, so you're shit out of luck on rent for a few days. </p>
<p>That said, debit is still safeish. Most banks have their shit together on this.  Just slightly less safe than credit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like most comments already made, there is less protection for debit cards.</p>
<p>I had a situation where I bought a burrito from a small mexican restaurant and they charged me twice - swiped the first time and the cashier said it did not go through so he swiped it again - not a big deal.  Then I saw 2 charges online on my account. Same amount at the same time or a minute apart. So clearly my story seemed valid.</p>
<p>I went to my bank and told them my situation and they said that I had to deal with the merchant/seller directly by myself first, then if that merchant/seller refused they could step in with more complicated steps.</p>
<p>Luckily I lived near the restaurant and I went there sort of often and it was close to my apartment.  They had no problem giving me my $10 back in cash to repay the second charge.</p>
<p>But ultimately kind of a difficult situation.  Luckily I checked my statement a few days afterwards to check for my work deposit into my account and looked for the 2 charges and knew exactly what it was, I live close by, and it was only for $10.  What if I was on vacation far away and had to deal with the merchant/seller? What if it was for more money that I was worried I would lose?</p>
<p>Credit is not evil if you really manage it and understand that credit cards can be used like debit - only swipe what you can afford (I know easier said than done) but treat your credit like debit and get the added benefit of cash back points. Plus building credit to be able to buy a home/car and get a better interest rate! </p></div>		</li>
