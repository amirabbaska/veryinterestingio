<p>Theoretically, if there was a material that was completely smooth at the molecular level, it's friction coefficient would be zero (no friction).</p>

<p>This is not true. You can get atomically smooth surfaces <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301679X16303553" target="_blank">relatively easily</a> and these will still exhibit a friction force due attractive van der Waal interactions. See this <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136970210500845X" target="_blank">article</a> for an example. </p>
<p>You are talking about roughness which enhances van der Waal interactions through increased surface area, but isnt actually the cause of friction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is the right answer. &quot;Rough&quot; surfaces increase friction because there's more points of contact for those attractive forces. </p>
<p>It's a common misconception that friction is from rough surfaces, but actually it's from attractive forces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. This answer is much more complicated than a introductory physics class. For example, gauge blocks are lapped, which means that their surfaces are about as smooth as mechanically possible. If you press two gauge blocks together, you can suspend one from the other.</p>
<p>Interactions between surfaces that are derivative of their roughness happen at the micro level, or 10E-6 meters. Other interactions we will still associate with friction occur at the nano level 10E-9 m, and these are much more difficult to explain with basic terminology. Interactions at this level lead to dissociative energy dissapation through vibration and heat.</p></div>		</li>
