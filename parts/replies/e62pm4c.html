			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah. You notice it when you see another car like yours but it doesn’t make it frequent. My previous car there were two maybe three in my city, I’d see them once a year or so. My current one there are at least 5-10 and I see them pretty much daily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you either describe your small town as a city or drive a rare car. I live in a small city (~500,000 metro area population) and I can't go 30 seconds without seeing someone with the same car as me</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife drives a Toyota Prius.  Every other car we see on the road is a Toyota &quot;something.&quot;</p>
<p>I drive a BMW i8.  I don't see a lot of BMWs on the road at all.  Espeically an i8.  They only sold 488 of them last year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I promise y’all before I got my car (an Infiniti i35) I had honestly never seen one before. </p>
<p>Now I see one maybe once a day, still fairly rare in the city of Chicago but definitely not as rare as I thought it was when I first got it </p></div>		</li>
