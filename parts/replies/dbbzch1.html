			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about this, I was hit (as a pedestrian) by a car going 45mph with no injuries minus being sore the next day. But the car itself was way more damaged than I was, my shoulder went completely through the windshield and my hip crushed the car hood before it flung me ten feet in front of it. All of my muscles were relaxed because I had earbuds in and didn't see it coming at all until it had actually hit me.</p>
<p>Are windshields really designed that human bones can break through them without damaging the person? How did the force disperse on that contact? I've been wondering for years how I did so much damage to that car but only got some intense but normal bruising. I was like 5'2&quot; 105 lbs at the time as well, certainly no large mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the windshield: I don't know the term for it, but when you hit something hard enough to break it, much less force is felt by you personally. I'm not having a great time trying to think of good examples. If you've ever tried to snap a piece of wood on your knee, but failed, you would note that it felt like someone just smacked you with a piece of wood. But if you then hit it harder you'll break through it and it won't hurt at all.</p>
<p>It also just doesn't require that much force to break a windshield. A few hundred pounds will do it, and that's just not that much compared to what your body goes through on a daily basis. If you weigh 200 lbs, that's how much force your body is under when you're just laying there. Jumping up and down is going to multiply that number by... something, math, whatever. Point is, your body is capable of sorta casually enduring hundreds of pounds of force (for brief periods) all the time, every day, without problems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer. It's not as though it was about pain as I would have thought my shoulder socket would have either shattered or be bumped out of place, as opposed to breaking deep into safety glass at high speed. Which is stronger at a concentrated point, you know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an engineer.  But what I do know about cars is that yes, much of the car is designed to &quot;fail&quot; and break before the limits of the human body.  This is why modern cars seem to fair so much worse in accidents which older cars could have survived unscathed.  It's not that those parts failed.  They are engineered to break before you do so that they have an opportunity to absorb as much of the impact as possible.</p>
<p>From what you describe, your accident is a perfect example of where being relaxed could make all the difference in the world.  If you saw the car coming and had tensed up, when you struck the windshield all of that force would have been imparted onto whatever part of your body struck the windshield first.  The windshield would have broken and absorbed some of the energy, but what it couldn't would have been applied to that one area of you body until the muscles, bones and other bodily components reached their breaking point.  Then the remaining energy would continue on into your body until it hit more resistance.  By being limp, that energy could travel through your body without having to break the first area to impact.  And as more of your body hit the car, the force is spread out over a larger surface area and defused enough to allow you absorb all of that energy without actually breaking any major part of your body.</p>
<p>The same principle is at work when you see athletes such as wrestlers who can take major impacts and still get up and walk away or even continue to perform.  You just did on accisent what they have to train to accomplish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Automobiles are designed to maximize survival of pedestrians who are hit by them. Bumpers are shaped to send you over the hood, rather than under the wheels. Windshields are designed to break, but not shatter into a million sharp pieces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The error here is &quot;low speed vs high speed&quot;. Maybe all this is true for low speed accidents but if your femur is getting snapped by a high energy crash you can be as relaxed as you want, it's still a-snappin' </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are limits to every system.  The higher the speed the more energy there is to be absorbed.  Eventually any system biological or mechanical is going to hit its limit and the remaining force is going to continue on.  If too much energy is exerted on a human body, then yes, there will be injuries.</p></div>		</li>
