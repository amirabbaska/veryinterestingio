			<div class="markdown"><p>The article has a little error: when we reduce tidal activity through tidal power stations, the effect that Earth's rotation increases the speed of the moon would get less, the moon would get slower, and it would move away from us at a lower speed. All the energy of tidal power stations comes in the end from the moon, not from Earth's rotation. Earth might even get slowed down less by the moon.</p>
<p>We could theoretically build tidal power stations so that the tides are in front of the moon, slowing down Earth and imparting the energy on the moon, but I doubt that would be very energy efficient for us.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it implies that there's an optimum rate to gather tidal energy, beyond which the calming effect of another tidal power station costs more total energy production than it gives. Probably roughly around 50% of the maximum possible 22TW mentioned (as an estimate)...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not right. Tidal energy is already absorbed entirely by landmasses and converted to heat. If we absorb some of it as electricity, it make no difference. The moon and the earth's orbit don't care how the energy is absorbed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I admit I gave probably too much weight on the effect of reducing the tides - as long as we don't cover large part of the oceans with tidal power stations, the article is right...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several posts further up show that the systems in play are so gargantuan, it's simply impossible for us to have any practical effect on the Earth/Moon system.</p></div>		</li>
