			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, cat's are more like a muscle mass with bone embedded for a loose structure. To contrast, we are more like bone scaffold with muscle mounted to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great, I wondered as much. It just seemed odd to have a whole arm segment, multiple bones, hanging in front of the ribs with nothing to relate them together. I guess I've always assumed all bones are linked into a single skeleton, but I guess this isn't really true. The human ear bones are &quot;free floating,&quot; I would guess.</p></div>		</li>

Sure, the clavicles articulate with the sternum, which articulates with ribs which articulate with the spine, but the scapula (shoulder blade) just sort of floats on top of the rib cage, enveloped and held in place by muscle.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Drumheller_150.jpg" target="_blank">Dinosaurs</a> and cats is just the same, only they don't have clavicles. That long club like bone at the top of the arm is a shoulder blade.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="http://www.packlunchraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/deer_bones.jpg" target="_blank">An illustration</a> of /u/SpiveyArms point about deer. The triangular bone at the top of the arm is the scapula (shoulder blade). It's not clear from this drawing, but that bone does not connect to the spine, it's just strapped to the rib cage by muscles beneath and on top of it. Actually, when /u/SpiveyArms says there are &quot;many animals whose shoulders aren't held by a joint&quot;, as far as I know, this is actually true for ALL tetrapods. We all evolved from fish who had a collection of bones for the pectoral fins to attach to, that eventually evolved into the scapula, clavicle and arm bones (even though clavicles disappeared in some animals). Arms were never connected to the spine by bone-on-bone articulation.</p></div>		</li>

Edit: The ear ossicles I mean</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scapulae technically <em>are</em> the shoulders - AFAIK musculature holds them to the ribs. Same goes for humans too.</p></div>		</li>
