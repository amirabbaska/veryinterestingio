			<p>There are many animals whose shoulders aren't held by a joint, but a muscle. Deer are the example I'm most familiar with. </p>		</li>

			<p>An idea floating in a bag of cat is going to be my band name. AIF BC for short.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, cat's are more like a muscle mass with bone embedded for a loose structure. To contrast, we are more like bone scaffold with muscle mounted to it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Great, I wondered as much. It just seemed odd to have a whole arm segment, multiple bones, hanging in front of the ribs with nothing to relate them together. I guess I've always assumed all bones are linked into a single skeleton, but I guess this isn't really true. The human ear bones are &quot;free floating,&quot; I would guess.</p>		</li>

Sure, the clavicles articulate with the sternum, which articulates with ribs which articulate with the spine, but the scapula (shoulder blade) just sort of floats on top of the rib cage, enveloped and held in place by muscle.<br><br><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Drumheller_150.jpg" target="_blank">Dinosaurs</a> and cats is just the same, only they don't have clavicles. That long club like bone at the top of the arm is a shoulder blade.<br><br>EDIT: <a href="http://www.packlunchraw.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/deer_bones.jpg" target="_blank">An illustration</a> of /u/SpiveyArms point about deer. The triangular bone at the top of the arm is the scapula (shoulder blade). It's not clear from this drawing, but that bone does not connect to the spine, it's just strapped to the rib cage by muscles beneath and on top of it. Actually, when /u/SpiveyArms says there are &quot;many animals whose shoulders aren't held by a joint&quot;, as far as I know, this is actually true for ALL tetrapods. We all evolved from fish who had a collection of bones for the pectoral fins to attach to, that eventually evolved into the scapula, clavicle and arm bones (even though clavicles disappeared in some animals). Arms were never connected to the spine by bone-on-bone articulation.</p>		</li>

			<p>But they are in humans, through the clavicle not being free-floating, right? So is that true of other primates? Is it an adaptation to using forelimbs to climb/swing from branches?</p>		</li>

			<p>I might have misinterpreted OP's question a bit, but as I understood it, he looked at an image like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Drumheller_150.jpg" target="_blank">this one</a>, and wondered why the arm bones just hang off the side like that, instead of connecting to the spine like the pelvis does.<br><br>Based on my interpretation of OP's question, the point of my reply is that that's how it is in all tetrapods - the scapula does not connect to the spine like the pelvis does. The clavicle, of course, <em>does</em> articulate against the sternum, but if OP's question was how come dinosaur shoulders don't attach at the back, I think he/she would be equally surprised that in humans the shoulders actually connect to the chest!<br><br>Regarding the function of the clavicle, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clavicle#Other_animals" target="_blank">this</a> wiki page sheds some light. The clavicle is not a unique adaptation of primates or even mammals. It originated in the fish ancestors of all tetrapods, and has subsequently been lost or retained by different animals. There are also a number of related bones that some fossils have, some modern animals have or not, and so on (interclavicle, coracoid, etc).<br><br>EDIT: I'm not at all an expert, but I googled some more on the function of the clavicle, and it seems it is more retained in mammals that climb, while running animals like horses and dogs have vestigial or lost clavicles. So it seems like your instinct that it's useful for climbing is correct, although the bone is much, much older than primates.</p>		</li>

			<p>Awesome! Yeah I don't think he ment connected to the spine in a literal way, more of that all bones are attached/jointed together  </p>		</li>

			<p>The are not floating, but are actually attached by both joints and muscles. <br>Edit: The ear ossicles I mean</p>		</li>

			<p>The scapulae technically <em>are</em> the shoulders - AFAIK musculature holds them to the ribs. Same goes for humans too.</p>		</li>
