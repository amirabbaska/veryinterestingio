<p>I'm not really sure what part of the story you are calling not credible. </p>
<p><a href="http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-11-09/news/0160080095_1_radio-waves-black-hawk-hawk-crashes" target="_blank">Here is a news article from 1987 about the controversy.</a> </p>
<p>There definitely was some mystery over whether EMI actually caused the crashes, and I'm sure that it could never be proven with 100% certainty. But the Navy, and eventually the Army, took it seriously enough to make changes to procedures and the aircraft themselves.</p>
<p>As for the lawn dart nickname, that stems from the general tendency of the aircraft to enter a dive when the stabilator programs to the full down position either uncommanded, of fails to program up on take off (when the acceleration is too quick to be recovered). EMI was a suspected factor in two of the cases for sure, but there were other accidents involving the stabilator. It was so serious, they installed the <a href="https://images.fineartamerica.com/images-medium-large/cyclic-steven-humphrey.jpg" target="_blank">vertical switch you can see here protruding up from the stem of the cyclic</a>, which when pulled with the pink moves the stabilator upward.</p>
<p>As to how common the particular nickname was, I unfortunately have no source other than crusty old instructors I had at Fort Rucker, sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, with all of the emi filters installed there are still times when the stab will drive on its own. Just a parts failure. I do not see RF from a tower being high enough to interfere unless they were ten foot away like on a ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc the reason you still have to store laptops and tablets on takeoff and landing is because in the event of a crash those become deadly projectiles. Phones would too but people usually hold on to those pretty well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wellâ€¦ There was this one time when I was on the phone with my then girlfriend, and I wasn't paying attention to what I was doing. I reached over and put my other phone directly into the cup of water I had, and didn't notice for a whole five minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were very useful in, say, search and rescue volunteer groups. No need to buy and carry two devices, as everybody has a cell phone anyway. Besides, every second saved increases likelihood of finding the person alive, so logistics delay related to distributing walkie talkies were mitigated.</p></div>		</li>
