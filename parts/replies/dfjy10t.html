			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's another way to think about it, and you'll see why tidal locking actually is important:</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, imagine a stationary Earth/Moon system. You're on a spaceship a few million kilometers away, firing asteroids at the Moon because that's how you get your kicks. If you're &quot;behind&quot; the Moon (relative to the Earth) you can basically aim your asteroid gun directly at the Moon and hit it with a straight line shot. It'll take a while to get there, but you know it'll hit.</p>
<p>Now, let's say you're somewhat &quot;behind&quot; the Earth (relative to the Moon) and aim your asteroid gun directly at the Moon. Despite aiming a direct line shot to the Moon, you're far less likely to hit it because the Earth's gravity will &quot;pull&quot; it towards itself, basically arcing the shot. The tighter your angle &quot;behind&quot; the Earth, the more the shot pulls to the side.</p>
<p>Now real life astronomy and orbital mechanics are, of course, much more complex, with moving Sun/Earth and Earth/Moon systems, and perturbation from other objects in the Solar System. On the &quot;local&quot; scale of the Earth/Moon system, however, that gravitational &quot;arcing&quot; from the Earth still provides a statistically significant change to the chances of something hitting either side of the Moon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not so clear: Earth's gravity might also pull poorly aimed shots, that otherwise would have missed, towards the Moon so that they hit.</p></div>		</li>
