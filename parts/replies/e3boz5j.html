			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, not to mention that the subtitles change more often then scenes do. Whenever new subtitles pop up, my focus is dragged to them. Especially when there's less visual action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I happen to suffer from the exact opposite problem. I have a huge lazyass when it comes to subtitles and while its helpful because i get to train listenin to whatever language, if im not proficient on it i miss lots of lines. Can you explain why is my brain like that, even thou it has been trained how to read?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think their answer is accurate. Some people read automatically (like if I flip through a book I haven’t read it’s possible for me to see a spoiler which SUCKS), but others definitely need to focus in order to read. My fiancé needs to pay close attention and see the letters clearly in order to read (maybe some is automatic; I’m not him) coherently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude, I hate that. I literally have spoiled endings of books for myself because I picked it up wrong and a flash of a paragraph becomes clear ”AND THEN THIS GUY CUT OFF THAT GUYS HEAD&quot; and I get soooo pissed off at myself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think in that case it is a matter of how much text is presented to you. In a move or television show you are only presented with a few words at a time. In a book you have several hundred words. It is easier to read a few words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's training.  Once you have learned the behaviour well enough, it becomes automatic.  </p>
<p>If you were to watch without volume (or extremely low volume) for long enough (measured in hours, not minutes), it is likely that you would find it much easier to read with the volume on.  </p>
<p>When it comes to reading, the speed and fluidity is somewhat dependent on how much you are able to comprehend with every fixation.<br />
As you read, your eyes stop a few times per line. Each stop is a fixation in which your eyes will take in a set number of words/characters.  (Part of learning speed reading is learning to recognise more words per fixation, resulting in fewer stops per line.)  </p>
<p>Likely, you are having mild difficulty doing this while <em>also</em> tracking movement and/or sound, or perhaps the lighting might interfere with your processing.    </p>
<p>It could just be training.  You're just not used to it.   </p>
<p>However, it could be neurological.  It may not be anything serious or otherwise notable, just another example of neurodiversity.<br />
OTOH, perhaps you have a very slight reading disorder, or other issue processing sensory information, or something like that, and it's so slight it's been otherwise unnoticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What confuses me is that im also a very fast reader. I can skip through a story and uderstand it, for example, and i enjoy reading very much,and very dense books, as none of the fantasy books on my shelf have less than 400 pages. Thats what confuses me about this. Why am i lazy with subs if i enjoy reading so much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you notice the same effect if the subtitles and audio are in the same language? What if it's your native? I find that I can easily ignore subtitles in a language different from the audio (including not automatically reading native or english lines) and if I <em>want</em> to read them while still listening, that requires some effort and might be slow.  However, that is only like that for a bilingual input, if it's all in the same language and I'm fluent in it, then by default I read the text faster than they say anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If its both audio and subs on the same language, i tend to pay much more attention to the sub, but i enjoy seein just how different the subs are from the actual spoken words, so i guess that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is close I think. What you are saying is 'you can't look at words and not understand then once you know their meaning.' </p>
<p>I want to know why my eyes are drawn to the text when I hear and see just fine. I do it anytime there's text scrolling on a news station too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much.  Like that trick where they have two words printed, both names of colours, but each name printed in ink the colour of the other word.<br />
And then you have to quickly point at the one that says &quot;pink.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
