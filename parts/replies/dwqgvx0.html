			<div class="markdown"><p>Trees do this, too. If one is diseased or damaged, it'll release panicky pheromones that alert others nearby that something bad is happening. In the case of, say, a beetle infestation, the other trees nearby receiving the message seem to react with defense mechanisms, such as bolstering their bark. And IIRC, the messages are not unique to specific tree types (e.g. birches can communicate with pine).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You make a good point. The post above detailing the increased bitterness of the leaves as a response is a better example. I do recall reading about changes in the bark as a response though, but perhaps that was related to fungi or parasitic plant growth on the trees</p></div>		</li>
