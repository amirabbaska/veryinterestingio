			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because it's fairly simple to replace the battery - if you're ok with a little DIY and soldering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cartridge works - you can play the game -, but your save file will evaporate minutes after you turn off the console.</p>
<p>You could solve this by permanently plugging your GameBoy to a power supply, or leaving it off only a few seconds (before the battery runs out again), or replacing the battery altogether.</p>
<p><strong>Edit :</strong> So yes it's hard to find a &quot;working&quot; gen two cartridge, and it's harder as time goes on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, it is very easy to replace the battery. This will of course kill the existing save unless you get fancy with supplying power while you change the battery. </p></div>		</li>
