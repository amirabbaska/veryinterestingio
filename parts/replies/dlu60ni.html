			<div class="markdown"><p>For the Minkowski metric (flat spacetime), then the coordinate speed of light is <em>c</em> <em>globally</em>.</p>
<p>(For those with the brackground, strictly speaking, we still only say that the speed of light is <em>c</em> locally, but flat spacetime has the special property that there is natural way to identify the tangent spaces at different points and independently of path.)</p>
<p>But there are two important caveats here. I wrote what I did very precisely.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You can easily use coordinates in a Minkowski spacetime for which the speed of light is not globally constant. For example, Rindler coordinates, those of a uniformly accelerating observer, do not give a constant coordinate speed of light.</p>
</li>
<li>There are non-Minkowski spacetimes where it is possible to set up coordinates for which the speed of light is <em>c</em> globally. Any spacetime that is <em>conformally equivalent</em> to Minkowski spacetime has this property. For instance, the FLRW metric with a vanishing curvature parameter (which describes the standard cosmology) is conformally equivalent to the Minkowski metric. So it's possible to describe our universe at large scales with coordinates in such a way that the speed of light is globally constant.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what exactly does this mean? Are you referring to how gravitational lensing can provide multiple images of same thing, which are not synced in time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you set up coordinates (t, <strong>x</strong>) for your (particular chart of) spacetime, the coordinate speed |d<strong>x</strong>/dt| of a light signal need not be <em>c</em>. This is a consequence of the curvature the spacetime. It is not possible to set up inertial coordinates for the entire spacetime; if it were, then all light signals would have speed <em>c</em> everywhere on their path.</p>
<p>So my statement has nothing to do with gravitational lensing. A common line of thought for laymen is: (1) speed of light is constant and (2) gravity bends space so straight lines are &quot;longer&quot;. (3) Therefore, (1) and (2) need to be reconciled. Well, (1) is not correct. Sure, (2) is not really an accurate description of curvature, but (1) is just not true. So there's never even a naive contradiction. But the reason why (1) is not true is quite complicated. </p>
<p>A light signal that passes right by you will have speed <em>c</em> at the very moment, and it doesn't matter what your speed is with respect to any locally inertial frame. This is essentially the second postulate of special relativity reformulated properly in general relativity. But if you measure the coordinate speed of the light signal somewhere else on its path, you will not necessarily get |d<strong>x</strong>/dt| = <em>c</em>.</p></div>		</li>
