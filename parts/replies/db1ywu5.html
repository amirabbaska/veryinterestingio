			<div class="markdown"><p>This is possible in English too though, we just don't have punctuation to reflect it.  Take these two sentences for example:</p>
<p>You're going to the festival. (Telling)</p>
<p>You're going to the festival? (Asking)</p>
<p>The only spoken difference is inflection, and the only written difference is in punctuation. </p>
<p>Edit: (It is possible to rephrase the same question in question format. Are you going to the festival? But it changes the contextual meaning. The former example implies surprise and subverted expectation, whereas the second is a flat, straight question.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, in English you can use the same structure, however you also have a proper structure if you need. In Spanish there is none at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a crappy festival then the inflection would be different altogether. </p>
<p>You're going to the festivaal? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(just copy pasting my comment from 5 days ago on a similar thread)</p>
<p>We don't change the word order for questions in Portuguese either, but use only the normal question mark at the end of the sentence.</p>
<p>It is funny though that children learning to read and even slow-reading adults sometimes will start reading a sentence with an &quot;affirmative&quot; intonation, then when surprised by the question mark at the end exaggerate the &quot;question&quot; intonation in the last or couple of last words.</p>
<p>So yeah, having the upsidedown question mark at the start may help a little bit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to think that it's because, at some point in history, those dirty Spaniards stole all of the extra punctuation on the Iberian peninsula and wanted to find a way to rub that in Portugal's face. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Happens a lot also in Italy.<br />
That's why I always tried to keep myself ahead and prepare the reading before I had to actually do it (if it wasn't written by me, that is)...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! Having the &quot;¡&quot; before it makes sure you start reading knowing it's an interjection, not an offer :-)</p>
<p>&quot;Caralho?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, thanks, I'll have the oysters instead.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is funny to me because I learned Spanish before English, so when I learned English it confused me so much. Like how was I supposed to know it was a question until the end of a sentence? I would be so infuriated when I read a really long sentence and it turned out to be a question so I had to change my voice out of the blue at the last word. Spanish was so much easier, it was like  a warning.</p></div>		</li>
