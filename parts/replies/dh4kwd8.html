			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking of taste, but have actually wondered if there isn't some real difference in how things taste.  I've cooked for varieties of people and have seen differences that seem to be more than simple preference.  For instance, I might use curry with someone unfamiliar with the spice, and get a reaction that they simply don't like it.  Fine, some people like this, others that.  BUT, I have also seen reactions to food that are more visceral, where the taste is utterly repugnant to the point I've wondered if we are actually experiencing a similar taste.  </p>
<p>I've noticed in myself a change over the years.   At one time, I HATED stewed spinach with a revulsion beyond, say my dislike other flavors.   It was s physical refusal.  I like to try foods I hate every decade or so, just to check in.  Last fall I tried it again, and I liked it.  It seemed like a completely different food and reaction to years earlier.  It was delicious.  </p>
<p>There seem to be certain tastes (sour, salt, bitter, acid) that differ so widely among people, I've wondered if we are actually tasting the same thing. </p>
<p>Short story:  I wonder if we taste differently from each other. And over time.</p>
<p>To respond to the sophists among us, it seems that finding out if, how, and why this developed could offer clues to evolutionary advantages between the differences.  For example, finding out if there are differences in how we taste salt, for example, could offer clues that affect treatment and risk for heart disease.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think just because I might like some particular taste or smell and you don't, doesn't necessarily mean that we perceive them differently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't express myself well, but there seems at times to be a reaction other than dislike, that seems to be more about the quality of a food.  I've experienced that in myself, where it seems as if my perception of the food itself has changed, not simply my preference for it.  </p></div>		</li>
