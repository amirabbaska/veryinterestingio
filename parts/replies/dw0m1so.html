			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, making dungeons is much more fun for me than running the game. And I have a weird addiction for collecting notebooks. My fiance is always getting on to me for all the blank books and journals I have. I tell her at least my addiction isn't meth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Real engineering paper has the grid printed on the back of the sheet and you only use one side. After years of using engineering paper I now work at a place with a bunch of scientist that all use the abhorrent lab notebooks like the parent comment.</p>
<p>I understand why its needed but DO NOT equate glorious engineering paper with this primitive lab notebook trash!</p>
<p>Source: I literally have both on my desk right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed about usefulness, I've got it handy too.  </p>
<p>My kids used it for some drawings and the dots-and-boxes game, but otherwise thought I was weird for using it.  Then one day they hit their first math class that required plotting points on a line.  Suddenly it changed from <em>'that weird paper dad uses'</em> to <em>'the awesome paper that makes math homework easier and my teacher praises.'</em></p>
<p>I prefer the back-printed variety as well, but when somebody gives me some that is printed on front or printed on both sides --- such as a birthday present from my mom -- I'll still use it.  It is also more likely to be used to play the dots-and-boxes game with my kids, so even better for the entertainment perspective.</p></div>		</li>
