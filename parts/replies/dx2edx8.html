			<div class="markdown"><p>What country was this in?  I can't believe that this would be true when in compliance with USA law.  OSHA has thresholds for vapor exposure, for ethyl alcohol it's 1000ppm (parts of vapor or gas per million parts of contaminated air by volume at 25 Â°C and 760 torr.).  Can 1000ppm do this?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because it's an OSHA standard doesn't mean the company follows the rules. Used to work for a shop that did this. It was so dangerous. They hooked a guy up to a air compressor to breath in a closed sandblasting box. I bet compressor air tastes better anyway tho, with the oil mixture and all. </p></div>		</li>
