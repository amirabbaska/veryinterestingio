			<p>&gt;You develop an immunity to said virus regardless of the variation IIRC.<br><br>except for the varicella zoster virus (chicken pox).  People infected with that virus harbor it for life.  If the immune system becomes weakened, or as we age, it will reactivate as shigles.  I wonder how many other viruses do this, entering an altered state in our cells only to reactivate at some point.</p>		</li>

			<p>So that's why my 90 year old grandma has had shingles twice? Dormant herpes virus?</p>		</li>

I remember reading that people with Remitting Relapsing MS had VZV and the Epstein Barr virus present in their body when they were having a relapse in their MS.  <br><br>Remitting relapsing MS accounts for the vast majority of cases upon diagnosis.  It tends to turn into secondary progressive MS later in life.  Primary progressive is less common.  <br><br>It's long been suspected that MS is genetic.  We have some kind of faulty gene which allows us to 'contract' MS.  It may be that these viruses 'trigger' the MS in people who have the faulty gene.  The faulty gene in question is linked to Scandinavians; hence why MS prevalence is highest in countries who have a Scandinavian connection.  <br><br>Scotland has the highest rate of MS in the world.  I'm Scottish and I took an ancestry DNA test which shows I'm 11% Scandinavian.  <br><br>There's also potentially a linked to vitamin D, which is gained from sunlight.  <br><br>Essentially, if you have the gene, have come into contact with chicken pox and Epstein Barr virus and live somewhere with low light - you are at highest risk of being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  <br><br>Some sauce: <br><a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/msi/2011/214763/" target="_blank">http://www.hindawi.com/journals/msi/2011/214763/</a><br><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3719426/" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3719426/</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Great info!  I have a feeling that viruses account for a lot of other ailments we haven't discovered yet.  examples are cancers, type 1 diabetes, and viral cardiomyopathy.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Back in the first half of the 20th century, research on cancer viruses was all the rage (discovery of murine mammary virus was a huge driver for ex) but research since then has failed to link most candidate viruses to cancer in a causal way. <br><br>Right now, the big immunology overlap with cance  research is inflammation, not viruses. <br><br>To grossly oversimplify, if you have a 'wound' that does not heal, chronic inflammation can set in-- with the secreted growth factors promoting cancer growth (and the chronic aspect teaching the immune system that cancer cells ought be tolerated).<br><br><br>In this case, wound wouldn't be something like a cut, but just any local activation of the immune system...the issue being that it doesn't shut down for some reason, perhaps the tumor evolves to resist apoptosis or interfere with immune signaling or coopts immune cell secretions to grow off of them.<br><br>For diabetes, I think the hot thing is bacteria right now.

			<p>It infects nerve cells too.  It infects nerve cells differently though, and can remain under the radar of immune response.  What reactivates it isn't entirely clear, but when it does the infection is much worse than chickenpox because it impacts nerve cells.  A friend of mine got shingles on his face when he was 42 and it gave him Bells Palsy.<br><br>My kids got the Chicken pox vaccine and will never have to worry about it.  I had chicken pox when I was in 3rd grade, so I may end up with shingles at some point though I plan on getting the new vaccine for that when it's time.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Wouldn't someone who got the vaccine still have chicken pox if they ever contact with the virus?<br><br>They wouldn't get sick but they should still contract it to some degree?</p>		</li>

			<p>My understanding is that kids who get the vaccine will have a much lower incidence of shingles later in life.  I don't understand the mechanics of this.</p>		</li>

			<p>Someone commented that if the virus ever reaches the nerve cells (If you come into contact after vaccine and it reaches them somehow) you may develop shingles if you have a lowered immune response in the future due to the virus not killing nerve cells completely and the immune system not detecting them as such.<br><br>As for that, I don't understand those mechanics either hah.</p>		</li>

			<p>While it's true that in some cases, they might be able to get shingles, but for the most part the antibodies in their system will knock out the chickenpox quickly enough that it doesn't infect nerve cells.</p>		</li>

			<p>I get shingles twice a year, every year in my left eye, so annoying. Whenever there is a switch into winter or into summer I get it. I can also force it by going from a hot sauna/spa and jumping into a cold pool a few times in a row.</p>		</li>

			<p>Herpes type viruses are able to enter into a latent stage. So even though your immune system has effectively &quot;beaten&quot; the virus, it has been written into your DNA, and every time a cell reproduces via mitosis it is copied into the new cells. They can be reactivated by molecular cues indicating the immune system is compromised which is why herpes is often referred go as a cold sore or fever blister , because it reactivates when you're already sick.</p>		</li>

			<p>The immune system is much less perfect than people make it out to be. <br><br>Chronic viral infection is implicated in many diseases such as MS, Fibro, CFS, and a portion of &quot;autoimmune&quot; diseases. <br><br>It makes sense, more people = more viruses = more total time spent 'evolving'. Meanwhile, our immune system takes generations to change. </p>		</li>

			<p>Families are a very broad group, and contain dozens to hundreds of different species of virus. And even within the same species, there can be hundreds of variants. Being exposed to one species or variant does not necessarily mean you will develop immunity that protects you against related species/variants.<br><br>For example, catching Influenza in 2016 will not necessarily give you immunity against Influenza in 2017, even though the two virus strains will be very very closely related.</p>		</li>
