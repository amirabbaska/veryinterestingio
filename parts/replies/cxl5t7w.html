			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear operator here.  This answer is correct.  When a reactor is at power, there are many systems that are continuously being operated locally for various evolutions and surveillance testing.  Many of the key valves are remotely operated, but to make every possible valve that needs to be regularly manipulated into a remotely operated valve would be virtually impossible and not cost-effective.  To have an entire plant underwater would make the daily operations and required preventative maintenance on vital equipment impossible.  Additionally, water is corrosive.  The systems used at a nuclear plant are stringently maintained chemically dependent on the various materials the system is made of and the temperatures and pressures to which the material is exposed.  If all of these systems were placed underwater for 50+ years, they would be drastically degraded in a relatively short time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started as a nuclear operator for the Navy about 15 years ago.  Their initial training program is about 2 years long where you learn the fundamentals of reactor theory and build up to qualifying at a prototype nuclear plant.  From there you get sent off to whatever command you get assigned to (nuclear powered sub or aircraft carrier) to relearn and qualify at an entirely different plant design.  Since then, I've gotten out of the Navy and now have a civilian operator license which takes about 2 years as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take the right paths, operator status can be obtained in 6 months or a year. In HS I had an internship at a reactor one summer. They had an operator course that was a semester long. I just got certified to handle radioactive materials. But I'm still probably on some lists. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a nuclear plant in the Midwest as an equipment operator. There are three different types of operators here: equipment operator (EO) , nuclear station operator (NSO), and senior reactor operator (SRO). EOs run surveillances and operate equipment in the field. We're the eyes and ears of the plant. I started right out of college (BS Electrical Engineering) and my training was about 1 year long. NSOs are stationed in the control room and are constantly monitoring various parameters and operating certain equipment remotely. This requires an extra 18 months of training after several years spent as an EO. SROs are management and get the same training as NSOs but they handle more admin stuff and don't operate anything unless it's an absolute emergency. SROs can be hired from inside or outside the company so the time to become this level will vary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear reactors are heavily shielded. I  fact, a coal power plant puts out more radiation than a nuclear plant. </p>
<p>This is because there are many materials on the earth's crust that are slightly radioactive. Hell, even uranium is a lot more common than you expect. You might barely detect it with a Geiger counter, but dig it up and burn it and you release the radioactivity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's true.  Exposure rates are extremely low.  I'm more worried about the radon in my basement than the exposure I would get from work.  There are some contractors working a certain job or doing a certain task like changing out resin from a demineralizer, for example, who may be exposed to more than that, but our department as a whole does not get much exposure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What are your thoughts on Thorium for nuclear energy? I've watched/read and some experts say it's a viable source for nuclear energy and reactors would be 'walk away safe' because the reactors wouldn't be under any kind of pressure. But the technology got scrapped in favor of Uranium/Plutonium because the U.S. wanted to make weapons. </p>
<p>The articles/videos i've read are written themselves by the Thorium advocates. It would be nice to hear someone else's opinion on the topic.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uranium wasn't chosen because we want weapons, it was chosen because it'd the absolute best candidate with its half life and cross sectional view. Compare the barns (an actual unit of measurement!) Of uranium to thorium. You're looking for specific isotopes as well, 235 for uranium, unsure which for the thorium advocates.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not so happy with the methods they used to decide how big of a tsunami they needed to design against in the first place.</p>
<p>Apparently a key part of the process was consulting the local old people about folk law regarding how high the largest historical tsunami was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earthquake and the tsunami was the initiating event. The plant design and some would argue the greatest flaw is that a reactor plant can only go so long without electrical power to maintain cooling and restore inventory.
The earthquake and tsunami took out the power lines that connected the plant to the grid. In addition the tsunami took out the plants Emergency Diesel Generators by flooding out the compartments. So this left the operators with no power to restore inventory to the Units and Spent Fuel Pools and severely crippled the plants ability to maintain cooling once the initial water inventory boiled away.
This is what is nice about the AP-1000. They are designed to be able to establish long term passive cooling. The only weakness from a design stand point that I can determine is that the AP-1000 still needs a sizable inventory of water. In which case acquiring more water should an earthquake fracture the water holding tanks could be a weakness in the design. Perhaps Molten Salt Reactors would be advancement in doing away with that potential issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At least in response to Fukushima we've learned some incredible lessons. One client we work with has a full fleet of serviced and ready to go land rovers, mobile sat com stations and generators housed at a few strategically placed sites around the country ready to deploy and arrive within a few hours of any of its sites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking that instead of power for pumps, they should rather have a reservoir/water-towers with water, and a form of ice-plug that stops it unless power goes up/and it heats up.  If there is a power-outage, the fresh water will flush trough the system.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earthquake?  Loss of power more likely.  Reactors are engineered to be pretty darn resilient.  The problem with Fukushima was not with the initial earthquake but the cooling systems losing power and backups failing.   Why did they fail? because a tsunami destroyed them because they were too close to the ocean, which was prone to tsunami. </p>
<p>Chernobyl was a failure during a test of the cooling systems in which operator error was to blame.  Warning systems were turned off during tests of the cooling system.  It was 100% preventable in multiple ways but the Ukrainian/Soviet engineers were oblivious to what was turned off and what they were testing. </p>
<p>Both incidents were 100% preventable, but multiple human errors happened. </p></div>		</li>
