			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna call total BS on this.  While it might be true the brain swells or shrinks a bit during sleep/awake cycles, the notion that we feel tired because metabolic waste collects in the CSF during the daytime and we need to sleep to circulate out the waste CSF to replenish it with fresh CSF is total BS.  That could be 1% of the reason we feel tired, but if we harvested someone's CSF slowly over the course of a couple sessions, and then replaced that with their &quot;dirty CSF&quot; at the end of the day they wouldn't suddenly feel energized and no longer need sleep.  Even simple anecdotal evidence would suggest the model you're proposing isn't true at all.  Our brains atrophy with age, especially notable in people with dementia.  The size of the ring of CSF between their brains and the skull can be double the size of a normal person's or more.  It doesn't improve their &quot;CSF circulation&quot; per se, and they sure as well aren't immune to feeling exhausted with all the alleged CSF flow they have going on.</p>
<p>The fact is we barely know anything about sleep.  It's a relatively uncharted field in human physiology.  We still haven't even figured out WHY the human body even needs sleep to function properly, let alone try to make a claim that we have found the organic basis of feeling tired and needing sleep in &quot;dirty&quot; CSF.  Hell, we never even discovered the first gene that controlled circadian rhythms - clock gene - until about 10-15 years ago when a guy that used to be at Northwestern Univ discovered it.  I took a class with the guy he was really cool.  He got like 10,000 mice, exposed them to a chemical that causes genetic deficits, and then charted their sleep/wake cycles.  He found a single mouse that had a circadian cycle that was 2 hours longer than the rest of the mice and was able to identify the gene responsible.  Utterly amazing stuff and cannot believe it worked.  But that's a separate topic.</p>
<p>EDIT: One thing I want to pre-emptively add to this.  There's a huge gap between in vitro (in the petri dish) and in vivo (in a living object).  A lot of people don't fully appreciate this, and you can see it all the time in the mainstream media coverage of scientific breakthroughs, where for example some lab has shown that some random fruit extract can kill cancer cells while leaving regular cells untouched.  That doesn't mean they've cured cancer, that just means they found a chemical that can kill selective cell population in a petri dish.  It would be another 10-15 years or longer of work on said chemical to bring it to market in a drug if it did turn out to a viable cancer drug.  Yes, there HAS been research that has shown neurons can't operate their transport channels during the daytime, and we need sleep so the neurons can open these and clear metabolic waste.  It's a farcry to conclude that this is the reason we feel tired.  All that research really has proven is that some random neurons close some random channels when we're awake, and opens them while we're asleep.  That is the limitation of proving something in vitro.  I'm sure if you did exhaustive chemical analysis on our morning CSF and compared to evening CSF you would find some difference in levels of chemicals here and there, but I almost 100% guarantee you that you would not be able to prove that if you removed those chemicals from evening CSF you would make someone feel energized like they just finished a great night of sleep; likewise you would not make someone suddenly feel tired if you added said chemical to their CSF in the morning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds legit... but can you provide a source please?</p>
<p>Reason I ask is that another question shows up a lot around here and that question is &quot;Why do we need to sleep?&quot; And it really never gets a good answer.</p>
<p>This seems like a pretty clear reason why humans need sleep if it's correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another theory about why we need to sleep is that memory consolidation occurs then. Throughout the day we take in information and store it temporarily, our brain then decides if it's important enough to remember and either gets rid of the memory or puts it into long term storage. Memory consolidation is what makes this new information long term and it happens through the strengthening of neural connections while one is asleep. So without the adequate amount of sleep our ability to later recall information we learned worsens. A lot of this isn't very well understood  and studies are continuously coming up with more theories. Because we're talking about the human brain there isn't really one answer to why we sleep, chances are its a combination of many complex processes.

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://qz.com/424120/our-poor-sleeping-habits-could-be-filling-our-brains-with-neurotoxins/" target="_blank">This source</a> seems to say yes:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Basically, the cerebrospinal fluid sits around your brain and spinal cord and “every six to eight hour period, filters through the brain while you’re asleep,” Tara Swart, a senior lecturer at MIT specializing in sleep and the brain, told Quartz. “The whole process takes six to eight hours.”</p>
<p>...this process clears neurotoxins out of your brain, specifically one called beta-amyloid, which has been found in clumps in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. When this system can’t function properly due to lack of sleep, harmful remnants, like beta-amyloid, are allowed to build up.</p>
<p>The more beta-amyloid you have in certain parts of your brain, the less deep sleep you get and, consequently, the worse your memory. Additionally, the less deep sleep you have, the less effective you are at clearing out this bad protein.</p>
<p>...even if you don’t feel sleepy, your brain needs those six to eight hours to cleanse itself every day.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's premature to say that your body &quot;needs&quot; sleep to do anything.</p>
<p>I took a cognitive neuroscience course a few years ago, and it turns out that there are some people who just <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703712504576242701752957910" target="_blank">do not sleep</a> We have no idea why, or how.</p>
