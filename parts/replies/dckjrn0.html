<p>Is there an amount of time that can go by where they can just recognize the whole balance of the card as revenue with zero cost?  </p>
<p>Do companies prefer to just keep this in their liabilities sometimes for tax purposes?  I assume they have the cash available to them for operations either way, but recognizing it makes it taxable.  Is that correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On your first question, the answer is 'it depends' (in technical accounting, this is almost always the answer). They can recognise it when it becomes probable that it will never be redeemed. But how do you know when that is? The seller would never be able to know that Little Timmy who received a gift card to Game Stop for Christmas mid-placed the card and will never be able to prove that he owned it. So, eventually, to the company it is just free money. But the assumptions that go into estimating that can be complex. </p>
<p>I replied to another user about the tax issues on it - but the tl;dr is that the tax accounting does not always (or normally) follow the GAAP/IFRS accounting - resulting in timing differences and therefore deferred taxes. </p></div>		</li>
