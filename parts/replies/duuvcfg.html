			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, no kidding. If you want something that's absolutely insanely complex, take a look at the <a href="http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/dl/free/0073403466/872912/Chapter_7.pdf" target="_blank">actual biochemistry of photosynthesis</a> (PDF warning), AKA the bane of every first-year bio student's life.</p>
<p>To me these insanely complex systems are actually a pretty good argument <em>against</em> intelligent design--ask a human engineer to design a solar power plant and there's no way they'd come up with something that convoluted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol yes I actually know it pretty well, had to take biology as a chemical engineer.</p>
<p>My peers who studied later biochemistry classes for med school were literally dying in the stacks of memorization required to have a good understanding of just one biological process.</p>
<p>Photosynthesis in particular doesn't impress me at all, from an engineering perspective. I always found cellular respiration to make a lot more sense, efficiency wise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. I work at a cannabis grow, and there are special light spectrums and timing to produce harvests year round. We have different rooms for vegetating and flowering plants for this reason. The outdoor grow operations only get the one massive harvest pretty year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha no problem. I'm actually just counsel for the cannabis grow, so I'm not the grower, but I've grown on my own and know a bit about it. </p>
<p>When you're on a veg cycle, you use a different light spectrum and run about 16 hours on and 8 hours off. I know nothing about the science behind the spectrums, but we use Fluence LEDs and they seem pretty knowledgeable. We've also used Gavita lights, but they get very hot, so you need a suitable HVAC system depending on the size of the grow. </p>
<p>When the plants are ready to flower, you typically give them longer periods of darkness (we do 12 hours on and 12 off), and I understand that that's when they develop the terps and whatnot (so I'm told). Some growers swear by some funky light schedules, like inserting random hours of light in longer periods of darkness, and sometimes we mix of the light schedule for different strains. You also switch out the lights or move them into flowering rooms with the flowering light spectrum.</p>
<p>You can grow pretty well indoors in grow tents (we have rooms for the vast majority of our plants, but we do breeding in the tents) with fans, humidifiers, and proper LED lights (and equipment to test water, very fine magnifying glasses to sex the plants, and any nutrients to add to the soil). Some light manufacturers will send you a free light if you indicate that you're in the market for more and want to test them out.</p>
<p>As for books, we have a <em>ton</em>, and a lot of them aren't specific to cannabis, as we take tips from the ornamental indoor market as well. The one that has been most helpful to me is Ed Rosenthal's Marijuana Grower's Handbook. It's typically one of the best known, but it's also one of the best. Hope that's helpful! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We've somehow managed to confuse our rubber tree - spring/summer is supposed to be growing season, but she grows in winter. We thought it was because of how hot our living room gets in winter, but now I'm not sure and kind of concerned. </p></div>		</li>
