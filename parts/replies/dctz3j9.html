			<div class="markdown"><p>The secret is in three things, and unfortunately you have to do them consciously until muscle memory takes over and it turns into auto-pilot. And I'm sorry all this sounds like an alien serial killer but it's hard to talk about eye twinkle without it coming off that way. It doesn't help that this is the first time I've manually put thought into it.</p>
<p>How high your eyebrows are raised, how open your eyelids are, and the tiniest sliver of a smile. There's a sweet spot for all three of these and the easiest way to start is with your eyebrows, you want them raised but not enough that your forehead wrinkles. It's a subtle raise, people need to notice when you stop raising them and it helps others see your eyes because it almost looks like your actual brow ridge raises. Depressed people have eyes that are hard to see and low eyebrows almost make it look like you're trying to look down even if you're not.</p>
<p>Your eyelids are harder because you don't have a definitive stopping point like a wrinkled forehead, and I'm sure it's different for everyone. All I know is you need to keep making your eyes more visible, so they need to be open more, but obviously too much is a problem. I guess a way to do it is to squint. Depressed people have eyes that are more closed, so it's harder to tell when they squint. Not that you're going to be squinting a ton but it's important to have a full range of emotion(tm). It needs to be obvious when you squint, but you don't need to look full on deer in headlights. These two make the actual twinkle, I think, if you manipulate these two things in the right proportion.</p>
<p>Third is the easiest, just a tiny smile. I said sliver earlier and it's the best description. The reason is that raising your eyebrows and opening your eyes a little more are going to make you look slightly more happy, and it's going to look weird on you if your mouth doesn't match your eyes. It barely constitutes a smile but it makes a difference.</p>
<p>I was joking when I said range of emotion but people do emote with their eyes, and it's hard to use them efficiently if they're barely open with slooped down eyebrows. That's it's own emotion: sullen. Manually manipulating these things gets your facial muscles back in the habit of working to emote, especially with your eyebrows. We already talked about squinting, and the thing when you release your eyebrows from their slightly raised position? Do that when someone tells you something slightly important and it'll show your seriousness. These are just examples. And you can do it as much or as little as you want but you need to get the right amount of eyebrow raise/eyelid opening first, and try to do it when you're alone so it becomes second habit. I'd also do specific facial gestures, just to practice. Imitate a comedian you heard, or a fun phrase you thought of, or a part of a speech you thought was really interesting; it helps.</p>
<p>All this is going to sound really unnatural but the way I see it, that's how happy people are normally without thinking about it. But depression takes it away. We're just reclaiming the twinkle.</p>
<p>Edit: Looking in someone's eyes is important. It's easiest for people to see the twinkle then, and they can react to it, which in turn makes you feel more human and better about yourself. For me personally I didn't think about how sullen my eyes were, so I only realized it when someone tried to talk, hence me feeling bad about it and looking down. If you have more visible, expressive, optimistic eyes (Sliver smiling!) then you're more likely to not feel that shame and look down. The whole process is almost a &quot;look good, feel good&quot; thing, it has helped tremendously.    </p></div>		</li>
