			<div class="markdown"><p>While the main elevator would have to be above the equator, the cable connecting it to the surface could be forked at some point above the equator, with multiple lines connecting from there to points on the surface; at least one to each hemisphere, and probably a third for stability, but they don't have to be at similar latitudes or anything so long as they're all the correct length to keep the elevator balanced over the equator. The line to New York would come in at an angle from vertical and have to be strongly secured to prevent it from dragging across the surface, but could allow for direct access to space just as with a typical space elevator connected to the surface at the equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you wanted to do that 3-fork approach with one over NYC (40.7 N, 74.0 W) You'd need the main cable attached to 0 NS, 74 W (Near Muriba, Colombia) and the southern cable attached at 40.7 S, 74.0 W (off the coast of Osorno, Chile)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, there's no particular need for the main cable to run past the fork all the way to the surface, and the southern cable doesn't need to be at the same longitude or symmetrical latitude as the northern cable. You could put it basically anywhere in the southern hemisphere that will still allow this location and New York to both remain within the line of sight of the fork on the main cable. With proper cable lengths, the main elevator can remain balanced over the equator. You could have the northern cable in New York and the southern cable in Peru or Argentina or even in Africa.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, that mile of cable you pulled it in moves it more down than north, because of the angle of the surface to the geostationary satellite--it's altitude above the surface is over 5 times the Earth's radius. The satellite can still move south because the cable isn't rigid. It can bend to let the satellite move south, where it's orbit will take it, but it will lose altitude as a result of the cable being taut, and thus begin to to move east as well. I'm not sure if the satellite will regain altitude as it moves back north or remain at a new, lower orbit, but I'm inclined to say the former.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Anywhere outside of the equator the centrifugal force would not be in line with gravity causing a sideways force on the elevator. </p>

<p>Which doesn't actually hurt anything. The elevator would still work fine. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qDn9i1B.png" target="_blank">5 minute diagram.</a> It could be anchored from New York City almost as easily as anywhere else. There might even be advantages like to purposely avoid space junk in geostationary orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that it would be constantly rocked with a 24 hour period, changing its angle to the ground. If we can create a material strong enough to withstand the associated tension, we're golden, but so far we don't even have something that can handle a regular space elevator.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would that be? Remember that this thing is not orbiting like a satellite. It can stay in one place above the Earth even without being near geostationary satellites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moving the anchor point away from the equator would reduce the linear speed (tangential velocity) a lot, and that is the source of tension in the tether we need in order to climb it.</p>
<p>Centripetal force (the resultant force from the motion and the tension in the tether) is  = (mv^2 )/r, where v = tangential velocity. We would need to put the mass at the end of the tether much further out to make up the difference, and/or increase the mass. Which in turn means a longer tether with more mass, necessitating more strength. That's a rabbit hole best not gone down.</p>
<p>Added to that, rather than a force &quot;straight up&quot; that needs to be overcome by the anchor point. We would have untold amounts of torque and shearing forces on the structure the further north it got placed. Infinitely strong and light tether? Could probably be done <em>if we could anchor it.</em> But barring that, I wouldn't expect to ever see a space elevator anywhere but the equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity can only pull radially through the COM of the earth but getting away from the equator means centrifugal force will have a non-radial or tangential component.  <a href="https://imgur.com/a/yYjXB" target="_blank">Free body diagram.</a> The net sideways force means the system is not in static equilibrium and will fall over.  I feel like you probably already know that though and I'm missing something. Hope you don't mind I hijacked your diagram because it was so nice.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Oh yes definitely. Your vectors are correct.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Oh, no. The system will certainly tilt toward the equator but won't fall over or even reach the plane that intersects equator. </p>
<p>I found <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.560.1934&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">a paper</a> that has a better diagram that shows the tangential bend that you are getting at. Note that if we just use a larger counterweight or a lighter tether then the tether bend is significantly lessened.</p></div>		</li>
