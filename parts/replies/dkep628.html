			<div class="markdown"><p>Halo basically became popular due to its split screen ability and now it offers none.  Also I remember I bought need for speed a few years ago to play it with my roommates and there was no split screen.  No split screen in a fucking car racing game that used to have split screen.  My mind was blown and I immediately returned the game.  Who the fuck wants to play a racing game alone?  I'm sure plenty of people but it was fucking mind blowing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You aren't wrong.  Not too long after we all went in on a Wii-U and had a blast with Mario Kart, Mario party, smash brothers, etc.  if you're gonna make it a pain in the ass for me to play games with my friends I'm just gonna find another system.  Plus Nintendo has great VC 2 player games too. </p></div>		</li>
