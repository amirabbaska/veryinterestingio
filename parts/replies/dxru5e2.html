			<div class="markdown"><p>While the bullet fragmenting does occur, I think OP's question has more do with the ceramics themselves shattering. This 'breaking the plates' diffuses a lot of the energy, hence why getting hit in a SAPI plate is a lot better for the underlying tissues than an equivalent thickness of say steel (gotta stop the bullet and waste as much of its kinetic energy too). </p>
<p>Dropping them can 'pre-break' the ceramics and remove this capability from the material. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A SAPI plate is almost an inch thick. My issue ones are several pounds lighter (level IV) than my steel ones (III). An inch of steel would barely transfer to you. You’d likely not notice if it weren’t for the frag in your chin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First off, you most certainly would notice if your steel plate took a hit. Secondly thats why steel plates have a coating to prevent spalling. If you wearing a steel plate without that coating whats the point of wearing the armor? It stopped the bullet, thats good but now you have a bunch of shrapnel in your neck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc that’s more of a secondary effect. The idea is to slow the bullet down though, by absorbing as much energy as possible in a lightweight and cost effective solution.</p></div>		</li>
