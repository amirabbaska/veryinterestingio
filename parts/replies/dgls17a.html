			<div class="markdown"><p>Hello, biochemist here!
DNA codes for proteins and proteins do the awesome stuff.</p>
<p>The way that DNA codes for proteins is by a sequence of four different chemicals. Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G), Cytosine (C). You've probably seen pictures of DNA and it looks like a twisted ladder. The rungs of the ladder is the bit that holds the code. The code may look something like this:
AAATGTATCGTATGCGTCGATAGG</p>
<p>A section of DNA that codes for a protein is a gene. Proteins are made up of amino acids. The DNA codes for the sequence of amino acids. Three letters codes for 1 amino acid. For example, that code above has 24 letters, so that's 8 amino acids that are coded for by that pretend gene there. A group of three letters is called a &quot;codon&quot;</p>
<p>There are 20 amino acids. They're basically all the same except for one bit, which is different for each amino acid. Some amino acids have a charged bit on it, whereas some may have some sulfur for example. The chemistry of the amino acids is very varied, which gives proteins their wide range of properties. This variable part of an amino acid is called a sidechain.</p>
<p>If you know some stuff about stats, you may have figured out that 3 letters per amino acid and 4 possible letters means 64 combinations (4 cubed). That's more than the 20 we need, but that's okay, because multiple different codons can code for one amino acid. Glycine, for example, can be GGT, GGC, GGA and GGG. We also have a few stop codons, which are markers that say &quot;the gene stops here, stop reading the code&quot;. </p>
<p>Now let's talk about what makes proteins so versatile. I've said the DNA codes for the sequence of amino acids in a protein. You can imagine a protein like a very long beaded necklace (very large: the largest protein has up to 33,000 amino acids!). On this necklace, you have 20 different coloured beads. Making a protein is like threading beads onto a necklace. </p>
<p>Remember how I said that amino acids have different properties depending on what their sidechain is? Well imagine you take your finished necklace and ball it up in your fist, tangling it. That's sort of what happens with proteins, but it doesn't just do it randomly. A positively charged amino acid side chain will be attracted to a negatively charge one. Charged sidechains like to interact with water, so if the protein is in water, charged sidechains will generally be found on the outside of the protein. The chemistry behind these interactions is quite simple on a small scale, but these proteins are massive. Loads of forces work together to make a protein fold into a very specific shape. It's a massive field of research, trying to figure out why proteins fold as they do and what happens if they fold wrongly.</p>
<p>So why do these proteins fold into such specific shapes? Well a lot of stuff involves chemicals binding to proteins. A good analogy for binding is a lock and a key. A lock can't be unlocked by any random key, nor can a key unlock any random lock. They're specific to each other. In proteins, there are special binding sites that act like a lock. Bacteria, for example, release chemicals such as toxins. Your white blood cells have proteins on their exterior to bind to these chemicals. The protein may then change shape after the chemical has bound, to cause a biochemical reaction to the presence of this chemical (which will probably involve more proteins). That's how cells can respond to the environment, even though they don't &quot;know&quot;. They're complex little machines and everything is managed by proteins ultimately.</p>
<p>Before I stop rambling, I want to convey a portion of the vast amount of variety that proteins can have. I mean, imagine, if there's 20 amino acids with different chemistry each and there can be thousands of them in one protein, the possibilities are pretty much infinite. Just think of how easy it is for earphones to become tangled if you stuff them in your pocket.</p>
<p>Haemoglobin, for example, binds to oxygen and carries it in your blood. The part where oxygen binds is actually relatively small and simple. What's cool about haemoglobin is that it has a system that makes it very sticky to oxygen when there's lots of it around (in your lungs, because it needs to pick up oxygen) and stops being as sticky to oxygen when there's low oxygen concentration (in your muscles, where oxygen is needed for energy). It's like a bus, it needs to pick up and drop off oxygen and it's big blobby structure is perfect for that. Myoglobin, which is found in muscles, has a different structure to haemoglobin because it only needs to pick up oxygen (muscles are greedy, they want all the oxygen) and is permanently sticky to oxygen.</p>
<p>Then there's collagen, which is a strong, insoluble protein found in connective tissues.</p>
<p>I find Green Fluorescent Protein cool. It makes jellyfish glow. It works in a similar mechanism to fluorescent lights.</p>
<p>ATP synthase is awesome too. It is pretty much a molecular motor. It even has a sort of drive shaft and a rotating head.</p>
<p>If you've managed to get through all that, then well done, here's some fun stuff:</p>

<p>This is a computer rendering of some of the molecular machinery inside a cell. It's fun to watch, even if you don't necessarily understand it. When I watch this and imagine how tiny these things are and the complexity of it all, I feel a sense of awe like I imagine an astronaut feels when they're looking down at Earth from orbit.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to write this! You really put such a complex topic in a much more simpler format so that people with average brains like me could understand the fundamental things that happen each moment in our bodies. It's just mind blowing to think about the sheer scale of the universe and your place in it and then to zoom in and think about all the trillions of cells in your body which contain their own little intricate universes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn it, I'm a biochemist too and you said all the fun stuff already! Some people... </p>
<p>No but seriously, you guys hiring? :p I've got computer science to go with it! :) cmon, you know you want someone who's as comfortable with pBAD CBD-intein chitin bead protein purification as they are with random forests classification. That's a steal, BOGO Free, and I'm currently priced below MSRP. </p>
<p>Next, let's tell them about the guy on LSD who discovered PCR. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked myself this question quite alot when I was in undergrad. My conclusion/statement is, these cells don't &quot;know&quot; why or how to do anything. They are not conscious. The molecules that make up the cell structures, proteins, and DNA do the things they do because at a molecular and thermodynamic level they are favorable. Therefore to ask how do they &quot;know&quot; dosnt really fit. Apply this to the source code analogy and you have a spontaneously occuring thermodynamically favorable source code that result in the obtain if more enery, spending less energy, and protecting the source code.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, it's just a bunch of parts that work really well together. The DNA doesn't 'tell' anything to anything else. But enzymes called transcription enzymes then take DNA, which is really like a blueprint, and use it to make a protein that helps the cell function. </p>
<p>It's not that the cell 'knows' it's hungry and that now it needs to eat while watching for predators. It's more like a mindblowingly effective machine. It's like the cell runs low on nutrients, and then when a certain receptor for food stops finding any it releases a chemical. That chemical in turn activates another which activates a receptor that's in charge of the finding food response. Now that the finding food receptor is activated, that causes a release of chemicals that result in the 'looking for food' behavior. This is what is happening when we see what looks like the cell 'deciding to start looking for food'. Once it finds food, the presence of that food activates a receptor that releases a chemical that starts the digestion process. And this continues until the food runs out and the process has to start over again. There are also receptors for dangerous chemicals and other bacteria, and when these get activated they start a chain of chemical release that begins a 'protection' response. So it's not so much the it knows to do all of these things, as much as all the parts are in place in the cell that allow the process to take place. Of course, what's really going on in the cell is way more complicated than even this. As humans we're much more complex so for us, at least from our conscience perspectives, we just decide to eat. Cells are much more like machines in that regard, they just do. They're just a bunch of chemical reactions propelling them forward. Really that's all we are too, but we're complicated enough that everything starts to get really abstract and we become more than the sum of our parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Combination of DNA/RNA in a base 1-0 Configuration, exactly the same as a computer program, as DNA copies are made (any time information is passed), The DNA can get corrupted (mistake is copied) this switches things on and off depending on what is miss written. The ones that switch on valuable things, are less likely to get eaten, and so will eventually make whole copies of itself and begin to thrive, when a particularly good set of code comes together, the population will explode until predator or environmental factors impact its growth. Some how in basing our computers in binary, we have actually replicated this system. Further more its quite common coding practice to use previously written simple modules in bigger programs (We actively choose these snippets however, while in evolution the snippets that make the most sense to the environment survive). Humans are essentially a collection of cells, a host, within which a myriad of single and multi-cellular organisms also make their home.</p></div>		</li>
