			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of guys also confuse <em>sperm</em> with <em>semen</em>.
Semen is made mostly by the seminal vesicles, rather than the testicles, which produce sperm. It all mixes during the magic moment, but not hours in advance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it should probably also be said that the vast majority (95-98%) of the semen's volume is produced by the seminal gland and the prostate. these are two glands that sit roughly between the bladder and the rectum.</p>
<p>the sperm cell also has a rather lengthy development time of 10 weeks and it can be stored in the testes for another 4 weeks before it dies and gets recycled.</p></div>		</li>
