			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not dust that's obscuring our cosmological horizon - its time.  How far away we can receive light from is limited by how much time has passed since the first light sources existed.</p>
<p>Looking outward in space is looking backwards in time.  At 13.82 billion light years distance everything goes dark - it appears there were no stars at that time.  What that patch of space looks like today is anybody's guess - maybe there are galaxies out there, but an observer at the current location of the Earth would not find out what those galaxies look like today until waiting another 13.82 billion years.</p></div>		</li>
