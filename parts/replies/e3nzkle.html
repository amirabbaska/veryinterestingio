			<div class="markdown"><p>Some fabric marking pens are like this. Iron-away, but if it gets cold the marks will come back. I’m a quilter and always prefer washable inks for this reason. If I want to keep a quilt in my car or take it outside to curl up underneath when it’s chilly out, I definitely don’t want my markings to suddenly reappear on the surface of my quilt. </p></div>		</li>
