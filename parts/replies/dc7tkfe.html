			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I'm curious about: does anybody else, when you're very tired, have your eyes not only lose focus but also drift in different directions? Or maybe it's more that they stop automatically converging, each pointing perfectly forward. I've noticed that when more than normally sleep deprived, my eyes will do that, and I even make a game of trying to relax my eyes completely and keep it there as long as I can. </p>
<p>Obviously, I should get more sleep. But I also want validation that doing this doesn't mean my eyes have eye-AIDS. Help me, r/kenobi, you're my only (not-a-)doctor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being exhausted does decreased the ability to converge. It also makes any deviations that normally get covered up by your brain working extra hard become more obvious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You probably have specific abnormal, but not unusual eye issues that make your eye muscles have to work extra hard to stay in focus.  Ask your optometrist about them, they probably noticed and wrote it down, but don't bother discussing it with you because you're a layman and there's nothing you can do about it anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When patients mention this symptom, I ask them if it bothers them. If it does, we suggest an orthoptic/vision therapy treatment which is like physiotherapy/kinesiology for eye muscles.
If it does not bother them, we don't bother discussing treatment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great explanation of the physical elements of it, but even with vision, I find the mental loss of sensory focus (that is to say the part that deals with processing the information) happens far sooner than the actual physical slackening of the eye muscles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was thinking the same thing. I even notice it with hearing and touch deficit too. That and proprioception. It's not that my eye muscles are tired, they keep doing their job like always. It's just my brain is getting tired and lowering the gain on these senses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The primary thing keeping your eyes focused are these small, thin, muscles attached to your lens. </p>

<p>But I have lens implants and my vision still gets blurry when I'm tired.</p></div>		</li>
