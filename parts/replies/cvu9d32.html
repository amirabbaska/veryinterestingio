<p>Now imagine that figure skater is 5x the mass of our sun, and it collapses to a radius of about 7 miles. Now you're spinning insanely fast.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In short yes, the sun does spin, but not all at once.</p>
<p>Confused?
Depending on what part of the sun, some parts may rotate faster than others. Spots on the equator of the sun rotate once about every 23-25 days, and spots near the poles can take up to 38 days to make a full rotation.
Just as interesting, the inner layers of the sun rotate at different speeds than the surface.  The inner regions, the core and the radiative zone rotate like a single solid body, but the layers above (the convective zone and photosphere) rotate at different speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. On Jupiter the atmosphere at the poles takes about 5 minutes longer to make a rotation than the atmosphere at the equator.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This whole thread is fascinating. The sun is made of what? Plasma? Super heated Hydrogen? It's not a solid so it can move at different speeds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well super heated Hydrogen is essentially plasma, the 4th state of matter, so yes, that is what the sun is made out of. Well at least 70% of it. 28% is helium, and the remaining 2% is all the other elements such as carbon, oxygen,  all the way up to iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, hard to comprehend.  Standard video is only 60 frames/sec... you'd need a high speed camera.    A car tire at 60 mph spins at about 840 revolutions per <em>minute</em>, so the whole planet's moving 50x faster than a car time on the highway.</p></div>		</li>
