			<p>So a person on one of those machines wouldn't have to breathe?<br><br>Would they feel the need to?</p>		</li>

			<p>That's a question I can't answer in total, but at least two directives that make you breathe would be taken care of with ECMO.  CO2 accumulation in your blood give you the painful sensation that makes you want inhale.  The machine filters CO2.  <br><br>The machines add O2.  O2 deprivation kicks in obviously at the same time as CO2 accumulation when you stop breathing, but is a lesser reaction than the accumulation of CO2.  <br><br>Example: exposure to NO2.  You become light headed then pass out/die because of O2 deprivation, but you don't have that intense response to breathe like holding your breath would be.  If you aren't breathing O2, then you won't be making CO2 in your blood.  No CO2, no/different pain from suffocation.  <br><br><strong>Here's a big part of your answer:</strong>   ECMO is used in conjunction with a ventilator to prevent your lungs from collapsing also.  You'll be breathing, but the seriousness of your disease makes ECMO an option to give you more time for you body to try to repair itself.  <br><br>Personally, I've always wanted to know what it feels like to be on a ventilator.  I want to know what it feels like to not be in control of my breath.  Would I feel the need to breathe at first when I realize that a machine is breathing for me?</p>		</li>

			<p>In answer to your question about the feeling of being on a ventilator, it depends. If the ventilator is completely breathing for you, using it's own monitoring for CO2/O2 blood gas levels, you'll be unconscious. The reason is you'll try to breath at your own pace and depth and fight the machine. Apparently it's really uncomfortable and counterproductive, so out you go. <br><br>A lot of the time it's a ventilator in an assist mode. When it senses you try to start to inhale, it kicks in with pressure to fill lungs so you don't have to. In this mode, your body is sensing whether it needs a breath as it normally would. Since you're already trying to breath, the pressure isn't uncomfortable, unless theres a reason for resistance- like airway disease, fluid in the lungs, etc. You can be awake for this, but people are still frequently sedated depending on the reasons why they are ventilated.<br><br>Paralyzed people with damage high enough that they can't signal breathing wouldn't fight a ventilator breathing for them, and it wouldn't be uncomfortable.<br><br>Having used a CPAP machine that became erratic, I can tell you it's a very uncomfortable feeling to try and breath out against pressure (normally theres pressure breathing in to prevent snoring, then it cuts out when you start to exhale). It's not painful, but it feels wrong and the it's panic inducing.</p>		</li>

			<p>As Just_Logged_in explained, it depends.<br><br>If the CO2 is low enough, and O2 is high enough from ECMO alone then no, they you would not feel the need to breath.  However, to minimizing some of the potential risks associated with higher ECMO support, often the ECMO will be adjusted to overcome whatever the patient cannot do themselves.  In this case they will still have a desire to breath.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Many don't have to, usually they still try to draw breaths if they're awake. Many times, though, we have them asleep and still on a ventilator. The ECMO machine doesn't see all the blood, either, so the blood that bypasses the machine and goes to your lungs still benefits from being ventilated. </p>		</li>

			<p>I had ecmo in 1990 at birth and have had 0 complications from it. How lucky did I get?</p>		</li>

			<p>ECMO on babies is very different than ECMO for adults. They do the same thing but the reason they're on it is very different. <br><br>Babies are put on ECMO usually for congenital heart defects or complications from birth. These are usually diagnosed before or shortly after birth. Their organ systems tend to be healthy, and the once the problem is treated, babies recover very well. The survival rate is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15921148" target="_blank">80-100% for neonates on ECMO</a>.<br><br>Adults get put on it for various reasons, but as stated above, their other organs are usually severely damaged. These are patients who have had things like cardiac arrest (thus depriving their body from O2 for a long time) or respiratory failure refractory to intubation and mechanical ventilation. ECMO in adults is a last ditch attempt to salvage the patient, and as a result, survival rates are <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20599396" target="_blank">between 30-50%</a>, depending on the cause of cardiopulmonary dysfunction.</p>		</li>
