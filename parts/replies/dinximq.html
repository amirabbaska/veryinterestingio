			<div class="markdown"><p>Only because it's not known how the brain stores information. There appear to be many ways information is stored and to varying and unknown degrees of precision. Also, recall has its limits. A lot of the brain's storage isn't available to conscious processes. Or it's only available within certain contexts.</p>
<p>It's probably possible to discover the all or most of the mechanisms by which information is stored, but I don't think we're there yet. Even knowing all the mechanisms, the precision issue is the hard part. Since the brain designed itself, the brain is the only thing that really understands the brain. So if you observe information storage in the brain, you can model the physical process and obtain a theoretical maximum precision. But there's no way to know how much of that precision the brain is using.</p>
<p>You can get an absolute maximum limit using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bekenstein_bound" target="_blank">physics</a>, but the actual capacity is probably much lower. Most of the estimates I've seen use the number of synaptic connections and I think that's where the top comment of 2.5 petabytes comes from. That neglects all the crazy stuff that happens at the actual synapses and lots of other things. Individual neurons also have memory, for instance. So the actual limit is somewhere between the number of connections and the Bekenstein bound. There's like 10^40ish orders of magnitude of room inside of that specification.</p>
<p>It's going to be hard to set the upper bound lower than the Bekenstein since the brain is still not even close to being figured out. We don't know all the ways the brain stores information, and the discovery of new mechanisms will multiply the storage capacity. So to put a hard number out with a non-ridiculous error is impossible.</p>
<p>I also subscribe to the unorthodox view that the brain doesn't merely exist inside the skull. Your environment is also part of the brain's computation and storage. Seemingly external processes compute and store information, but my view is that the brain is directly connected to those things. As an extreme example, complete isolation destroys the brain. As relatable examples, close friends and lovers as well as things like your own room store information as well as compute. You are connected to them by sound and light waves, and mechanical connections. The gap between the cone cells in your eyeball and the surface of your coffee mug don't have to be distinct from a synaptic cleft except that photons transfer information across the eyball gap. The configurations of the external world have a direct impact on the computation in your brain and the brain does not function in isolation. So to consider a brain separately does not work in my view.</p>
<p>Unlike a traditional computer, the brain touches reality without needing to translate between a logic system imposed externally. The brain is internally consistent and builds its own logic to wrap around reality. Computers are designed with logic we can understand, then reality must be translated by us into that logic system for the computer to use. Since the brain does not have that barrier between reality and itself, it might be very hard to separate it from reality and specify exactly what it is and how much it holds or computes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that making estimates of human memory capacities based on broad domain knowledge - such as the number of connections between neurons - is both ‘absurd and foolish’ or “silly”. However, I think progress is being made towards explaining the processes and mechanisms of various capacity limits. Where I guess we disagree, is perhaps to what extent the research challenge is surmountable. I believe in the prospect of estimating human memory capacity limits based on detailed domain-specific empirical evidence, such as knowledge about neuronal coactivation, the chemistry and physics of signal propagation, microanatomical features, together with data on observable behavior and physiology and biophysically realistic computational models.</p>
<p>Contemporary research includes a model of short-term memory, in which the accuracy of recall is quantified. To what extent this model, if at all, applies to human memory is still controversial and part of ongoing investigations. The model indeed challenges integer views of capacity estimates.</p>
<p>The brain did not design itself. During development, it develops together with the spinal cord. As you indicated, the brain responds to the environment. During the evolution of the brain, the brain changed in response to increased and more sophisticated tool use, to name but a few factors. By observing the interaction between the brain and the environment, there is still much to learn about the brain. Precision has developed from utility for survival. When we see that a grass appears bent in water, the information about there being water is more important than knowing how straight the grass is.</p>
<p>The Borkenstein boundary is to my understanding based on the observations of black holes. Estimates of information entropy have successfully been used to quantify the ‘randomness’ of epileptic seizures. The value of measuring entropy in neuroscience is often secondary, such that mutual information is computed to compare two different brain states or different regional activities.</p>
<p>There appears to be a finite capacity based on rational and intuitive physical principles. Perhaps such a belief is similar to the belief that the brain is set in stone. Today we know that the brain is malleable, both functionally and structurally. There are multiple examples of humans with exceptional long-term memory capacity, which makes the physical intuition somewhat dubious. If one would try to make such a physical estimate, one must not forget that the functionality of the brain is more than its parts.</p>
<p>I am familiar with the “skull beyond the sky” view and the concepts of situated and distributed cognition. These are frameworks that are relatively new, but not too old compared to neuroscience, which is a young science -- not more than 50 years young.</p>
<p>In stricter philosophical terms, the mind sometimes defies logic. However, logic is a product of the mind, and computers are a product of both minds and that very logic. It does not follow that understanding the brain is very different from how we understand the world.</p></div>		</li>
