			<div class="markdown"><p>There have never been terminator seeds in farmers fields, anywhere. If people tell you that, they don't understand the biology. </p>
<p>Sometimes people imply this, though, when they are really referring to the legal agreement not to save seeds for the following year. But buying new and improved seeds each year has been common in production systems for a long time, long before GMOs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The GE seeds, as well as most modern varieties, are also hybrids where the saved seed would not have the desired traits of the original crop. Farmers have bought seeds in most crops every year for many years preceding GE. Saving seed is a pain at scale and presents it's own set of problems. Buying is much easier and secure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really depends on the crop. Farmer here. We haven't bought alfalfa seed for maybe 30 years (since before I was born). There are newer strains of alfalfa out there, but that's a cost, one that isn't usually covered in yield due to the alfalfa market. Alfalfa also has a few options for reseeding. Usually we plant a stand for 3-5 years. If it gets scorched by the sun or dies back for some reason, you can let it go to seed, harvest the seed to sell, bale the straw, and then scratch the soil to let the residue seed germinate and fill the field back out.</p>
<p>Eventually we do have to till and re-level our fields, we're in the southwest and are all irrigated, and keeping the field flat both helps in crop production from a navigation side(cutting, raking, and baling alfalfa is best done at full machine capacity, which these days is around 10mph, which is really fast if you have deep ruts in your fields) and from a water consumption side(having a field out of level makes you have poor water distribution, and additionally if water sits too long on alfalfa it has a tendency to scorch it, killing it back and reducing yield). At which point we'll let the last cutting go to seed, and then after harvest, till and maybe rotate into a different crop, but we can rotate other acreage into alfalfa with that seed. </p>
<p>All this is to say, there are still some crops for which we save seed, because it's the best economic choice. Cotton also has some savable seed still, even though the seed you sell back will need to be treated before planting again. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we do buy GMO, hybrid, or other single use seeds for various other crops because of the yield benefits outweighing the cost(hell we even grow some male/female pairs that produce hybrid seed that we sell for others to use). We're not stuck in the mud about saving seed, we're just looking to make the best choice we can to produce the best we can with the resources we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the funny things about the terminator idea is that we don't know if it works. There was so much drama around it that work stopped. I was not really convinced it would work. But I'm always open to new data. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ironically, the promise of Terminator was to ensure protection for wild species.  The seed companies knew that the economic issue was moot (you have to buy new hybrid seed every year anyway) and this was simply a responsible thing to do.  However, it made for a great talking point for certain interests, and the rest is history.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assumed it was due to cross breeding with wild strains. Any chance of our wild plants becoming sterile is too big of a chance. We will risk all corn becoming resistant to sun burn, but resistant to reproduction is a no-no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am a farmer. You must sign this legal agreement or you cannot purchase the seeds. It's not like someone said &quot;oh hey yeah let's agree on this&quot; it's more like &quot;if you want to be part of the farming sector you do it my way or not at all&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which, btw, was the source of the Monsanto lawsuit.  The guy who Monsanto sued had never signed the agreement, but some of their product ended up in his field.  </p>
<p>Which was probably fine, if he had harvested and sold it all, but he noticed that parts of the field were growing better, so he intentionally kept seed from those parts of the field for replanting, and next year, replanted the seeds on as much of his land as they covered.</p>
<p>Monsanto argued that growing his crops was use of their patent on the genes.  The Farmer argued something about &quot;farmer's rights&quot;, which isn't a thing.  Monsanto won, with the court agreeing that growing GMO crops was using the patent.  </p>
<p>This was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto_Canada_Inc_v_Schmeiser" target="_blank">Monsanto Canada Inc v Schmeiser</a>.  A related-ish case in the US was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowman_v._Monsanto_Co." target="_blank">Bowman v. Monsanto Co.</a>, in which the farmer argued that First Sale doctrine didn't permit Monsanto to dictate what happened with seeds after the farmer sold them to a 3rd party (farmers were selling to a grain elevator then buying back for replanting, rather than buying from Monsanto).  The US Supreme Court unanimously decided that growing a plant constitutes use of the patent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right--but people are asking about sterile seeds--meaning they can't be used the following season. It's commonly conflated in people's minds that &quot;no re-use&quot; and &quot;sterile&quot; are the same thing. They aren't. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There has never been a commercially available sterile GMO plant seed.</p>
<p>However, there have been uses of GM sterility in animals, such as mosquitos, but those aren't sold either.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>There is <em>non</em> gm sterility in animals that are for sale.  Specifically, sterile triploid carp and trout are commonly sold for stocking in ponds.  I bring this up because people sometimes <em>think</em> this is due to GM, but it's actually done by treating the egg just after fertilization to prevent the production of a polar body.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry. What is your definition of GM? Treating an egg at fertilization so it does something different IS a form of genetic modification, in this case being sterile. Even though it's not done at the DNA level it's still GM, GM has been around for thousands of years. See: corn and tomato. </p></div>		</li>
