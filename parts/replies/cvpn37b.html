			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose in a pure hypothetical sense, yes? Someone should correct my horrendous &amp; amateur maths here, but if you had a ring of steel of equal length of the earths circumference (Google gives me a value of 40,075 Km) and factor in the speed of sound in steel to be approximately 5920 metres per second (again a Google supplied value), you end up with approximately 6769 seconds for the wave to propagate through the entire ring leaving you with a very rough duration of 1 hour and 53 minutes to sleep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...but certainly not practically. Even if the ring was a couple millimeters in width it would still weigh several trillion tons and probably break if you applied enough force to move the whole thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was wondering about that, and may make another question. If you had an arbitrarily long pole in a vacuum, what prevents you from breaking the speed of light by rotating it from one end? Is it just that it's structurally impossible?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely.  Shock wave propagation would apply if it's being pushed faster than the inertia of the pole.  It would travel as a compressive wave faster than sound through the material relative to the force applied.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry but im going to have to take this to the next level of stupid questions because my mind is pretty blown right now.</p>
<p>If there was an extermely large ring, say earth sized. Somewhere in the ring there is a 1 meter gap. Now we push one end of the ring to rotate it, can i fit a 2 meter object in the gap as long as the ring is rotating?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be a lot of messy, confounding factors in reality, but yes, in your thought experiment you're first compressing the ring by a metre, then it recovers its original length as the wave travels round.</p>
<p>Think about pushing jelly (jello) along a table, you squash one side, then it stretches back out. Everything is elastic in the same way, only, metals and such are way less elastic, not enough to be visible to the naked eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At that length it starts acting like a slinky. If you stretch a slinky across a room, and shove on some coils at one end, it doesnt move the slinky on the other end immediately. A sort of wave travels across until the end finally moves. That's exactly how the stick behaves. Short sticks behave this way too, it's just too fast and small of a wave for a human to detect. Nothing moves as a solid object in reality. All is slinky.</p></div>		</li>
