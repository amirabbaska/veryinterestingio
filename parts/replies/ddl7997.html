<p>Take Heroin for example. It's schedule 1, yet derivatives of morphine(which heroin is) are the most common pain killer prescribed.</p>
<p>Peyote(Schedule 1) is used in many tribal rituals(religious &amp; good in their eyes).</p>
<p>My point is, your description is correct and the laws are wrong.</p></div>		</li>
