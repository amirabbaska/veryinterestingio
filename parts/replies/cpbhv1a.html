			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't raise taxes by $40/year (well, not directly, but you might see an increase in your water bill)</p>
<p>The government body that builds it would float bonds to pay for the installation, the water produced would be sold to water districts, and the water districts would adjust your water bill based on the cost of the water they had to purchase to sate their district's demand for water.</p>
<p>The bonds wouldn't raise taxes, though they would cut in to the local operating budget, but the local governments do this all the time, so it's nothing new.  If the water produced cost more to purchase than other sources, then you would see the bill go up.  But if the cost per acre foot was comparable to what we currently pay for water from the central valley and from the Colorado river, then it might not increase our bills by quite so much as that.</p>
<p>The cost of water from the desalination plants might be used to defray the cost of paying off the bonds as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's my real worry with the notion of building a giant water pipe to California: where's it coming from? That much water is probably somebody else's river getting diverted, or a glacier in the Rockies getting melted or a lake drained, or <em>something</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a high cost associated with desalinization, it takes a lot of energy to remove salt from sea water, no matter which method is used.</p>
<p>To desalinize sea water one must <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic_pressure" target="_blank">exert a pressure</a> equivalent to pumping water to a height of 270 meters, or 900 feet. This is a fundamental physics question, it's due to the fact that the salt molecules are electrically attracted to the water molecules.</p>
<p>When people mention &quot;X% more efficient desalinization&quot; that means only reducing the energy one must use <em>on top off</em> the one I mentioned above. If you had 100% efficient desalinization you'd still need the energy needed to pump water to a 270 meters height.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Desalinization is very energy intensive, and it also leaves behind extremely concentrated saline that cannot simply be pumped back into the ocean without negative environmental effects. </p>
<p>I remember a scientist I spoke with about this issue say that desalination plants need a nuclear power plant built next to them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other side of it is where will the water come from.  Western states have been trying to get fresh water labelled as a commodity so that it can be bought and transported from water rich areas like the great lakes regions to areas in need of water.  The pushback comes from those areas that have large stores of fresh water that are concerned that such a move will lead to exhausting the water supply and dealing damage to the local environments.  An example of this back and forth can be seen in the debate over selling Canadian freshwater to the US [1].</p>
<p>The desalination plant and other methods to develop local sources of fresh water don't have the same issues as ecological impact is localized.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also international treaties at play here.  For instance water from the great lakes basin may not significantly leave the great lakes basin without agreements from all parties (several Canadian provinces and several US states).  This is primarily because of the abuse of the Colorado river basin where people have grandfathered rights to effectively free water and are abusing that to the point that there isn't enough water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right. An Oregon, the nearest neighbor with something approaching an abundance of fresh water, is not at all enthusiastic. Certainly there is nowhere east of the Cascades in Oregon that has the water to spare, and while places on the west slope of the coast range might be willing, the logistics of getting a pipeline through the mountains would make local desalination look pretty good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your base numbers are right but you're counting some of the water twice. Assuming that the 2000 gallons/day includes manufacturing, etc., that's water that does not have to be pumped through your hypothetical pipeline, because it was already consumed to make that clothing in China, that grain from Iowa, etc.</p>
<p>Your point still stands, and it would take a lot of work that isn't worth it in order to get a better estimate, but your numbers are a bit exaggerated because of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, but you've missed the converse: you're discounting some of the water altogether. The water saved in California from imported finished goods is somewhat counterbalanced by the fact that California <a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/faqs.aspx" target="_blank">is <em>the</em> largest agricultural state (by dollar)</a>. Therefore, here in California, where <a href="http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/statistics/" target="_blank">we grow</a> much of your grapes, pretty much all of your almonds, many of your flowers, strawberries, lettuce, and so forth, <em>we</em> are using water that is under many non-Californian peoples' ledger. It may well be true that the water consumed in California is above the national per-capita for the fact that California is such an agricultural powerhouse.</p></div>		</li>

He validated the opinion (&quot;Your point still stands&quot;), didn't insult or berate, and guided the discussion without deviating from it in ways that distract from the central point or issue.</p>
<p>In my opinion, that's what a discussion is.  Anything else is argument, false rhetoric, fighting, or pontificating - not discussing.</p>
