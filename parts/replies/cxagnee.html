			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CItDiuBWP5I" target="_blank">cool youtube video</a> that discusses the biological and cultural implications of a ring system around a terrestrial world. To summarize:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Early science could be jumpstarted because using relatively simple math, one can use a terrestrial ring system to determine a lot about the local planetary neighborhood</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winters will be significantly colder depending on the axial tilt of the planet, because the rings will block light</p>
</li>
<li>Actual spaceflight will be significantly more difficult because the ring system is potentially very dangerous to spacecraft</li>
</ol></div>		</li>

<p>definitely. just consider how a full moon can brighten up a night. the rings would have to have an even stronger effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume it would, just think of how much brighter the night is with a full moon, or how much brighter the night seems in the winter when the frost crystals in the air reflect light. Amplify that by about a hundred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly a solid moon like ours is solid, creates periodic lunar tides, and tide pools near the beach are a conducive environment for life to evolve.</p>
<p>so, a) do ring structures create similar tidal forces?
b) is that tide-pool theory in fashion or not?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to answer you first question, not because I'm knowledgeable but because it's an interesting question and I couldn't resist:</p>
<p>A ring, by its nature, is fairly evenly distributed, so I don't think it would create tidal forces. The material in Saturn's rings is about equivalent to the mass of a small moon, but spread to a thickness of only ten meters in places. It might exert some noticeable pull on the equator, but it would be constant. Would that still be called a tidal force? (I don't know)</p></div>		</li>

<p>You hear the theory brought up in two places: first, tide-pools as concentrators of pre-life chemicals.  I don't know how valid that theory is, it's outside of my specialty.  But I will say I usually hear more about deep-sea vents and RNA world and clays and I don't think that's quite the same situation.  Second, you hear the idea that tides would have been important for helping life invade the land.  The idea goes that the tidal variation gives life a sort of &quot;halfway&quot; step on approach to the land from the ocean.  I can tell you for sure that this doesn't hold up to scrutiny.  We know that the earliest land plants and vertebrates originated from ancestors that lived in <em>fresh</em> water, where there are no tides anyway.  I'm not 100% sure but I believe this may be true of insects and fungi as well.  Anyway, life is quite capable of colonizing land through that route, and it may even be preferred.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the moon creates tidal forces because there is no mass to offset it in the rest of its orbit.</p>
<p>a ring is an even amount of mass all the way around, there would be no &quot;offset in forces&quot; as it moves around.</p>
<p>think .. a ball on a string, vs a spinning top.</p></div>		</li>
