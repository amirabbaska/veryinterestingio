			<div class="markdown"><p>In CO poisoning, the CO binds preferentially to hemoglobin, forming carboxyhemoglobin. The standard treatment for CO poisoning is administration of 100% O2 using a mask with a high flow of oxygen. This will help replace the CO on the hemoglobin with O2. </p>
<p>The pulse oximeter, aka &quot;O2 sat&quot; probe, may indeed read 100% in CO poisoning, but it may be partially due to the treatment. An ABG (arterial blood gas) sample is always warranted, to verify both the actual oxygen level in the blood AND verify the CO level. The finger probe reading of CO is not always accurate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc, it has an error margin of 5%, aside from such confounding factors. Though, this may have improved since I learned about it.</p>
<p>If not, this makes it kinda shitty ass a tool, since even if it reads perfect score then the error margin is enough that you could be under oxygenated. At least it still gives a general idea where they are at, you would be able to take extreme measures when they get down to 80, or whatever they are at</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely true.</p>
<p>A regular pulse oximiter won't pick it up, but there's a special type called a CO-oximiter that has multiple different frequencies and will pick up CO-bound hemoglobin as well as methemoglobin. If you have one of those around, you don't necessarily need to do a blood test for CO poisoning.</p></div>		</li>
