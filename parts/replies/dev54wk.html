			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say a 30 hour work week would be close to ideal, lowering working hours per week has statistically boosted people's mental health so much it opens up many avenues for higher production. Plus, no one WANTS to work, we just have to. So if we lessen the forced amount of work time we are going to put in more effort in the time we are there. Because though we don't like work, we love to be productive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck that. I don't want my work day to be 9 hours. Even with the 2 hour break, all I'll be thinking is &quot;damn, gotta go back to work later&quot;. Much rather just work the 6 straight through and be done for the day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same, I've never been a fan of the Siesta schedule. I'd rather work 8 straight (lunch, 2 breaks included obv) than have a misplaced WHOLE TWO HOUR break slapped in the middle of my day. That'd mess me up I think. I wouldn't be as productive. And I definitely wouldn't want to go back to work when those two hours are up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'd be 8 hours. You still only work 6 hours, get paid for two ours off. You can do your shopping or things you wouldn't normally have time to do after work like go to the gym. It would have high benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do that (kinda) right now. 2-3 days a week I take 1.5 hours and go to the gym near my office. The days I don't, I eat at the office, and stay available for customers. Boss gives me some flak but only because the precedent was originally set that no one really took lunch, but in the end it works out well.<br />
I get to go to the gym when it isn't crammed, I have more energy (both at work and the gym), can go home directly after work without needing to find the motivation, and I end up taking the fewest sick days of any other employees. I think more employers should encourage this over &quot;siestas&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my last job, we didn't hire more people because:</p>
<p>1) it takes too long to train them for the job. 2-3 months training for 2 months of work. </p>
<p>2) current staff relied on the bonus pay and tips to live during the quiet season, buy Christmas gifts, have money for holidays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a place that did this. The majority of their work fell in the summer so they brought on a bunch of college kids such as myself to help pick up the slack on some of the more simple manufacturing/assembly. It worked out well because made some extra money and the full time people didn't have have to work sun up to sun down all summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Skilled labor doesn't work like that.</p>
<p>For my job my boss bassically accepts that he won't make any money on people for the first year or two they work until they get up to speed.</p>
<p>Hiring more people that don't know what's going on would honestly probably slow work down. </p></div>		</li>
