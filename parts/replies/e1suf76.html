			<div class="markdown"><p>Our school had a couple portables with window AC units.    Those of us that sat in the back would quite frequently pull the plug out enough to expose the two prongs  and drop a piece of mechanical pencil lead (graphite) on it.  That was always fun,  until we blew the breaker and got an in-school suspension</p></div>		</li>

<p>The design is clever.  There is no way it can fallout.<br />
The ground terminators is flexing in to the plug.<br />
And with extensions before metal makes touching the wires impossible. </p>
<p>The main issue we got with them is ppl pulling the cable not the stick.<br />
Thus pulling the cable out of the plug and shorting it out.  </p>
<p>But that’s User problem not design.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks great. Just be careful, saying something is well-designed and only prone to issues with consumer misuse is tantamount to admitting that Apple products are actually pretty good. It’s very contentious here, haha! </p>
<p>Seriously, thanks for the reply. Cool to see different plugs. And all you techies, I do like Apple, but hate them for a lot too, as it’s fair. Happy 4th of July!!!</p></div>		</li>
