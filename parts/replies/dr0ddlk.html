<p>Made <em>to look like</em> carbon fiber? Definitely. Cars in particular are terrible about it, faux carbon fiber trim in lieu of wood, because sportiness reigns king over comfort now. Hell, Chrysler has an option for some of their higher level cars like Hellcats to have Carbon Fiber-esque vinyl racing stripes applied. It's horrible.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's pretty much there. When you're mass producing consumer grade tennis rackets and golf clubs with it, it's no longer a high budget mystery material. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure it's the most expensive option pretty much anywhere, but there are few things you can't find a high end carbon version of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not quite, production using carbon fibre is still generally many times the cost compared to for example, steel so it's use is mostly limited to very high end products</p></div>		</li>
