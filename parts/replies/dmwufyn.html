And it's not uncommon for any large discovery like this to post an errata very soon afterwards, because they essentially got an extra 1000 free reviewers on the date of publication. </p>
<p>Is there anything super substantial in the erratum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The evidence for the metallic hydrogen state was a reflectance measurement. The diamond-anvil cells used in the experiment are under a ton of stress, and it was pointed out that the optical density of these diamonds can be altered under those extreme conditions.  This was not accounted for in the original data; the corrected reflectance data was updated in the erratum, which nevertheless still supports their conclusion. </p></div>		</li>
