			<div class="markdown"><p>In short, yes. Cardboard boxes can attract bugs, especially crickets. Cricket crap <strong>stinks</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, one of the common (modern) mistakes is leaving fabric softener on blankets being stored. The wax and perfumes cause major problems.</p>
<p>Living in New England requires knowing how to store stuff. My junior high home-ec teacher spent a week on showing us the proper way to wash, fold, and store blankets. Kids these days don't have much (if any) home-ec classes, so they don't know what to do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we take the example of <em>why does water taste different in glass, metal, or paper cups?</em></p>
<p>It has to do with <em>permeability</em>.</p>
<p>Basically, these material containers aren't perfectly sealed. They allow some molecules to pass through them (at different rates), this can include smell particles. Paper is the worst offender. Plastic has mixed results. Metal, for some, taste the cup more than the water. Glass is the all-around good one when properly cleaned. </p>
<p>For boxes, stainless steel or glass, if you have it, might be the perfect solution. <strong>IF</strong> you suck out the air inside and make it absolutely air-tight.</p>
<p>That's the purpose of those bags with a whole for sucking out the air with a vacuum. </p>
<p>Less air inside, less chance for air-related smells, dust, etc. Also, by sucking out the air, you save space. I've never tried it, but that's the idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love those bags - we keep so many blankets in these things. They are so easy to store anywhere and there hasn't been a smell like the hall closet smell on any of them that I've noticed actually. Try the bags! </p></div>		</li>
