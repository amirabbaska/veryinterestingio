			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the info on pain /gate therory (not really ELI5 anymore)...some nerve fibers are enclosed by a dealy called a myelin sheath. It helps nerves move the signals faster. Pain travels on non-myelinated nerve fibers. It's why there is a noticeable delay between stubbing your toe and feeling the surge of pain. It takes 1 or 1.5 seconds for the pain signal to travel all the way to your brain for processing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile pressure and vibration travel along myelinated fibers. They simply move faster. </p>
<p>As Bindweed has already clarified, your brain only processes so much signal at once. So you bonk your shin on the coffee table and immediately, instinctively grab or rub it you are sending pressure/ vibration signals on fast nerves to get there before the slow moving pain signals do. Instead of 100% pain signal, you get a mix.</p>
<p>Babies do not have the myelin sheath. It develops in your early years. When the pediatrician is tapping your knee reflex, what he is testing for is myelination. Slow reflex means poor myelination development. A simple, clever test.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can confirm this. learned this as a neural science student. as counter-intuitive as it seems, pain sensation is one of the slowest-signalling sensation. the reason given was that the body can take damage associated with pain relatively longer than damage associated with losing balance and knocking your head, which is why proprioception is one of the fastest-signalling sensation. which makes you wonder, why does pressure signal travel faster than pain signal?</p>
<p>another question, where are the myelinated pain fibers located at?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My not having the knee-tapping reflex was what finally convinced doctors that something was wrong with me, and I wasn't just a lazy, clumsy teenager. Turns out I had Charcot Marie Tooth disease, which is a malformation of the myelin sheath. I don't feel sensations like light pressure in my extremities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Jackimust said it above, Gate Control Theory. Or as Google says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The gate control theory of pain asserts that non-painful input closes the &quot;gates&quot; to painful input, which prevents pain sensation from traveling to the central nervous system. Therefore, stimulation by non-noxious input is able to suppress pain.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gate Control Theory can also be used as a therapy for chronic pain. Some patients with debilitating back or leg pain can get circuits implanted into their spine that replace the pain signals with a numb tingle.
This can be a good alternative to pain medications like opioids, which doctors are trying to avoid now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this helps explain why autistic people are thought to high very high thresholds  for pain. Maybe, they are taking in so much stimuli in other senses they do not feel the pain as much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the current understanding in neurology and pain management.  The so called &quot;gate control&quot; happens in the spinal cord, so it has less to do with &quot;only being able to process so much at once&quot; than it does with suppressing the painful signals as they are relayed up the spinal cord.  It is definitely possible for the brain to process pain and light touch at the same time, which would be like rubbing your hands on somebody's sunburn or shingles.  You're going to feel both.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your pain receptors are saying to you, in a normal voice: hey dude you're having some pain. </p>
<p>When you put/rub your hand on that area you're basically putting your fingers in your ears and going LALALALA. if you stop doing it you'll &quot;hear&quot; the pain &quot;talking&quot; again and experience the pain </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be. I cut at one point in my life (places hidden even by shorts and shirt, wasn't an attention thing). But the mental pain and stress I was dealing with was too much and by transferring it to physical pain, i.e. Cutting it was like my brain couldn't process both and would shut down all the mental anguish to focus on the physical pain. After a while the pain would subside and it felt like my brain had calmed down. </p></div>		</li>
