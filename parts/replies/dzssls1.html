			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.
Technically, mayo has such a high vinegar content, it can be left out and not spoil, but better to keep it in the fridge just in case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.  To expand upon this, according to NPD, mayo's acidic nature &quot;slows the growth of the bacteria associated with food-borne illnesses&quot; but doesn't stop it outright.  If you go through it at a relatively quick pace, it's probably fine, but if you go through it slowly it can still spoil.  I've certainly had it spoil even in the fridge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, if the product says no refrigeration needed it’s very very unlikely you’ll get sick from not refrigerating it. Some products like ketchup don’t say this but restaurants leave them on tables overnight. They can get away with this because of the high turnover rate of their product versus the home user. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the specific food, and how it is processed.  Even among a specific type of food, they aren't all processed the same.  For example, you can buy ultra-pasteurized half and half packets that don't need any refrigeration at all, while normal half and half still needs to be refrigerated even before you open them.  </p>
<p>Mayonnaise is unique not because it is jarred, but because it has a high vinegar content, which resists bacteria growth.  Note that this doesn't completely stop bacteria growth, just slows it.  If you go through mayonnaise slowly, (like I do) you might still want to refrigerate it.</p></div>		</li>
