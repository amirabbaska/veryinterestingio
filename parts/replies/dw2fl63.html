			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly... The average resistance to motion is somewhat tactually perceptible, but it's not what we think makes up softness in general. It's actually more correlates with stickiness I believe (or tact).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s basically the concept of friction. If you run your hand against a smooth stainless steel door, it’s going to feel “softer” compared to running your hand against a cheese grater. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn’t the whole explanation though because there are plenty of things with give that do not feel soft, like wire mesh. And then you get to fine materials like steel wool which is soft but not particularly pleasant to rub.</p></div>		</li>
