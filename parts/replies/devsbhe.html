			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in water distribution for a smallish town (~18000 residents) and I can't imagine the colossal undertaking it would be to replace all of our underground water distribution infrastructure. I mean, at a minimum, every water main, transmission line, and service line are under at least 6ft of earth. On top of that, aside from the service lines (the lines running from the main to people's houses), nearly all of that infrastructure is under asphalt. Furthermore, any time just a piece of a pipe is to be replaced, water service has to be shut off for any residents between the given valves we use to shut off water to a section of main. What makes it even more complicated is that it's not simply a matter of tearing it out of the ground and replacing it because there are often other utilities (sewer, electric, gas, etc) in the way which usually results in having to dig with shovels instead of a backhoe. Those pipes are also FUCKING HEAVY and it requires a truck-mounted crane to pick up a piece that is more than a few feet long. Then there are the valves, which are also heavy as fuck...and cost about $1800 a piece. There is also fire protection to be considered. That is, when water service is shut off, that means there is no fire protection until said service can be turned on. Things rarely go smoothly during a repair and service can remain off for a lot longer than anticipated.... and that's just fixing a crack or other leak, not replacing entire sections of pipe. </p>
<p>That said, I'm pretty confident that Flint is completely fucked. The only thing they can do is switch back to the water they were using before, flush the hell out of every single line, and hope that that water won't continue to leech toxic metals from the lead pipes. Even then, if the protective inner lining of the pipes (concrete or otherwise) as been eroded, changing water doesn't even matter. The people of Flint would be best off by packing up and leaving. Of course, that isn't economically feasible for a lot of people there, but it seems to be the only realistic option other than just living with toxic water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for such an informative (albeit depressing) analysis.</p>
<p>I tried thinking of a question to ask about how they might solve their problem, but it seems like such a catastrophic situation. I don't even know what to ask as a layperson. Incredibly sad. </p>
<p>Glad to see that someone with great knowledge about this stuff is working on this, even if you're just in a small town. I hope you keep doing what you're doing. Thank you for the work you do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Puts the engineering failure into perspective.  People died because of this and there were enormous economic losses that won't be recovered for over a decade.  The incidence of education and behavioral support needs has been increased in an already vulnerable population.</p>
<p>People died from Takata's airbag inflaters, but they could be flushed from the supply chain pretty quickly.  People who didn't die but bought Takata airbag inflaters didn't suffer huge economic losses in their family wealth.</p>
<p>The Note 7 battery defect cost Samsung billions, but the damage was contained entirely to Samsung and their shareholders, as I'm sure they reimbursed people who lost property due to the fires.</p>
<p>There needs to be greater engineering and process protections on the water supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to give people an idea, my village has about 35 thousand residents and our average household income is around 100k/year.  Our annual budget is $18M, but I believe half of that is funded by the state via property taxes.</p>
<p>If we had an OH SHIT $60M emergency, we would have to shutdown for 3 years, that includes the police.  I think something like 90% of our budget is salary and benefits (insurance, pension, ect).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. </p>
<p>But consider that most cities actually have some lead pipes that need to be replaced. Most cities do, and after Flint many folks (politicians, government officials and agencies, advocacy groups and concerned citizens, etc) went looking for those pipes. </p>
<p>Lots of lead pipes are being found to be in use across the US. I think Flint is a special case of disaster, but most cities in the US have at least some homes and entities (schools, businesses) that are serviced by out of date/out of compliance pipes. Lead pipes that could eventually lead to health problems.</p>
<p>Municipal water infrastructure has historically been a state/local issue. They plan and fund it themselves.</p>
<p>If the Federal Government were to swoop in and replace Flint's pipes on the federal dime, why shouldn't they do so in Memphis? Or in Athens? Or in Charlotte? Or in Salt Lake City? </p>
<p>We could have a conversation about federal budget priorities and we might agree. But that's one of the hints I pick up when trying to understand this, that yes Washington could appropriate funds to fix Flint's infrastructure but then they would need to explain to other municipalities why Flint is more special than they are. </p>
<p>Like I acknowledged, Flint's situation is uniquely bad. But choosing to fund Flint's infrastructure improvements while failing to fund your own Congressional District's infrastructure improvements isn't exactly seen as a huge win in most districts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right. And the cost isn't really the issue. That 15 years can't be sped up by much because the work is so disruptive. It means tearing up roads. There can't be a &quot;price is no object&quot;, throw everything there is at the problem type solution because only so much work can be done simultaneously.</p>
<p>Frankly, the scale of the issue has everyone paralyzed. Everyone should just leave the affected area.</p></div>		</li>
