			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there are serial killers at work now. One seems to be working up around Edmonton, in Canada. The RCMP up there seem to have a very poor rate for solving murders, even within the fact that murders are inherently hard to solve if the killer isn't known to the victim (husbands are prime suspects for a statistically sound reason).</p>
<p>These cases take place over time and we're very immediate in our news consumption - time is moving slower for us than for a book you read over a couple of days that describes the Zodiac investigations. The gathering of clues by law enforcement is slow and although technology helps, it still requires the work of boots on the ground. This seems to me like the notion that classic rock and nostalgia music is always great where there were tons of garbage songs in those eras that didn't stick around because although it could get published, better music was selected for.</p>
<p>But I would agree that catching killers we discover should be easier. In the Edmonton example, one known victim called a relative and left voicemail from a cell phone. Therefore: the murderer has a habit of carry his cell phone and cell phones track by GPS. If he is ever caught, a phone will help, where nothing like that existed in decades past. His vehicle, depending how new it is, will also be provably at the scene.</p></div>		</li>
