			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue here, as you recognize, that the number will depend on the player population. </p>
<p>If the game has any element of luck the game will tend towards pure luck as the quality of play approaches perfect play.</p>
<p>So the question is badly formed. The ratio of luck versus skill isn't the property of the game. It is the property of the game <em>as played by a given population</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Take a different example. You and I pay $10 to enter a coinflip game that is best of three. Winner takes all.</p>
<p>At the start our equity in the event is$10 each.</p>
<p>If I win the first flip, my equity is now $15 and yours is $5.</p>
<p>Now imagine that my 75-25 edge was due to skill, not luck. There,  my equity is still 15 dollars. I may not get that money as I can still lose, but it's my equity in the event</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We aren't talking about smoothing out luck as time or the number of games approaches infinity. We're talking about the luck:skill ratio. The point, which you seem to have missed as though it was your job, is that this ratio will be different for different sets of players. In other words, it is not necessarily an intrinsic property of the game, but rather is bounded by the game. The exact ratio will fall within the bounds imposed by the game, but will be dependent on the skill of the players. (Or, perhaps more intuitively, on the skill differential between the players) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There will always be randomness in players' performance in any tournament. People's arm strengths can vary. Usain Bolt would never have 100% implied odds of winning the 100m from the betting markets. And AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol 4 games to 1 in go, rather than 5 to 0 if their skills were deterministic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't apply game theory or associated mathematical concepts to running track, though we may colloquially refer to it as a &quot;game&quot;. To address your point about go, it is extremely unlikely (bordering on impossible) that either of the players played a perfect game in any of the 5 matches. If go were to be solved, then we could have a scenario where one player could always force a win. No randomness whatsoever, like connect 4. However, I do not anticipate that go will be solved within our lifetimes given the massive amount of computational resources that would be required. </p></div>		</li>
