			<div class="markdown"><p>You're mixing effects of long term calory restriction with short time fasting. And don't think for a second that you can be healthy while just eating a couple of vegetables a day. You're going to lose muscle mass because autophagy will kick in, bone structure bcs of your low calcium intake etc. And don't cite an article from a corporate owned journal for which it's impossible to even find an impact factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think he was asking about long term fasting to the extent that autophagy kick in.  He was asking about how it is that fasting regiments are associated with longevity.  There are many reseach articles that talk about the benefits fasting. One need only do a google search.  I think he was asking why it is thought to be benefitial - current theory.  Additionally, </p>
<p>Long term fasting can be safe, even healthy, if supervised by a trained physician. There are several types of fasting used to both prevent and treat disease. Many doctors recommend fasting as a method to free the body from toxins. Although some critics claim that the body cannot tell the difference between starvation and fasting, other doctors insist that fasting and starvation are two separate processes.</p>
<p>There is some debate on how many days a fast must last to be considered long term fasting. Some people believe that anything over three days is long term, while others think a long term fast will stretch past 30 days. Many factors influence how quickly a fast will affect the body, such as body weight and metabolism. The line that separates a short-term fast from a long-term fast might be different for each individual.</p>
<p>Experts recommend consulting a doctor if a fast will last longer than three days. If a person intends to fast for longer than three days, most doctors will recommend regular checkups to ensure that the patient's electrolyte and potassium levels do not drop. The doctor will help his patient decide how closely the fast should be monitored.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. In power save mode the system is operating with only a little power.  Things that are not working go to sleep for a while.  But everything else stays the same or worse.  With fasting it seems that our “human computer” is smarter.  It reallizes that we need to think sharper when we were in power save mode so that we can catch food etc.  </p></div>		</li>
