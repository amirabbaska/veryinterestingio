<p>Here is a more detailed entry on the antibacterial and antimicrobial properties of sage smoke: </p>

<p>RESULTS:
Antimicrobial data revealed that in most cases, the 'smoke-extract' obtained after burning had lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values than the corresponding solvent extracts and essential oils. The combustion, acetone and methanol extracts produced different chromatographic profiles as demonstrated for Pellaea calomelanos where several compounds noted in the smoke fraction were not present in the other extracts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That study doesn't address whether the smoke actually reduced pathogenic loads, and you should always be skeptical with a study that starts like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Validation of smoke inhalation therapy to treat microbial infections</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The researchers were biased, looking for a certain outcome.</p></div>		</li>
