			<div class="markdown"><p>But what would happen if Britain re-instituted a much higher income tax again today? Would the economy continue to grow?</p>
<p>It seems like nowadays, whenever a country threatens to increase the income tax on high earners, these people threaten to pull out their business and invest in another country. It happened when Francois Hollande wanted to create a 75% &quot;supertax&quot; on the rich after he became President of France. A bunch of big French automotive companies said &quot;okay, we'll just move our operations to Switzerland where we won't have to deal with the taxes&quot; </p>
<p>So how was Britain able to institute such a high tax back in the post-war period without this happening? Why didn't all the investment dry up? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't these rates the reason for people like the Beatles and Led Zeppelin spending half the year living outside the UK &quot;for tax purposes&quot;? I have a foggy memory of reading that taxation was very different if you resided for less than six months of the year in Britain, so Robert Plant, Paul McCartney, et.al. would live at home for five months and 29 days a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't read that myself but of course, there will always be people trying to minimise their tax bill but that happens whatever the top rate is. There are people now who do similar things and the rate is 40%, vastly smaller than what it used to be. Remember the whole Mossack Fonseca and Panama Papers controversy last year? I have no doubt in my mind that even if the top rate of tax was 1%, people would still try to wiggle their way out of it </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what the exact time limit is (I have a feeling it's less than 6 months) but yes, you can qualify as a &quot;non-domiciled resident&quot; which basically means you live in the United Kingdom but officially reside in a different country. A lot of very wealthy people use this to avoid taxes; here's a list:</p>

<p>It caused a lot of controversy in 2010 when there were reports of some very wealthy people pulling some ridiculous stunts to remain qualified as a &quot;non-dom&quot;. There was one story going around about a certain individual who took his private jet into international airspace for the night and then returning the next day, purely to extend his non-dom residence.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were lots of little tricks like that happening. It also led to some odd little projects - George Harrison founding Handmade Films (Who produced the Monty Python movies, among many others) was basically an excuse to chuck a shitload of cash into a venture rather than give it to the taxman. </p></div>		</li>
