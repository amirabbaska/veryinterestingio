			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this! Is there any information on the actual relative strength of an average strike then as compared to now, i.e. was there an actual measurable difference in shockwave strength etc? Or was it that the 'bolt' itself would have been largely similar, just that on the ground, plant material was much easier to set alight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Carboniferous era is wicked cool, by the way. Trees had evolved, but no organism that could break down cellulose. Trees would grow, live, and die, and just stay there. Imagine forests dense with fallen tree trunks tens of feet deep, teeming with giant spiders (bodies a foot long with 20 inch legs)!</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, not a spider. Straight from the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_spiders" target="_blank">Wiki</a> </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of the energy in a lightning strike as being the energy stored in the capacitor that discharged - call that 1/2 C V^2.  The breakdown voltage of a gas increases with pressure (roughly linearly at atmospheric pressure).  So if atmospheric pressure was 2x higher (no idea if that is true but as an example), breakdown voltage for lightning would be 2x higher and the energy released would be 4x higher per strike.    So I'd expect louder thunder for example, and more damage at the contact site.</p>
<p>The amount of lightning over the planet would be strongly influenced by climate as well - warm and wet is better than cold and dry for electrical storms.  A warmer, wetter, higher pressure world would have more lightning with more &quot;oomph&quot; per strike.</p>
<p>As a side note, the formation of extensive coal deposits was helped by the fact that trees did not decompose as quickly  as organisms with the appropriate enzymes to break down wood/lignin had not evolved.  I wonder if plastic today will be the coal of tomorrow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no need to wait for a lightning strike. Spontaneous combustion is a real thing. In fact, when charcoal, ordinary charcoal gets wet and then dries out it will often set itself on fire. I don't understand the chemistry but I do know that it is a real issue in the safe storage of charcoal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not entirely accurate. That paper is not suggesting that the coal beds formed during the Carboniferous period derived from huge charcoal deposits. The Carboniferous coal beds formed from peat deposits developed from the extensive swamp and wetland that covered much of the world.</p>
<p>The paper indicates that fusain concentrations are evidence that wildfires were severe and more widespread than today, but that's not the same thing as suggesting what you are saying it suggests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If my understanding is correct, that buildup of charcoal (that later becomes coal) was compounded by two other effects:</p>
<p>-the ratio of bark to &quot;wood&quot; was much higher than it is now, something like 8:1.  Therefore there was a lot more bark being produced than we see on contemporary trees.  Anyone that has burnt wood vs. bark in a campfire can see that bark transforms to a carbon deposit much easier than wood.</p>
<p>-there was no biologic activity that led to decomposition and decay.  therefore, the bark that was shed would remain on the ground indefinitely.  Since it wasn't decaying through biologic activity, it would accumulate until it experience a fire strike.  The bark accumulation could be significant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read something about this having to do with the tendency of plants/trees to be much skinnier and smaller at the time. Circumference increases linearly while area increases exponentially, so a dozen skinny 1-inch trees would have a much greater ratio of bark-to-wood than a single 3 or 4&quot; tree that covers the same amount of ground and has the same amount of wood.</p></div>		</li>
