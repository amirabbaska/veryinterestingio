			<p>Thank you for this! Is there any information on the actual relative strength of an average strike then as compared to now, i.e. was there an actual measurable difference in shockwave strength etc? Or was it that the 'bolt' itself would have been largely similar, just that on the ground, plant material was much easier to set alight?</p>		</li>

			<p>The Carboniferous era is wicked cool, by the way. Trees had evolved, but no organism that could break down cellulose. Trees would grow, live, and die, and just stay there. Imagine forests dense with fallen tree trunks tens of feet deep, teeming with giant spiders (bodies a foot long with 20 inch legs)!</p>		</li>

Some good reading <a href="http://feedthedatamonster.com/home/2014/7/11/how-fungi-saved-the-world" target="_blank">here on that subject</a><br><br>&gt;Whereas <strong>cellulose was made of glucose</strong>, which can be readily converted to energy, <strong>lignin was based on phenol</strong>, a derivative of benzene, which is only a good energy source when it's on fire. This isn't a solution for your average bacterium. Digesting lignin was so difficult that lycopods had free reign over the planet for over 40 million years, leading to the world's first and only wood pollution crisis.  Finally, however, a fungus belonging to the class Agaricomycetes – making it a distant cousin of button mushrooms – did find a crude way to break down lignin. <br><br>&gt;This was the one and only time in the last 300 million years that the wood-rotting ability evolved. All the fungi today that can digest wood (and a few that can't) are the descendants of that enterprising fungus</p>		</li>

			<p>Spider fossils are very tricky, they tend not to preserve well. The largest known spider fossils are two specimens of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongolarachne" target="_blank">Mongolarachne</a>. We have one male and one female both from the Jurassic period. They exist because they were preserved by a volcanic eruption. <br><br>These spiders are roughly the same size as their modern relatives the <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/0e/21/50/0e2150785e9da3f18768acbcae3e729e.jpg" target="_blank">golden orb weaver</a>, which having personally walked face first into one I can tell you they are very big but a far cry from a foot long. The misinformation you see about foot long spiders comes from speculation that the oxygen content would allow them to get that large. Some spiders never stop growing and in theory even modern day ones could reach these sizes but environmental factors (lack of oxygen) prevent this. Here's a probably <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/amp.livescience.com/24122-why-insects-are-not-bigger.html" target="_blank">overly simplified explanation</a> for different thoughts about this.<br><br>Edit: oh btw my links are about giant spiders click at your own peril</p>		</li>

The giant insects of the late Palaeozoic occurred when atmospheric PO2 (aPO2) was hyperoxic, supporting a role for oxygen in the evolution of insect body size. The paucity of the insect fossil record and the complex interactions between atmospheric oxygen level, organisms and their communities makes it impossible to definitively accept or reject the historical oxygen-size link, and multiple alternative hypotheses exist. However, a variety of recent empirical findings support a link between oxygen and insect size, including: (i) most insects develop smaller body sizes in hypoxia, and some develop and evolve larger sizes in hyperoxia; (ii) insects developmentally and evolutionarily reduce their proportional investment in the tracheal system when living in higher aPO2, suggesting that there are significant costs associated with tracheal system structure and function; and (iii) larger insects invest more of their body in the tracheal system, potentially leading to greater effects of aPO2 on larger insects. Together, these provide a wealth of plausible mechanisms by which tracheal oxygen delivery may be centrally involved in setting the relatively small size of insects and for hyperoxia-enabled Palaeozoic gigantism.<br><br>Yes, and no. It's very dependent on the insects you look at. With insects having hundreds of thousands of species, it would be hard to pinpoint which ones would thrive in the hyperoxic environment. Insects that have quick transition into the adult stage, such as dragonflies, would see a profound explosion in size. Others like roaches are bigger now than ever before due to their poor tracheal development. </p>		</li>

			<p>Think of the energy in a lightning strike as being the energy stored in the capacitor that discharged - call that 1/2 C V^2.  The breakdown voltage of a gas increases with pressure (roughly linearly at atmospheric pressure).  So if atmospheric pressure was 2x higher (no idea if that is true but as an example), breakdown voltage for lightning would be 2x higher and the energy released would be 4x higher per strike.    So I'd expect louder thunder for example, and more damage at the contact site.<br><br>The amount of lightning over the planet would be strongly influenced by climate as well - warm and wet is better than cold and dry for electrical storms.  A warmer, wetter, higher pressure world would have more lightning with more &quot;oomph&quot; per strike.<br><br>As a side note, the formation of extensive coal deposits was helped by the fact that trees did not decompose as quickly  as organisms with the appropriate enzymes to break down wood/lignin had not evolved.  I wonder if plastic today will be the coal of tomorrow.<br></p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/plorraine" target="_blank">plorraine</a>
			<p>There are other factors affecting pressure.  When the early earth cooled sufficiently that water could condense out of the atmosphere, the pressure dropped.  Minerals exposed by weathering or tectonic activity interact with the atmosphere as well - either absorbing or releasing gas depending on the temperature (I think carbonates breakdown on Venus).  Volcanos release gases, methane gets sequestered or released, etc.  Venus's atmospheric pressure started much lower and got higher over time.   But I think this is inferred from models that we think are valid rather than by something like measuring the pressure in a trapped bubble.   This is something I'd love to have someone more knowledgable educate me on.</p>		</li>

			<p>Important distinction, thanks.<br>The data show that the largest commercially-available bag of charcoal briquets, 9 kg (20 lb.), cannot self ignite at an ambient temperature below 394 K (121 C or 250 F). All tested variations: size, different formulations, addition of water or dry wood, aging, and different bag configurations, raised this critical temperature even higher. At ambient temperatures (approximately 25 C ) these data show a bag of charcoal briquets would have to exceed the volume of a typical house to self ignite.<br><br>Of course the confusion between coal and charcoal is probably responsible for the myth.<br><br>Still, I seem to see a pattern: anything combustible might go up, even wood, but it gets less probable at lower energy densities.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sort of. Warm and wet in the low levels but cold and dry aloft is ideal for lightning. This gives you the best lapse rates and conditional atmospheric instability. Charge separation by hydrometeor collison is the primary formation mechanism.</p>		</li>

			<p>Direct measurements of ice core bubbles can only go back about 800,000 years. Beyond that we use &quot;climate proxies&quot; to indicate the rough climate/ atmospheric conditions. Things like isotope ratios in carbonate rocks (basically compressed sea shells).

			<p>Insect sizes are a big one. Book lungs are not very efficient and place an upper limit on the sizes of arachnids and insects. More oxygen increases this limit. The largest of both lived at that time including a dragonfly with a 1m wingspan and a an arachnid with a 3 foot claw (the only fossil we have is tgat one claw)</p>		</li>

			<p>We dont know. Some paleontologist have estimated around 10m. But we dont even know if it was a spider. There are 3 other arachnid families with similar claws. It could have come if a scorpion or solifuge or a family we dont even know about. Perhaps aquatic (sea creatures have a tendency to giantism which is stronger for creatures whose ancestors lived on land). One claw fossil does not tell you much. I saw a documentary on it once. Cant seem to find a link though.</p>		</li>

			<p>Indeed. You may want to read up on the Burgess Shale. It was always believed that there were basically four body plans in life. Every family, kingdom or species known was one of those four. The Burgess Shale - in one single place, gave us fossil evidence of another 20. Twenty types of life as different from vertebrates and inveterbrates as they are from each other. The shale dates from the pre-Cambrian era, and there are no other specimens or fossils of any of those bodyplans. The general belief is that they simply didn't survive, the four that made it all the way to today were just more practical. I should mention there is ongoing research into the Shale and it may be a little less diverse than originally believed, but not by much. <br><br>That said - it's amazing what we don't know even about things we do know about. As XKCD so eloquently pointed out this week - if spiders had gone extinct before humans had writing, and all we had known of them was from fossils - nobody would ever have known they spinned webs. Fossils can tell us something about an animal, the more we have and the more complete the better the picture. When we have a decent supply - we can learn a great deal about what an animal looked like... but they teach us almost nothing about how an animal lived. What it's soft organs could do. How it behaved. Think about it. If there were dinosaurs who used tools, maybe even had writing - how would we know ? Unless their tools were made of stone we would never find any. We see that even with humans. Where stones were our ancestors tools - we find examples. But there are almost no examples of tools from ancient China. Yet the earliest Chinese settlers were people whose ancestors had tools - did they lose the ability ? No. They made use of the best local resource, which was not stone but bamboo. Bamboo makes excellent tools - but it doesn't often leave long-lasting relics.<br>Reading about archeology and paleontology I am always simultaneously awestruck by two contradictory things. How much we learn from so little, and how incredibly little we know. There could have been a Pterosaur that spun webs - and we would never know... Hatzegopterix could not have taken off from ground-level, we've experimentally proven it could fly, but only if it somehow got up there in the first place. How did it do so ? Did it jump from cliffs ? Trees ? For all we know it built trampolines (if a spider can manage it - why not a much smarter reptile ?).</p>		</li>

			<p>I didn't realize oxygen was a size-enhancing factor. I thought it had to do with having exoskeletons and the weight-to-size ratio scaling up too quickly -- i.e., they'd simply be too heavy to move at a certain point.</p>		</li>

			<p>One way is to use air bubbles trapped in Antarctic ice. Scientists drill out cores and analyze the bubbles. This gives us a good record going back at least 800,000 years.<br><br>Older samples are a little harder but amber traps air as well. It's not as complete a record as the ice cores but still works.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is not entirely accurate. That paper is not suggesting that the coal beds formed during the Carboniferous period derived from huge charcoal deposits. The Carboniferous coal beds formed from peat deposits developed from the extensive swamp and wetland that covered much of the world.<br><br>The paper indicates that fusain concentrations are evidence that wildfires were severe and more widespread than today, but that's not the same thing as suggesting what you are saying it suggests.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/JohnnyMnemo" target="_blank">JohnnyMnemo</a>
			<p>If my understanding is correct, that buildup of charcoal (that later becomes coal) was compounded by two other effects:<br><br>-the ratio of bark to &quot;wood&quot; was much higher than it is now, something like 8:1.  Therefore there was a lot more bark being produced than we see on contemporary trees.  Anyone that has burnt wood vs. bark in a campfire can see that bark transforms to a carbon deposit much easier than wood.<br><br>-there was no biologic activity that led to decomposition and decay.  therefore, the bark that was shed would remain on the ground indefinitely.  Since it wasn't decaying through biologic activity, it would accumulate until it experience a fire strike.  The bark accumulation could be significant.</p>		</li>

			<p>I read something about this having to do with the tendency of plants/trees to be much skinnier and smaller at the time. Circumference increases linearly while area increases exponentially, so a dozen skinny 1-inch trees would have a much greater ratio of bark-to-wood than a single 3 or 4&quot; tree that covers the same amount of ground and has the same amount of wood.</p>		</li>

			<p>Interesting. I suppose since nothing could break down cellulose yet they couldn't get as much nutrients from the soil, or am I completely off the mark here for why they were so skinny?</p>		</li>

			<p>My understanding is that they just weren't as tall, so they didn't need to be as thick. <br><br>Explanation was that height is a competitive advantage, lets you steal the sun from other plants. Trunk thickness has little inherent benefit except for a place to store nutrients. However it turns out that producing those expensive thick trunks is a winning strategy in the height race, but only if you live a long time.</p>		</li>
