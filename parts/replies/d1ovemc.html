<p>But if you owned the company that the money went to, wouldn't that just be a profit for the new company that you'd still owe taxes on? Haven't you just kicked the can down the road for yourself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once a decade or so, the US government announces a &quot;repatriation tax holiday&quot; in order to &quot;recapture all that offshore money&quot; to &quot;inject back into the US economy.&quot;</p>
<p>The last time it happened, in 2004, corporations only had to pay 5.25% instead of the standard 35%.</p>
<p>I don't have a cite handy but I'm pretty sure Trump or Cruz has called for another one of these tax holidays at one of the GOP debates.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation_tax_holiday" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repatriation_tax_holiday</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Didn't have to go far to find a cite for Trump, it's a main pillar of his <a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/tax-reform" target="_blank">tax plan</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Trump tax cuts are fully paid for by:</p>
<p>_2. A one-time deemed repatriation of corporate cash held overseas at a significantly discounted 10% tax rate, followed by an end to the deferral of taxes on corporate income earned abroad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT2: <a href="https://www.tedcruz.org/tax_plan_summary/" target="_blank">Cruz too</a></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Removes the current tax penalty on American businesses that earn profits abroad, encouraging those businesses to bring profits home. Businesses will flock to America rather than keep money abroad or move overseas to escape high tax rates â€“ and jobs and growth will come home with them. Under the Simple Flat Tax, U.S. businesses could return their overseas profits to American soil for a one-time 10 percent repatriation fee.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT3: <a href="http://crfb.org/blogs/kasich-releases-plan-get-balance" target="_blank">Kasich</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>On the corporate side, it would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allow multinational businesses to repatriate their foreign income at a reduced rate</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Companies are taxed on profit. Not income.</p>
<p>If company A has $100, and gives it to company B, then company A has no money to pay taxes on. Company B doesnt either. Because company B can give it to C, or they can give it back to the owner as a paycheck. Either way it is an expense to B, and the profit for B is $0, so they pay no taxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So company C or the owner has to pay the taxes?  If company C pays, who cares?  And if the owner pays, you are just cutting out the corporate tax which is really just inefficient double-taxation anyway.  Seems like the easiest solution here would be to eliminate corporate taxes and raise rates on dividends and distributions to make up for the loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're not missing anything. Either the money goes into a black hole and is never seen again or it gets repaid later to the individual or company that paid the money to the Panamanian entity.  Of course it doesn't go into a black hole so it eventually gets repaid. And when it does that's taxable money, just taxable at a later time and potentially at a different rate. That's tax planning. Not tax evasion but rather tax deferral.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the last 40 years, everyone has known about it.  Things like this have been plot points in movies for about that amount of time, if not longer.</p>
<p>Part of the issue is that most offshore business dealings are completely legal.  That's why all 11.5 million documents were not revealed.  Most people are probably playing by the rules, and they use these offshore companies for legitimate, law-abiding reasons.</p>
<p>But everyone has always known that some people and companies break the rules.</p></div>		</li>
