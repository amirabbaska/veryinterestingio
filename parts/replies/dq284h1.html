			<div class="markdown"><p>Cas stands for CRISPR Associated. Really any gene that is associated with the function of the CRISPR array (the genetic database of  targets) is a cas gene. They can be the nucleases that do the cut,  nucleases involved in maturation of the targeting RNA, regulators, RNA-binding proteins...</p>
<p>The name CRISPR-Cas9 applied to a technique identifies the main protein that performs the final targeting/cutting function (in this case Cas9).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're talking nonsense.</p>
<p>Firstly, Cas9 absolutely does not have &quot;insanely high&quot; off-target effects. Off-target binding is certainly a problem, and one that will probably be reduced with improved guide design or Cas variants over the coming years, but you make it sound as if guide RNAs just bind anywhere. A well designed guide will have perfect sequence homology to only one region in the genome. I personally haven't been able to detect any off-target effects in my CRISPR experiments. </p>
<p>Secondly, the Cas13 system is a tool for editing RNA, not DNA, so would not be useful in this circumstance and isn't really a gene editing tool. </p>
<p>Thirdly, what do you mean by &quot;we're a long way from true gene editing&quot;? Gene editing has been possible for decades. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh please, you know exactly what he's saying. The public doesn't talk about gene editing technology in terms of an embryo. It's great you're into science, but do try to maintain perspective. Additionally, if you were to have some delivery system to every cell in the human body his point about the off target effects is exactly right: they'd be insanely high and probably kill you.</p>
<p>Just because the CRISPER/Cas system is such an amazing tool doesn't mean it doesn't have room for improvement. This is what science does. Day in and day out, improve improve improve. No one stops at that rare big step. It's absolutely worth remembering what the long term goals are even if its not realistic to talk about them just yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we're all getting confused by the term &quot;insanely high&quot; because we haven't asked The Economist's Question which is &quot;compared to what?&quot;</p>
<p>As you've said off target binding, compared to other options for gene editing, or what is needed to transform cells in the lab, isn't insanely high at all.</p>
<p>As the post you reply to is I think trying to say, off target binding <em>is</em> insanely high compared to what would likely be needed to change every cell in a living human safely.</p>
<p>By &quot;true gene editing&quot; most people are thinking of the sci-fi version of the technology where if you know which letter pairs you want to change, you can walk into the clinic, get an injection and every cell in your body is flawlessly converted a week later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lol! And it would be probably the ultimate risky use of a scientific tool for limited gain. Gene modify my cells so I don't have to buy a $10 vial of lactase enzyme every month or three? And if I miss a dose I get a little farty and bloaty? Uh, nope! </p>
<p>Now something more serious like PKU, now THAT is a serious use for CRISPR. Assuming their brains haven't been already cooked from Phenylalanine exposure, it would keep them safe from risks of accidental exposure, and literal loss of their minds. </p>
<p>And someone is actually trying something like that. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5081532/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5081532/</a></p>
<p>Something more down the road, but similar, repair of the glutamate moderation mechanisms that glitch out in schizophrenics, if they every find the right on. And maybe something for huntington's, which might happen before the schizophrenia cure.  </p>
<p>Maybe something a bit more interesting, modification of something that has evolved to get inside the human body to deliver a payload. Wanna deliver a wallop to liver flukes, hep c, blood parasites, there's a payload delivery mechanism waiting to be edited.(but probably not for a few decades) <a href="http://mbio.asm.org/content/5/4/e01414-14.full" target="_blank">http://mbio.asm.org/content/5/4/e01414-14.full</a>  Probably be more likely to fly in a country where everyone has already been exposed to malaria. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gave the article a quick look and it says he &quot;injected himself with AAV or bacteria with CRISPR to promote muscle growth&quot; which is personally baffling how he thinks it will have an effect. CRISPR is originally intended to repair unwanted genes (disease causing viruses, cancer gene mutations, etc) with a known gene sequence. </p>
<p>What did this &quot;muscle growth&quot; promoting CRISPR do? he didn't specify if it produced growth hormones or cause increased muscle cell division. If this method did work, as far as I know this method of injecting would only affects a small area around the injection site, so I could even hypothesize he'd be experiencing uneven growth on his arm.</p>
<p>The way the article quotes him equating sunbathing and chemotherapy in terms of damaging DNA while downplaying CRISPR's possible negative impact to DNA is evident to me about his credibility as well. His vendetta against &quot;big-pharma&quot; and regulations in this article is apparent too. Personally, these &quot;homebrewed&quot; genetics kits are concerning since they're a grey area for regulations and safety standards, and this guy is just one more leaf into the pile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gave myostatin a quick look and is it true that knocking out that protein would cause excessive muscle growth like those burly cows? i also found some links to journal articles that equate myostatin loss to loss in actuation strength and muscle atrophy. that'd be troubling in the least and possibly debilitating if this was injected with the intention to silence myostatin.</p>
