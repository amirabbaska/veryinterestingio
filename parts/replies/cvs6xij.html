			<div class="markdown"><p>True but don't forget that in the early stages of hunting a lot of success would stem from a tribe's or an individual's ability to keep running for long distances in order to tire out their prey.  </p>
<p>So on top of being the smartest, it was also the being the most fit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're also leaving out the intelligence factor with humans. Strategy and general caution, no matter how crude or undeveloped our far reaching ancestors had, would have a huge effect on things. Short burst energy is outclassed when put it up against endurance and planning. You'll lose the battle, but win the war in a sense. This could come in effect in both self-defense and hunting aspects as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah for sure intelligence is a key factor, although I never really said it wasn't in my comment.  </p>
<p>In hunting though I don't think intelligence played out a significant role in it as much as long-distance running to exhaust the prey did. No real difficulty intelligence wise or tactic wise, you just have to immobilize the prey and then spear it.  </p>
<p>Intelligence advanced ourselves in terms of building buildings (lol), creating medicine, developing religion for intrinsic value (not really practical though maybe doesn't fit here), and enhancing our strategies to get food through better hunting and later on farming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well there are all sorts of interesting idea about how hunting worked for so called cave men. Leading mammoths to the bottom of hills and cliffs where other hunters can throw spears down into them in the valley and the like.</p>
<p>Also, the religion thing is a way to organize people, very similar to a governmental body. A government of the mind, so to speak. Good way to keep a tribe or town together, although faces schism problems at larger scales.</p></div>		</li>
