			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a horribly run chain store type charter school. Teacher turnover is terrible, administration constantly changes the rules of the game, parents are not involved. There's nothing in place (aside from a phone call home, which usually ends up being a voicemail) for minor student behaviors so unless the kids fight, they can basically do/say whatever they want. If you fight, you get suspended (so, yay, enjoy your day off). We've gone through 2 Interim (like, temporary) principals this year and school has only been in session since September. We are a priority school,  which basically means the state knows we're failing and has threatened to shut us down if we continue to present below-standard test scores.
There have been articles in the news lately from sister chain store schools. Whistle blower teachers are coming forward anonymously to talk about terrible management. Scary because there's no contract and it's at-will employment.
All that said, there are great schools run by the same company on the other side of the state. Some of my friends work for them and when we exchange stories, we just end up not believing one another.
I have started looking for a different job. I had a second interview this week and if I get the offer, it'll be a $5k pay cut. I'll probably take the hit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing about charters, as you were getting at, is that the quality very much depends on the individual school. In a large sense district schools are the same. I work in an amazing charter school in Florida. It's run well, administration is in top of their game, teachers are expected to be truly effective (not just in a &quot;did your kids pass he state test&quot; way), and the kids are held to high expectations. It works amazing and parents are on board. They know the alternative to the charter is a god awful district school that has substandard education and safety issues. But you know, its district run so it won't be shuttered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think university/college charter schools would be the ideal nationwide standard. Greater access to education resources and a better support system for teachers. The charter school my sister attended (ran by the University if Texas) had education TAs work with the teachers, so students were essentially getting double the attention (my high-school had a similar program for education students, but only for a few classes). </p>
<p>Having that much attention per student at early development is so important, and it showed when we moved and my sister attended a regular school. She got bored very easily, since some of the material she already knew, and anything new she learned so quickly.   </p>
<p>I have to disagree with your complaint about the textbooks though. I feel too often bad teachers use them as a crutch. Textbooks should be a general reference source at best - and ideally you would just have a set of more specific reference books that are decided by the teachers and Principal (or other similar overseer). The best education I received is when my teachers ditched textbooks and had us read scanned excerpts from their own collection, published studies (people usually have to pay to see them) and articles. We were much more engaged.</p></div>		</li>
