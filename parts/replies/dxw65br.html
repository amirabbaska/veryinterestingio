			<div class="markdown"><p>So suppose the sun was 1 million Kelvin all throughout. Not a bad assumption, it's about 15 million in the core, and about 5,000 K at the surface.</p>
<p>The kinetic energy of a proton in a 1 million Kelvin gas is found from 3/2 k T (k is the Boltzmann constant). That's 0.0001 MeV. Compare that to the mass-energy of a proton, 939 MeV/c^(2). That thermal energy is less than a millionth of the energy per particle. </p>
<p>For all practical purposes, you never really need to consider this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genuine question because you broke that down brilliantly..</p>
<p>What happens when two gravitational curves of equal potential meet? Do reflecting waves colliding form a linear path or would the wave collapse? Or possibly oscillate off each other?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gravitational waves can meet, they just pass through each other without interaction for all practical purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, how come they dont interact? Is it because of different potential in the waves. Say the inertia of the wave was identical would it still not interact?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might be interested in reading about wave <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superposition_principle#Wave_superposition" target="_blank">superposition</a>, and the linearity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation" target="_blank">wave equations</a>. The equations governing most waves - such as ripples in a pond, sound in the air, earthquakes in rock, string, and light or radio in the electromagnetic field - are linear (at least to first order for small enough magnitudes). As a result, waves pass through each other without affecting one another, simply adding up in the exact region of overlap. This is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interference_(wave_propagation\)" target="_blank">intereference</a> works. </p></div>		</li>
