			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not so much that your skin is unable to sweat, it’s that your body is trying to heal your skin. Your immune response dilates your blood vessels on your skin. This causes you to cool off at a fast pace, thus, your body doesn’t need to produce as much sweat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There is a lot of inflammation associated with a broken bone. At least early on, the tissue around the break is often swollen, hot, and tender. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YEs! Same for cuts! or light bruises! BUTa bigger bruise is colder. Because the blood vessels have broken close the the surface of the skin and the blood is pooling, losing heat. </p></div>		</li>
