			<div class="markdown"><p>To look at it from another perspective, parasite-host interaction is a powerful selective pressure in evolution. A parasite species is put under pressure to successfully parasitize a host while the host is pressured to resist and destroy it. These interactions are a very literal arms race of evolutionary adaptions that can and does occur quite rapidly in populations. (Humans perhaps excluded, since we use medicine-- but you can argue that this in itself is us adapting.)</p>
<p>This competitive pressure is so powerful that parasite adaption is often considered one of the main reasons sex developed-- sexual reproduction allows for random assortment, and therefore more rapid emergence of new adaptive traits, for both parasites and their hosts...</p></div>		</li>

<p>We are definitely not excluded. Until we reach a point when all parasites can be easily and <em>cheaply</em> eliminated even from the most immunocompromised (and otherwise weakened) humans, there is definitely a huge selective pressure to fight parasitization.</p>
<p>And we haven't reached that point -- not when hundreds of thousands of people still die annually to malaria alone. (More than nine-times-eleven nine-elevens worth of deaths <em>every year</em>.)</p>
<p>(Good points otherwise, I'm just nit-picking...[lol nits are parasites geddit])</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so you know there's a lot of work been done on our medicine causing many auto immune diseases, its natural for your body to be bombarded with bacterial and parasitic attacks in fact its nessesary. For example, often allergic asthma is caused by incorrect activation of IgG antibodies I think which are the part of the immune system associated with paracite control. I've even seen studies on tapeworm infections curing asthma. You wouldn't want to remove all the parasites anyway, most of them are harmless: your whole body is inhabited by different nematodes that all do very little and digestions is reliant on lots of bacteria that anywhere else in the body cause serious illness. So uh... Infections are you friends </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, we've seen the exact evolutionary pressures at work in humans. Malaria js actually a fantastic example, as sickle cell anemia is generally theorized to be an adaption to malaria. It's the textbook example, but its hardly unique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such parasitic species are also under heavy evolutionary pressure to form symbiotic relationships. To limit the harm to the host species to maintain a high population of host species and limit the evolutionary pressure of the host species to engage in an arms race to eradicate it, or eradication by taming. Once two species can comfortably coexist the pressure exist to create a mutually beneficial relationship. In which the host actively contributes to the survival of the hostess to garner the benefits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is a cyclic process in and of itself. The logical conclusion to prolonged symbiosis is merger into a single organism more fit than either would have been on their own. For example the inclusion of mitochondria into animal cells, or the inclusion of photosynthesizing algae in things like wasps and hornets. We even see this on the viral level with the inclusion of viral genes into our own genome in the form on introns. Successful organisms incorporate the tools of their parasites and symbiotes into themselves to either utilize their benefit now, or to save them for a time in the future they are useful against a new parasitic adversary, and then the cycle resumes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the common cold (typically caused by viruses like coronavirus or rhinovirus) does not &quot;compete&quot; with other infectious agents such as parasites. Viruses and parasites infect their hosts and cause disease through very different mechanisms. Viruses hijack their host's cellular machinery in order to replicate their DNA, proteins, etc. This usually results in cell death or abnormal proliferation. Parasites are largely <em>extracellular pathogens</em> (malaria being a notable exception) and cause disease through a variety of other mechanisms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings up something I've always wondered about. Can you get two different colds at the same time? Like two different cold viruses? Let's say one coworker has something that really hurts his throat and comes with a rough cough, while another has something more sinus related with a leaky nose... Can those two things fight each other in your body, as though there's only enough room for one in there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses are extremely simple, they are closer in design to rocks that when they land on their target are shaped in such a way as to cause their target through some mechanism to make similar rocks.
It's highly uncommon for viruses to be able to effect many different types of targets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this. I work on Toxoplasma which is classified as a blood borne pathogen related to malaria. There have definitely been reports of viruses infecting Toxoplasma in nature. Furthermore, anytime a parasite is outside of a host it is subject to the innate immune system which can passively mark the parasite as being foreign so that phagocytes and other immune cells can destroy the invader. This is especially easy in the blood where the innate immune system is well set up to patrol</p></div>		</li>
