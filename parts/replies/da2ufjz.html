			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't explain it well myself but I believe the fabric of space time is distorted by mass, like a bowling ball on a trampoline. So although light is massless it still must travel through space time, which is curved so the light curves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And to expand on that, spacetime is distorted by energy too. So you can distort spacetime by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_\(astrophysics\)" target="_blank">shining enough light &quot;on&quot; / &quot;into&quot; it</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't describe this phenomenon with classical mechanics (ie, the usual Newton's law of gravitation: F=GmM/r^2). General relativity is required to understand this, which describes gravity as a bending of space-time. Because of this, we see that light can be affected by gravity, because it is deflected by these deformations in space-time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, to put it another way, Light travels in straight lines through a curved space.  </p>
<p>For example, draw a straight line on a sheet of paper.  Then if you fold and bend the paper the line &quot;curves&quot; from our outside perspective, but in the &quot;space&quot; that is the sheet of paper, it remains straight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Relativity, gravity doesn't attract. Gravity bends space. This is how it affects massless phenomena-- by bending the space they travel through. </p></div>		</li>
