			<div class="markdown"><p>I once was at a zoo where a chipmunk had gotten into the rhino enclosure. This little guy darted past the rhino and that big guy jumped. Yeah. That two ton behemoth left the ground. Maybe the most bizarrely hilarious thing I’ve ever seen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually true, but not for the reason you think.</p>
<p>The reason being that their eyesight is not good. When they see a small moving thing on the ground, they can't tell the difference between a harmless mouse and a venomous snake. Better to err on the side of caution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not so sure about your fact. Elephants are supposed to see pretty clearly out to around 25 feet away and the can see colors (only 2 cones instead of 3 like humans, though). As smart as they are I'm sure they could make out a mouse VS a snake. They can recognize individual people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they react the same way to a snake? It seems safe to assume that they would and your explanation makes sense. But I really want to see an experiment comparing the two. Just to be sure that elephants aren't specifically afraid of mice for some other reason. It would definitely be strange if they only behaved that way with mice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This article states that humans are building over elephant migration routes and now groups of elephants are purposefully destroying houses. I surmise it's a coordinated but doomed effort to reclaim their land. </p></div>		</li>
