			<div class="markdown"><p>In German its -chen or -lein, depending on what part of Germany you are in. So &quot;Haus&quot; (house) would become &quot;Häuschen&quot; / &quot;Häuslein&quot;.</p>
<p>Fun fact: &quot;Mädchen&quot;, the regular modern German word for girl is derived from &quot;Maid&quot;, which is an old German word for woman, so we don't really have a word for girl, we just call them little women.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not as common in German as it is in Dutch though. In Dutch you could easily say something like &quot;huisje&quot; (small house) and I think it would be weird to say häuschen/hauslein(don't know which is correct)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is spanish, cuckolds are supposed to grow horns on their heads. That's why if you are called [insert random animal with horns], you are called a cuckold. </p>
<p>We also use the typical heavy-metal hand gesture of horns as an insult. Like middle-fingering but calling you cuckold. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the rules, the diminuitive of &quot;bull&quot; would be &quot;bully&quot;... hmm... perhaps &quot;small, cute bull&quot; just doesn't work as a concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cubans are somewhat well known for not always using the literal correct word for things. There are a lot of phrases/words that have entirely different meanings for Cubans. </p>
<p>For example, bus is guagua instead of autobus because in Cuba the ambulances were recycled as public buses and the sound &quot;gua-gua&quot; is the sound of a siren. Also peas are guisantes in most places except cuba where they are petite pois because the only peas sold had french labels. And then there is papaya...which is a fruit and euphemism for vagina. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Xiao is used when speaking to any age group to make a word cuter/ friendlier/ more polite, word doubling is specifically geared towards babies/ kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might just be a northern thing, but there's also the highly controversial 儿, right? Like 鸟儿 and 小猫儿. Though I think it gets used quite a lot especially in Beijing, so maybe it's not so much a diminutive form.</p></div>		</li>
