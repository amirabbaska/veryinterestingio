			<div class="markdown"><p>By the way, poop is full of bacteria and so is your ass, so you don't have to worry about the sterility of the things you put in there.</p>
<p>Also the toilette paper lost its sterilization immediately afterwards as it's not produced in a sterile room, it's not shipped in air tight containers, and it's not handled with sterile gloves.</p></div>		</li>
