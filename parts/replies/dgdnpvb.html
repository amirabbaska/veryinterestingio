			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer below by /u/SuperbOwlSundae is probably a more chemically accurate picture.  Also, people are right that I should have described a substance like honey or syrup as a <em>colloid</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many alcohols have a &quot;syrup&quot; transition as they approach freezing temperature.   The fluid is (for our purposes) just one, uniform molecule, and yet we still see the viscosity OP is asking about.</p>
<p>Compare the behaviours of pure methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc. as they approach freezing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, many pure sugars do the same.</p>
<p>I'm not a chemist, so I'm asking if you can verify my line of thinking for me.  Pure substances that experience a more &quot;syrupy&quot; transition are composed of larger or longer molecules.  (Sucrose being larger than glucose and fructose.  I imagine menthol [C10H19OH] would experience higher viscocity before freezing than methanol)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't there sugars or carbohydrates in there contributing to that?  And if not, it's still a hydrocarbon, right? So it is just one molecule, but still has this property of increasing viscosity before changing state.</p>
<p>I dunno, I'm no chemist - you probably know the right answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. </p>

<p>That's OP's question, basically: why would a hydrocarbon have this property but water does not?</p></div>		</li>

<p>those other things which have a gradual viscosity change would be called something different</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid#Classification" target="_blank">colloids</a>. Depending on what is mixing with what, they can be subdivided into: sol, aerosol, solid aerosol, foam, emulsion, solid foam, gel, or emulsion. </p></div>		</li>
