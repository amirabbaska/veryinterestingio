			<p>oh my goodness, i just got thru doing an audiobook called : <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Your-Inner-Fish-Journey-3-5-Billion-Year/dp/0307277453" target="_blank">Your Inner Fish A Journey Into the 3.5-Billion-Year History of the Human Body - Neil Shubin</a>  .... <br><br>Dr.  Shubin is one of the co-discoverers of that fish.  I loved the book. So much made sense by the end of the book.  <br><br>(btw, after i finished the book, i was thinking. there isn't going to be another person who understands this book that i can talk to, and 3 days later it gets mentioned)<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Hah! I had the pleasure of sitting through one of Dr. Shubin's talks when the whole Tiktaalik business was first hitting the press.  It's definitely cool stuff.  Have you checked out the 'Inner Fish' Nova special that was on PBS?</p>		</li>

			<p>No i didnt know about that series.<br>I had just finished the book the other day.  It was a different type of subject than i normally do.  <br><br>And because I did that, i had seen it at the library so i ran over to see if they still had it on the shelf.  Strangely enough an audio lecture course called <a href="http://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/origins-of-life.html" target="_blank">Origins of Life</a> was still there.  So i grabbed it and started.  <br><br>I normally just do physics / astronomy / history.  But i have to say with his understanding shared with me, i think this is going to be a little less dry.  :)</p>		</li>

			<p>You know, that's the really cool thing about paleontology.  It has that history aspect about it like astronomy or (duh) history.  While the former and latter help us understand our cosmic and human perspectives, respectively, paleontology elucidates our place on the planet as living things, not just people.  And I think that was a big part of the goal of Dr. Shubin's book: get people more broadly interested in a deep evolutionary perspective that goes beyond Neanderthals and dinosaurs.  I'm glad you're hooked!  There's a lot of interesting things waiting for you.  Who knows, maybe one day you'll even open up Darwin's On the Origin of Species...?  I found it much more readable than I thought I would, and incredibly illuminating despite its age.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;Who knows, maybe one day you'll even open up Darwin's On the Origin of Species...? <br><br>I own a leather bound copy i bought from my library for 1$.<br>I like to creep out the xtains by bringing to work and read sometimes.  (I do get some serious looks when they see the title 'is that the monkey book?&quot; )<br><br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Haha that's awesome.  That's a steal.  How much have you read?  A couple chapters are kind of like reading a laundry list, but most of it I found really interesting and approachable.</p>		</li>

			<p>When I have time!  I go through phases of reading nonstop and then not at all.  I'm in a bit of a &quot;not at all&quot; phase at the moment that I'm hoping to break.  Any recommendations?</p>		</li>

			<p>yeah, i know the feeling.  <br>and its not helped that i work overnight and am allowed to listen to my bluetooth while i work.  i've done over 200 books in the last 2-3 yrs.  about 40 - 40ish hour college lectures.   my library has a really nice collection of The Teaching Company stuff.  And unlimited inter-library loans if you're a 'friend' (60$) of the library.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Any recommendations?<br><br>hmm.<br>ok, i do lots of space sci fi, recently i've been hooked on the [Christopher G Nuttall - The Empire's Corps] (<a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Empires-Corps-Audiobook/B00KTNEARM" target="_blank">http://www.audible.com/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/The-Empires-Corps-Audiobook/B00KTNEARM</a>) i think its #11 that releases tomorrow and i cancel Audible.  <br><br>Some classic sci fi.  I had 2 Audible credits, bought <a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Classics/Journey-to-the-Center-of-the-Earth-A-Signature-Performance-by-Tim-Curry-Audiobook/B003ZFO3FA/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1456181847&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Jules Verne Journey to the Center of the Earth</a>  .. hell yeah i got the read by Tim Curry version ! <br><br>Thinking as I write this, I do have a book i recommend often.  In fact the butchering of the facts by a current hollywood movie is one of the stories in this book.  <br><br><br><a href="http://www.audible.com/pd/Travel-Adventure/Desperate-Journeys-Abandoned-Souls-Audiobook/B002UZLEJY/ref=a_search_c4_1_1_srTtl?qid=1456182061&amp;amp;sr=1-1" target="_blank">Desperate Journeys, Abandoned Souls: True Stories of Castaways and Other Survivors</a><br><br>The story of the real person <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Glass" target="_blank">Hugh Glass</a> from movie The Revanant is in there.  The real story is crazier than the movie.  </p>		</li>
