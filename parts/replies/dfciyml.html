<p>Look up &quot;iodine clock&quot; for a really cool looking experiment you most likely have the ingredients for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, H2O2 and isopropyl alcohol will disrupt the healing if you keep applying it. Why would anyone use any of these more than once (to initially disinfect the wound)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, you don't.  But the question was about mixing, so just an example would be mixing h2o2 and iso alcohol.  Both great at cleaning, but if you mix them you destroy the h2o2 by reacting it, and you make the alcohol much weaker by oxidizing it.</p>
<p>You can use other things to clean wounds long term, but those are generally non reactive just because of what they are.  Like you can put iodine on a wound, and then put neosporin on it right afterwards and nothing will happen.  </p>
<p>Or you can clean a wound with dilute Epsom salts, magnesium sulfate, and then use something else afterwards.  But you don't generally mix things like chemical cleaners.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By shaking, I think you released the Oxygen from H2O2 and created H2O and a free O.  My organic chem is rusty, so I'm not sure if the shaking alone would cause the isopropyl alcohol to react with the free O to form an aldehyde (propionaldehyde), which is an irritant to the skin.  I doubt you would have formed any large quantity, but that could explain the slippery feeling.  But I doubt that the resultant mixture was H2O2 and isoproply alcohol, the shaking would have released the oxygen and at the very least it was then water and isopropyl alcohol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that was my whole point! If you mix h2o2 and iso, the h2o2 breaks down and the iso oxidizes, turning them into different things entirely. Theoretically.</p>
<p>Though just shaking h2o2 alone doesn't make it react. You can go shake a bottle of hydrogen peroxide and it will still work as intended. The fact that it's mixed with iso is what breaks it apart, shaking it just makes the reaction happen way faster and more completely. And you're correct, to form an aldehyde you'd need a catalyst, so it's most likely just producing a tiny bit of ketone, like acetone. Though that also really needs a catalyst, so in reality it's, just like you said, creating watered down iso. Though even without a catalyst it may have created small quantities of lactic and/or pyruvic acids if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>Here's some interesting alcohol oxidation with peroxide articles if you're into that kinda stuff. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, some of this is coming back to me.  And I must admit, it makes my head hurt a bit.  But acetone and water - that shouldn't feel slippery on the skin, should it?  That, I find curious.  Acids feel slippery, acetone always made my skin feel dry.  I'm not questioning your comment, I'm just wondering about the slippery feeling thing.</p></div>		</li>
