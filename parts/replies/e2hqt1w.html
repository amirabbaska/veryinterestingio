<p>Things like knowledge and cognitive function are multifaceted and cannot be affected by simply introducing a serotonin blocker</p>

<p>This is true, but we do know that temporary boosts in &quot;cognitive function&quot; are possible using stimulants like amphetamines or GABA inhibitors like modafinil because they increase the frequency that individual nerves send signals by increasing the available neurotransmitters. </p>
<p>Of course we also know that long term use of these substances can lead to physiological dependence and addiction and leave the user worse off than before, but if we had a way to safely boost neurotransmitter activity without these side effects (which we do not) that might allow for increases in &quot;cognitive function&quot; in the long term. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about common nootropics? They are poorly studied and effects seem to vary a lot depending on the individual (probably for the same reason that brain chemistry/neurotransmitter profile can vary a lot too) but their effect is very real.</p>
<p>I do not understand why they have not been studied more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You said it yourself, they have not been studied thoroughly yet. Medical research is a <em>slow</em> process, and the time between good, demonstrative, peer reviewed research on a treatment and that treatment becoming mainstream practice is even slower, sometimes decades. </p>
<p>As for why, I’m not personally familiar for any specific reason for nootropics. If you take them and it works for you, great! Even if you’re just experiencing a placebo effect, there’s no reason to stop unless you notice side effects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to being poorly studied, the simple fact is that most nootropics either don't work or have similar side effects to stimulants.</p>
<p>This is because neurotransmitters are regulated by strong negative feedback loops, so artificial increases in their number invariably result in lowered production of them within the brain. </p>
<p>Modafinil is (kind of) an exception to this because GABA is the least toxic neurotransmitter and thus controlled by a feedback loop that isn't as strong as dopamine or serotonin, but it is also the least studied of commonly used stimulants and still has serious risk of dependence and addiction if used consistently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several non-minuscule differences that we know about, such as gray matter volume and gray/white ratio, as well as neuron firing energy efficiency and speed.</p>
<p>We can't currently change these after birth though, as they seem to be down to genetics, as long as you aren't nutrient deficient or have heavy metal poisoning or something.</p>
<p><em>The Neuroscience of Intelligence (Cambridge Fundamentals of Neuroscience in Psychology)</em> is a great textbook on the topic.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, those are just stimulants that increase the speed of neurotransmitter transaction speeds. Quantity does not equal quality in this case. Also the side effects of those drugs outweigh the positives in most cases, making them poor choices to study increases in intelligence with.</p></div>		</li>
