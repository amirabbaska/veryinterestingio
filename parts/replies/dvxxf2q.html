			<div class="markdown"><p>U/Sand_Trout is right, most submarines can hover but it's a pain unless the ship has an auto-hovering system like a Trident.  In general the sub maintains a slight negative buoyancy (meaning with no other forces acting on it the sub will slowly start to sink) so that when it's operating at periscope depth it's less likely to broach and give its position away.  So that is why it needs to maintain forward velocity so that the planes have water moving over them and they can effectively control the sub's depth.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I was friends with a guy who served on a nuke boat in the 80s and thats what he said. He especially pointed out the scene in hunt for red October where the two subs just sat motionless in the water. and said there was no way.</p>
<p>He said when they surface and allow sailors to jump off and swim it still had to move forward. </p>
<p>He told me several stories of life on a boat and it didn't sound like much fun.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't miss the job but I miss being surrounded by and working with high quality people (for the most part of course, there are always exceptions).  It's a cliche but that doesn't make it not true.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone who has stood throttleman watch many times during swim calls, I can say that this is definitely not true.</p>
<p>The shaft is rotated every couple of minutes just enough to keep it from bowing due to the steam heat.  </p>
<p>Also even very slow movement of a couple of knots would cause the swimmers to have to constantly try and keep up with the boat.  An average person swims about 2 mph</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how negatively buoyant the boat is.  In other words, the more seawater the crew allows into the auxiliary tanks and trim tanks the &quot;heavier&quot; the boat is and the faster it would sink if it wasn't moving and using the planes to keep its depth.  And the lower the boat goes the more naturally negatively buoyant the ship gets because the hull is being compressed (so the same weight of submarine and crew is occupying a smaller space = more dense = more negatively buoyant compared to water that is essentially incompressible).</p>
<p>In general, you don't make the boat very negatively buoyant.  Just enough so the tendency of the boat is to go down instead of up if the helmsman/planesman or pilot/copilot make an error so the boat doesn't broach.</p></div>		</li>
