<p>Consider also that when many animals sleep they make use of their fat stores to maintain energy homeostasis. Pretty much all animals with nervous systems engage in sleep or a sleep-like process.</p>

<p>This just me think about hibernating mammals and how they obviously must be able to use it to fuel the brain. I probably should have noticed that myself.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most animals have smaller brains than we do. Lipid metabolism generates a small amount of glucose from the glycerol backbone, that might very well be enough to sustain their brains without the need for ketosis.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that the conclusion is wrong, just that hibernation might not be a definite indication that ketosis is possible in organisms</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dolphins and some birds seem to sleep with only parts of their brain at a time, using the other parts to continue swimming or flying, maybe not exactly the same as not sleeping though. Arthropods also don't exactly sleep in the way we do, their bodies are quite different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has a collection of arthropods as pets (~10 species of tarantulas) -  they may not sleep exactly like higher order animals, but it can be pretty obvious when they are sleeping... and you learn it is best not to rudely awaken them from sleep. A gently tap or nudge on the leg and then let them wake up is much safer than full on abrupt awakenings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would imagine the same could be said about whales? Meaning they don't entirely shut off their brain to sleep because they need to remember to breathe rather than doing it involuntarily?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting... I'd never thought about which animals sleep like we do, as opposed to sleeping with other parts of their brain. I wonder when/ how this evolved, and if it evolved independently in these lineages. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worth noting is that heart cell mitochondria undergo a autophagy &amp; regeneration, during embryonic development, that shifts carbon source preference from glucose to fatty acids. Without that shift of preference in energy source, at least in mice, it's lethal. Different organs have difference preferences of carbon sources for their energy needs. Additionally short chain fatty acid metabolism has an interesting role in the body as compared to medium and long chain fatty acids. That's a whole topic worth talking about in and of itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert, not consider myself a certified scientist so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Short Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA) have an interesting feedback effect - they're produced by your gut flora fermenting fiber, they make it from your GI tract into your bloodstream in a different mechanism than glucose, and they don't cause an insulin spike. In my unqualified and certainly biased historical observation, that last effect is the most important - proper (and improper) insulin response controls or effects <strong>every important system in the human body</strong> and something that makes it function better (ie less insulin resistance) is <em>fundamental</em> to good health (it's one of the reasons exercise is so beneficial). </p>
<p>A good paper on the importance of SCFA <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3735932/" target="_blank">is here</a>. Be aware, it's quite the read through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot find the Nature news article that touched on the subject first, but it essentially detailed that a knock of of a specific gene prevented/interrupted the fetal heart cells mitochondria, that prefer glucose as a carbon source, from undergoing autophagy &amp; being regenerated as 'adult' heart cell mitochondria that prefers fatty acid oxidation and it lead to a fatal outcome. </p>
<p>As to why that occurs I ended up finding this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3387529/" target="_blank">paper</a> about lipid metabolism of the heart and it states </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The fetal heart operates under low oxygen pressure and primarily depends on glucose and lactate for ATP generation, whereas the adult heart utilizes FAs but conserves the ability to switch other substrates. Older animals and humans use relatively less FAs and more glucose.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pointing to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randle_cycle" target="_blank">Randal Cycle</a> as a quality of the nutritional needs of the heart. The paper suggests around 60-80% of the energy source of the heart is lipid based. </p>
<p>If I had to wager a guess having the heart muscles are reliant on fat, a more energy packed, long term storage &amp; structural class of compounds, over that of glycogen, which is more short-term energy storage and less abundant. That it's best to have the heart reliant on an energy source that is reliable, even in times of poor nutritional intake, and not competing with muscles to use glucose when it comes down to it. As to the why - the paper touches on that a bit more. </p></div>		</li>
