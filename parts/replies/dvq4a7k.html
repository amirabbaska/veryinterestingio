			<div class="markdown"><p>Up to the comma part I have no issue with, but &quot;we can rule out some inherited property from a singular event&quot; is hard to swallow.<br />
In a broadest sense everything in the Universe, and Universe itself are &quot;inherited properties&quot; of a singular event (The Big Bang).</p></div>		</li>

But as we’ve seen through the centuries if we didn’t pursue comic interest, things like the earth NOT being the center of the universe or being flat would still be arguable. If galaxies are revolving, what are they revolving around? Their respective black holes?</p></div>		</li>
