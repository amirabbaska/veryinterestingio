			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, this makes a lot of sense! I like to buy plants small anyway because I find it more gratifying to watch them grow over time, but I never fully understood the benefits of increasing pot size gradually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Super welcome! I enjoy sharing my passion for Horticulture so more then happy to help :)</p>
<p>I really love to see my plants grow from so tiny too, sometimes I get impatient and want a larger one and then my budget reminds me that small is the only option lol besides when you kill it by accident it's less money lost. (I usually get super sad though when I get them small and they die years an years later by accident because I invested so much time and love into them) :)</p>
<p>Also fun fact: some plants <em>like</em> to be tight in a pot. Succulents (and cacti) are definitely one of those types. Orchids too - honestly for house plants it is best to wait until they're about  escaping the pot because they're more &quot;efficient&quot; in a smaller space, you may have to water more over time but at least you won't be over doing it. Most soils break down over time that is usually a reason to repot and why you wouldn't jump to a big pot. So I guess I mean you should repot every year or so with most houseplants but only to change the soil (especially if you have hard water), not to necessarily change the pot size :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question for you...</p>
<p>I got a Diffenbachia early this year as a first plant because the internet told me that it was a good starter plant for indoors that doesn't require brains (as a caretaker, not as a meal).</p>
<p>Apparently I have neither to offer, because when indoors my Dumb Cane just gives up on life. I keep my house at 75F, as far as I'm aware (I don't fully trust thermostats) and I was under the impression that would be OK for the plant. It would sit in the front of multi-windowed French doors on a table with plenty indirect sunlight. It's the brightest spot in the house.</p>
<p>When I put it outside, directly on the other side of the French doors, it goes from withered, droopy pale to a deep, healthy green after a few days and new leaves start to appear. The plant literally looks freakin' HAPPY outdoors. Watering stays the same in either case and the soil moisture seems the same in either environment.</p>
<p>Because of this, I now assume that the inside of my house hates plants and it's an inhospitable environment for them. What with correlation not equating to causation, I'm just wondering if you have any advice.</p>
<p>TL;DR:<br />
I don't know how to plants. Help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wanted to ask tho, my dad threw a random seed from a fruit he ate (he can't remember what he ate that day) into my pot and it germinated in some obscure corner along with the original resident.</p>
<p>So I transplanted it into a small pot and the seedling suddenly seem to stop growing. Is this a sign of shock? If so, do I just ensure the soil is moist enough, that it has enough sunlight and just wait out the shock?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment reminds me that I recently had an umbrella plant that had been kept outside by its previous owners, and had curl grubs and onion grass throughout the soil. After trying and trying to fight them all, I eventually took the whole thing outside and completely rinsed off the root ball to make sure I got the entirety of the curl grubs and onion grass away. Then I put it all in with the highest quality potting soil I could find. </p>
<p>I've been a little worried because it has been looking just a little bit sad lately, but it's helpful to remember that it has to adjust and will probably get better soon!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, after a matter of time you learn to &quot;read&quot; your plant and know what it wants. Discoloration in leaves overwatering/wanting more. My house plant started off small and its on its third pot now. Reasearch your plant though. For mine when it's growing slower than usual that means I need to upgrade its pot depending on height/thickness of main stem or replace its soil with a bag of potting mix so it gets more nutrients. Changing soil is key. I do it about every 2 years</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would love r/succulents &amp; r/houseplants ! I've learned most plants like to be pot bound, although they have unlimited space in the wild it's easier to control their watering needs.</p>
<p>Any plant should have drainage, in the wild the water gets soaked up but in a big pot the water has nowhere to go and the soil will stay moist for much longer leaving the plant susceptible to root rot  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could be wrong but I think the difference might be the plants are adapted to it and it is constantly refreshed water, not wet soil which leads to root rot on plants </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because of mold. Water logged soil gets moldy, which is what kills the roots. Mold doesn't grow on just straight up water though </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question that may or may not be associated with this -</p>
<p>I have a San Marzano Tomato, a Green Pepper, and a few Jalapenos in large pots (3 foot diameter by 2 foot deep) on my back patio (townhome complex). </p>
<p>Recently, the leaves on the jalapenos have gone from a deep green to a yellow green. They still seem to be producing peppers just fine though... and the tomato I learned I need to prune back (I didn't realize it was an indeterminate plant... whoops!) so it had sort of grown wildly out of control before I figured that out, but it had some serious blossom end rot issues before I found a rot-stop spray with a high calcium content.</p>
<p>I had used a &quot;moisture control&quot; potting soil (Miracle Grow I believe was the brand) and... have honestly <em>not</em> been impressed - I feel like it doesn't retain moisture very well, and if I dont' go out daily to water, the tomato especially starts to wilt.</p>
<p>Now, the tomato and pepper share a pot (which I am NOT going to do next year as the tomato is seriously crowding the pepper) but... any advice on avoiding some of these issues? I'm looking at possibly building a 3 foot wide by 8 foot long by 3 foot deep planter box to use next year, instead of the pots. Would that give more &quot;room' and help? I feel like being in the pots may have stunted them (one of the other pots had a zucchini that did very well, produced a bunch of nice sized zucchini, but then died off - it was growing in a very odd pattern and looked like it overextended its root structure?, the other pot has the 3 jalapenos in question)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely google your plants like &quot;growing tomatoes (insert your state) .edu&quot; and you'll get the best information for your location. </p>
<p>In general tomatoes and peppers are <strong>heavy</strong> feeders and need lots of water. If a pot is drying out really quick -it's soil composition is most likely lacking as in there isn't enough viable material to help the plant hold on to water. Yellowing is usually a sign of lack of nutrients in in these plants. </p>
<p>One of the best things to do for vegetable gardening is have a very deep box or pot. They say you can do stuff in only 16 inches but long term and for vigorous growers like tomatoes and peppers it's absolutely ridiculous. Example some of the best veggie boxes I've seen have been almost 3 ft tall. </p>
<p>But every climate is different- for here it's definitely necessary (FL) and very often veggies in the heat of summer will wilt in the hottest part of the day and also slow in flower production. Having not enough organic material in a pot though will cause you needing to water every day. </p>
<p>In my original comment I was mostly talking about house plants but hope this helps! </p></div>		</li>
