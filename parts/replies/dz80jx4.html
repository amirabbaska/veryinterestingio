			<div class="markdown"><p>that's &quot;divergence&quot;, not scattering.</p>
<p>A laser, if you point it through a milky white diffuser, scatters in every direction.  Xrays don't do that in human tissue- they either penetrate without changing direction, or stop when they hit bone or metal.  They don't redirect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have a source for that last claim? I don't think there is any evidence of dental xrays being associated with increased risk of brain cancer. All of the major international organisations' (BEIR, UNSCEAR, etc.) guidelines suggest that there isn't any solid evidence for increased cancer risk for doses under 100 mSv. The dose from a full dental xray exam is in the order of 100 uSv. They do, however, recommend the use of the Linear No Threshold model in order to remain conservative for radiation protection purposes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some studies link benign brain tumours like that. But a benign brain tumour is still a pretty serious thing. This study found a statistically significant connection with brain cancer:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone has the full report I would love to take a look at it. The whole article seems super shady. How can they see a statistical significant correlation when the cohort is that small? </p>
<p>If there was conclusive evidence for increased brain tumor with dental x-rays, it would be groundbreaking.</p></div>		</li>
