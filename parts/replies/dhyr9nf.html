			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting that there is no record of the prescriptions. Here in Australia every time a doctor prescribes narcotics they have to call a government agency, cite their unique number and prescription pad as well as the Medicare number of the patient and the reason. They are then given a code which the pharmacist has to use to be able to dispense the medicine. </p></div>		</li>

<p>wouldn't they have to comply with DEA rules for manufacturing controlled substances?  At least domestically, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From the way I understand your question, in the eyes of the DEA, manufacturers can make as much or as little as they want depending on supply and demand. Because the FDA has approved opiates for legal use per a physician's orders, manufacturers will then produce as much as needed to keep up with the prescriptions. So the manufacturers are legally within full compliance. Is that what you were asking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, they do have to track shipments and are obligated to report oddly sized orders.. they've just had a very spotty record of doing so. </p>
<p>The Washington Post did a quick write up on West Virginia currently suing drug manufacturers for not reporting odd shipments.</p>
<p>Relevant highlight: </p>
<p>Between 2007 and 2012 &quot;Cabell County, in the heart of the state, was flooded with nearly 40 million tablets of painkillers in that time. With a population of 96,000, thatâ€™s more than 400 pills for every adult and child.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you have a question about it in particular?</p>
<p>In this case we do know how many pills were sent to these pharmacies and it does relay how severe the abuse is in the area, but that was after a targeted investigation. The information wasn't available prior to that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So they can find out the information which means some federal judge could conceivably force pharma companies to make all this data publicly available right? You made it seem like actually knowing how bad things are would be impossible.</p></div>		</li>
