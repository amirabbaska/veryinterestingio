			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but you're almost right. Speed of sound is relative to the medium of stuff the sound is happening in. So for example, if the wind is blowing towards you, any noise traveling towards you is traveling at 343 m/s + windspeed and any traveling away is 343 m/s - windspeed <em>relative to you</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The speed of sound depends on the medium it is traveling in, not the speed of the emitter. If the speed of sound were always some fixed value + the speed of the emitter, the act of &quot;breaking the sound barrier&quot; would never happen, as the sound of a traveling object would always be faster than the object itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems to be saying that the speed of light is relative to the object that creates it and views it. I think, lol. <a href="http://www.einstein-online.info/elementary/specialRT/speed_of_light" target="_blank">http://www.einstein-online.info/elementary/specialRT/speed_of_light</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>No, all dynamic will be different. Supersonic gas dynamic is the completely separate field. It includes shock waves, Mach cone just to mention a few.</p></div>		</li>
