			<div class="markdown"><p>Uh, getting your A&amp;P does not require 4 years of school, and the classes aren't $80,000 per year.  Most programs I've seen are between 14 and 24 months, and under $10,000.  And most schools I have seen have military transition programs where they give you credit for knowledge and time put in in the military (in fact, I think the FAA has provisions exempting military personnel in a variety of MOSs from needing to take a course all.  But you still need to pass the tests so the program tailored to getting you to pass is helpful.)</p>
<p>Unless you're talking about getting avionics certified on top of the A&amp;P, which I admit I have no idea about.  (Or are from another country with different requirements.)  But with the A&amp;P you would be able to touch the aircraft, have a stable job, and be earning money that could be put towards continuing education.  But a lot of the guys I work with are ex-military so the transition seems to work for a lot of people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm sorry the transition out wasn't easy for you, and I hope you're doing well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your service.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Stable job&quot; and aviation rarely belong in the same sentence. A big part of the industry these days is based on contracting and temp work, all it takes is a little bit of a hint that the economy is losing steam for mass layoffs to arrive. Right now things are alright, in fact aircraft mechanics are in high demand because with retiring mechanics and a lack of young ones out of school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've worked for a couple different airlines, and from what I've seen good mechanics are in demand and able to move up in the world fairly quickly if they make a good impression.  The place I currently work has opened a couple new mx bases in the past year and converted another one from contract to regular employees.  (Though our heavies are all outsourced to another country).</p>
<p>The field is always going to be a little dicey.    Especially being at the mercy of fuel costs, people's leisure budgets, etc, and with regionals operating on a shoestring budget.  But we're in a good patch at the moment and hopefully that sustains for awhile.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I misspoke.  $10k a &quot;semester&quot;.  Most seem to he about $30k total around here.</p>
<p>If I could find one for $10k total I'd go for it immediately.  As it is I'm contemplating it.  I'd recoup the cost in a couple years time (if it were $10k it would be 6 months).  But my ultimate desire isn't really to be line maintenance - I'd be using it as a stepping stone to office type jobs that require or at least desire an A&amp;P.  And there's other similar jobs that don't require it.  So it's a matter of whether I want to spend the money and have more options available to me in the future, or not spend and continue building my career path without the A&amp;P and 3 years experience out there actually on the aircraft.  </p>
<p>Costing $10k vs $30k would make that decision a lot easier.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>No company will look at military time as useful.  They want to see degrees and time served in the civilian world.</p></div>		</li>
