			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. Getting rid of ‘blue light’ in the light source with things like the night mode settings in tablets and phones that make them slightly yellowish.  There is still a small amount of UV(blue light) that will filter through the screen and it can still impact your rhythm. </p>
<p>You can also get contacts and glasses that have a UV filter on them that help. I have both prescription(clear) and non-prescription(yellow tinted w/a slight magnification) glasses that have a UV filter to prevent TVs, Monitors, Tablets, and phones from doing this. My contacts also have a tiny amount of UV blocking in them, but not enough to really help.</p>
<p>UV filtered lenses also help because you blink less while looking at a screen and the UV light doesn’t trigger your pupils to constrict like regular visible spectrum light does. Staring at a screen can end up causing all kinds of issue staring with dry and sore eyes and going all the way up to macular degeneration and blindness from over exposure.</p>
<p>If you have CFL or LED lights in your home, it’s also best to stick with the warm(slightly yellow) 2000k-3499k color temperature bulbs. Both work by using a high energy UV light source to make a fluorescent coating glow and the higher color temperature bulbs work by filtering less of the UV. </p>
<p>Long story short, UV is just as dangerous for your eyes as it is for your skin. Always wear UV blocking sunglasses outside, polarized are best, and try to use UV blocking lenses when working on a screen frequently or for extended periods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Especially the blue light present in sunlight and lcd-screens, like our phones. This is received by special receptors in our eyes, which are there to see if there is blue light present and send this information to other parts of our brain to stimulate or inhibit melatonin extraction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Melatonin builds up as your exposure to light decreases (typically as the sun goes down). A small area of your brain right above where your optic nerves cross (optic chasm) called your suprachiasmatic nucleus continually samples light exposure throughout the day. As exposure to light decreases, the suprachiasmatic nucleus increases production of melatonin. While melatonin is an important chemical in maintaining circadian rhythm, it only really functions as the starting gun for the sleep race. Adenosine buildup in the brain is what actually causes the sleep pressure or sleepiness feeling. Caffeine blocks the receptors for adenosine in the brain, thus its effects and allowing us to feel more alert. While caffeine may be good for keeping us awake for a little longer, it doesn't actually clear the sleepiness causing neurochemicals from your brain, so once the caffeine wears off, you crash because of all of the buildup of adenosine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that serotonin has implications in torpor as well, down regulating metabolic rate (decrease thyroid activity), increased insulin resistance and obesity, decreased conversion of WAT to BAT, and therefore lower body temp which is implicated in drowsiness, sleep, and hibernation.
