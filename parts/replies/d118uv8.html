			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can. My answer was a bit ambiguous. Barbecues indoors or in tents regularly kill people. That is due to incomplete combustion, efficient combustion will produce carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Putting your head in the oven used to be a common suicide technique, coal gas was largely carbon monoxide (as is wood gas). It doesn't work anymore here (UK),  natural gas ismostly methane. You might asphyxiate eventually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Barbecue is charcoal which is very impure carbon so it still emits deadly carbon monoxide and consumes oxygen. Do not use unventilated barbecues indoors.  All smokers inhale carbon monoxide in small quantities that will not kill you today. </p></div>		</li>
