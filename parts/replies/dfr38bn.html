			<div class="markdown"><p>Just too add to it (I have worked as a dishwasher in a restaurant several times) - when using one at home, your plates often stand there for longer times, letting the leftovers dry in, if a dish on one of the kitchens i have worked in is standing for a long time, it is standing for half a minute, and then getting rinsed before being thrown in (some places I have worked there where literally a chance, that if you sat down at a table, and the table next to you just finished their meal, you would get the same dish, we actually don't have tons of them - they break all the time so yir) </p>
<p>Edit - and since I do not have a dishwasher at home I am not sure about this part but the temperature too, damn have I burned my hands in restaurants, if you leave the dishes in the washer for something like ten sec, they are literally dry when you take them out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>is this why sometimes the plates are hot when they serve you, that it was just washed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add to the explanation.</p>
<p>As well as intense pressure and tons of water, the water is <em>ludicrously</em> hot and often accompanied by very strong detergent. The dishes are cleaned while &quot;fresh&quot; so no food is really dried on there. Finally, the guy operating the dishwasher scrubs anything that looks like it might be a problem.</p>
<p>Do this little experiment for a physical demonstration - next time you eat dinner, boil a kettle or something. Put your plate in the sink when you're finished and pour the boiling water over it from a decent height (safely, of course.) Even without soap your plate will be completely spotless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a very busy restaurant. We had a separate dishwasher for glasses/cups and this dishwasher hindered service so badly. </p>
<p>During extremely busy service, there'd be basically no time to allow the glasses to cool down from the intense heat of the water and since we weren't a huge establishment but had a LOT of customers, we didn't have enough glasses for peak period--there'd be like only 5-6 glasses left over if everyone in the restaurant had a glass already. So the turnover for these glasses was insane. Chuck the glasses into the dishwasher, clean for 2 minutes, take them out while they're PIPING HOT, bring them outside and fill them with ice water in attempts to cool them down enough to serve to customers. Unfortunately, this resulted in a lot of glasses breaking because of the extreme heat touching extreme cold, even just shattering when a customer would pick it up. Which would worsen the cycle because now we would have even LESS glasses and thus became even MORE frantic to get the water glasses out to customers. Combine that with burning your hands when handling the glasses. Was NOT fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry I'm a little late, but I would like to add that a good portion of dishwashers in low traffic restaurants use a version of dishwasher that's actually just a sanitizer, high traffic restaurants, like Applebee's and Chillies use a high performance dishwasher that actually washes dishes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only partially true. A commercial machine actually uses less water (about 1/5 or less, even accounting for one rack vs two tiers in a residential unit). Even then it can recycle that water through a filter several times.</p>
<p>Maybe most importantly, your dishwasher (probably) didn't cost 4000 to 6000 dollars. So you're not exactly comparing apples to apples. These machines are legally required to get water temp to 180* so that dishes are sanitized  They often include a booster heater just for this purpose. Because it gets so hot the steam is very hard to control which would in most cases destroy your countertops. </p>
<p>Numbers could all be up for a little debate based on models. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;are legally required to get water temp to 180°&quot; isn't true, well at least not everywhere. I worked at Beacon Hill Country Club and they had 2 machines, a low temperature 120°ish that took 3 minutes to cycle and used more detergent/sanitizing agents and the water had to be changed every few hours depending on how many cycles, and a high temperature 180° that took 30 seconds to cycle and used new water every time while only using a chlorine based sanitizer.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You generally have two options when it comes to dishwashers. You have high temp and also detergent dishwashers. Both types of washer utilize both detergent and hot water but not to the same...degree.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP meant the dishwashers that use hot water as the sanitizing cycle specifically. </p>
<p>Where I am, dishwashers must reach 71C (160F) during the final rinse cycle if hot water is the sanitizer, or use 50ppm chlorine or 200ppm quats. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take a dirty dish and put it through the machine, yeah it will leave junk on there. But that's not how it's supposed to work. You spray them down and wash them first then run them through the machine, just like at home. Most busy restaurants have a dishwasher doing this for most of their shift. </p></div>		</li>
