			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the whole story and missing a big part of galaxy formation. Galaxies were created when dark matter merged and clumped together which also pulls together huge amounts of atoms, creating regions dense enough for nuclear fusion to ignite again and again, giving birth to stars, more stars, and eventually galaxies.</p>
<p>While it is true galaxies continue to form today and even collide with one another, the cause and location of galaxy formation originates with the distribution of dark matter-- not from ordinary matter in the form of SMBH's. Dark matter can be thought of as the scaffolding of the universe. The visible matter we see collects inside this scaffolding in the form of galaxies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the effect of dark matter halos on galaxy formation imply that an SMBH can exist prior to the structure of a galaxy though? Appreciate that the model I've described isn't the whole story nonetheless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well in addition to dark matter clumping visible matter into areas that cause it to form galaxies, it also has an effect on how that visible matter interacts. Visible matter doesn't just interact with itself but also, to a much greater degree, with dark matter through gravity which alters how it goes about forming the galaxy.</p>
<p>I don't know, but it stands to reason since the rotation of galaxies is equal at all distances from the galactic center, instead of faster closer to the center, because of dark matter effects, (a gravitational energy force much more powerful than the effect of a SMBH), that this artifact of dark matter's effect on galaxy formation, and its huge gravitational power ability, tells me that the formation of the galaxy is rather indifferent to a visible matter created SMBH that is also formed at the center.  </p>
<p>A SMBH forms as a consequence of dark matter's galactic formation blueprint, and the magnitude of dark matter and its effects greatly outweighs the power of a SMBH to effect the formation of that galaxy.</p>
<p>So I guess I indirectly answered the OP's original question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big bang is not an explosion into space it is an expansion of space itself, so there is nothing to be radially symmetric around (or everything depending on your point of view). I think what you mean is why isn't dark matter and consequently regular matter distributed smoothly. It actually very smooth when you zoom out far enough. The clumpiness we see were tiny quantum fluctuations near the very beginning which with time and gravity became the clumpiness we see today. Measuring the cosmic microwave background radiation confirms this smoothness for the visible universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How much would our understanding of galaxy formation change if the dark matter theory turns out to be incorrect?  I'm a slightly well read layman that is wondering about the recent challenges to the dark matter theory based on the original sample size of background radiation measurements.  Thanks for your time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stars may come before supermassive black holes, but that doesn't mean that they become the stars that make up a galaxy. I would imagine that the formation of a supermassive black hole has a dramatic impact on nearby matter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would it?  It's not like the formation of a black hole increases the gravitational pull of the prior solar body.  It's only the continued accumulation of mass over a long period of time that I imagine would create a noticeable increase in the gravitational field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;nearby&quot; is probably not a good word to use when describing things of this scale.</p>
<p>The dramatic effect I mentioned wasn't as a result of gravity changes, but of the energy released in the formation of the SMBH.</p>
<p>When large amounts of matter come together, it creates a lot of heat. When matter on the scale of SMBHs comes together, it would create absolutely unconcievably enourmous amounts of heat, which would push things apart, and heat up other things, and do all sorts of things that we won't naturally think about.</p>
<p>Even normal supernovas are incredibly destructive. A nearby one, it's theorized, could wipe out life on earth. We can't even begin to understand how massive they are. A question I like (From XKCD) is &quot;Which would deliver more energy to your retina: a supernova seen from 1 AU, or a hydrogen bomb pressed against your eyeball? The supernova is brighter... by nine orders of magnitude.&quot; Supernovas occur at ~10-40 solar masses (wikipedia). The SMBH at the center of the Milky Way is about 4 million solar masses, so the energy released is going to be, quite literally, unimaginably enourmous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As above I'd suggest it might be possible for a galaxy to coalesce around an existing SMBH (given the variable density of galaxy filaments) and that this might form a part of the 'lifecycle' of certain galaxies.  However such an SMBH would itself have been formed from a galaxy or a very significant mass of stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but OP's question was specifically about galaxies with a SMBH, so I don't think that &quot;stars form before black holes&quot; answers the question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So where do quasars fit into it? Thought it went. Super massive black hole forms. Feeds. Heats quasar. Feeds till the jets from black holes poles get so big they push material back from hole. Stops feeding them behind cooling and then galaxy begins at that cooling point?  </p>
<p>Maybe galaxies are cyclical? I always thought saying something was x amount of solar masses was done mostly because it's relatable to us. Because in all of my astronomy courses it's only used to see who knows how much a solar mass is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quasars form after SMBH's do (well technically a Quasar is a form of SMBH) but a significant structure of stars should exist before the SMBH does. That doesn't stop a galaxy evolving further as a consequence of a Quasar cooling and changing as you've outlined, however I don't believe that a Quasar would pre-date a galaxy any more than an SMBH would.</p></div>		</li>
