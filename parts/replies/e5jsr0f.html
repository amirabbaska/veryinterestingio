			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't want blood sugar spikes basically, so the lower the glycemic index of your meal (the longer it takes to digest and be converted into glucose) the better. Eating straight simple carbohydrates (e.g. bread, white rice, potatoes, sugar or corn syrup in any form) is the absolute worst. Especially via sugary drinks like soda. </p>
<p>Protein and fats take longer to digest, and complex carbs (e.g. whole grains) are still better than simple. </p>
<p>Tl;dr your doctor is correct, just adding more info. </p></div>		</li>
