			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, this was a major reason why the Toyota F1 effort failed. First they had to pay an absolute fortune - the budget was $450m p.a. by the end, the largest in F1 - to  hundreds of employees with any kind of F1 experience to move to Cologne in Germany. They recruited some guys from German sportscar teams, but a large chunk came from that British cluster and they paid over the odds.</p>
<p>Second the ones that moved weren't the most experienced, just the most willing to relocate. They never had a really first class designer on the team for example.</p>
<p>They made other mistakes, like driver selection, but the location was a key issue from day one. Red Bull learned from that.</p></div>		</li>
