			<div class="markdown"><p>(Then-)Google's Marissa Mayer in 2007 said:</p>
<p>&quot;Whether or not free-411 is a profitable business unto itself is yet to be seen. I myself am somewhat skeptical. The reason we really did it is because we need to build a great speech-to-text model ... that we can use for all kinds of different things, including video search.</p>
<p>The speech recognition experts that we have say: If you want us to build a really robust speech model, we need a lot of phonemes, which is a syllable as spoken by a particular voice with a particular intonation. So we need a lot of people talking, saying things so that we can ultimately train off of that. ... So 1-800-GOOG-411 is about that: Getting a bunch of different speech samples so that when you call up or weâ€™re trying to get the voice out of video, we can do it with high accuracy.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
