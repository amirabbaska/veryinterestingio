			<p>(Then-)Google's Marissa Mayer in 2007 said:<br><br>&quot;Whether or not free-411 is a profitable business unto itself is yet to be seen. I myself am somewhat skeptical. The reason we really did it is because we need to build a great speech-to-text model ... that we can use for all kinds of different things, including video search.<br><br>The speech recognition experts that we have say: If you want us to build a really robust speech model, we need a lot of phonemes, which is a syllable as spoken by a particular voice with a particular intonation. So we need a lot of people talking, saying things so that we can ultimately train off of that. ... So 1-800-GOOG-411 is about that: Getting a bunch of different speech samples so that when you call up or weâ€™re trying to get the voice out of video, we can do it with high accuracy.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>Wish they had gotten more people with lisps. Sometimes I can't even use any of these. </p>		</li>

			<p>Speech recognition ought to listen for the words &quot;I have a lithpth&quot; and proceed to consider th's as potential s's thenceforth. </p>		</li>

			<p>Other google services become clear under this approach. For example, Ingress likely feeds them a ton of mapping and route data.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's my belief that they were attempting to crowdsource geolocation of landmarks and interesting tourist spots into maps as well, using ingress. </p>		</li>
