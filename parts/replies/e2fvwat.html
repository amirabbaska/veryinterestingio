			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just different values, different functional forms. If the acceleration is collinear with the velocity, the relativistic version of Newton's second law is F = y^(3)ma, and if they're perpendicular, it's F = yma. And for anything in between, it's a combination of both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so, F=lerp(abs(dot(acceleration, velocity)), yma, yyyma)? Which could be written, I guess, as F=yma * lerp(abs(dot(acceleration, velocity)), 1, yy)?</p>
<p>Or some other kind of interpolation, since I doubt linear is correct.</p></div>		</li>
