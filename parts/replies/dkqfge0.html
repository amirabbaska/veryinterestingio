<p>Everest is the real champ here.</p>
<p>Damn, can't even trust a mountain to play fair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everest is also a cheater because it's on the Tibetan plateau. There are several far more massive and larger mountains on Earth that don't have a plateau boosting them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador. Not as high as Everest, but do to the equatorial bulge of the planet and it's location right on the equator, its summit is the furthest you can get from the center of the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that unfair though?  You're basically saying that the land in which Everest sits on eventually stops counting  as the mountain itself.  Where is the cutoff here?  Why can't Everest claim the continent itself as its base?  Can I get a geologist with some special geology phrases to come define them? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The largest mountain from its base to the peak on Earth is Mauna Kea, one of the Hawaiian volcanoes.  It's a few hundred feet taller from base than Everest.  Olympus Mons is still much much taller.  and wider--there's no sense of being on a mountain on the slopes of Olympus Mons, since it's so broad and flat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. While it is technically a mountain, the curvature of Mars is more steep than the incline, so a person hiking up it wouldn't actually be able to see the top until they got there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assumably they calculated the area that deviates from the usual oblate spheroid that Mars would otherwise be there, and said 'this is where Mons Olympus starts'.  Normally they'd start from the plain, but Olypmus Mons is so damned big it covers most of it :D</p></div>		</li>
