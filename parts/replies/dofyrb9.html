			<div class="markdown"><p>What LIGO really measures is called the chirp mass. That is a measurement of the combined mass of the binary. What it doesn't measure so well is the mass of the individual components. The total mass of the system is 2.74 solar masses, and so you more or less have 2, 1.4 solar mass neutron stars in there. It is just there is a wide range that are possible given the observations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, to add: LIGO just measures the masses of progenitor objects. It is only astrophysics that tells us what sort of objects those are or could be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So during the life stream on YouTube, somebody asked what you could do with the fact you know there is a black on that location. And somebody answered it is the smallest/lightest known black hole. But you cant do a lot with that information. But is a mass of 2,7 Solar masses not to light te be black hole? Or will It transform back into a neutron star when things have settled?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a plot showing the expected masses of neutron stars by probability? Basically like an IMF for neutron stars? Is ~1.4 solar masses very common if both could have been that? From what I remember, it at least shouldn't be surprising that they could be about the same mass since massive stars often come in pairs of nearly the same size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me add that Fe cores of stars of about 10 solar masses have masses of the order of 1.1-1.3 Msun, and densities sufficiently high to give rise to a n-star. Ugliano et al 2012, Astrophys. Journal,757, 1, show that the Fe cores are below 1.4 Msun at the lower end of the core-collapse mass. Once collapse starts a NS of similar mass may form if no further fallback happens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there's overlap between the possible masses of neutron stars and white dwarfs? And you're saying that's basically because the iron core is denser than a carbon-oxygen or an oxygen-neon-magnesium core so that electron degeneracy pressure will fail at a lower mass for the iron core, which results in a neutron star that can be less than the Chandrasekhar limit if little material falls back onto it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I won't speculate in to the physics, but this part is true as far as observations are concerned already. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would naively expect to see this sort of end product represented in pulsars, though, as well - is there a reason that a lower mass NS shouldn't become a radio pulsar? Or is the mas distribution of radio pulsars not really so tightly peaked as we've believed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you're absolutely right.
As mentioned above, the masses are consistent with 2 MCh NSs. However, NS masses with M &lt; MCh are not impossible. The range of NS masses observed is not so small. masses in excess of 2Msun are known, so possibly some are also below MCh.
Btw, the Chandrasekhar mass itself depends on the neutron excess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Others have pointed out that we really measure chirp mass well, and not the component masses. Part of the reason for this is because there is a degeneracy in the gravitational waveform between the mass ratio and the spin of the neutron stars. If you assume a model where the neutron stars spin must be &lt;0.05, then you find that mass ratio nearer to one is preferred. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to know! I would expect that neither NS is recycled to a MSP (or if they are MSPs dynamically merging in a cluster that spins are not aligned), so that the binary should have fairly low spin...still trying to catch up on the torrent of papers released, though!</p></div>		</li>
