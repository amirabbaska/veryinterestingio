			<div class="markdown"><p>What's interesting to me about orangutans, is that the presence of a flanged male seems to inhibit other sexually mature males from developing a flange. But again, I don't think anyone really knows how, at least not yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, being a clumsy, introverted geek with James Earl Jones' voice and the body of a jock I've always set up a huge cognitive dissonance in the people I meet. People try to put me in charge when I have no clue what's going on, they accuse me of being a glory hound when all I want is to be left alone...</p>
<p>It's definitely useful but also really annoying - and it's made me very sympathetic towards little guys who sing tenor and get ignored.</p></div>		</li>

<p>These just seem to be physical manifestations of physical dominance. I see no evidence that the wittiest or most strategic monkeys display physical signs of those types of dominance. Unfortunately, they haven't evolved past a point where anything but physical dominance has much value. Dominant humans don't tend to be bodybuilders or athletes really...as in they don't rule society or necessarily have the absolute best breeding prospects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also more than double their physical size when they flange, and I believe they switch from a primarily tree-dwelling life when non-flanged to a primarily ground dwelling life after.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ohh yeah orangutans are super cool in that regard. I read somewhere (a random text book I don't remember the name of, so take this with a grain of salt) that pheromones released by the King orangutan inhibit the growth of flanges on other males. If the king dies or leaves, a new male will grow the flanges. Similar to a wrasse species with their rainbow colouring, but we'll stick to talking about primates for now :) </p></div>		</li>

<p>The dominant theory is that the presence of a Flanged Male will inhibit the developement of any other males within his territory from becoming &quot;flanged&quot; through that process you mentioned, but it's not been proven how that works. </p></div>		</li>
