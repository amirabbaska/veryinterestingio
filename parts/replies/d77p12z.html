<p>I think fundamentally, other science problems are dependent on things beyond the realm of the human mind -- by which I mean things like cost of research, lab equipment, the laws of physics as we understand them, fundamentally we depend on the way the universe is and how we interact with it to define research in those areas.</p>
<p>Mathematics (and theoretical physics), on the other hand, is independent of the universe we live in: it is logic, pure and cold, and has an objective existence beyond such petty things like &quot;we don't have enough power to contain plasma in a sword-like shape&quot; or &quot;we lack the ability to manipulate single atoms&quot;. Fundamentally, hypothetically, any outstanding mathematics problem can be solved with nothing more than some pencil, paper (or other equivalent mind-extension-tools), and a flash of insight. Can't do that with any other field of science (which is also why mathematics is sometimes considered to be apart from &quot;science&quot; depending on the meaning you attach to the word).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not true for theoretical physics - its results are constrained in the sense that IF they make observable predictions, they should be consistent with those observations.</p>
<p>(And there's a good argument to be made that if they don't make such predictions, they are not physics.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, you can say the same for any science - the difference is that in maths, you are largely solving problems having assumed certain axioms to be true. Scientific fields could do that, it would just defeat the purpose of science as a tool for finding useful explanations of things.</p>
<p>Also it feels weird to talk about maths as objectively existing - sure, our thoughts may exist, but that doesn't suggest mathematical laws are real or true. Indeed it seems they regularly lead to contradiction.</p>
<p>But I think your sentiment is right - there aren't many unsolved problems in physics, chemistry etc. that can be solved without massive R&amp;D cost, so these kinds of prizes aren't exactly incentivizing compared to say, peer recognition.</p></div>		</li>
