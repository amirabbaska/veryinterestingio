			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like it shouldn't be discounted that plastics have lips and troughs where water can pool and wait out the heat as well. Not to mention odd shapes that may not fit quite right. Plates and cups are smoother and water tends to not collect on them. Plates also stack neatly and shed water easily.</p>
<p>A good example are those zip lock plastic containers. They have little lips around the edge that retains water. When you take them out, it spills and gets everywhere.</p>
<p>You can see similar effects with cups with concave bases</p></div>		</li>
