			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Separate your laundry. Really, you should. All-white things can be subjected to almost any chemical treatment you can imagine. If it has a hint of color, use color-safe bleach and warm rather than hot water.</p>
<p>2) You won't get bleach stains if you use color-safe. However, you won't get your whites as white as you can with chlorine bleach.</p></div>		</li>
