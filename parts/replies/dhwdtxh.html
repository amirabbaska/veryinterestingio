			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It's also uncommon for your data to stay intact in any kind of view such that someone could pull all the records on you specifically. There probably isn't a big table somewhere that tracks you in particular as a user, and all the attributes and actions relating to your usage. The only time something like that is created is if there is a specific business need that demands it. Most of the user usage data that gets tracked and recorded ends up being sliced, diced, and aggregated until you couldn't reverse engineer it back to see what a specific individual user did.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess I'm curious if there was ever a business demand for such data?</p>

<p>How does it get sliced and diced?  What categories do they use?  I guess each business is different but what are the trends what information businesses seek?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's rare. An example from where I work is that we create a record for people that enter our sales funnel but don't follow through to purchase. The idea is that if they decide to come back then we can pick up where they left off in the sales process vs having them start over from the start. Even then we purge this data after a few weeks as there's no real value in keeping it any longer. Presumably the customer has gone elsewhere or isn't coming back.</p>
<p>If the customer were to complete a purchase then we do create a persistent record specific to them to track their account info but there is still a lot of data we collect during our interactions with them that isn't stored long term or <em>is</em> stored long term but isn't associated to their account. An example might be when we track their interaction with our page to create a heatmap op cursor loitering, clicks, etc for our UX people to use. The data collected is an aggregate of all of the users, not any one in particular.</p>
<p>For the slicing and dicing part....without getting into data modeling and database design it's difficult to explain how we chop the data up so that it can be easily stored and accessed for different business functions in a way that's ELI5. But as others in this thread have noted, it's more common for the business to come to us to ask &quot;how many people from OH, age 25-34 started a purchase between Jun and Jul but didn't complete?&quot; vs &quot;tell me everything Joe User did last month.&quot; Because of that we usually store the data in a way that readily supports answering the first question. We probably could pull data to answer the second question but since no one ever asks us that we don't put time and effort into storing data in a way that makes it easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's custom, especially for the bigger companies that have inhouse digital marketing.</p>
<p>You buy a premium analytics product like Google Analytics 360 or Adobe Marketing Cloud, then you create a DMP and start to collect custom dimensions.</p>
<p>A telco would probably ad contract duration, contract type, and other things related to that.</p></div>		</li>
