			<div class="markdown"><p>But the full moon also takes into account the movement of the earth around the sun. The cycles under discussion are about the moon in relation to the earth, not the way the moon looks from earth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually no.</p>
<p>From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Regardless of the culture, all lunar months approximate the mean length of the synodic month, or how long it takes on average to pass through each phase (new, half, full moon) and back again. It takes 29.5 days</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So when talking about a &quot;lunar month&quot; we are talking about 29.5 days.</p>
<p>If the lunar cycle has some impact on the menstrual cycle then it would <em>definitely</em> be the way the moon looks from the Earth. That's the only factor that you can readily observe and use to calibrate a rhythm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless there is gravitational pull from the moon that is intended to affect the person, it would be the 29.5 day cycle we are interested in, as that is something visible and corresponds more with the tides, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any information of the distribution of lengths of cycles?  Are 21 or 35 day cycles exceedingly rare, and about how much of the mass of population is within the 26-28 day range? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question, all I could find was this chart from an iPhone app maker lol:
<a href="http://www.fertilityfriend.com/Faqs/Menstrual-Cycle-Length-Stats-Study.html" target="_blank">http://www.fertilityfriend.com/Faqs/Menstrual-Cycle-Length-Stats-Study.html</a></p>
<p>I'm guessing it's something like that, this is perhaps biased towards variability since I'm guessing many users of &quot;Fertility Friend&quot; are getting pregnant or are concerned by a highly variable cycle. Or it could be the other way, women with a variable cycle would find such an app less useful. Anyways if someone has a real study that would be interesting.</p></div>		</li>
