			<div class="markdown"><p>Valve doesn't ask for any money, they just straight up print free keys for developers to use as they see fit. As many as you want - within reason. Maybe they have a deal with Humble and GMG where they get a cut from their sales, I wouldn't know. But the devs see none of those costs. Source: is dev.</p>
<p>Valve's main cut of the deal is that they get new Steam users, or get old Steam users to log in to play the new game. And then they can show ads for games on Steam to those users! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its the Gillete tactic. Give something cheap or even free, and make money from customer retention afterwards since they are &quot;forced&quot; to use your product. Gillete gave a lot handles for replacable razor handles for free, since he knew the customers would come back for the razors themselves in the long run.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Square does this too sort of. You get a free reader which likely costs 20 cents to make. Then they get 3% from every transaction.
If it cost money I probably wouldn't have even gotten it but I decided hey maybe I'd need it and now I use it and they've gotten at least 10 bucks from me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which makes sense, if you think about it. If Valve started charging for that sort of thing, devs and Humble Bundle could just provide other versions of the game. By offering a free and simpler method (hey, use this free Steam code and we'll provide the download, as well as updates, etc), they're, as you said, bringing customers to their service (and ultimately their store).</p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair, Steam never forces me to see 'ads'. They have that stupid pop-up you can disable (per-machine), but other then that i never see an 'ad' on Steam.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They've won me over into using them by providing a good product/service. I'm not particularly huge into gaming but as long as my laptop (bought for running CAD 4 yrs ago) can handle the game I wait for a sale and pick up what I want on steam for a better price and the ability to LAN older games who don't have online servers anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Til this about g2a, I have used it for a bunch of games and have never had a problem, had no idea devs might get screwed over thogh. Buying from steam lets me have the refubd option but buying from g2a gives me better prices. Now however I might stop using it, thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>G2A seems like a great deal until you get burned.  Had a friend get me into it and bought like 2-3 keys.  One was for $20, it got revoked pretty quickly, I tried complaining to G2A and their support seemed like they were going to be helpful (kept responding, asking for some verification etc) until they just <em>stopped</em> with no explanation.  Crickets for like a week or so, and finally I just had enough and did a chargeback on the card I used and never used them again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only keys I ever bought off one of those sites (Kinguin, I think) were for the various installments of Football Manager, since licensing issues prevent Sports Interactive from selling the game here in Germany. Have been lucky so far, no revoked keys yet. </p>
<p>For the next FM game, I'm going to look into getting a boxed copy from the UK or wherever else it's being sold, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use it a lot for games that are like, 8+ years old. Mostly because they're dirt cheap on there and Steam generally asks 4-5x what G2A does. I've never had any trouble with my purchases, and it doesn't feel any morally worse to me than like, picking up an old game at Goodwill. I'm sure new games are often purchased in shady ways, but I doubt people are committing credit fraud to resell Rome: Total War for $4</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are legit. The issue was that they were getting their Witcher 3 keys from an authorised distributor and not CDP itself. The keys were fine but CDP wasn't ok with it and called them out on it. /r/gamedeals felt it was a little too close to G2A style reselling and banned them. GMG then added something saying where they get the key from in the interests of transparency. If you go to a product and it says the source is Paradox or Ubisoft, it's 100% legit and from the publisher itself (almost all keys have that). If it says &quot;Authorised Distributor&quot; then it's 99% legit because it's bought from a company that GMG trusts and got the keys directly from the publisher. It's not like G2A where keys are stolen or taken from cheap regions and can get revoked. I'm not sure if they even buy any new keys from distributors anymore, Witcher 3 has been out of stock for years and they don't even list some of the newer games they couldn't get keys for. </p></div>		</li>
