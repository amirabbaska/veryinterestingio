			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you see a dermatologist, there's really no way to tell. Personally, I spent my teen years relatively clear faced, and got hit with it bad in my early 20s. Spent the later half of my 20s battling it just on my chin, until I got pregnant and suddenly zero acne. A dermatologist can give you an idea of what kind of acne you're dealing with, and how to treat it, but there's no way to predict how long it may last unfortunately. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No one can answer that question because it's so different for each person. It may clear up on its own, or if you change your skincare routine (please use a moisturizer!), or you may have to go on accutane eventually. </p></div>		</li>
