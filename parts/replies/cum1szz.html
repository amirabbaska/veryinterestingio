			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just like to note that modern Hebrew does not use that system. Only things like dates on official documents are still counted in that way, and even then the Gregorian calendar date is also given (transliterated into Hebrew, of course). It's a lot like how English still uses Roman numerals to make something look fancy. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hebrew uses an additive system.</p>

<p>Languages from Ethiopia and Eritrea (Semitic languages, e.g. <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/amharic.htm" target="_blank">Amharic</a> and <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tigrinya.htm" target="_blank">Tigrinya</a>) use a &quot;ten-one, ten-two system&quot;. So in Tigrinya (found in Eritrea and northern parts of Ethiopia) ten is &quot;Aserte&quot; and one is &quot;Hade&quot;. Eleven is &quot;Aserte-hade&quot; (i.e. ten-one) and the pattern follows. The Amharic is similar (they are both closely related to each other in the same way the romatic languages are).  </p>
<p>Similarily <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/language/numbers/japanese.htm" target="_blank">Japanese</a> also follows this pattern. </p>
<p>I think the real answer is that OP's view is that &quot;many cultures&quot; is really the cultures with which he's familiar i.e. Indo-European. And so generalized this question as if it related to more cultures than his own familiarity.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A further afield example that does the same thing is Māori:</p>
<p>one = tahi</p>
<p>two = rua</p>
<p>three = toru</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>ten = tekau</p>
<p>eleven = tekau ma tahi</p>
<p>twelve = tekau ma rua</p>
<p>thirteen = tekau ma toru</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>twenty = rua tekau</p>

<p>I wouldn't be at all surprised if other Pacific Island languages do similar things, as they are often related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, Japanese was the one I was going to point out as well.</p>
<p>One = Ichi</p>
<p>Two = Ni</p>
<p>Three = San</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Ten = Juu</p>
<p>Eleven = juuichi</p>
<p>Twelve = juuni</p>
<p>Thirteen = juusan</p>
<p>And so on. The interesting thing about Japanese, though, is that once you get to 20, things get a little weird. As an example, the number 21 would be reprsented as nijuuichi.</p>
<p>To break it down, ni-juu-ichi. So a literal translation would look like 2-10-1. Awesome language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the 2-10-1 case (èr-shí-yī in Mandarin) is because shí becomes a counter for 'tens'. So if you said 二十一個 (èr-shí-yī-gè), you're actually saying (two tens and one) of things. Rarely, numbers are written without place value counters, like 一五〇三〇 (15030).</p>
<p>This system is actually derived from from Arabic numerals. Before Arabic numerals came to China, they used a different system called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzhou_numerals" target="_blank">Suzhou numbering</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In French, 70 is <em>soixante-dix</em>, or 60-10. Ninety is <em>quatre-vingt-dix</em>, or 4-20-10.</p>
<p>Note that French-speaking Belgians usually don't use those, and instead have respectively <em>septante</em> and <em>nonante</em>.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, Hebrew does follow that pattern. We may use an additive system, but it is not the common way to refer to these numbers.</p>
<p>In Hebrew, 11 is אחת-עשרה which is composed of the words אחת - &quot;one&quot; and &quot;עשרה&quot; - meaning &quot;ten&quot; and pronounced &quot;es-re&quot;. Twelve is שתים-עשרה with the same principle where שתים is &quot;two&quot; and the suffix &quot;עשרה&quot; remains. So on up to twenty, which is literally the plural form of the Hebrew word for &quot;ten&quot;. So Hebrew also follows the same pattern.</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that over the years there were several ways to refer these numbers. For example, the word &quot;תריסר&quot; for Twelve, similar in meaning to the word &quot;dozen&quot;. Also, the Hebrew numbers have feminine and masculine forms corresponding to what they represent. 14 for example can be either &quot;ארבעה-עשר&quot; or &quot;ארבע-עשרה&quot;, and so on.</p></div>		</li>
