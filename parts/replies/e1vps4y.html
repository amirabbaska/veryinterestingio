<p>It is actually between minus 170v and plus 170v. 120 is the Root-Mean-Square (RMS) value. The peak value is √2 times the RMS. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify , the neutral (smaller prong) and protective earth (3rd circular prong) both are considered earth but serve different purposes and should not ever be wired together.</p>
<p>Neutral is typically connected to the center winding of the transformer and is also connected to earth at the transformer or breaker panel.  Protective earth is a separate path to ground to provide a backup should a single fault cause the neutral line to become energized or disconnected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that, the <em>primary</em> breaker panel is (almost always) the only place this should happen, and this should also be where the ground rod for the building is tied to. Secondary panels (such as run to a garage) should generally not have the ground and neutral tied together. The biggest exception is when the panel has it's own ground rod, such as detached buildings on the same property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To further add to this, your own ground rod doesn’t actually do much, it’s just a small part of the equation. What’s important is that it’s connected (through the neutral conductor) to the grounding terminal at the transformer, and to the ground rods on all your neighbour’s houses. It’s all these ground rods in parallel that produces the good, low impedance connection to the earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all. FYI, there is no &quot;European&quot; plug. There are at least 5 or 6 different and mutually incompatible plugs used in the different EU countries and for different purposes. E.g. the French style &quot;Schuko&quot; (used also in Czech Rep., Slovak Rep., Poland, Hungary, etc.), the German variant of the Schuko (has a grounding strip instead of a pin, so a  French cable fits into a German outlet but not a German one into a French outlet), the Swiss 3 pronged plug (pins are staggered), the Italian 3 pronged plug (pins are in a straight line), the UK &quot;brick&quot; style plug - all of these are standard. </p>
<p>Then there are various local variants, e.g. with flat and slanted prongs used for special purposes (e.g. computers connected to an UPS protected circuit where you don't want people to plug in their random non-critical junk), special plugs for high power single phase appliances in some countries (e.g. some ovens, water heaters or washing machines), etc.</p>
<p>I think you mean the flat 2 pronged plug with no protective Earth. However, those are meant for (and permitted!) only on doubly insulated devices, i.e. things that are equipped with a galvanically insulated power supply (e.g. a transformer) and all potentially live parts are hidden inside the enclosure, impossible to touch. The transformer is the first insulation layer, the non-conductive enclosure the second. So there even if the plug is reversed it doesn't matter, the transformer (or a modern switching power supply) doesn't care which end is connected to live and to neutral and the safety part is handled by the insulation - there is no way for you to touch anything dangerous. </p>
<p>However, anything larger than a small device, appliances powered directly from the mains (no transformers) or having metal enclosures will have a three pin plug of some kind with protective earth that is polarized and impossible to reverse. E.g. the standard Schuko type plug. If you reversed the plug e.g. on a washing machine somehow, the metal chassis could become live - and that would be really bad. That's why you won't find the 2 pronged flat plugs on anything of that kind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take a closer look at a German Schuko. You can absolutely plug it in either way, reversing hot and neutral. Also most double outlet sockets are constructed simply, with the grounds together, meaning your hot and neutral are switched depending on whether you plug in at the top or bottom ( search Legrand 764542 images for examples).</p>
<p>Europe is wired rather differently than the US. I moved here 11 years ago, and it took me by surprise. England is really weird too, with 'ring topology' wiring rather common, hence the need for the gargantuan foot-destroying plug with built-in fuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My bad for being imprecise. I was specifically refering to the german Schuko plug, which is the standard type of wall outlet in my country. (This also explains the hole that can be found in the grounded plugs)</p>
<p>I think I understand now. On those devices the chassis is protected from the live guts. And because of that, and the fact that AC is oscillating, the plug can be rotated freely and manufacturers expect this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA_connector" target="_blank">NEMA</a> (North American + some others) plugs have polarized and unpolarized variants, as well. Polarized plugs can only be plugged in one way, and it's a safety feature that ensures the hot lead is going to the place you want it to, and not somewhere else.</p>
<p>On a few devices, however, it turns out not to matter. There would be no safety problems with plugging into an outlet in either way. When that is the case, there is no point in making a polarized plug, so some manufacturers won't.</p>
<p>The consideration should be the same for European plugs - some are polarized, and some aren't. It really depends on the item you're plugging in, more than anything else.</p></div>		</li>
