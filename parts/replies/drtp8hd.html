			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question, and a quick search couldn't find a solid answer to it. It seems that while there is a great deal of speculation, the evolutionary advantages of green vs other pigments is not currently understood.</p>
<p>I did find an interesting research paper that seems to state that the green color of most plants is mostly to do with the chemicals involved in photosynthesis than anything else. So if they'd been black instead of green, that would have conferred an evolutionary advantage. But like we see so many other times in evolution, things have ended up in a local optimum, not a global one.</p>
<p>&quot;... no special signiÔ¨Åcance should be attached to the
fact that they absorb much less in the green region of the
spectrum.&quot; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40900745_Cost_and_color_of_photosynthesis" target="_blank">Cost and Color of Photosynthesis</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure speculation on my part, but maybe green offered an advantage in other ways. Plants didn't evolve in isolation - they are somewhat dependent on animals to eat them, spread seeds, etc. So one thought I've had is that maybe plants which reflected green were more likely to attract animals than other colors that may have existed. Perhaps precisely <em>because</em> green is the most abundant color emitted by the Sun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple differently colored molecules that can do the job of converting sunlight to sugar; the green chlorophyll is the most common, but there are some others. And many colors in plants come from other molecules that just happen to be there. The purple color that I think you're thinking of is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthocyanin" target="_blank">anthocyanin</a> which may act as a kind of sunscreen. Why plants are various colors and haven't narrowed it down to a single optimal strategy is still a bit of a mystery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It'd be presumptuous of us to expect evolution to have reached an optimal strategy for any process in any species.</p>
<p>I think of evolution as a swarm of blind people trying to find the highest point in a field by moving in the direction with the highest local gradient.
Sometimes they get stuck on a local peak with no clue there's a massive mountain on the other side of the valley they just climbed out of.</p>
<p>The long winded, meandering point (or is it a question? Haven't decided yet) I'm trying to make is:
Without seeing them all of the field, how do we know we've gotten to the highest point? Particularly when the field is actually squishy and bouncy, so the very act of all these blind folks walking around changes its shape.</p>
<p>That got away from me a bit...
Someone let me know if that rambling makes any sense at all or if I'm just spewing bollocks from my cleftal horizon. </p></div>		</li>
