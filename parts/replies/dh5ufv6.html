<p>Now I'm wondering- is there generally enough slack in the line for splicing to happen? How durable / energy efficient / &quot;noisy&quot; (in terms of signal) is the splice kit in comparison to the original line? Does performance / safety degrade noticeably when enough splice kits are used? At what point do companies consider laying a new line instead of splicing?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Generally on land copper facilities can use as little as 5' of slack loop. Fiber needs a bit more off around 50'. This is usually the case to give slack for fusion splicing if needed as you generally want to pull a fiber into a closed area to have a better splice. Mechanical clip splices can be done with much less, but there's no serious gain to not have the length and the extra cost isn't usually worth fucking your future self over. </p>
<p>Any deep underground or under water cables typically allow for 1.5x vertical rise plus the slack loop. Access points are typically placed at intervals so overall if one section is cut the whole line isn't bad. </p>
<p>Now, I say this but I do not know specifics as I to T3 work and haven't the need to cross oceans. The deepest i put stuff is probably 20-30 ft. </p>
<p>Mechanical fiber splices typically cause .3 or so db of Loss. Fusion splicing the fibers directly causes around .1 db. </p>
<p>As far as safety what do you mean? Generally a line cut won't be like cutting an electrical line, there's no &quot;direct&quot; danger. </p>
<p>As far as running a new line it's usually just what would be cheaper or more lines were going to be run any way. Speed of the fix is also vey important as T1 lines going gown starts to cascade problems pretty badly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The post says &quot;electric cable&quot; and &quot;electric company&quot;, so I wouldn't take that to mean data. Sure the electric company would own data cables, but that's not really what they are known for. Electric would mean it's definitely not fiber, that has light signals, no electricity is flowing in it.</p></div>		</li>
