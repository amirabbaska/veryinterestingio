			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of that has been due to what the FDA has allowed for labeling. Basically new enamel cannot be created, but during the day enamel demineralizes and remineralizes. The fluoride in toothpaste and stuff can help the enamel remineralize with a stronger crystal (FAP instead of HAP) and FAP is more resistant to decay, specifically S. Mutant which is the colonizing bacteria that causes bacterial decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is more to it.  I personally use a toothpaste that includes both sodium fluoride (.243%) and potassium nitrate (5%).  Fluoride works even better with a potassium compound.  And there are other toothpastes which have even more active ingredients.  But fluoride remains the most basic means of strengthening enamel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The potassium nitrate is not an adjunct to the fluoride and does not strengthen the enamel. It is added to make the teeth less sensitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strengthen yes. Rebuild no. I always compare dental decay to termite damage. Once it starts damaging the wood all you can do is repair (fillings and crowns). Once the damage is too extensive it must be replaced (dental implants after extracted grossly decayed tooth structure)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dental student here. For clarification: during the beginning of the process of tooth decay, the enamel becomes demineralized and more porous. As long as the tooth decay remains in the enamel (and hasn't extended into the dentin), that tooth structure can be remineralized with fluoride. Your dentist may do this with a topical fluoride varnish, or prescribe you a high-fluoride toothpaste.</p>
<p>Another interesting tidbit: when enamel demineralization occurs, it will often become discolored, turning white, yellow, brown or even black. If that enamel is able to be remineralized, the decalcified area will remain that darker shade, despite being harder than it was before. This is one of the reasons that caries, or tooth decay, can be so tricky for a dentist to diagnose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No :-(  I asked my dentist about a spot like this, which she said was the remineralization of a weakened spot on the crevice of a molar.  She said bleaching won't ever make it the same color as the rest of the tooth.  It may lighten very slightly, but in short, nope, it's like that forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For most people its just not necessary, as regular fluoride toothpaste will get the job done. That's why its up to your dentist to evaluate your risk for tooth decay and prescribe accordingly.</p>
<p>There's also the issue of patient compliance. If a patient doesn't brush with regular toothpaste, the likely won't brush with the good stuff (in my experience).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely not, but it is possible. Changes in color can sometimes be corrected with tooth whitening, especially if the changes are mild. If the color change is more drastic, and the tooth is in an esthetic area, the case can be made to restore it with a filling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is another product called Novamin that can also make enamel stronger. It was developed in the US, sold in the US, and then purchased by a UK company which no longer makes it available in the US yet sells it in many other countries throughout the world. That evil company is GSK. They ruin every product they buy, in my experience.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really drives me crazy that Sensodyne Nupro 5000 isn't available in the US anymore, I guess sales weren't enough for GSK to bother keeping it here.  So now to get a toothpaste with Novamin I have to have people buy it when they happen to be traveling abroad and bring it back for me.  Ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I also hate GSK's version of Gaviscon (a unique antacid that forms a foam raft barrier in the stomach). The version in the US is made with aluminum hydroxide (which some people believe is related to development of dementia) and doesn't contain the same amount of sodium alginate as the UK version. They also bought out Biotene, which makes toothpastes and mouthwash for people with dry mouth, and they changed the formula to remove the enzymes that they previously had.</p>
<p>I also personally have a beef with them because I was on brand name Paxil in 2005 that was being made by GSK in Puerto Rico in a factory that was so bad it was eventually raided by the US government because GSK would never make the improvements requested. The Paxil I was on turned out to be superpotent and I developed some of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome, and when I called there customer service about the Class II recall they didn't even apologize. I was shocked at how callous they were.</p>
<p>Since then it seems like every time I find a product I like, GSK buys it and ruins it. I guess everyone has one company they really hate, and GSK is mine.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, when I try to order Gaviscon from UK pharmacies online and try to check out it lets you do it from EVERY country except the US. I don't think it's a coincidence. GSK owns the right to distribute Gaviscon in the US, and another company (Reckitt Benckiser) owns the rights to distribute in the UK, and is the company that sells the original, good version. I finally found a seller on Amazon but have to pay quite a mark-up to get it shipped to the US. If I have to go through all that trouble, you would think GSK would realize they are selling an inferior product.</p></div>		</li>
