			<div class="markdown"><p>I never liked that theory, because wouldnt there be a difference between industrialized nations at different latitudes? There was a chart in /r/mapporn that showed some countries get a lot less light. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8ldNxOx.png" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/8ldNxOx.png</a></p>
<p>Edit: here is a different map also from /r/mapporn that shows the total number of hours of sunlight in the US and Europe. Shouldn't there be some variation in incidence of myopia between these locations? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off topic but that map is really weird - it looks like it's averaging the hours of night time by area over the country. So somehow the US ends up with less than Canada, I suppose because it's Alaska. It seems very strange to use country borders on a map like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I think /u/bosephus totally misinterpreted that map. It seems to be measuring the number of hours per day that a given nation is in darkness at all points simultaneously. The key phrase here is </p>
<p><em>The Sun never sets on the British Empire</em></p>
<p>which is (or was) true because the British Empire controlled land on almost all parts of the globe. Similar for France, which is why those two countries are yellow on the map. You'll note that the key for the map has the phrase &quot;Sun never sets&quot; next to the yellow. Next thing to note is the larger countries are more light-coloured, meaning they have fewer hours of &quot;simultaneous night in all parts of the country&quot;. The reason should be obvious.</p>
<p>Finally, note that there <em>is indeed</em> a correlation between larger countries and countries near the poles (away from the equator) presumably because they are less densely inhabited and therefore easier to conquer, and that may have led to the confusion. However, to conclude, any one point on the globe should get an average of exactly 12 hours of night every day (averaging over a full year). So the number of hours of light that any particular location is getting is definitely <em>not</em> what this map is showing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it <em>is</em> actually true that the poles get less light - after all they are colder because of that, but the underlying reason is simply that the sunlight is hitting the Earth at a shallower angle and so is spread out more per given area of land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, there's a massive difference between indoor light levels and outdoor light levels.  And lots of biological phenomenon occur on a threshold level...it may well be important to have above a certain light level, and more above that doesn't do much.  It's entirely possible that being outdoors in either polar or equatorial regions gives you that threshold, so latitude isn't so important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the most useless maps I've ever seen. Saying the sun never sets in france or south america is just incredibly misleading even if it's true through whatever weird technicality their trying to argue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In cases like mine, that doesn't make sense. My myopia is progressing identically to my biological father. We both grew up in rural areas, lots of time outside as children. I even moved to Arizona at 12 and got sunlight basically beamed into my eyeballs 24/7. there's clearly a genetic component in our development.</p>
<p>I'd read that myopia, like dwarfism, is a dominant trait. I'd assumed more nearsightedness was more people living through childhood and having their own surviving children to pass on the trait, now that it doesn't kill you.</p></div>		</li>

<p>then yours is genetic, it is ones where their parents do NOT have myopia that are getting it early in childhood that are the concern.</p></div>		</li>
