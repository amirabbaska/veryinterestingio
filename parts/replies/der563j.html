<p>I find your answer troubling. Many years ago I myself chose to end my employment with a major engineering consultancy rather than get involved with work I found ethically difficult to justify. Are you saying there could be no circumstances in which you would even consider doing the same?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The highest obligation of engineers is their duty to society, and ethical issues should not only be part of quotidian responsibilities, but the primary concern. As technical experts, engineers have a tremendous amount of insight into projects that affect many others, and it is absolutely shocking to me that you do not consider the impact of your designs from an ethical point of view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beautiful but not true.
I've refused several tempting offers in the defense industry only in ethical grounds. However that won't stop other engineers to join and do the work.
Is there something else we can do? Probably have ethical professional commissions to investigate violations and sanction members and suspend or strip away titles when necessary. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Putting aside the type of engineering you do, ALL engineers should be thinking about ethics on a daily basis. In Canada engineers wear an iron ring on their pinky finger as a reminder of their duty to the public and the ethics associated with their work. </p></div>		</li>
