			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. Short answer: Yes-ish. </p>
<p>Detailed answer: We have some internal tools that are in development which pretty much do what you're talking about.  </p>
<p>Over the last 2-3 years, we've been attending large QA Conferences and know that some other studios (bigger ones, like Blizzard, EA) are a bit ahead of us in these regards, however, even programs can't get everything. Or at least, making a tool that <em>could</em> get everything would be an enormous task in itself.
What we're aiming for is to make a sort of plug-and-play interface that could be used across all current and future projects. </p>
<p>I believe the idea is to get QA involved with development a lot earlier, and to hook it up to the engines themselves to pull data.
Our internal tools are being made to do some of the more mundane tasks, so that we can let testers focus on the creative side.</p>
<p>Things such as buying 1,000,000 potions in the shop, selling them back, then doing it at every shop, with every item in each shop. Picking up and dropping each item in the game in every-single-location in-game. Stuff that can be easily done with broad terms, like &quot;Spawn character at position X.Y.Z&quot;, kill each enemy in the game with every type of weapon in the game, stuff like that. Or just mashing all the buttons repeatedly. Or saving after taking a single step, times a billion. Things that are pretty much humanly impossible. I mean we COULD ask the testers to do that but they would probably kill themselves.</p></div>		</li>

As far as S class, they don't totally cancel progression, and for b class its not like physics anomaly making a particular puzzle ten times harder than it should be, so its c class with still a considerable amount of user pain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm well I can't speak for Bioware and don't think they use that system, however, I am 100% positive that QA brought up their concerns. There's no way they didn't unless they legit didn't give a fuck. They were definitely aware of the problems before the public outcry. They're way too jarring. </p>
<p>I haven't looked too much into the Bioware Montreal studio, but they're relatively new and likely ran out of time and budget. </p>
<p>My guess is that, yeah, their concerns were ignored due to lack of persistence in stating that they were actually fuckin awful, while likely, since it's not game breaking, the devs ended up prioritizing crashes, save corruption, streaming/loading issues over some problems with their faces. </p>
<p>Our (not bioware) internal standards would class the facial issues at a low B, but seeing as it's pretty much globally across the game, would probably have been taken care of depending when the concerns were brought up.</p></div>		</li>
