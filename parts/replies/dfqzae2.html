<p>Note that even proton/anti-proton annihilations will result in the creation of electrons and positrons as well so they will end up having the same gamma ray photons produced.</p>

<p>I'm not convinced by this... proton-antiproton collisions can produce e^+ e^- pairs of course but these won't then annihilate off each other (if they did they'd just be another loop in the path integral expansion). In any case, they won't be produced or annihilated at rest so any e^+ e^- collision would produce higher energy photons.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're thinking of this in a particle physics context versus an astrophysical context. If you pump a bunch of anti-protons into a region filled with gas/plasma (otherwise known as &quot;most of the universe&quot;) then you'll get proton/anti-proton annihilations and you'll get production of positrons. Those positrons will eventually annihilate with electrons in the environment. And in general that will result in a peak of gamma rays around 511 KeV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah fair enough. If we're in a purely astrophysics area then I'm more than willing to concede there :p</p>
<p>For my own education - proton anti-proton collisions should have ~2 GeV of energy to spare - why does this still produce gamma rays peaking around 511 keV?</p></div>		</li>
