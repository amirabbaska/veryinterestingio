			<div class="markdown"><p>This can also be observed in older 2D games like the first and second Prince of Persia, where formerly animated enemies suddenly changed colour and turned into background after death. This was done to save processing time by not having to redraw it every frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the thorough explanation of the mechanics of how cartoons were created.  But it still doesn't explain why the color is different.  Is it that the two different animators cannot coordinate to use the same exact color? Or is it that because they are photographed through different numbers of layers and the layers in the back look darker so an exact color match still won't work?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sure, sorry to not be more clear. The basic answer is that the two things probably are the same color, but human brains are really stupid at thinking about color.</p>
<p>What's happening is the color scheme is being hugely simplified which is going to make the colors look different even if they aren't. The first thing an amateur painter does when the sit down to paint a person is pick people skin color paint, and then mix white to make the highlights (where sunshine is reflecting directly off) and black to make the shadows.</p>
<p>The problem is that's not nearly, like even at all, what is actually happening with light. <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/631700285202492757/_" target="_blank">Here</a> is one of my favorite quick reference charts on real skin tone just to give you a taste of how much more complicated realistic painting is than cartoon painting. You can see the chart talking about things like saturation, additive colors, and sub surface scattering, but this is really just scratching the surface of how light interacts with objects.</p>
<p>Cartooning is <em>very</em> different. Cartooning vs. realism is a lot like writing vs. taking pictures. When you take a picture you just capture everything as realistically as possible, but you can't do that when you write (a picture is worth a thousand words right?), instead you have to try to put the idea in your readers mind in the most natural and least intrusive way. Likewise there are a LOT of things in cartooning that are super unrealistic (like zero saturation changes, additive coloring, or sub surface scattering) but that have become a kind of &quot;language&quot; of images, i.e. a way of communicating to us what we should be seeing without actually having to realistically paint them.</p>
<p>Here's a good example. <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/52/eb/2f/52eb2fecf543659c4145a4318c4a6b1f.jpg" target="_blank">anime hands</a> and <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/631700285202492738/" target="_blank">realistic hands</a>. Notice that anime hands has two colors, beige and dark beige, realistic hands, on the other &quot;hand,&quot; has oranges, white, red purple, brown, and even a little blue (look at the vein area on the top left hand). </p>
<p>Going back to your question, take a look at the realistic hand that's on the second row far right. Then look at the anime hand. They're pretty much the same skin &quot;color,&quot; i.e. white guy hands. But put them next to each other and it's obvious that one is a different 'color' than the other. They're not really 'different colors' per se, the base color is the same, but a realistic painter has to do a lot of different things to make it look real (like sub surface scattering, which is ALL OVER the realistic hand example), while anime painter can just paint in 2 colors: white guy and white guy in shadow. Keep the pictures separate and our brains think &quot;white guy hands&quot; but put the two images together and our brains start highlighting the differences, such as the different colors that result from capturing real light and it's real affects on objects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your second guess is right on. Remember, the background is being photographed with the cell on top of it. The foreground is not. This makes the color look slightly different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, watch the whole series of Disney's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFN0er-Jy6w" target="_blank">Peter Ellenshaw</a>, the magnificent matte painter who painted backgrounds on glass for so many movies. Beautiful work! Part 6 is from Mary Poppins. So cool!</p></div>		</li>
