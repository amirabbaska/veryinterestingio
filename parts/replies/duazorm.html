			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really the soundest comment. Placebo research is still in its infancy, but there is a lot of real physiological work happening behind the scenes here. Decreased inflammation is another placebo response. Our perceptions can very much be influenced top-down, and it would be excellent for us to harness that ability in medicine. For a super awesome layman's article with links to research, I highly recommend:</p>

<p>Edit: read the article. Yes it can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the 1970s scientific articles on the placebo pain effects engage in a number of very questionable statistical practices. So much so that I feel you need to go to the ORIGINAL data and take a closely look at anything before you conclude the placebo effect is real. The earliest studies, for example, concluded the people with more pain were the placebo responders, when in fact they were also the people who would have released more endogenous opioids anyway. The statistical fallacy was subdividing the placebo group into responders and nonresponders in order to show an effect of the placebo on the responders (major statistical faux pas number one), and then that the placebo response was opiate sensitive by blocking it with naloxone (anyone in any amount of pain will experience MORE pain with naloxone). On this basis, the placebo pain effect was born.   </p>
<p>I am not saying there is not a real placebo pain effect. I am saying that a LOT of the placebo studies are little more than cleverly disguised and written statistical misinterpretations.</p></div>		</li>
