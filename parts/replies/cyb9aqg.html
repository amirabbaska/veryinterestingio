			<div class="markdown"><p>This was true in the early days but not relevant anymore. Early aircraft such as the bucaneer had weird pitch up tendancies and it was found that the pilots were overcompensating during the acceleration. Nowadays it's purely due to the acceleration and to stop pilots inadvertantly pulling back on both the stick and throttle when the catapult fires.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This leads to the pilot pushing the nose of the plane down to correct the perceived nose-up attitude and flying into the ocean.</p>

<p>It should be noted that day time good weather catapult launches may not be a problem, but when you're doing moonless night time, pitch black, bad weather operations... you absolutely can't see the ocean just in front of you. </p>
<p>That's when trusting your instruments becomes an absolute way of living</p></div>		</li>
