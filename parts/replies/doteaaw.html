<p>Before there was the Earth, or any of the other planets in our solar system, there was basically a large dust cloud surrounding our star.</p>

<p>Serious question: where did the dust come from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The dust of different elements are formed in <a href="http://static6.businessinsider.com/image/59e4c6a71f848920008b5b93-2400/periodic-elements-table-universe-cosmic-orgins.png" target="_blank">different processes</a>.</p>
<p>Shortly after the big bang, quarks combined together to form baryons (protons and neutrons). When the universe was 3 minutes old, it had cooled enough for these protons and neutrons to combine into nuclei. Afterwards, these came together to form mostly hydrogen, and a bit of helium, lithium and trace beryllium. Heavier than that and you need a star to combine them in fusion, and then that star to explode in a supernova for example.</p>
<p>For the rare metals near the bottom of the periodic table like gold and platinum, these were created by neutron star collisions. The collision of two neutron stars was first observed with both electromagnetic and gravitational wave telescopes on 17th August <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817" target="_blank">this year</a>. A total of 16,000 times the mass of the Earth in heavy elements is believed to have formed, including approximately ten Earth masses just of the two elements gold and platinum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This has never been proven. In fact many hypothesis(and some evidence) suggest the opposite. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The physics have been proven, heavier metals move to the center. This article is about how after the Earth was bombarded with heavier metal Chondrites (meteorites) after most of the heavy metal elements had &quot;sank&quot; to the core. Some cooling had already taken place, so this article is explaining how elements like Palladium and Platinum exist in larger quantities in the mantle than they should. It is not because the forming earth ignored the physics of the rest of the universe, it is because things were still being added to the mixture while the formation was on going. The elements simply didn't have enough time.</p></div>		</li>
