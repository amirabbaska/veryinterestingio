			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much! This makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>The two theories that you mentioned seem to be objective theories with respect to the compound's interaction with the receptors in the nose. Does that mean that all people smell the same thing in the same manner? In other words, does a fart smell the same to everyone in the room?  </p>
<p>Another related question: if the only variable is the vibration of the molecule, does this mean that the composition of the compound/element is irrelevant? </p></div>		</li>

<p>The first part is a definite no. We know that the sensitivity to certain odors differs by a large margin across the human population, and it seems to be in part <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168952509000407" target="_blank">linked to genetics</a>. This shouldn't be so surprising, with so many receptors playing a role in olfaction, it's easy to see how variations in some of them can have a noticeable effect. </p>
<p>As for the second question, it's almost impossible to answer. It's a bit like saying: &quot;does everyone see the same color red.&quot; Even if we are all using similar chemical and biological machinery, the final effect (the smell/taste) is a matter of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perception" target="_blank">perception</a>. As such, it's very hard to answer the question in objective terms.</p>

<p>Not necessarily. For example, one mechanism for why vibrations should be important is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/kQqjYgG.jpg" target="_blank">sketched out in this diagram</a>. The idea is that within the receptor a signal is received when one electron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">tunnels</a> from one site (the donor) to another (the acceptor).  The role of the odorant is than to provide a bridge that accelerates this rate of tunneling by coupling a vibrational transition to this electron transfer process. Now the shape and composition could still matter in this case. For example, a molecule might need to have the right chemical structure to wedge itself into the receptor in the right orientation (or to even fit) in order to play a role in this process and be detected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any evidence for any receptors, olfactory or otherwise, that activate a signal through a tunneling mechanism?  I have some background in physical organic chemistry, so I understand how isotope effects might provide some evidence for that mechanism, but do other experiments support this hypothesis?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned in the vibration theory that different ions of an element can have a different vibration. Do ions interact with other atoms/molecules differently than their standard counterparts? What I'm getting at is do the chemicals that enter our nose interact with and/or react with the chemicals already in there i.e. our mucus? I know farts smell worse in the shower as opposed to the same fart in a small area like a car because the insides of our noses are moist in the shower. What I'm thinking is that our noses may be able to sense some kind of energy signature of the chemical reactions that are (maybe) happening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is coming wayyy late but I just wanted to add another bit of info about how we recognize specific smells that I haven't seen talked about yet. Also this is coming from a neuro class I took over a year ago so my knowledge is pretty rusty. </p>
<p>When you think of the smell of bacon, apple pie, burnt rubber, fresh baked bread, or other recognizable smells, you can pretty easily imagine the smell in your head, or you can immediately recognize these if you smell them, right? Smell is really interesting in terms of how they're encoded in our brains compared to our other senses. So we actually have hundreds of unique odorant receptors in our noses, that all attach with varying strengths to varying chemical odorants. They overlap some in what they attach to. Things we smell like bacon release many many different chemicals (odorants) into the air that will subsequently attach to various receptors in our noses, telling us hey! This is bacon!</p>
<p>For example, let's say these 16 x's are all of our odorant receptors:</p>
<p>xxxx
xxxx
xxxx
xxxx</p>
<p>And let's say bacon is in the air and attaches the receptors like so, where O = strong attachment/activation, o = weak activation and x = no activation:</p>
<p>xOox
xxox
xOOo
oxOx</p>
<p>This is how the smell of bacon is encoded! When a certain mixture of odorants enter your nose and attach to these receptors in this way, our brain thinks it's smelling bacon! </p>
<p>What's even MORE incredible is how we can distinguish between many different smells in a room at once. Imagine entering a brunch buffet. You can smell the sweet syrupy pancakes, fried bacon, and scrambled eggs in the air. There's the scent of fresh fruit like banana and melons. Someone's cooking some onions for the omelette. Oh but someone left the bathroom door open and there's the smell of poop mingling among the delicious food. Gross. </p>
<p>There are hundreds of different chemical odorants floating around the air, and maybe some foods are releasing similar odorants, all of which are attaching to our odorant receptors in our noses. At this point, so many of our receptors are being activated it's not as simple as </p>
<p>xOox
xxox
xOOo
oxOx</p>
<p>anymore. You'd think our smell senses would be completely overloaded and we wouldn't be able to tell what was in the air if things worked like our hearing works, for example. Imagine if every musician in an orchestra played a different note; we'd just hear noise. Yet, our brains can tell things apart when they're all present at once! Yay science!!! Of course how this all works isn't yet well understood as mentioned by the OP of this thread. But hopefully this is a little more enlightening for you! Thanks for reading. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this discriminative ability is due to the fact that you don't smell everything at once - you get a waft of this and a waft of that. Onions now, bacon a second later.  </p>
<p>If you thoroughly mix several aroma-chemicals with similar volatility, the task becomes much much harder. IIRC, not even experts can correctly tell the composition of such a mixture, if it has more than 3-4 components. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to jump in here and add a level of complexity to the original (fantastic!) response:</p>
<p>Smell is combinatorial. It's not ONE type of receptor responding to a single odorant; separate receptors bind specific functional groups or shapes. This means the same odorant molecule can bind a number of receptors. When I teach this in class I draw a complex shape with a squareish part, round part, and pointy part. That molecule can bind to round receptors, squarish receptors, and pointy receptors. The brain gets a signal from those three different types of receptors and says, &quot;That's lemon!&quot; Now if we imagine a shape with the squareish and round parts, but no pointy part, it only activates two of of those three receptors. The brain sees those two receptors and says, &quot;That's lime!&quot;  If a person is missing the pointy receptor (or if it's dysfunctional) then both lemon and lime molecules will be interpreted as &quot;lime.&quot; This is common for the flavor of cilantro (side note: &quot;flavor&quot; is mostly based on olfaction, not taste). Some people, about 10%, HATE cilantro, they'll say it tastes soapy. Those people are missing one of the receptors necessary for detecting cilantro. Without that receptor, our brain interprets that molecule as soap. So to answer your &quot;does everyone smell things the same&quot; question, not at all! There are hundreds of receptors, allowing us to identify thousands of odors, and differences in expression (presence or magnitude) and function can greatly change our perception/interpretation of an odor or flavor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you happen to know why some people can't tell the difference between the enantiomers that are attributed to dill and spearmint smells? I recall that the chiral environment makes one enantiomer more easily reactive with receptors than the other. I don't understand how one wouldn't be able to tell the difference if everyone has chiral receptors. If they were just missing a receptor entirely like with cilantro, wouldn't they not be able to smell it at all since each enantiomer has the same functional groups? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They sound very complementary. Use the shapes to narrow it down, then vibrations to pinpoint the smell.</p>
<p>It's basic algorithms - two small simple filters are easier and more efficient than one large complex filter. You save over an order of magnitude in accuracy going from 10k steps to 200x50 steps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's interesting actually is that the brain already does this when it comes to smell. We don't just have one smell receptor, we have 800 (mice have 1400, flies have 60) that each have preferences for specific odor. The number of odors we fan discriminate exceeds 800 though, because we use a combinatorial code like what you described.</p></div>		</li>
