			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct but a couple of disclaimers—overrun is not a bad thing. It is important to balance, taste, texture, and process. </p>
<p>High overrun isn't necessarily indicative of cheap ice cream, either. The higher the fat the higher overrun that is usually necessary to avoid shear (where the fat separates from the mix and turns to butter), at least in certain mixes on certain equipment. </p>
<p>Also, without some overrun, ice cream would be tasteless. Those tiny little bubbles of air explode like flavor bombs on our tongues. When you conduct the experiment suggested above, taste the flat melted stuff alongside a fresh pint. Despite having the same amount of fat, sugar, and everything else tasty, it lacks air and thus taste. </p>
<p>There is one ice cream company with significantly more than 50% overrun that is far superior to any super premium or super super premium ice cream I've ever tasted. So the figures above should be taken with a grain of salt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is different.  Of course i agree with your earlier comments about how important air bubbles are etc. But i personally ony like really heavy ice cream, its jst my preferred texture.   So i think any discussion about if more or less overrun is better (outside of the fact that of course some is needed) is gonna vary wildly per person :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I'm a bit confused by this. This makes &quot;overrun&quot; sound like a bad thing, but it's a direct consequence of freezing it while churning, adding air etc, which is what you want when making ice cream? </p>
<p>Are premium ice creams made of different ingredients that require less churning but still give a creamy consistency? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not a bad thing. I think it’s preference. I personally don’t like the super fluffy (lots of overrun) ice creams.<br />
You can start out with the same base product before adding air, stop at 30% for and 90% for another - you’ll have two different ice creams.  The first one is creamy but may only get a couple servings whereas the second is fluffier and lighter and has more servings.    </p>
<p>The ingredients do differ in some and that will contribute as well. </p>
<p>You should buy 2 ice creams, scoop up the same volume, then let them melt completely and see what the final volume will be. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true for the most part, but at least in the company I work for I have been told that our premium stuff (which is made at another plant) has more overrun in it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That wouldn’t make sense. Overrun = air = more volume.
What company do you work for?</p></div>		</li>
