			<div class="markdown"><p>You have an important point and I think it bears repeating more clearly:  There is a huge difference between computer code...Logic...and data.</p>
<p>If you're a computer, data might be something like a book.  If there's a few words or paragraphs scratched out of the book, maybe a missing page, but as long as the next page is printed ok you can pick up reading from there and keep going.  You might have missed a little story but your ability to read the book isn't messed up by the missing page.</p>
<p>But code, that's more like driving directions or an instruction manual.  If there's a missing page in that little booklet that comes with the Ikea furniture, you're in huge trouble.  Now yes, just like before you can try to pick up reading after the missing page but you weren't able to follow any of the steps on that page...you've missed something important, your TOMNÃ„S looks nothing like the pictures anymore and you can't figure out where to put any of the parts.  Even if you try to follow the next steps the thing'll probably fall over.</p></div>		</li>
