			<div class="markdown"><p>If the outermost nucleons are not bound to the nucleus in the case of large |N - Z|, in what manner do they occupy space? Do they exist as probabilistic clouds like electrons, even though they have much higher mass? What theory governs this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All nucleons exist in probabilistic clouds like electrons. The difference is whether the particle is in a bound state or a resonant state. Bound states stay localized within the nucleus forever while resonant states will escape with time (the survival probability decays exponentially with time).</p>
<p>Beyond the dripline, the outermost unbound nucleons are in resonant states.</p></div>		</li>
