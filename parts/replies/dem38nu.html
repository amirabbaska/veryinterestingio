<p>The speed also decreases when there's other devices on the same frequency, not necessarily connected to the router/tower and even if not following the same protocol.</p>
<p>Each device listens to the frequency before trying to send something. If the frequency is busy, it waits a random amount of time to try again.</p>
<p>When a given device is waiting for data, it actually tries to receive every transmission using the same frequency, coming from any device in range, but it can only decode the data meant for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time slots are not used by all wireless technologies. CDMA, for instance, transmits for every connected device simultaneously. The signal encoding key is designed with some mathematical guarantees to ensure the signal can be interpreted correctly by each device, even when other signals are present. Phone Aâ€™s signal just looks like random noise to phone B.</p>
<p>The catch, of course, is that as noise goes up, the ability to decode the signal goes down, which limits transmission speed. So just as with time division, code division slows down as more devices are added.</p></div>		</li>
