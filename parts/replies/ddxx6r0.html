			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that the slab is refrigerated, because you wouldn't use, say, a refrigerated piece of wood.  It matters that marble has a high specific heat, which means that it can store more heat (or coldness, in this case) and so it gets less warm when exposed to the air.  This allows it to keep the ice cream colder when its in use.  </p>
<p>There are plenty of other materials that have high specific heat (e.g., anything that feels hot when you touch it on a hot day and cold when you touch it in medium weather), and any of these things which are also non-porous would work.  Alternatively, something conductive which could have a refrigeration unit right underneath it (e.g., a metal casing) would work well too.</p>
<p>But the point is, it isn't <strong>just</strong> the refrigeration, the material matters too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pedantry for the sake of pedantry: it doesn't store &quot;coldness&quot; so much as once all the heat is removed it requires a great deal of heat to increase the temperature. </p>
<p>Based on your use of the term &quot;specific heat&quot;, you probably knew that, but other people might not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I figured it was easier to say it stored coldness than to try to explain why the things that feel hot when it's hot also feel cold when it's cold.  I figured I already was getting too technical for ELI5. </p></div>		</li>
