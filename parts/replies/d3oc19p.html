			<div class="markdown"><p>Null gravity is not the same as zero escape velocity.  If a molecule was knocked off the center point, it would then be subject to gravity.  If the molecule was knocked a thousand kilometers farther away from both, there would be a triangle involving the planet, moon, and molecule.  The combined gravity of the 2 bodies would tend to pull the molecule back to the center point or one of the 2 bodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but null gravity means the gas is up there for a while, with lots of opportunity to get hit by a high energy photon. Not all of the gas atoms would escape, but a lot would. It would be a leaking hole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pluto-Charon was one of my first thoughts. </p>
<p>In regards to atmosphere sharing though, it seems that Charon orbits at about 12,000 miles, while Pluto has an atmosphere out to about 1,000 miles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how Pluto and Charon are setup.  They are a binary system because they both orbit a point between the them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But how long would this unstable pair last? Aren't all two-body systems technically unstable? If the moon lasts for, say, 50-100 MY, that's in the vicinity needed for sentient life to appear. Or let's say a planet captures a rogue asteroid in a &quot;rapidly&quot; decaying orbit. Could the new satellite exist [without breaking apart] inside the planet's atmosphere for 1 MY?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't done the math, but no, consensus is it would not last very long at all. As the orbit degrades, friction gets exponentially stronger because it's deeper in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If they're starting close enough for us to count the space between as an atmosphere in the ordinary sense (say, dense enough for a hot air balloon), I think centuries would be optimistic. Years is plausible.</p>
<p>Satellites in low orbit need fairly frequent course correction, and the atmosphere at that height is thin enough to be vacuum by most definitions. It's definitely not &quot;air&quot;. A moon might be a lot bigger, but it's also going to have more surface area.</p></div>		</li>
