When you check the box, if the system has vetted you enough to think you are an actual person, then it just checks the box and you can go. It uses past solves, browsing habits/tracking cookies, etc. If it is unsure, then when you try to check the box, that is when you get the &quot;Pick all of the street signs&quot; dialog. Try it with a fresh browser installation and you will see</p></div>		</li>

<li>Finger movement, if you have to scroll or touch anything</li>
<li>Device movement (motion sensors)</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's both, actually.</p>
<p>Here's a quote from WIRED about reCaptcha:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of depending upon the traditional distorted word test, Google’s “reCaptcha” examines cues every user unwittingly provides: IP addresses and cookies provide evidence that the user is the same friendly human Google remembers from elsewhere on the Web. And Shet says even the tiny movements a user’s mouse makes as it hovers and approaches a checkbox can help reveal an automated bot.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary purpose is not to train AI on street signs, but to limit automated submissions.</p>
<p>So when the movement of the mouse, timings, etc. indicate that it's a human manning the mouse/trackball/pad/pointer with high enough certainty, then it lets you through.</p>
<p>So wait a bit and then miss it a few times before clicking right and you might skip the signs picking stage more often than not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the &quot;I am not a robot&quot; checkbox doesn't require a captcha when you've already solved a captcha recently. Try clearing your cookies, and you'll figure you'll have to do your captchas again. It's just a measure so it doesn't become TOO annoying.</p>
<p>The entire mouse movement, timing, whatever stuff is bullshit. First of all mouse movement is client-side so could easily be forged, second if you wanted to create a bot with humane mouse movement that'd be very easy.</p>
<p>Please, stop spreading that non-sense. It's everywhere; people think that mouse tracking is a sure way to figure out if someone's a human. It's not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You write BS. recaptcha v2 def. uses behaviour tracking, including mouse movements. You can even see it in their delivered minified javascript file.
You can also check the network tab when you open a site with a google captcha. It sends mouse coordinates in various intervals as base64 encoded data to googles captcha API.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read somewhere that this depends on how you move your cursor towards the box. A computer would go in a fast and steady motion, whereas humans tend to speed up, misclick, move in a circle etc. </p>
<p>Don’t know what they could possibly learn from this though.</p></div>		</li>
