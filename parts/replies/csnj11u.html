			<div class="markdown"><p>About the size of a turkey. Deinonychus and Utahraptor were much bigger, though (the Jurassic Park raptors were based on Deinonychus, iirc, but they decided Velociraptor sounded better) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the error comes from the source material. In writing the novel, Crichton used a source that lumped most of the raptor species into the genus Velociraptor. He used a large raptor species from Mongolia that was identified in the source as a large variety of <em>Velociraptor mongoliensis</em> but was later reclassified as <em>Achillobator giganticus</em>.</p></div>		</li>
