			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the things most people don’t know about using steam to generate power, is that there are massive heat exchangers at the outlet of the steam turbines that rapidly condense the steam back into water, creating a massive pressure drop between the inlet and outlet of the steam turbine.  The water flowing through the heat exchanger is what’s pumped out to the cooling tower where it’s distributed through nozzles and rains back down into the sump at the bottom as cool air is drawn in through the bottom and rises up past the falling water.  It’s a neat process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it should be noted that there are usually three loops in a nuclear reactor. </p>
<p>The water used to contact the reactor. Which is fed into a heat exchanger to make steam, which is fed through the turbine and then another exchanger, where a third loop of cooling water is used to condense the steam back into water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, at least in terms of pressurized water reactors.  Those pesky Soviet RBMK boiling water reactors pumped irradiated steam through the turbines.  Only two loops on those bargain basement nuke plants. </p>
<p>(I’m not an expert with nuclear power, but I find it fascinating and have read up on it some to satisfy some of my curiosity.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The one in Kansas uses a lake for cooling. The temperature is warm year round in certain parts of the lake. They even found an alligator in the middle of the winter!  Of course, there is no telling how long it was there, and it was discovered dead, but there had been rumors of it being spotted for a few years.<br />
