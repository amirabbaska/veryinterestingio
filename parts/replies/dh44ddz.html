			<div class="markdown"><p>Beside the melting of the Tokamak walls from the magnet quench, there is always the possibility of non-nuclear accidents such as turbine generator failure on the secondary side.  Thousands of pounds of rotating blades flying in all directions doesn't make for a very fun day.  The possibility of a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) would seem to be less severe in a fusion reactor than in a fission reactor since there isn't as much loaded fuel generating decay heat (heat that still exists after the chain reaction stops, often for months).  This can be partially mitigated with a liquid nitrogen/helium Emergency Core Coolant System <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITER#Cooling_systems" target="_blank">similar to what is installed at ITER</a>.</p>
<p>My imagined hypothetical worst case scenario would be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Catastrophic turbine failure</li>
<li>Loss of Coolant Accident</li>
<li>Supermagnet quenches, gains huge amounts of resistance</li>
<li>For whatever reason the ECCS decides to fail.</li>
<li>Walls of Tokamak melt and plasma escapes</li>
<li>Fusion chain reaction shuts down (only good thing here)</li>
<li>Lots of paperwork to fill out for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mind blowing to me how irresponsible they were in using a screwdriver to hold the halves apart. They did it in a manner that was fail-deadly instead of fail-safe. What the hell were they thinking?</p>
<p>There was even a term for the practice, &quot;tickling the dragon's tail&quot; and they had been warned by others that doing that shit would get them killed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Moments later, the plasma starts to collide with the inner wall of the fusion reactor, cooling down even more rapidly now that it is in contact with it - and also ruining the wall, and potentially burning a hole into it to destroy other parts of the reactor.</p>

<p>I doubt that the thermal energy contained in the plasma would be enough to burn a hole in the wall...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're dealing with plasma that's measured in the millions of degrees, like as hot as the core of the sun. There's no known material that could withstand something like that. There's a reason magnetic containment is used--it literally suspends the plasma in mid-air so it doesn't touch anything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of a full breach, definitely not - might be (note: I am not an expert in magnetoplasmadynamics) if there is only a small &quot;leak&quot; in the containment, and so the energy gets concentrated in one spot.</p></div>		</li>
