			<div class="markdown"><p>If they are really having to go at it to get your teeth clean then it's probably a good indication that you are not brushing effectively, missing 6 month cleanings or not flossing enough. I brush with a regular old toothbrush but I brush and floss in the morning <em>after</em> breakfast and brush and floss before bed. I will occasionally gargle with hydrogen peroxide which does an amazing job of bubbling all of the gunk out of my gums. I haven't had a cavity in almost 10 years and every time I go in for a check up the hygienist comments on how clean my teeth are. They do very little scraping. Totally worth the extra 60 seconds each day to take really good care of my teeth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dental hygienist here. You make some great points! I'd also like to point out that if you receive regular cleanings, brushâ€‹ and floss, then the cleaning itself won't hurt!! That's because when you slack on your hygiene and gingivitis sets in, your gums become infected/inflamed/irritated. Just like an infected wound on your hand, it hurts! When you effectively remove plaque bacteria and food debris on a regular basis it gives your gums the opportunity to heal. Healthy gums do not bleed.. not even a little. Not to mention the multitude of other diseases that can be brought on by poor dental hygiene. Your mouth can make you sick. Even kill you.
I'm also a HUGE proponent of hydrogen peroxide as an oral rinse! It works significantly better at killing bacteria than any other rinse you can buy. You can use it every day. For optimal health: floss first, rinse with hydrogen peroxide 20-30 sec, brush thoroughly focusing on the gumline. Don't forget your tongue!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And not scrubbing your gums away. </p>
<p>Note that not brushing allows the plaque to create the calculus/tartar and that will push the gums back.  </p>
<p>That's how it works.</p>
<p>Flossing helps to remove the build up between your teeth before it hardens into calculus/tartar, which helps prevent gum recession, which keeps the teeth in your jaw bones, which we like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Flossing helps clean between teeth AND gum margins, which is where plaquelikes to  hide until it hardens into tartar. It's important people remember this. Floss is way cheaper than restorative work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly!  If there's a lot of calculus (or if it's tightly attached to the tooth - we call it &quot;tenacious&quot;), it can take a lot of scraping to get off completely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually just went to the dentist for the first time in 28 years last week. I had really messed up spots between a couple of teeth, this ugly black line at the gum of one of my front upper teeth, I had chipped the back side of one of my front bottom teeth, I figured they were going to tell me I had tons of cavities and needed pulling and root canals and crowns and everything.</p>
<p>Nope, it was all calculus. I spent over an hour in the chair with the hygenist. She threw everything they had at my teeth and the end result was, it was 100% calcified plaque. The chip that came off my tooth? Plaque. No cavities, no nothing, just tartar.</p>
<p>I literally felt like I had a whole new mouth. My entire bottom row of front teeth had calcified together, I can now feel all of them independently. Apparently, I have an overproductive amount of calcium in my saliva and that's likely the only thing that kept the nearly three decades of dentist avoidance from wrecking my mouth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 10 years ago I moved to a small rural town and ended up going to the local dentist.  They immediately take me to this room/girl who had been to a conference on gum disease.  The dentist bragged he didn't even bother with gum issues because she handled it all (yes, I'm just giving this info bluntly, and anyone should say to me: &quot;why were you so stupid?&quot;  Well, I had never had a bad dentist experience before).  So, after they did &quot;testing,&quot; they come back and tell me I had advanced gum disease, and treatments must start.  So began weeks of visits, wherein I let these non-periodontist people rip my gums back, scrape, hurt me and also, I had to nightly do this rinse.  It was a kit.  (Oh, and I paid $$$ for this horror).  I did what the kit said.  After a few weeks, my gf says, &quot;you're teeth are looking dark.&quot;  Long story short: the rinse had layered my natural smooth enamel with a rough layer, that now, any dark liquid easily stained.  I tried over 3 sessions explaining this to them.  I even printed out google searches, that showed the rinse would do &quot;permanent damage in stains&quot; to teeth.  They denied, denied and I finally stopped going to them.  I went to a real periodontist who checked me out fully, and told me I had no gum issues.  To this day, I work with a dental hygienist who knows the whole story, at a dentist I trust, and have saved several friends and family who let me know their local dentist wants to do gum work on them.  I tell them, &quot;NO!  Go to a real periodontist to get an opinion!&quot;  I have had to augment my diet, stay clear of dark sodas and tea, and I visit my hygienist about a half dozen times a year for cleanings.  Luckily, I have great insurance.  I have resisted getting any kind of veneers on the advice of my dentist/hygenist who say I have great teeth, and since she is so good, I probably have healthier teeth now than ever, but they will forever stain if I don't keep up the visits.</p>
<p>tl;dr: because of a bad dentist who was not a periodontist, I deal with permanent stains on my teeth requiring a half dozen professional cleanings a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh. Good god. I'm sorry. If it sounds like a sales pitch, it is. That makes me sick. About ten years ago there was a push for starting soft tissue management in general dentistry (mind you, we are very very capable of treating 4-5 mm pockets non surgically in general dentistry, I will treat up to 6mms), because perio is a well known money maker and we are capable of treating it in the early stages. The general dentists wanted a piece. So you got this stupid piece of crap toothbrush for $150 and a kit of crap to take home. I HATED selling that. I'd tell people to go to Target and get a Sonicare, but yes, you indeed have early periodontitis and I can confidently treat that here. I got in trouble for not selling toothbrushes. I told the doc that I didn't believe in them and research has been done over and over again on Sonicare toothbrushes. I wouldn't recommend snake oil to my clients. Ever. I still don't. </p>
<p>Another scam? ZOOM in office bleach!m. Save your money, kids. Please. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a dentist.  I've had TONS of dental work due to &quot;night grinding,&quot; as in 11 teeth (all molars and a few premolars) have crowns--17 crowns, as some got replaced.  Three molars were rootcanal-ed from damage due to all this pressure.  One of these molars was really damaged (2 cracks and a hole, below the gum line) and required an implant.</p>
<p>Personally, I floss first--sounds gross to some, but often while I'm watching tv, hours earlier--so that my gums are &quot;relaxed&quot; for when I brush before going to bed.</p>
<p>When I brush, I just let the ends of the bristles touch my teeth.  I've read about 2 minutes is all that's needed.  That's only 30 seconds or so per quadrant, inside and outside.  I probably take a bit more time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plaque is easily removed with daily brushing and flossing. When the plaque sits there and calcifies is when a hygienist has to scale it off. I used to brush really hard also, as that is what I was taught by misinformed family members, but my dentist showed me that I was having fun recession due to my brushing habits. He then explained to me that brushing your teeth should be like dusting window blinds, and that you only want to lightly stroke and do it over and over again versus beating the shit out of them. That made sense to me :)</p></div>		</li>
