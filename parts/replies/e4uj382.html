<p>EDIT: okay I get it. Also, a lot of you are replying with instances of accidents, kicks, and other general testicular impact scenarios that do not qualify as a “sucker punch.”   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. My wife's family friends kids both punched me in the balls one right after the other and their parents just laughed and didn't discipline the kids at all. I immediately left and went to sit in the car to wait for my wife. To this day I don't want to be around those parents, my wife thinks I hold too much of a grudge- but seriously fuck those people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the testicles begin emprylogically in the abdomen just like ovaries, and then descend. Their nerves and blood supply come from around the level of the kidneys. That's another reason why their referred pain gives the impression of abdominal pain. </p>
<p>Also, the body is very good at identifying pain affecting the musculoskeletal system, but cannot pinpoint pain affecting the internal organs which is typically referred, as in the heart attack example. So when you are kicked in the nuts, you feel the easily pinpointed pain from the scrotum and surrounding area while the testicles produce a deep referred pain to the abdomen. They are obviously in a unique anatomic location since they begin as an internal organs in development before descending and externalizing.</p>
<p>I always thought the reason for this was that historically, knowing the exact location of visceral pain was not an evolutionary advantage. For example, saying, &quot;my ascending colon&quot; hurts would not help someone fix the problem before the age of modern surgery, and just a general sense of vague pain would be enough to entice a person to rest. Meanwhile, saying, &quot;my right toe hurts&quot; would be important to avoid stubbing it again. That's just my theory though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once had a severe cyst rupture in my ovary that required immediate emergency surgery and I was in the hospital for two days. Weirdest thing though was that I had pain in my stomach area and shoulder blades. My sister kept cracking jokes so when I’d laugh I’d get excruciating pain in those areas so I was screaming at her to stop lol. It was because of the pain receptors as referred to in this comment causing this. </p></div>		</li>
