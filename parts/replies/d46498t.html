<p>If you mix, say, blue and yellow pigments, they each reflect their color and absorb most of the rest</p>

<p>It's more of the opposite: they each absorb their complementary color and reflect most of the rest.  </p>
<p>Otherwise mixing anything would be black: if blue (or more accurately cyan) absorbed everything but cyan, and yellow absorbed everything but yellow, the mix would absorb everything because the yellow part would absorb any cyan light and vice versa.  It would look black.</p>
<p>Instead, what actually happens is that cyan absorbs mostly its complementary color (which is red) and reflects the rest (notably green and blue).  Similarly, yellow absorbs mostly its complementary color (blue) and reflects the rest (notably red and green).  The mix of the two would absorb red and blue and reflect the rest: it'll look green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate it when people describe cyan and magenta as being blue and red. Cyan is just as green as out is blue, and Magenta is just as blue as it is red.</p>
<p>The difference between red and Magenta is the same as the difference between red and yellow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another nit-pick: when you say &quot;spectrum,&quot; you really mean &quot;wavelength.&quot; A spectrum is just all possible choices (ie. the electromagnetic spectrum -- contains all colors of light and more) and a wavelength is a specific measurement which can connote a certain color of light. You could probably also substitute &quot;frequency&quot; if you prefer</p>
<p>EDIT: Slight adjustment: &quot;spectrum&quot; is technically correct (as mentioned below) however vague</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No I meant spectrum. Most pigments are not going to reflect a single wavelength but more likely a small spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alright, I'll concede that to you. It just was a bit jarring. Perhaps in the future you could clarify a bit. Especially when explaining to 5-year-olds</p></div>		</li>
