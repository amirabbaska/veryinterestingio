Fossil alien life is even harder. There are 6 types of fossils, or biosignatures, that we are searching for, each requires a different type of instrument to find and none of them is conclusive of life on its own. This means sending a suite of instruments to the right places and hoping that alien fossils look like what we think fossils should look for. </p>

<p>The benefit of Mars is that nearly everyone thinks that any evidence of life we find on the surface would be as fossils, long dead. This means that we can search without fear of causing harm to living things. The icy moons might have environments where life is alive today. Some missions, like flying through the geysers of Enceladus would let us test for organics with little risk to any current life, but deeper studies, like searching the underice ocean of Europa would risk hurting or contaminating the very life that we want to find. </p>

<p>If alien life looks like life on Earth, then we do have a decent chance of finding it with our spacecraft and instruments, if it is very different than we might pass right by and never know... </p>

<p>Thank you for the question!   </p></div>		</li>
