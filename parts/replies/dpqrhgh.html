			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually very intersting for radar applications. Atmospheric refraction causes the radar pulse to travel in a curved line which allows you to see beyond the horizon. If you want to have exact radar measurements and you want to get the maximum range out of your radar system you have to take it into account. It basically allows you to see around corners which really gets me excited. </p>

<p>You want your car radar detector to detect the police gun as soon as possible and before the office has a clear line of sight. When the radar pulse refracts around the corner, your radar detector can notice there's a speed trap before you take the turn or go over the hill.</p>
<p>Police know this and use their gun conservatively. When you see an police use the gun, notice how they'll look for a car they suspect is already speeding before they target them and activate the gun. </p>
<p>Each time the gun is used, little bits of the radar gets spread throughout the area, allowing cars approaching to detect the speed trap. </p>
<p>Even though most of the radar is focused on a target car, it still refract before it reaches the car. That's enough to light up detectors around corners and over hills.</p>
<p>Also, radar that bounces off the target car is reflected and refracted throughout the area, giving detectors more signal to detect. </p>
<p>You can see this effect with a regular red laser. Shine one in a dark room and you'll see the entire room get a bit brighter. That's because the laser is refracting off the air in the room (and also reflecting off the wall) enough to brighten up the room. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another issue in areas where the water temperature is hotter than the air temperature (see North Arabian Gulf) is surface ducting which causes the radar waves to travel between a layer around 30m above the water and the water. You get some very strange things happening with the radar bouncing off of the peaks of waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was impressed by Cody of Cody's Lab demonstrating light's strangeness when he shows off an aragoscope which puts a solid object to block out a light source and takes a long exposure to record the light that was successful in bending around the blocking object.  </p>
<p>In the end he was able to take a picture of a bright light with a cross on it from 100 yards away (or so) at night to still show there was a cross pattern on it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Any electromagnetic wave of any frequency will refract passing through any medium.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, through any medium that it <em>can</em> pass through. Won't refract through lead, for example...</p></div>		</li>
