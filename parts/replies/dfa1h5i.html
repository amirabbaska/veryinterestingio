<p>That's like literally the point of lawyers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the client has a really good case for an offer in compromise it is really hard to get. I've seen maybe 2 out of the 50 I have done got accepted. That program the IRS has is really just a scam anyways. Unless you are likely to die of age before the CSED dates pass or those dates are coming up it is unlikely you will get it. Not to mention the time it takes the IRS to process a 656.... </p>
<p>Lesson of that rant.... pay your damn taxes and don't fuck with the system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like credit repair companies. Most of what they do is just argue that your various lines of bad credit are in error. For a short time (about 15-45 days), you have an extra 120 points on your credit. When all your creditors respond with proof that you do indeed owe them money, your rating is returned to normal. </p>
<p>Not the worst strategy if you are looking for a small loan, but it's all shit that you can do yourself. </p></div>		</li>
