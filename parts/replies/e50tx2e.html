			<div class="markdown"><p>To be pedantic, 2018 in Japan is &quot;Heisei 30&quot;, but it's often abbreviated to H30 or even just 30. The year resets to 1, with a different name prefix, when a new Emperor takes reign. </p>
<p>Japan was supposed to change over to the western style year system some years ago but only partially did. Many things such as train tickets (depending on the company) retain the old date style. My JR pass from a recent visit actually showed the expiry date as 2018 but the year of the issue date was 30, just to confuse people!</p></div>		</li>

<p>From what I've seen the Taiwanese Government and official documents tend to use the Minguo calendar but that could just be because I only see it through work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Muslim calendar is based on the prophet's journey (PBUH) from Mecca to Al-Medina, the months names used in the Islamic calendar are way before Islam (it was called the Arabic calendar), the recording started by the order of Omar Ibn Alkattab 5 years after the prophet's death. It was 16 years after the prophet's journey. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. And in response, the Bahá’í calendar (known as the Badi) begins counting from the day that one of our twin prophets announced that he was the Báb(Arabic for 'Gate' - Bahá’í believe that the Báb was the one who predicted the coming of the Most Great Prophet, Bahá'u'lláh).</p>
<p>The current date in Badi is Asma 10, 175 BE. </p></div>		</li>
