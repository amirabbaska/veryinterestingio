<p>I'm pretty sure if children were raised in a place full with (blank) metal cans, and these cans would be handled just like random rubble and pebbles by the adults (and they wouldn't have access to canned food otherwise), they would be perceived as a natural part of the world, just like ... pieces of stones are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We are very good at pattern recognition, and the shape of a tin can is pretty telling that it is unnatural.</p>
<p>There are even things that are natural yet may look unnatural, e.g. some pyramid shape on a foreign planet (could be said though that's because we've been trained with our own pyramids).</p>
<p>I see a path made with stones and don't have to be told that stones don't naturally occur in a path with somewhat straight edges. But I'm not sure if the stones themselves were chipped (shaped by man) or solely carefully picked.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plenty of patterns in nature that seems extremely unnatural.</p>

<p>One of these patterns is man-made, and the other one is naturally occurring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only if you hide from them the origin of the cans, but that would only slow thier learning. Eventually they'd come to know that nature grows, is shaped differently, and exists in distinct environments from these man made objects. The smart ones would then guess it was man-made and the dumb ones would blame aliens or God.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am speaking of a hypothetical isolated environments with ≈ late neolithic technology level.</p>
<p>There is also no source of them, as they are just there from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Now, the metal cans needn't be all exactly the same. There might be those made for 300ml, 450ml, 500ml... thin cylinders, thick cylinders. With time they will all get dissimilar natural dents and other debris. They won't be similar.</p>
<h4>But even if they were:</h4>
<p>Let's take 2.5x2.5x2.5cm^3 diamond cubes instead of metal cans.</p>
<p>Even if they are identical they wouldn't be perceived manmade. At most &quot;special&quot;. (Which might well be understood as &quot;divine&quot;).</p>
<p>Your claim that they would figure, that because something is identical it would be man-made has actually a strong post-industrial-revolution cultural bias.</p>
<p>Before mass-produced merchandise even manmade products were merely similar, but never exactly like each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>'Should' isn't the appropriate word here - it's extremely subjective and betrays the reality of how materials are formed and used. We use iron to make bridges, and iron occurs in nature.  We insulate (or used to insulate) houses with a magical fibrous flame retardant mineral (that is also incredibly carcinogenic) called asbestos - and it occurs in nature. Some polymers (plastics) occur naturally. Heck, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_nuclear_fission_reactor" target="_blank">naturally concurring nuclear fission reactors</a>.  </p>
