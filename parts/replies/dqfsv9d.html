			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little unclear. Bodybuilders looked at a picture of a regular dude and said &quot;I'm as muscular as that guy,&quot; then looked at a picture of Mr. Universe and said &quot;I'm <em>more</em> muscular than that guy&quot;? That seems weird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're looking for rationality in an irrational mental health condition. BDD causes people to hold conflicting pieces of information, knowing that they're wrong but feeling emotionally unable to dissociate from it. </p>
<p>It's also worth noting that as a compulsive disorder, BDD manifests as an escalating pattern of behaviours. The more you try to change your body, the more extreme your DESIRE to change your body becomes. It's a self-fulfilling cycle, because the more they change their body the more extreme they want to make it because they don't perceive any differences from before, and so now they go &quot;well I guess I should go more radical then&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's hard to get my head around. I mean, I understand it's a disorder that makes you see yourself differently than you are; I get the idea of a buff person looking at themselves in the mirror and thinking they are not very buff, just like an anorexic sees themselves as fat when they really aren't. I don't get how one person can honestly visualize themselves as a pudgy weakling and a gigantic muscle-man <em>at the same time.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it has to do with 'plain wrong about how they look', yes, as people with BDD are no longer sufficiently able to distinguish between how they look objectively (take in to account that there's not much objective in what looks good as beauty ideals differ through times and cultures), how they think they look, how they feel they look and how in their opinion the should feel or look about their body. </p>
<p>Presenting them with facts like their BMI or whatever does nothing for them. That's rational reasoning where they whole problem with the disorder, the disorder itself in fact, is irrationally about ones appearance. </p></div>		</li>
