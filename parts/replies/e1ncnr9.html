			<div class="markdown"><p>Because your eyes &quot;turn off&quot; when the muscles moving them (I don't know why - I assume this is the brain's way to stop you being dizzy with a suddenly changing image). Your brain keeps the previous image until your eyes are re-positioned.  </p>
<p>Look at a fastly moving, but repeating object (like a rotating bike wheel) and quickly move your eyes - for a moment you can see a still image long enough to recognise the pattern of the tire - it feels like the tire &quot;stopped&quot; while your eyes are re-adjust itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The same reason why when you glance at an analogue clock with a ticking second hand, it looks like it looks like the second hand has stopped moving for a moment.</p>
<p>I'd like to believe that red light ticket I got a few years ago was the result of chronostasis. I'm positive the light was yellow the moment i entered the intersection, but officer begged to differ.</p>
<p>Edit: not sure why I spelled &quot;analog&quot; the British way. I'm from Philly...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wanna see something even crazier? Go look at your eyes in the mirror - try to see them actually move as you shift your gaze between the left and right eyes. You canâ€™t, your brain filters out the motion, but if you take video of it or watch another person do it, you can clearly see the movements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funner fact : there are 6 different mechanisms/systems for your eye movements. The ones you described are the smooth pursuit and saccadic movements. One more I can remember off the top of my head is the Optokinetic mechanism. There's one more that keeps your eyes fixed if your head is jerked suddenly and another to co-ordinate with your neck muscles and inputs from your inner ear. </p></div>		</li>
