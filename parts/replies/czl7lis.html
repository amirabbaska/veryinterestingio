			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be a simple answer, sadly in practice people tend to use these terms interchangeably. </p>
<p>I'm an accountant but i work in corporate finance - so underlying company earnings are a key focus of what we look at in a business being acquired or sold. Lets use an example, and i'll explain how we would try to look at &quot;profit&quot; using each of your terms.</p>
<p>Company A has three divisions, they sell clothes, watches and hats. Sadly they've been losing money on hat sales, so they have decided to shut this business down.  They shut it down half way through the year, and had to pay for redundancy costs, and a bunch of other things. We'll call these the &quot;exceptional costs&quot;. </p>
<p>Now, I'm going to buy this company, i want to know a few things. </p>
<p>1) What is the &quot;normal&quot; profit of this business?
Clearly we've had some exceptional costs that are not normal, we so we'll exclude this from our normalised profit. </p>
<p>2) underlying profit.  I'm buying this business that will be continuing as a seller of clothes and watches.  So any losses or related costs that resulted from hats, before it was closed, aren't really part of its &quot;underlying&quot; profit.  So i will look at their normalised profit but i will also remove anything to do with hats.</p>
<p>3) adjusted - now we have some fun and games.  Lets say that this business was owned by one person - who was completely in charge.  If he is in charge then the way he gets paid is through dividends - which isn't part of profit.  Now, i'm gonna buy this company and it needs a CEO, so i would, say, add in a cost of what i think a market would pay a CEO. In this case, we'll go with $300k.  There will be some other similar items. </p>
<p>We didn't mention pro-forma profit.  This is similar to underlying, but assuming we bought a new division in the year half way through.  To get a &quot;pro-forma&quot; profit, we'll make some assumptions and try to build up what a full year would look like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's simplifying GAAP and non-GAAP numbers to a misleading degree, or misrepresenting the appropriate time to use non-GAAP numbers as a more accurate representation of a company's health. There's a use for both numbers, and both are very valid meters of a company's performance, but in many cases, those &quot;one-time large structural investments that are only for this year&quot; happen every few years, and I think you are implying they should all be written off. If it's a truly one-time thing, non-GAAP numbers become more useful. If it's something that only happens every few years, but regularly, or many miscellaneous things that happen within a giant conglomerate that come out to what I'm sure is a general average every year, GAAP numbers become more representative, or at least more important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Very large companies tend to be going through a number of projects at any given time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They do, and so often that it becomes a regular part of doing business and you can expect them to happen every year. That's why looking at GAAP numbers would be far more accurate than writing them all off...... Preferably look at GAAP and non-GAAP in a case like that.</p>
<p>Here's a quote that I think sums it up pretty well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We believe that the best EPS measure for valuation purposes sits somewhere between pro forma and GAAP EPS, where in between varies by company, industry and sector,&quot; wrote Deutsche Bank's David Bianco in December 12 note to clients. &quot;Although pro forma EPS can overstate true EPS, GAAP EPS can understate true EPS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, that's not an ELI5 quote, but explain the simple concept of GAAP and EPS and it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some things that can't be described in a sentence without sacrificing essential parts of the answer. I think this is a question that requires like five whole basic sentences. I know five sentences must be a lot for a five year old, but this sub isn't for literal five year olds.</p>
<p>My first post wasn't my form of an ELI5, it was a question and argument I guess.</p></div>		</li>
