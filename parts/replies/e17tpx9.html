<p>I've noticed that I can start classifying people by their facial appearance alone, kinda like how those with Down's all have similarities, but not related to any disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you smile at someone and they smile back, a message is communicated. When you look someone in their eyes, the way they respond to that focus tells you about them.</p>
<p>Autistic people struggle to pick up on social cues, and our primary means of conveying our understanding of social cues is, you guessed it, through our face.</p>
<p>I used to teach kids, and I taught a few autistic children along the way. They definitely wear it on their face.</p>
<p>It’s most noticeable when you say something to them like “Wow, that was really great! You’re doing a great job!”</p>
<p>“Normal” children will (most likely) get excited and smile or say something or look at their parents or REACT in some form or another that externalizes their internal emotional reaction to your compliment. </p>
<p>Autistic children would turn and look at me and sort of investigate my presence with their eyes as if I were an alien. They don’t really have an emotional reaction to communicate beyond confusion or uncertainty because the implicit emotional content of your statement never reached them. </p>
<p>So when you look at their face, you scan their reaction to determine what’s going on, and even if most autistic people don’t “look” the same, their difficulty in picking up subtextual cues ends up being communicated (by their face) relatively similarly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't buy that it's all about people's health.  I think a lot of it has to do with social influence and communication.  Many people will listen to you more if you have a better looking face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe health is the wrong word. I guess the best word (or phrase) is fitness to survive. </p>
<p>I think that adequately covers the realm of social status as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add the word prosper.  With a k-selected species, mating choices are more about intra-specific competition than survival.  To add to that, humans have been the dominant species in the global ecosystem for hundreds of generations.  I think people today want to have good looking, smart, wealthy etc families because those characteristics give them and their children a better chance of doing well in society.  Looking back 100,000+ years, it's not hard to see why people may have expressed mating preference with women who could have more children and survive childbirth and with men who were strong enough to protect their family from predators and other humans.  Back then, humans were more of an r-selected species.  The sort of pretty-faced, skinny girls that are popular in fashion nowadays would likely be seen as less attractive back then because their thinness would be correlated with malnutrition.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that is partially learned. A cute or pretty or attractive child is going to be treated slightly differently than a child who is, ugly. The pretty one will get all kinds of positive feedback and will probably be more confident at least of how they look. That will translate into a certain expression or demeanor. The other kid might have a kind of guardedness or unsureness to their expression. More people will want to listen to the confident, expressively in tune face. I'm making all this up but it seems possible.</p></div>		</li>
