			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere that ligers don't stop growing because they dont get the gene to do so from a female lion which could cause health problems but tigons do not have this issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are actually both fertile unlike many hybrids so you can get weird combo's. I don't know if one survives better but I believe ligers are at least more common if not healthier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thought about the sperm to egg fertilization.  The size of the mixed breeds head would have to be a consideration too.</p>
<p>A modern female's body probably couldn't handle the Neanderthal head size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many modern female's bodies can't handle our <em>own</em> head size - we've worked right around selection for birth canals, and it's likely that eventually, <em>all</em> births may need to be Cesarean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely correct.  Sometimes a hybrid's viability depends upon the relative sexes of it's parents.  There are some specialized cat breeders mixing wild and domesticated felines that only produce offspring with a wild male mated with a domestic female.  Then to complicate matters the second generation hybrid must also follow the same pattern to produce offspring.  The relative sexes of the parents can be very important.</p></div>		</li>
