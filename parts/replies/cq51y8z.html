			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic! See this is educational... alot of the time when transgendered people are portrayed in the media talking about being transgendered, alot is made of the fact that they &quot;feel&quot; a certain way but very little is portrayed as being based on science... so thanks</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's good that somebody has tried to explain this. I think it's a genuinely good question that a lot of people may not know the answer to. But I have seen this question asked in other places and some people freak out and are so offended by the question like &quot;How dare you insinuate that being transgender is a mental illness!!&quot; without actually acknowledging what the question is really asking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really think it is sad that mental illness still has such tremendous shame and aversion attached to it. There is no fault or guilt in it, just a noteworthy deviation from &quot;normal&quot; that may or may not have a negative impact on interaction between people. The stigma doesn't help anyone cope with or overcome their challenges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just speaking from a linguistics point of view here, &quot;transgender&quot; is an adjective, and is neither a verb nor a noun. People are not &quot;transgendered&quot;, they are &quot;transgender&quot;. Similarly, a trans person is not &quot;a transgender&quot;, they are &quot;a transgender person&quot;. </p>
<hr />
<p>If you replace &quot;transgender&quot; with &quot;happy&quot;, it might help.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A lot of the time, when happyed people are portrayed in the media...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn't work, does it? However:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A lot of the time, when happy people are portrayed in the media...&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does work, because &quot;happy&quot; is an adjective.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I have an explanation for this. There is no objective medical 'test', or at least not yet, that a person can go through (like an MRI or whatever) and be told &quot;yep, there it is, that little dot means you're transgender.&quot; So the single most accurate way we are able to tell is by a person's own personal report of their experiences.</p>
<p>Aside from this, perhaps they do not want to push the notion that a hypothetical physical test is the end-all be-all conclusion of whether or not someone is trans.</p>
<p>Or maybe it's purely Lazy Writing and they don't consider these when casting Emotional Trans Woman #15 to recite her Traumatic Life Story. Eh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mental illnesses are also neurobiological in nature and are also real. You can see results very similar to the scientific evidence you present for most mental illnesses - changes in brain structure and functions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. But the human body is mutable enough with regards to gender that it is possible to change large aspects of someone's sex to bring them mostly in line with their identified gender using existing technology. This is effective and has a very high success rate, in the high 90s percentage. No mental illnesses have that level of success.</p></div>		</li>
