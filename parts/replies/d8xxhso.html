			<div class="markdown"><p>As you said above, we have issues with doing it in sustained, controlled amounts. I will add to that from what I know. So we have created fusion in a lab environment, so it is definitely possible, whether it is a net positive is looking grim, but still in the realm of possibility. </p>
<p>First, we have made fusion, but it is slightly different from the sun. The sun has it easy as it has massive amounts of elements and gravity on its side. So because it has this extreme amount of matter inside of its core it has a much higher chance at fusion. Yes fusion is giant roulette inside of the sun. This is due to quantum tunneling. In short, if you have a large amount of energy on one side, the side in this case the suns hydrogen is on. On the other side is this nice low energy helium; sometimes the elements will just fuse. This is just because they &quot;want&quot; to go to this lower energy state, so they have a very small probability of just ending up on this low energy state. In this case the states was fusing into helium. That is way over simplified, but that's the best I could do in Laymen's terms. </p>
<p>Second, the suns gravity. So the sun also has a massive amount of gravity on its side, helping push the atoms close together creating better conditions for fusion to happen. Fusion only happens when an atom has enough energy, and hits another atom in a specific way and they both have enough energy. Although, that energy requirement is sometimes circumvented from the quantum tunneling I tried to explain above. So when you add the suns gravity, atoms are closer together. This in turn helps the chance of atoms hitting each other which would help the chance of fusion occurring.</p>
<p>Finally, is fusion a golden goose chase. In short, it's not certain. The deeper explanation is that it was possible, at least by our theories, and models. Recently we weren't getting the data we expected from the model. Namely they weren't getting a net positive of energy from fusion. Yes we have fused tritium, but not like the sun. We have to compensate for the suns mass and gravity, so we just add more energy. The more energy the particles have the higher chance they are going to hit each other. Also due to the higher energy, the area where they have to collide to fuse is also larger. So we just compensated with adding more energy. We were able to achieve a net zero once, but never the positive that the model predicted. Using the data we had gained from more tests we drew up a new model. In this model, it seems to be that it is impossible for us to get a net positive from fusing particles. Unless we have the mass of the earth of hydrogen shoved into a lab, and we give it enough energy to fuse, we won't get a net positive. So the old model said that it could be done, and the new one says it can't, we have been wrong before so it is possible but it isn't looking good for the moment.</p>
<p>TL;DR: an old model said we could have went positive of energy from fusion in a lab, new data adding to the model says it can't be done. We have been wrong before, so it is possible that we just can't do it at the moment. Or our model is wrong once again.</p>
<p>For the fusion info, look for the data/stories of the National Ignition Facility. That is where I got mine. Sorry if I bored some of you, thanks for making it all the way to the end, even if you did only read the TL;DR.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that a pile of composting yard waste produces more power (heat) than an equivalent amount of volume at the Sun's core.  The sun just generates all the heat it does because of how utterly <em>massive</em> it is.</p>
<p>So if we want any sort of reasonable Fusion Power Plant, we need to compress hydrogen plasma to temperatures and pressures well in excess of the center of the Sun.</p>
<p>Easy to do in the heart of a fission bomb for a few instants. Hard to do anywhere else for any sustained amount of time.</p></div>		</li>
