			<div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 answer is; because when your body produces melatonin during the day this donks up the natural balance of melatonin and cortisol. Although feeling lonely and depressed in the morning is also a common phenomenon called seasonal affective disorder in clinical populations:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being alone effects me a little more, just enough to be noticeable after waking up than it does during the day. No depression, but a lack of interest in doing the things I normally like to do. I tend to watch a lot more youtube on mornings when my wife has already gone to work whereas when I come home from work and she's sleeping, I'm gung-ho for some PUBG.</p>
<p>If I make myself do something I like, I jumpstart myself out of that somewhat meloncholy mood after 20 or 30 minutes. Sometimes (due to work schedule changes) I'll use melatonin as a sleep aid and those are almost exclusively the days this effects me. </p></div>		</li>
