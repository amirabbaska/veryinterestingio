<p>You used to be able to change your DNS or use VPN to enter blocked sites such as Twitter or Facebook but since a few months changing DNS stopped working and they blocked the IPs of every known DNS servers. And sometimes when there is a terror attack or a scandal in the government the ISPs slow down the internet to an unusable level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm living in Istanbul. I can still change my DNS to Google (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4). This unblocks 'soft blocked' websites such as Imgur. You can change this both in your PC settings (both OSX and Windows) and in your router settings. If you're on Android you can download <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dnset" target="_blank">DNSet</a> which does the same thing and works on both WIFI and mobile internet. I'm not sure if you can change DNS on IOS (iPhones).</p>
<p>The VPN blocking issue is slightly different. I'm using Private Internet Access which was recently blocked. However, I found that if you use an <del>OpenDNS</del> OpenVPN client instead of PIA's own client it works perfectly. This will work on all platforms (even IOS) and instructions are on <a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com" target="_blank">www.privateinternetaccess.com</a>. Of course you'll need to get some sort of free VPN to access that website (there's loads on the Chrome Webstore and Play Store, just make sure you've deleted them after you've used them). I mainly use PIA to circumvent ISP throttling of video streaming such as YouTube. It is paid, and there's a chance that all access will be blocked in the future, so keep that in mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, more simply, elect folks who at least know what net neutrality is. Many representatives are dangerously tech illiterate and just go off of what lobbyists tell them. As much as this ELI5 is clear and concise in describing the dangers of no net neutrality, ATT can easily pay someone to draw up a nice ELI5 about how no net neutrality saves lives and stops pedophiles. </p></div>		</li>
