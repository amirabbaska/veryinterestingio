			<div class="markdown"><p>One possible reason - it is beneficial to the plant for the fruit to be eaten so the seeds get spread around, and so fruits evolved to have lots of sugar or other desirable nutrients as bribery.  On the other hand, vegetables are other parts of the plant, often ones that are important to the continued existence of the plant, and a lot of them evolved to have various nasty chemicals in them to say &quot;fuck off and stop eating me, I'm trying to grow here&quot;, so they don't taste as good.  One of the jobs of the liver is to shred nasty chemicals so we can eat them anyway.  </p>
<p>Domesticated vegetables may have less of this effect due to human-influenced selective breeding - we like to pick the plants that taste better if possible.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, peppers are spicy because birds can't experience spiciness. The pepper &quot;wants&quot; to be eaten by birds and nothing else. EDIT: Obviously, peppers can't want anything. I'm just explaining it ultra-simply assuming we both understand how natural selection works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also fruits and other things you listed are more calorically dense. When Homo sapiens first emerged in Sub Saharan Africa there wasn't a whole lot of food and a lot of competing carnivores. Craving these foods would be an evolutionary advantage because they would sustain us longer and you would need less of them, problem is now we have an abundance so we deal with complications of over feeding. Your probably wondering why then doesn't it reverse so we crave the healthier lower calorie food? Well natural selection doesn't work that way. Once a trait becomes apparent in a species it won't just devolve once it moves past its use. The only way the trait would cease to exist is if people that held that trait did not have the ability to reproduce. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sugars. </p>
<p>Fruits are a vector for plants to spread their seeds. They made them very sugary so that they are eaten more often and can spread their seeds better. They are very nutrient dense which means they provide a lot of energy for very little effort which makes them prized by many animals. </p>
<p>It should also be noted fruit is relatively rare in most of the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also in evolutionary terms, you can get to baby making age and successfully pass on your genes having a diet rich in fat, salt and sugars, and low in the good stuff. Having a &quot;healthy&quot; diet is more about surviving to and thriving in old age which evolution does not give a hoot about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, many people dislike vegetables alongside many other food items due to never having had eaten them properly prepared... or having had been forced to consume the nasty versions of dishes containing them.</p>
<p>Examples:
Canned, overcooked, mushy etc green beans hold no candle to fresh quickly blanched ones. </p>
<p>Lightly sauteed cabbage with seasoning vs. an overcooked gray/brown fall apart equivalent that smells of something horrendous.  </p>
<p>Same goes with fish.. if improperly prepared or &quot;too well aged&quot; it can alienate a person for life. </p>
<p>Other things such as liking Soda can be a learned preference... at least it has been in my case.. still cant really tolerate the overt sweetness and acidity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure what you dislike about carrots... we can explore that and see. </p>
<p>Radishes are their own thing some like em (I do) some don't... usually the dislike is due to the inherent &quot;spicy&quot; astringency in which case could try a different type of radish. Daikons are nice and mild. Tons of different asian recipes to prepare radishes in various ways. But still really hard to get away from the spiciness etc. </p>
<p>Eggplant can be cooked to taste like bacon. Nice smoky and caramelly kinda like this. <a href="https://georgiaabout.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/frying-eggplant-copy-2.jpg?w=640&h=503" target="_blank">https://georgiaabout.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/frying-eggplant-copy-2.jpg?w=640&h=503</a>
Used to make stuff like that alongside pan fried mushrooms for the vegetarian burger I served in my former restaurant. </p>
<p>Edit: Also tons of different types of eggplants out there.. the worst of which for a variety of recipes is that big purple one that everyone sees in the store. Also, many people buy their eggplant improperly.. that is going for the biggest one they see. Which is a bad idea.. they are usually too old, excessive bitterness, may have seeds, dry insides, discoloration.. the works. Best to go for the smaller ones.
