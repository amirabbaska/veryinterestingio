			<div class="markdown"><p>its not just litigation, its that we have 50 states with slightly different and strange laws. we are not going to make one product for one state and another for another. that is why there is expiration dates on water. some state decided that everything sold in grocery stores must have expiration dates. so water bottling companies make up an expiration date to satisfy that state. bu of course they are not going to make a bottle just for that state. all boots now have expiration dates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really excellent point, especially when you consider how truly nasty a lot of anaerobic bacteria can be. And they grow very well in an environment like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if they're used to store water maybe?</p>
<p>But how is a dry plastic bottle that is filled up with cold tap water and then emptied within, say, 12 hours, a good growing environment for any bacteria? The tap water doesn't bring food for bacteria.</p>
<p>If you're saying that there could be traces of anaerobic bacteria in the bottle after a while, I concede that point, but is that even dangerous to a healthy human? Can't you easily smell anaerobic bacteria before they would be numerous enough to be dangerous to a healthy human? I say &quot;healthy&quot; for a reason, obviously people with specific problems should be taking specific precautions... but probably tens of millions of people refill water bottles every day.</p></div>		</li>
