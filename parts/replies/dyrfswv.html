			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this one caldera in New Zealand (now a lake <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Taupo" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Taupo</a> ) when it last erupted The resulting ash turned the sky red over Rome and China. IIRC Yellowstone is bigger than the Taupo caldera so the eruption could very well throw enough ash into the atmosphere to course a real problem</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Krakatoa was a fun one too. The eruption removed 70&#37; of the island and the sky changed color worldwide. For years. The Scream painting (1893) was likely influenced by the super red sunsets created as a result from that explosion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention it was the loudest sound in all of recorded history. It ruptured eardrums in a 40 mile radius was clearly heard 3000 miles away. That's something happening in New York city and being able to hear it in Los Angeles. In fact you could be 500 miles out to sea from LA and still clearly hear it.</p>
<p>Edit: Due to the attention this got here's some more fun.</p>
<p>The &quot;sound&quot; waves from the eruption traveled around the planet 4 times before dissipating.</p>
<p>Also here is a video of the 2014 eruption of Mt Tavurvur in Papua New Guinea that captures the moment of the <a href="https://youtu.be/BUREX8aFbMs" target="_blank">eruption with sound</a>. Now imagine that but big enough to blow up an island.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's postulated that the Toba supervolcano eruption in Indonesia 70,000 years ago created a volcanic winter (similar to nuclear winter, dust in the atmosphere blots out the sun) that nearly brought humanity to extinction. All humans on Earth today are extremely genetically similar (far more homogeneous than most animal species) and it's been suggested this is because the catastrophe reduced humanity to a population as small as 1,000 individuals, who are now the ancestors of every human on Earth since. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 2nd time St. Helens passed gas in a big way, I was living on the Oregon Coast. Got covered with a half of foot of ash, 200 miles away. What I found amazing was: The prevailing surface winds are from the West. The ash shot so high the jet stream (moving from the East) picked it up, sent it out over the Pacific, then dropped it. It looked like snow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mt St Hellens was only about 1 cubic kilometers of material.</p>
<p>Krakatoa was about 20 cubic kilometers of material. It killed almost 40000 people...in the 1800s. And was one of the worst eruptions in relatively modern human history. It dropped the global temperature a couple of degrees for 5 years after</p>
<p>Mount Tambora in 1815 was ~160 cubic kilometers. Probably the largest eruption in modern human recorded history </p>
<p>So....Yellowstone at 1000 cubic kilometers is in a league of its own </p>
<p>But...let's not forget the big Cauldera under Naples Italy they think could blow at any time now</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm assuming there's nothing we can do with modern technology to help &quot;clean&quot; up the mess that a Yellowstone eruption could cause? Not even sure what could besides a giant vaccuum to suck up all the ash. There's nothing that can neutralize the ash in the sky or anything? Am completely clueless on nature type shit. I just make metal parts for a living. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is the scale of things. Stopping the wind from a desk fan is easy, setup a couple pieces of cardboard and you're done. Now try stopping a hurricane that's the size of Texas. The energy contained in a system if leaps and bounds beyond what we can contain. </p>
<p>But let's say you could capture the ash.  Where would it go? You have 1000 km3 of stuff that needs to go somewhere!</p></div>		</li>
