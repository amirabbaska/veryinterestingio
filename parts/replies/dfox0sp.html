<p>What kind of math are you trying to do here?</p>
<p>Also to actually answer some of your questions at the end for those who want answers, the &quot;mass&quot; of the proton that we measure is actually the particle's invariant mass of all the quarks and gluons that make up the proton. While the gluons are massless, they have so much energy (quantum chromodynamics binding energy or QCBE) that they are the main contributors to the mass of the relativistic mass of the proton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since there is some text in italics I assume that there is a star somewhere that got converted. It's <code>2 * 2.3 + 4.9 = 9.4</code> and <code>2.3 + 2 * 4.8 = 11.9</code>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. This shows up fine for me. I'm just naively adding up the uud and udd triplet masses. Hopefully the formatting is fixed for you.</p>
<p>I'd also just like to point out that the CETQ datasets here seem to show that a good chunk of the mass also comes from a small number of relatively high energy quarks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He didn't use an escape character with an asterisk in the two-digit numbers that appear. I.e. 22.3 should be 2*2.3 but he left out the &quot;\&quot; symbol in front of the asterisk, so instead it just italicized the &quot;2.3&quot; part.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because of E=mc^2?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! Technically it's mass expressed as eV/c^2 since eV is a unit of energy, but writing c^2 everywhere is kind of tedius so usually it's left off.</p>
<p>This also reflects the point of view that mass and energy are essentially the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, from your value of say 2.3 MeV, should I divide by c^2 to get the true value of mass or should I multiply by c^2 to get energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually there's a good reason why on a first approach they could be assumed to have the same mass.  For simplicity's sake, an element's isotope is disinguished by its nucleon (proton + neutron) count. The slight difference in mass and the effect of the binding energy makes it such that the actual atomic mass of an isotope turns out to be a wee bit smaller than its isotope number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah. That's a really good point. IIRC for this reason, historically the mass difference was what in part gave hints that nucleons are not fundamental particles.</p>
<p>Since OP is thinking about proton substructure though, with that question I was shooting more to highlight why the valence quark model can't be the full story here.</p></div>		</li>
