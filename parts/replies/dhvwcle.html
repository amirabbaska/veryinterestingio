Second surface mirrors are typically a sheet of glass with some kind of coating on the back. So every time a reflection happens it is happening after going through a layer of glass. After many reflections, the faint tint of the glass starts to show in the same way it is difficult to build a two feet thick wall of glass without that same green showing.</p>
<p>That's just what I imagine happening, I don't know for sure.</p></div>		</li>
