			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Human stomachs can be anywhere from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_acid#Secretion" target="_blank">1 and 3</a>, so 10x is more of a lower limit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can. Think about water sources. If I am born and raised in India, I can build up a tolerance to all sorts of nasty things. However, if I arrive there from the West, I should drink purified water. This is pretty much the immune system in action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While it's true that you will develop some measure of resilience with prolonged exposure, the trade off is that things like low-grade diarrhoea are endemic and constant for a staggering number of people in the developing world.</p>
<p>Indeed, Diarrhoea <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4367049" target="_blank">kills over 100,000 children annually in India</a>, to put this in some perspective - and around <a href="http://www.cghr.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Causes_of_death_2001-03.pdf" target="_blank">8% of <strong>all</strong> deaths</a>. It's worth mentioning that this is an enormous improvement over the past.</p>
<p>To clarify, I'm not in any way disputing the point you make, just ensuring people understand that the immune system has its limits, and a measure of protection acquired from repeated exposure is neither comparable nor preferable - and assuredly not an alternative - to sanitation infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This depends on the type of bacteria once again. Also, many protozoans, viruses, or fungi cannot be easily defended against or create immunity through exposure. </p>
<p>In that way your answer is slightly misleading. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You definitely see our immune systems adapting to different pathogenic bacteria. People travelling to different countries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveler%27s_diarrhea" target="_blank">often get diarrhea</a> because they are not immune to the bacteria in the drinking water, while the locals have no problems. So maybe you could develop some tolerance for the bacteria in rotten meat too. But since each rotten carcass is carrying a different range of pathogens, there would be a bit of a Russian roulette game being played even if you built an immunity to a few of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria is simply not the only issue, fungus spread their mycellium through food in about three days, you don't see it until its is fruiting and spraying spores onto other food, meanwhile it is producing mycotoxins which are some of the mouse carcinogenic substances on earth, and no we can't build a tolerance to cancer, the more genes you turn on by exposure to carcinogens the more likely you are to accelerate cancer growth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One final piece to this is the nature of animal digestion itself compared to human digestion. For humans, are food spends a short time in our stomach and a long time in our intestines. With some animals (including common house pets), the food will sit in their stomach for a much longer time getting more acid washed, but spend very little in their intestinal tract, which is much shorter than ours comparatively.</p></div>		</li>
