			<div class="markdown"><p>I once swallowed whole and alive, a series of really large gold fish back when I was in high school as a stunt. It was at a block party. I drank them in a glass of water.</p>
<p>Each time one went down my throat, I felt it flop inside my belly rapidly before it eventually died. It was a very interesting sensation, like a pulse in my stomach.</p>
<p>There is something called the esophageal sphincter that holds stuff in your stomach. Though I did get some light indigestion from the experience, everything was fine.</p>
<p>I know that you're asking about large animals specifically, but in some circles I am considered one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A teacher in my high school got fired for taking a bet that she could swallow one of the classroom catfish.</p>
<p>It ended up puncturing her esophagus and she had to be sent to the hospital.</p>
<p>Protip: Catfish have barbs on their fins specifically as defense mechanisms. Do not swallow them unless they are dead and prepared as a meal.</p>
<p>The goldfish thing is really interesting and simultaneously horrifying. The last few minutes of that poor thing's life must have been a nightmare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to be eaten by a giant shark is in the ejected capsule of a one man submersible. That way you can climb out after you have been swallowed without being crushed. Next you pull out your lucky megalodon tooth and slowly but surly cut through the it's stomach lining, crawl out, and stab the shark in the heat with the tooth. </p></div>		</li>
