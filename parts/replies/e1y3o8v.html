Edit: that didn’t include a new strap.</p></div>		</li>

<p>$4250 is more than a lot of brand new Breitlings. What was done to it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That amount does seem very high, especially when their top service cost is $850

Maybe it was a special edition or possibly he really damaged the watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At that point the price of the skill is probably a lot more than the price of the materials. And it might be more difficult to figure out the issue with a broken watch and repair it while keeping as much of the original components as possible than to make a new one from scratch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because master watchmakers are rare and it costs a lot to train them. The expensive watch community treats them like art and that explains the odd pricing scheme</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These luxury watches are completely mechanical, there are no electronics.   They are powered by wind-up springs.   When striving for exact time-keeping with a mechanical watch, it takes more and more intricate parts, of extremely tough material so it doesn’t wear, machined into extremely precise, unique shapes.    Each watch design is almost like its own little universe ticking and whirring away behind its clock face.   </p>
<p>They are relics of the pre-electronic era.   Some people value the art and science of these masterpieces of engineering-art, others value the prestige of paying for something so damn expensive to make.   The mechanical watch makers are finding it increasingly difficult to find engineers with the requisite handcraft skill to make or repair these watches, so extensive  in-house training is necessary.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to this the stores that sell clothes under $20 dollars have to sell more to make ends meet. So if say your operation costs were $5000 a month before you make a profit you would only need to sell 1 or 2 watches before you saw that shop make a profit. While for that clothing store they would need to sell 250 shirts before they start to make a profit. So these high stores don't need the high volume of people to walk in like the low end stores. I have worked in high end and low end retail and high end is more easier when people come in they are there intending to buy and have the money to drop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>$5,000 is funny. There’s at least one Rolex store in Manhattan that costs likely about $2,000 per square foot in rents per year. Likely somewhere around $350,000 per month.</p>
<p>Sometimes the locations are just about having the location.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Some locations are &quot;flagship&quot; stores which are effectively advertising. The Hershey store in Times Square for instance does not turn a profit on the location, but the signage alone is worth more than the retail space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well $5000 dollars is just an example. The Rolex store in Manhattan also has a very very large customer base that it can make a profit even with $350,000 in rent that would be only selling 70 watches a month. There's over 350,000 millionaires in NYC alone so there is certainly a store customer base to be able to reach a 100 sales a month, combined with the brand name anyone making over $200,000 year also buys them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Midtown commerical rent is $80-$100 per square foot per year. Let's say Rolex's store is 10K sq. ft. And $100 per sq. ft. Thats $1M in rent per year. Since Rolex has been there forever, I would assume their lease is somewhere in the $50-$75 per sq. ft. range. But even at $1M rent per year, thats about $83K a month in rent. Thats about 10 watches a month to cover rent assuming they pay that rate and assuming their store is 10K sq. ft. Both assumptions which I believe are higher than what it actually is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A watch strap is not part of service. It is something you buy per piece.</p>
<p>Full service is usually $500 for most watches - and only when/if your watch is not running on time. If parts are broken then you will need to pay for the parts on top of that. I have only needed to pay for a part once and that was $40 on top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally consider replacing a worn out leather strap with a new one part of &quot;servicing&quot; a watch.</p>
<p>But you're right in a sense that ordering a new strap is just like ordering a product.</p></div>		</li>
