			<div class="markdown"><p>Inverse square law counts, so does your cross sectional area. A person occupies about 0.7m^2 of space. Radiation spreads over a sphere. So, if you operate your WiFi across the home, say 4 to 10 metres, so you are only getting about 1/300th to 1/2000th of that dose - call that 0.05mW to 0.3mW.
That's an incredibly tiny amount of energy. To put it into perspective, the sun hits you with around 10 to 100 million times more radiation, or 1,300,000.00mW of broad spectrum electromagnetic radiation - including radiation in the same frequencies as your WiFi - for 12 hours a day. (Let's ignore neutrinos, unless someone wants to claim they are mutating...).
So, the size of your body and the distance from the emitter matter as much as the power.
Feel free to calculate the non-spherical emitter pattern of the microwave oven. I'm too lazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth remembering that the sun is a (mostly) blackbody source with it's peak radiance a long way from 2.4GHz. I did some back of envelope stuff and got angry at wolfram for a while and eventually figured the suns intensity at 2.4GHz at the Earths radius is most likely around 1mW.
It makes sense if you think about it, if the sun was pumping out WiFi ours wouldn't work very well on earth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this indicate that WiFi routers are pumping out more energy at that frequency than is present in ambient sunlight?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your skin, subcutaneous fat and muscles protect those organs from rf radiation. It can't magically teleport to your center; think of your microwave, the outside gets hot before the inside. Same thing with all rf energy,so skin cancer is the most likely not brain cancer and yet no one ever worries about that.no it's always the rf magically teleported into my brain and gave me brain cancer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's wrong in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The resonant frequency of a water molecule is no where near 2.45GHz  (2.45 * 10^9 Hz) it's difficult to model precisely, but if by &quot;change position&quot; you mean &quot;rotate&quot; then measurements generally put it closer to <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/169173/what-is-the-resonant-frequency-of-liquid-water" target="_blank">10^13 to 10^14 Hz</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because of issues with interference with pacemakers, current microwave ovens allow 0.005 watts of leakage, not 1-2 W. The rules may have changed now, but a few years ago I modified a cell phone to stay under 100 mW broadcast power (as opposed to the 2 W maximum power it was capable of) so it could be used in a hospital without the risk of it interfering with medical equipment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you microwave your cup of tea, you don't stand pressed up against the oven (you'll probably be 1-10 m away), but when you use a laptop it sits on your lap (so it's only 1-10 cm away) so exposure on your testicles from the laptop is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse-square_law" target="_blank">10,000 times stronger</a>. The same problem exists with cell phones -- you should worry about the phone, not the cell tower, since a closer cell tower means the phone broadcasts at a lower power.</p>
</li>
<li>The sun does not bombard us with 2.4 GHz radiation. The reason the 2.45GHz frequnecy is used is because there isn't a lot of interference. The 2-4 GHz range is also used for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave#Microwave_frequency_bands" target="_blank">ship and weather radar</a> and this wouldn't work if there was millions of times more 2.4GHz radiation from the sun.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might want to look a bit deeper.</p></div>		</li>
