			<div class="markdown"><p>Requiring the user to use a combination of ASCII characters are secure, sure.</p>
<p>However, some websites and schools I see place restrictions on what passwords cannot be. Such as: A password cannot have an upper case letter as its first character. A password cannot start with a number. A password must not end with a number. A password cannot be a lowercase character in its 2nd position. A password must contain a special character in its 3rd position.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All such form rules limit the brute-force search space (easier for attacker), but exist because people are trying to increase the number of guesses required for a <em>dictionary</em> search (which should make things <em>harder</em> for an attacker).</p>
<p>All security is made up of these sorts of trade-offs, and some people make fairly stupid ones -- but the mistake is usually being overly-worried about a particular attack rather than seeing the bigger picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ran into one that would not let you use repeating characters.  Anywhere.  I get that you don't want your users to make passwords like 'aaaaa', but the password I couldn't use was something like 'octopusesandvac<strong>uu</strong>mcleaners8729'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But where did the lower case restriction come from in your example? I don't think that is what op was saying. The number of 8 character passwords is greater than the number of 8 character passwords that contain a number.</p></div>		</li>
