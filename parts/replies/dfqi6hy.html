			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this experiment for my thesis paper and surprisingly my teacher said the waves are progressive. Needless to say he doesn't know anything about physics as he also argued that waves in a one side open vessel can have even numbers of harmonics (or whatever word it was that can't occur and only occurs in odd numbers) and he rationized this by using the flute as an example. Which is clearly a two side open vessel. Anyways. .nice detail! </p></div>		</li>
