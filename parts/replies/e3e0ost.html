They’re based out of Fort Hamilton They’re under control/ordered by New York state and have been operating since 2001 (9/11 attacks). As someone who commutes everyday through NYC, I do feel safer by having them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For some reason, this reminded me of the scene in (I think it was Old School?) when the character kept trying to get through TSA and the metal detector continued to go off each try,  causing the soldier to get more and more suspicious to the point where he was waving in backup and pointing his rifle at the character. Good laugh!</p>
<p>It was shortly after 9/11 and it was a time when it was not uncommon for very visible military presence in airports.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That feeling should be normal. An abnormal amount of security presence can cause people to believe something might happen, even if the reason for more than usual is completely random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a random antiterrorism measure (RAM). In order to maintain unpredictability against anyone who would be trying to determine patterns, identify weakpoints, or exploit what they consider weaknesses, you will randomly vary aspects of your presence in the area. This can be random searches of people going through checkpoints, different patrol routes, different entrance/exit points, or an increased number of men and equipment. Keeps the bad guys guessing. </p></div>		</li>
