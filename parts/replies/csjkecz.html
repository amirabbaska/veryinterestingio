			<div class="markdown"><p>Churches are independent from the law.  They can choose to marry anyone, or not, and it's just a spiritual union, and not legally recognized unless it's properly licensed by the government.  Religious clergy are authorized by the law to solemnize a marriage, but that applies to any religion, plus notaries, judges, etc.  So they can decline to carry out a marriage ceremony, but that wouldn't prevent a gay couple from getting married.</p>
<p>EDIT for clarity because that looks rambling and unclear:  church marriages in the US are traditional just like in your country, but also legally binding IF properly licensed, and you don't have to go through a church to be properly licensed and get married.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. Aleksandrov, I'm curious as to where you live? If we viewed the legal contract and the religious institution separately (and preferably only called one of them marriage) over here in the US, I have a feeling this wouldn't have been nearly as big a deal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks.  I'm not sure it would have made a lot of difference, though.  Nobody was ever trying to force churches to do what they didn't want to.  It hurts my heart to think about, but I really think the majority of opponents just don't want to see homosexuals receive the same rights they have.</p>
<p>And, yes, also curious:  Where do you live, Aleksandrov34?  That sounds like a much more sensible setup, whether it would have helped the process here or not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From what you know, do you think a lot of churches will refuse wedding same-sex couples?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many will. There are quite a few progressive denominations and individual churches out there who won't, but definitely a lot that still view homosexuality as an abomination and would never consider being a part of such a union. But I'm no expert on religious studies so I'll leave the listing of what denominations will and won't to someone else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Churches are not managed by the government; we have a Constitutional clause that says government can't make laws about how a religion operates, and 200+ years of court precedent on what the exceptions and limits are to that principle.</p>
<p>Different states have different rules about who can be an officiant and therefore conduct a civilly-recognized marriage. In all of them, clergy can do this simply by registering with the State, which means you don't need separate ceremonies. Also in all States, there is a non-religious route through a clerk or judge or the like. In some states, any citizen can register to be an officiant.</p>
<p>But the short answer is that churches are able to conduct a single marriage that is both civil and religious, as long as they follow the rules for conducting a civil marriage when they do so. However, churches are not <em>required</em> to marry anyone they don't wish, because there's always the option of a civil-only marriage.</p></div>		</li>
