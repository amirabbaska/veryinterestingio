			<div class="markdown"><p>With CRISPR, you could conceivably genetically modify humans to produce cellulase in their intestinal wall. </p>
<p>But since fiber protects against colon cancer, you'd need to address the lack of it in cellulase+ humans.</p>
<p>...and the cellulose would just turn into a bunch of extra sugar, so for anyone besides starving people it might suck. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactase#Industrial_use" target="_blank">Lactaid</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-galactosidase#Over-the-counter_brand_names" target="_blank">Beano</a> are enzyme extracts that break down various sugars. You could extract <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulase#Uses" target="_blank">cellulase</a> from vats of recombinant bacteria, and package it similarly. That way the blessing/curse of cellulose digestion wouldn't be persistent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really sure, I'd guess the answer is 'in theory'. Digesting things like cellulose requires not just the right bacteria but also a lot of time. Animals which can make use of cellulose typically are ruminants or have very, very long small intestines (or both). The human small intestine isn't especially long so it's unlikely, even with the right bacteria, there would be enough time to make much use of the cellulose in your diet.</p>
<p>Interestingly bowel/gut length is well correlated to diet. Carnivores tend to have shorter small intestine (3-5 times body length) as they don't need to process much plant materials, herbivores tend to have long small intestine (10 times body length). Omnivores like humans typically have a gut length somewhere in between.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So a few years ago was catching up with an old friend, now a biochemist whose lab collaborates with some gut microbiome labs.  She told me in passing that firmicutes with the ability to extract calories from lignin have been identified in human microbiomes. I've never found confirmation of this though. Do you have any idea what she may have been referring to and where I might find info?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, but the gut is very competitive and doesn't let new bacteria in easily. The new bacteria would also have to be able to survive in the environment. Currently hospitals do give fecal transplants where the clean the bacteria out of the poop in a healthy person and give it to a person with a bad gut microbe population, like people who have taken extreme antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great info.  I read once that diets that are too constrained for too long will result in the death of those microbes that can digest the foods that aren't being eaten.  And because the appetite/food cravings we sense in our brains are the result of chemical signals sent from the active and/or dying microbes in our guts, that in time if one eats only a few things (think only pizza, or only salads, etc.) that our brains will eventually only be getting signals from the microbes that can digest those, with the end result being a vicious cycle whereby after only eating one thing for too long we will eventually only crave that one thing.  The explanation made sense to me, but I'm wondering if there's any truth to it - anyone else here of that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not so sure about the cravings for certain foods part, but most definitely a restricted diet, particularly those lacking in dietary fiber will result in a less diverse microbiota, which can have important health consequences. One theory is that this is the root cause of the increased incidence in autoimmune type diseases seen in the Western world compared to the developing world. Additionally this less diverse microbiota is to a certain extent heritable as your children more or less get their microbiota from you, so these issues can be transmitted down through generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The are few experts who would claim to understand the gut microbiome more than very slightly. A few weeks ago one such expert was on a reddit and had just given up working on a oral tablet to replace fecal transplants, because it was ineffective. He did comment on the apparent increase in &quot;unfriendly&quot; bacteria in response to high carbohydrate diets. Equally there was an increase in &quot;friendly&quot; bacteria in response to high protein diets. As an ibs sufferer I would concur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add some interesting additional info on the idea of bacteria 'waiting turns' or the premise of nutrient sharing - it has been shown that certain bacteria which are capable of degrading complex polysaccharides, utilize 'selfish' mechanisms of nutrient degradation/importation when degrading low abundant, highly complex polysaccharides. Meaning they invest so much of their own resources into targeting and degrading 'niche' nutrient sources, they do not want to risk the loss of any sugar to the gut lumen for other gut bacteria to harvest (and thereby providing themselves with an advantage under low nutrient conditions). Conversely, the same bacteria genus, when faced with high abundance, low complexity polysaccharides (such as inulin like you mentioned), degrade these 'simpler' polysaccharides in a manner which freely liberates oligosaccharides into the gut lumen, which can then be scavenged by other members of the gut microbiota as energy sources. To put it simply, the food source is so simple and/or abundant the bacteria doesn't 'care' about freely 'sharing'. Here is the reference for those interested; <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/full/nature13995.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v517/n7533/full/nature13995.html</a></p></div>		</li>
