			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the Japanese competitive eaters get a pretty decent living out of it, but probably only at the super super elite levels. Joey Chestnut apparently made &gt;$200,000 one year (maybe multiple years, I dunno), and Takeru Kobayashi has apparently earned $3 million from eating contests.</p></div>		</li>

I'm sure that contributes to their earnings. There is no equivalent in the US market to my knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree it’s a good idea to exercise no matter what your eating habits, I don’t think there’s any way to exercise away the amount of overeating that guy did. I used to eat in an all-you-can-eat cafeteria at my university and there was also this tiny little Asian man that would have four or five trays of food every single meal. A lot of the students would marvel at how much he ate and he probably weighed 90 lbs. My father in law is Korean and can also eat more than anyone I’ve known personally and is still skin and bones. I think there might be some gene that’s more prevalent in Asian ethnicities to allow this?? </p></div>		</li>

<p>It's like running a marathon. You only do that once every so often, and your body recovers in between. One day of eating 20k calories won't make you fat or unhealthy. Eating 5k a day and not exercising for 2 years will.</p></div>		</li>
