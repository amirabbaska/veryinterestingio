<p>Thank you... people get so wrapped up in impedance matching sometimes...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The antenna on my car looks like it has two wires with one spiraling around the other. The stock radio has built in support for sat radio. Would that design be how they get both antenna lengths into one form?</p>
<p>edit: Here's a pic. The antenna on my older car looks close to 4 feet long, while this one is around 2 feet long.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might be wrong, but at least one function of the spiralling wire is to cut down on vibration. Karman vortex shedding can cause your antenna to vibrate violently as it travels quickly through the air, IF it's a cylinder.</p>
<p>It's the same reason you see spiral structures wrapping around tall smoke stacks and other tall, cylindrical structures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found this which seems to make sense to me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spiral shape increases the bandwidth of the antenna, at the expense of gain. It also mechanically shortens the antenna, versus if the same length of antenna were kept straight.</p>
