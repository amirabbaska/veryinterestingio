			<div class="markdown"><p>Death sentence in dry af Texas summer, too. Absolutely would not recommend unless you are a person who has become accustomed to working out in the hot sun. Heat stroke can happen in a matter of &lt;30 minutes. </p>
<p>Extreme heat isn't something to fuck around in. Please don't try it out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low Desert in SoCal has the same issues. OSHA mandates shade here considering it gets into the 120s during summer. As someone who has gotten used it it, I can spend hours exerting myself physically w/o water, but I still keep it with me. People that come here from the PNW(Pacific North West) regularly die because they hike without sufficient hydration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ahaa tell me about it man. When we were kid we used to spend full days getting stoned in the local parks - which were basically big fuck off fields with trees and benches all 30-60 minutes away from any shops. I'd always bring a big bottle of water but rationing betweeen four people is rough. Inevitably it would often get to the point of &quot;I'm too stoned and thirsty to move... but I'm soooo thirsty&quot;.</p>
<p>Worst time ever it was 32 degrees C out. We smoked a nice blunt. Then had to ride (cycle) 6 miles uphill to a shop lol. Passed the fuck out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tripped acid in the woods with my roommates last week. We were hiking for seven hours total. Five hours in 80 degree weather and we went through 2 of our 6 bottles of water (between 3 people). The second we stopped to smoke a blunt we went through 3 more bottles and basically had a panic attack. We were a mile and a half from the entrance to the woods with one bottle of water and we were all parched. Luckily intelligence prevailed and we rested in the shade for 45 minutes, saved the rest of the blunt for later, and made it out without even touching the last bottle. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That's your problem right there man. Fuck.that.shit. Never again.</p>
<p>The one time I took acid I didn't drink for most of the very intense 24 hour trip. It was bad. No one should be allowed drugs <em>that</em> strong IMO.</p></div>		</li>
