<p>A lot of trends (fro yo, cupcakes, etc) draw a lot of me-to business owners, who may not have the skill or business savvy of others and fight an uphill battle to compete with the established players.</p>

<p>Most businesses fail. Most rich business-people have failed a lot. Most of these had rich family and friends and got bailed out.</p>
<p>Business is a pyramid. At the top people make money without often needing to even provide a great service. At the bottom it's a lottery.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most franchisors will sell a franchise to anyone who can afford it, but it depends on the company.</p>
<p>Some are more invested in the success of every franchise and will work with the franchisee to scout locations and things like that. </p>
<p>But, on the other side, some franchisors make most of their money from selling franchises, so they don't care if the stores stay in business. In fact, some of them can actually make more money if an individual franchise goes out of business because they can sell it again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but if McDonald's and Starbucks are Tier 1 franchises, froyo franchises are like Tier 5. Usually bottom of the barrel in terms of upfront costs, etc. </p>
<p>The irony is that ice cream (and similar) shops have, in theory, great profit potential; however, you can't decide to put your froyo franchise wherever you want. You're usually in a relatively high-rent commercial district. Plus, you pay franchise fees and profit sharing. And you get none of the benefits of the cold, dirty word of running a cash business as you would if you were an independent ice cream shop. In the franchise world, everything has to be above board, which is a little discussed topic in this realm. </p>
<p>Edit: Saying &quot;Tier 5&quot; (a made-up term in this context) is a bit of an exaggeration in terms of the whole scope of possible food-Bev franchises. That said, compared to McDonald's and Starbucks, it's still a pretty fair comparison. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a big one like Pinkberry would... but it does seem that it's a segment of the restaurant market where there are more non-franchise individual businesses, or small chains that might not be as rigorous.</p></div>		</li>
