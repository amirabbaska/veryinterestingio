			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, so if you close one eye the colours look different to if you close the other eye? How do you know which colour is correct and which one is not? This is fascinating. Thanks for sharing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything is just SLIGHTLY more red. If I look at a piece of paper with the crushed eye it looks very faintly pink, but colours in both eyes are almost exactly the same. And there is nothing in the cornea or fluid of the eye that can be seen tinting the eye. It just seems to be a weird side effect of being squished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excuse me for prying further. Do you know if the damage was to the eye itself or to the brains connection to that eye? I don't know if the perception of shade within a colour falls into the same category as the perception of altogether different colours but it's a start. </p></div>		</li>
