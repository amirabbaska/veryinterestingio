			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't mean to bring in a videogame to this sub but Assassins Creed: Black Flag had &quot;Rouge waves&quot; in it which were devastating if not properly managed by your sea craft.  I thought that was a nice touch.</p>
<p>To be clear, I only mention the game because it is a way to teach kids that these things are real, and happen often, but as you said there's not many of us out there (the ocean) to observe them.  They are quite terrifying to behold. Even with that being said, I doubt an aircraft carrier or a cargo ship would have much trouble negotiating them. We've known about them for a long while now and have procedures to counter them, albeit they come quickly and without warning. </p></div>		</li>
