			<div class="markdown"><p>While Professor Olson does the TYPE of work described in the OP, it is important to note that the type of information you know limits the type of information you can deduce. For example the reason he was able to determine the time of the V-J day photo was because the date, location, and direction we're all known quantities, allowing determination of the time. A moon from an unspecified night in an unspecified location is a very different set of constraints.</p></div>		</li>
