<p>This. IDK about the regulations in the US, but in Germany (possibly whole EU) there exist export restrictions for a broad list of items that are &quot;dual use&quot; (i.e. are not weapons, but <em>could be used</em> to manufacture weapons). Examples are high precision ball bearings or magnetic bearings that can be used to build centrifuges (which again are used to enrich nuclear fuel).</p>
<p>So if someone would like to build a plant with a lot of centrifuges they would have to source even &quot;simple&quot; parts like their precision bearings on the black market while the intelligence services of several countries are on the lookout for just such transactions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. There is an international organization known as the Nuclear Suppliers Group that has a list (the Dual Use List <a href="http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/images/NSG_Part_2_June-2017.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.nuclearsuppliersgroup.org/images/NSG_Part_2_June-2017.pdf</a>) which details. The controls deal with almost all parts of the process involved in making a nuclear weapon, but many of them are specifically targeted towards stopping someone from illicitly building a centrifuge plant.</p>
<p>The earlier responses are also correct - the Oak Ridge plant used nuclear diffusion, which uses a mind boggling amount of power. Centrifuge plants need less. But you still have to figure out how to make/import a bunch of highly specialized industrial products, like vacuum pumps, high strength steel/carbon fiber, and magnets.</p></div>		</li>
