			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not too sure about that.  Yeah, CO2 + H2O &lt;-&gt; H2CO3, but as it goes flat, CO2 leaves the system, and our old friend Le Chatelier kicks in and the H2CO3 breaks down back to H2O and CO2.  Repeat until entirely flat, and all the CO2 should leave the drink.  Maybe there is some small amount of stabilizers or something that keep H2CO3 in solution?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy is right. The pH is dependent on the species at equilibrium in solution. Once the CO2 leaves, there's only water left, which returns to its equilibrium pH of 7. This isn't homeopathy, the water doesn't have a &quot;memory&quot; of the CO2. </p></div>		</li>

That's how I understood it. Most likely wrong lol.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are incorrect. Carbonated water is only acidic because of dissolved CO2, which is no longer dissolved when the water goes flat.  In fact, it is the acidic flavor when carbonated that makes it taste good.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbonic acid is very unstable and decomposes into CO2 and H2O quite quickly. CO2 floats to the surface and is lost in the air. Even if Carbonic acid would increase the acidity of the water it will do it for a very short time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>You could think of the carbonate system as being 4 separate steps.</p>
<p>1) CO2 and H2O (Dissolved carbon dioxide gas in solution)</p>
<p>2) H2CO3* (Carbonic acid) - (the asterisk means &quot;effective&quot;, because we usually treat this as the sum concentration of dissolved CO2 and the actual carbonic acid and use that sum as the concentration for carbonic acid in the equilibrium kinetics in the next step). This is a strong acid. It can donate up to two H+ ions.</p>
<p>3) HCO3(-) (Bicarbonate). What forms after carbonic acid donates one H+ to lower pH. Bicarbonate can act as both an acid and a base, because it can both accept or donate an H+ ion. At pH&gt; 6.5, it will act as more of an acid. At pH &lt; 6.5, it will act as more of a base. This is why it is referred to as a &quot;buffer&quot;. It offsets changes in the solution, whether that is adding or removing H+.</p>
<p>4) CO3(2-)  Carbonate, a base. Can accept an H+ ion to become bicarbonate.</p>
<p>Which species you &quot;start with&quot; in the system is important. If you are adding calcium carbonate for example, it's going to drop the pH because you are adding a carbonate, which at most pH's which will accept H+ ions and form bicarbonate.</p>
<p>When you add dissolved CO2, it's going to lower pH because you are effectively adding a strong acid. But once CO2 dissolves out and goes flat, that effect is reversed. There's been no net additional removal of of H+ ions. </p>
<p>If you add sodium bicarbonate as your form of CO2 to water around neutral to acidic pH, some of it will react to form carbonic acid and then dissolve out of solution as gaseous CO2. This causes a net removal of one H+ ion from solution per initial bicarbonate ion, causing a net increase in pH, but less per mole compared with adding carbonate. </p>
<p>All species are going to be present in solution at any given time in any solution in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Combined with the effects of dissolved carbonate/bicarbonate from minerals, this &quot;carbonate system&quot; is an important factor for environmental chemistry because of how it affects pH and alkalinity (two separate measurements) of the water. </p></div>		</li>
