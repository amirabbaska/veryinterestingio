<p>There was 39,710 earthquakes in the past 365 days. I’m going to try and find figures for the last few years now to compare. But like you said there isn’t an exact science to understanding them. So even if they have been increasing in numbers we won’t know why,</p>
<p>I think with technology improvements we might just be getting reports of earthquakes we previously wouldn’t have known about.</p>
<p>Hopefully the San Andreas fault holds off a little longer and people are more prepared than 1906.</p></div>		</li>
