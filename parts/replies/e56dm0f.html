			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a vacuum chamber and suave body wash. Prediction?</p>
<p>LOUD VACUUM PUMP - TURN DOWN SOUND</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/KMxKrxDwYXI" target="_blank">Full Raw Video</a></p>
<p>Update: I tried Suave(I) SoftSoap(II) Head n Shoulders(III) and Pantene Shampoo(IV) for 3 minutes and nothing really happened besides a couple bubbles in the Pantene.  I then tried water to see if  there is a problem with the vacuum pump.  It <a href="https://youtu.be/KMxKrxDwYXI?t=4m20s" target="_blank">boiled</a> at 4:20 but when I felt it after 3 minutes in vacuum it was still warm which means it isn't pulling the vacuum down as hard as it should.</p>
<p>I don't have shaving gel unfortunately.</p>
<p>My Adobe premier expired so I can not make this nice with music and sped up through the boring parts, sorry.</p></div>		</li>
