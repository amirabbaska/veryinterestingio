			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the first &quot;full&quot; treatment of Galilean invariance in QM was <a href="http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.1724319" target="_blank">LÃ©vy-Leblond</a>, though he mentions that a previous treatment by Bargmann had already noticed the peculiarity, called the &quot;Bargmann superselection rule.&quot; Weinberg makes a brief statement about it in his first QFT book at the end of section 2.4.</p>
<p>The reason mass becomes important is because Galilei symmetry of wave functions can only be imposed <em>projectively</em>, meaning &quot;up to a phase,&quot; in physically relevant systems. What happens is that, if you first apply a translation and then a boost in the same direction, the resulting state goes to</p>
<p>|initial&gt; -&gt; e^(i M stuff) |initial but boosted and translated&gt;</p>
<p>Here, M is the mass of the state, and &quot;stuff&quot; is some simple function of the boost and translation. So the symmetry transformation didn't actually act like a group, but the difference from a group action is just a phase, so it's still a symmetry of the quantum theory. You may recall that something similar happens in rotations for half-integer spin particles.</p>
<p>But the appearance of M has dire consequences. You obviously cannot have superpositions of states with different mass, because the two parts would generate different phases under symmetry transformations, and then not be Galilei invariant. This restriction is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superselection" target="_blank">superselection rule</a> between states with different mass. Selection rules arise when states can't be connected by the Hamiltonian, but superselection happens when states can't be connected by any possible operator you can write down. So no transitions between particles of different masses can occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that would only imply that the conservation of mass is the exact law, unlike in relativity where only energy is conserved. Particle transformations preserving their total mass should still be possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More precisely, relativity is needed when you have particles being created and destroyed, and then it's satisfying that the non-relativistic limit of QM forces creation/destruction to go away. Even without QM, when you're considering particles being created and destroyed, the typical velocities are close enough to c that you'll need relativity to describe the kinematics accurately. </p>
<p>Some heuristic dimensional analysis (this is not a proof of anything!). Particle creation/destruction should be important when kinetic energies are on the order of mc^(2), implying total energy E = KE + mc^(2) = 2mc^(2). Then the velocity of a particle with total energy E is</p>
<p>v/c = sqrt(E^(2) - (mc^(2))^(2))/E ~ .866</p>
<p>so relativity should be needed for calculations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are instantaneous forces in the non-relativistic limit, like Newtonian gravity. But unlike with special relativity, instantaneous forces don't mess with causality, so the theory is fine.</p></div>		</li>
