			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're incorrect on parallax having anything to do with distant objects. Parallax only works with stars in our galaxies and is only good with nearby stars. Once you start hitting more than a few hundred light years, you get more and more Arvin for error until it's basically worthless. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We know the distances to far galaxies due to redshift, not parallax.</p>
<p>We expect certain absorption spectra for all stars, since the light has to pass through the (mostly hydrogen and helium) interstellar medium (AKA diffuse space gases).  The absorption you can spot the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/nasa/measuringuniverse/spectroscopy/a/absorptionemission-lines" target="_blank">hydrogen absorption lines</a> for any star and see how far off they are from where you'd expect and use that to determine redshift, thus velocity.</p>
<p>This is useless for distance without showing Hubble's Law (that further things are moving away faster.)  However, we were independently able to measure distance using variable stars (thanks <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henrietta_Swan_Leavitt" target="_blank">Henrietta Leavitt</a>) and supernovae.  Since we know how bright those are, every time, we can figure out how far away they are based on brightness.</p>
<p>Putting those together, we notice that the farther away something is, the faster it's receding.  You can use that to infer distance for any star/galaxy. </p></div>		</li>
