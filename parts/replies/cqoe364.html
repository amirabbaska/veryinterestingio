			<div class="markdown"><p>I love this explanation. Its not that we don't want modders to profit from thier mods. Its not that we don't want to pay for mods. Its that this method valve has introduced fundamentally changes the modding community. Modding will no longer be done for 'the love of the game'. It's going to be for profit. Everything changes once money is involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what sometimes changes when money is involved?  Quality.  Maybe a cool new expansion pack will be created.  I'm not quite avid in PC gaming but my favorite example is Microsoft Flight Simulator (FSX) has tons of paid and free mods made by the community.  Lots of people still make mods for the love of the game.  Some mods even cost more than the entire game (pmdg aircraft) and IMO may have taken more effort than the entire game to make.  <strong>Paid mods allows legitimate game developers to make improvements to a video game while still be compensated.</strong>  Many of these devs would never make these improvements without being paid.  I don't see how outsourcing DLC is such a terrible thing.  If you don't like it, don't buy it.  </p>
<p>Personally I think a 30% cut for steam is absurd and I try to buy direct from the content creator whenever possible.  </p>
<p>edit:  I have never personally seen mods getting &quot;stolen&quot; or many of the other terrible things that people say will come.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, its not that I don't want mod developers to get paid. I just believe that creating the practice of selling mods has a net negative on the modding community. Take your example; previously someone who could not have the luxury of spending a lot of time on modding can now improve the quality/quantity knowing they'll be compensated for their work. That's a good thing.</p>
<p>However on the other side, now plenty of people can submit their mods for money. Inevitablely, people will start to create mods for money rather than for a hobby.</p>
<p>I don't want modding to become like the App Store where we have rampant quality control and difficulty finding that quality amongst other things. I dont want to have to spend $10 because I want Mod C, but Mod C is dependent on Mod B which is dependent of Mod A; but likely wouldnt occur anymore since devs know that making their mod a dependacy will cut into their profit.
Say something as crucial as DSFix was behind a paywall. Instead of being, 'Hey, a modder fixed a crucial part of the game, improving it and making it free on PC! Yay for PC!' becomes 'Well the game devs didnt fix the game, and now a fix for the game is an extra $1 on top of it.'
Thats a bad thing.</p>
<p>I'm more worried about the modding community than compensation. Its going to be more about making DLC for the game, which I'm not interested in. You say that I shouldn't buy it, fine, but now I lose all the other great aspects of the modding community I would have had if 'paid mods' did not exist. So whether or not I buy, it is a detriment to me and thus I'm complaining about them.</p>
<p>Edit: <strong>TLDR:</strong> I'm not against paid modding, but I am against this current implementation of that Valve currently has. There are many improvements that <strong>needed</strong> to be made to this system instead of throwing the modding scene under the bus by blindsiding us with this information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. It will be far too easy for modders to just modify a bit of code or design a weapon mod and release it for a quick buck. Large collaborative projects will be <em>much</em> more complex to work out and in many cases just won't exist. It will be set up to reward low efforts content. Look at the way that app stores tend to end up, cheap, microtransactions that cash in on small fees to add up to big revenue. Everything about it just perverts and twists beyond recognition what mods were about.</p>
<p>It's not that we don't want to pay...I've donated to my favorite mods before. It's just so sad seeing arguably the greatest advantage that PC Gaming has always had over consoles be whored out to greed. It's like an abomination of what the community has always been about, sharing and collaboration. In an economy where everything is free like this, there's a truly communal way about the way things are created. Competition is good for markets, but communalism, when placed in a free and equitable system, is arguably the most productive mechanic you can imagine. That's pretty much gone now. Even if paid mods were removed from Steam, I don't think things would totally revert to the way they were. Just the announcement has totally changed everything with some of the big name modders decrying the system and the smaller, less-celebrated modders turning to shortsighted greed.</p>
<p>It just so sickening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In very limited cases, yes, it could have a positive effect.</p>
<p>The best example of this is Gula from Cities:Skylines.</p>
<p>He was an artist for EA and worked on Sim City, but then lost his job.</p>
<p>He started playing around with making some extremely high quality models for Cities:Skylines, but is limited in that he needs to be spending time looking for a job and such instead of creating free models.</p>
<p>He has a donation page where he basically has promised to keep creating more high quality models in proportion to the amount of money donated (so he can pay his bills).</p>
<p>While donations are nice, I highly suspect that he'd be better off if he could just sell his models, in which case he'd have more time to continue to produce more.</p>
<p>The thing is though that such cases need to be rare exceptions, where people are allowed to sell their mods. Cases where a modder/modeller is known for high quality, original content.</p>
<p>Some of the issues that are starting to come about is because there hasn't been such a drastic limit on who can sell their mods and a very careful rollout of the changes. There becomes questions about IP rights/authorship. There becomes anger at having free mods suddenly pulled and then put up for sale.</p>
<p>Valve should have started by announcing that they were intending to allow paid mods, by only a very small set of hand-picked well-known modders. Also, they'd have to spell out that these were all all-new mods, but in order for these modders to have the time to write the mods (and to pay their bills), they'd have to charge.</p>
<p>It still would have not gone over super well, but Valve wouldn't be getting hammered for the utterly short-sighted approach that they've decided to take in this matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I think that in the right persons hands, it could go a long way to developing better, more advanced mods. However, the number of people who are in it just to make a quick buck, will far outnumber those who really do wish to create quality content. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And, also, that you're paying more to both Valve and Bethesda (in this case) than you'd be paying the modders. You'd be better off donating to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was always coming, most of us have seen it happening, could see it would lead to here.</p>
<p>If valve try to dress it up in, &quot;we want to give mod makers a chance to make money from this.&quot; that is the biggest pile of corporatist propaganda bullshit, the ONLY, and I mean ONLY reason why they implement this is because it is profitable and they want to stay ontop of the competition vs EA and co.</p>
<p>I would bet every cent to my name these are plans they have discussed since before they even started steam. What is happening now would have been the vision behind why they bought out CS/TF/DOD back in the day.</p>
<p>I can't get past the blatant capitalism of all this, its like a tax on oxygen, making us pay for what was literally free. Trying to exploit over a decade of creativity, ingenuity, community, open up your dictionary and take your pick at positive words to describe the mod making community.</p>
<p>Most of what is good about humanity is present in the ideas behind free mods and everyone associated with it. </p>
<p>But alas, this begins a new decade of billion dollar industries trying to convince us and the next generation that mod making is the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, communities become inundated with people who are being deceptive for sales: Puppet accounts doing guerrilla marketing, people posting to modding subreddit about a 'great new mod' that are all just marketing hype by shills. Now those posts have to all be deleted or, at the least, mistrusted which means that honest developers get lost in the spam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I feel this way about social media overall, including reddit. Whenever there is a money-making opportunity(or fake internet points) to be had: no one can be trusted at first glance anymore. The modding community is almost becoming the latest victim of monetization. </p></div>		</li>
