<p>Fiber while expensive</p>

<p>The cable itself is not that expensive.  A 1000' spool of 12 fiber single mode cable is just over $200.  What tends to be expensive is digging up everything to replace copper with fiber but if you're starting with fiber the costs are on par.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're a telco or cableco you have the equipment and then it's just labour cost.  I belive you can rent the equipment as well.  For the FTTH termination the techs add the ends as part of the install so it's not that big of an expense.</p>
<p>For home fiber runs, someone in /r/homelab mentioned you can do it with $400 worth of equipment.  You can also buy custom length preterminated fiber with or without pull loops.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of this is wrong. Power lines are not designed to send electrons from one place to another, they’re designed to move energy from one place to another. With DC the electrons move very slowly through a wire:</p>
<p>“... the drift speed through a copper wire of cross-sectional area 3.00 x 10-6 m2, with a current of 10 A will be approximately 2.5 x 10-4 m/s or about a quarter of a milimeter per second.”</p>
<p>Besides, large scale power transmission is almost always done with AC. As there’s a back and forth going on there with the electron movement, the electrons don’t really go anywhere anyway. Think of it more like pushing and pulling marbles through a hose pipe to do work at the other end (crude analogy but you get the point)</p></div>		</li>

<p>If for some reason you need more throughput than it can deliver there is 10 Gigabit Ethernet available, but that exceeds the speed of most desktop's storage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be honest, 15 to 20 years ago most people downloaded and saved files, nowadays its mostly streaming, no storage media limits required. While I have not yet seen my 300Mb/s internet maxed out, I did when I was on 100Mb/s due to multiple 4K devices streaming, while a family member downloaded a game on steam, while I was also streaming 1080p and trying to play a game online. It's only a matter of time before 1Gb/s connections can easily be maxed out in a family regularly.</p></div>		</li>
