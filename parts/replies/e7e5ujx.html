			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the question. First a little clarification. Catalytic converters are part of the emission control systems in internal combustion engines which decrease particulates and criteria pollutants in the exhaust. In PNNL's Chemical Transformation Initiative we are exploring new ways of converting organic wastes to value added products including fuels. The liquid fuels would be biodiesels. Because the biofuels are generated from waste streams they would have a lower greenhouse gas equivalency compared to fossil fuels. </p>

<p>About the related question on CO2 capture for fuel production. This is a separate program here at PNNL. We have developed new technologies, called CO2 Binding Organic Liquids, which are less expensive than current amine based carbon capture systems. We can combine this new technology with hydrogen to make organic products. You can find out more about the CO2 capture technology at this link <a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news/release.aspx?id=4278" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/news/release.aspx?id=4278" target="_blank">https://www.pnnl.gov/news/release.aspx?id=4278</a></a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using waste and keeping CO2 down by using CATs to keep my 6 speed going sounds awesome, but I'd assume at the moment it takes more energy to create fuel in this manner than is produced.  Is that correct, and what is the ratio approximately? And what would be realistic in 5 years, 10 years?</p></div>		</li>
