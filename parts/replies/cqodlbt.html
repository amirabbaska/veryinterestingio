			<div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't tell you anything.  You only need the dimensions of the neck.</p>
<p>This lumped element model does make the assumption that the wavelength of the frequency is substantially larger than the bottle.  If your bottle were actually cylindrical then you are playing a waveguide (e.g. flute) rather than a lumped element model (e.g. ocarina or a car with one window down).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically you model the air in the neck as a mass. Model rest of the bottle as a spring.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm guessing you assume the neck is a cylinder?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What kinds of majors need it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was an engineering elective.  It was not required. You can watch all the lectures <a href="http://teachingexcellence.mit.edu/category/inspiring-teachers/amar-g-bose-6-312-acoustics" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>I took it in 1984.  Yes, it IS that Bose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Acoustics is a broad multi-disciplinary topic which is important in many different areas of study. Below I list some of the main areas which acoustics branches out into:</p>
<p>Architectural acoustics - important for ensuring that resonant frequencies don't cause structures to collapse (like the Tacoma Narrows bridge).</p>
<p>Electroacoustics - transducer (loud speaker &amp; microphone) analysis and design.</p>
<p>Audiology - study of health of the human hearing system.</p>
<p>Acoustic weapons - there are acoustic crowd control type weapons in use by US police forces...</p>
<p>Psychoacoustics - the study of how electrical signals are interpreted by the human auditory system and the brain to yield the perception of sound.</p>
<p>Speech technology - the study of the reproduction and perception of speech. Very important in communication and assessing the effectiveness of a space to be used as a lecture hall/ teaching area/ area in which speech communication is the primary function.</p>
<p>Environmental acoustics - the effect of the level and type of noise on human and ecological receptors which is important for determining planning decisions from major road network projects to small heating and air conditioning units which might affect nearby residents.</p>
<p>.... And that's just the tip of the iceberg!</p></div>		</li>
