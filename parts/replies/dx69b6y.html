			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an MD and I have had tinnitus for several years. It is correct, that tinnitus i more a phenomenon of the brain than of the ear (it has been shown, that the &quot;sounds&quot; of tinnitus, typically ringing, does not at all behave like sound perceived by the ear). I consider tinnitus an inapropriate cerebral processing of sound information, a filtering defect. Initiated accidental, by stress or after trauma to head or inner ear, you start to focus on sound information, that normally would be filtered or damped by the several neurological circuts of the brain before reaching consciousness. It annoys you, which in turn makes the brain focus even more on the tinnitus sound. In the end the noice may be perceived as unbearable by some. Tinnitus, I think is present in every person, especially, if the person has a hearing impairment (the amplifier of the brain is turned to a higher level, due to the lack of sound). You can learn to handle your tinnutus, just as you normally perceive wearing a pair of trousers (or some other garment): for most of the time you are not truely aware of your trousers, then sometimes you are, and then it's like, &quot;aha, I am wearing trousers, so what...&quot;. These days I perceive my tinnutus on and off, but it almost never bothers me, even if it is quite loud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually unrelated to tinnitus, but has more to do with the blood flow around your tympanic membrane. Clenching your jaw pulls it tight and you can hear the blood around it. </p>
<p>Not everyone has it, but those with tinnitus tend to have it more because the sound is so similar that it just sounds like your tinnitus is worse when you do it. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>the short answer is that your brain has probably cross-wired touch-sensing neurons from the trigeminal ganglion into auditory pathways, in an effort to compensate for loss auditory input. This appears to be very common in noise-induced tinnitus, probably affecting the majority of patients to some degree (see: Dr. Salvi's work @ University of Buffalo in the 90s, I don't have a link handy)</p>
<p>This is a more recent video which explains this down to a level of detail that my layman's ass cannot grok: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQoazdaZK14" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQoazdaZK14</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this explanation! I have experienced ringing since I was born and simply assumed it was normal - everyone else must have it too. I casually mentioned it to my MD friend and she said not everyone experiences that, but if it hasn't been too big of an issue then don't worry about it. I don't always focus on it and really only hear it in complete silence. But I often wonder if there's a fix for it and how much nicer it would be to enjoy silence without the ringing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine became noticeable as I read this. I have very good hearing so it’s always bothered me that mine gets so loud. </p>
<p>Only sometimes when my anxiety is bad, I’ll do the “reddit tinnitus trick” and it’ll help it to stop for a few so that when it comes back it’s less noticeable. </p>
<p>Definitely doesn’t feel/sound “real”, it sounds like it’s coming from my brain so it’s interesting to read that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fact that the tinnitus continues after the auditory nerve has been severed opens up the possibility that the tinnitus was ’from the brain’ all along and not stemming from damaged hair cells. In other words it seems like damaged hair cells doesn’t need to be part of the equation at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that’s true. I guess the brain could try to up the gain from damaged hair cells and get stuck there because of the plasticity?</p>
<p>One of my points - though maybe not explicitly stated - is that you don’t have to have hair cell damage to have tinnitus. But honestly, it’s not like tinnitus as a phenomenon is a solved case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How did this work?  I've had tinnitus for a long time now.  Not horrible, just enough to notice if I listen for it.  I can still do daily life, sleep and listen to music with little to no change.</p>
<p>But if hearing aids are a potential solution, this is interesting.  What kind of hearing aids?  I would think that if it was hairs/nerves being the cause, a hearing aid wouldn't block it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has tinnitus I read about it often. One cause of tinnitus from what I read is that the neurons attached to the ear (the inner part of it) get damaged. Now a neuton is basically an on-off switch. From what that article said, when we're subjected to sounds that are too loud, that switch breaks and remains in the &quot;on&quot; position. Due to that it transmits a signal that the brain interpretes as sound when it isn't, hence the ghost sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also physical tinnitus, called Objective tinnitus; it is a physical sound that can be heard, created by a structure in the body. ¿I believe it is common in horses?
The more common occurrence is the Subjective tinnitus which you mentioned — is created by the brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This would be limited to structures in and around the ear I'd imagine, like muscle spasms or carotid artery stenosis. Weirdly from having a quick google apparently your cochlea itself can create and amplify its own sounds termed 'otoacoustic emissions'!</p>
<p>I think there might be something else at play in your case considering the distanc of the sternum from the ear.</p></div>		</li>
