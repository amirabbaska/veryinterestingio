			<div class="markdown"><p>I kinda have one of these car keys when I was in high school. My mom's toyota and one of my friend's toyota are the same model but different year, off by 1 or 2. Just for laughs, I stuck my key into his door and was able to unlock it. He totally freaked out, but his key doesn't work on my mom's car. I also not able to start his car though. Only able to open his door. I guess the door lock and the engine lock has a slightly different mechanism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeh, I grew up for 23 yrs. in the automobile industry, just a couple hrs from detroit. We saw a fair amount of this. But each car co. uses so many different keys the ODDS of it happening very often are just low enough not to cause trouble, but to create interesting, but fortunately rare events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I encountered one of these interesting events.  I was valet parking cars around 2004 or 2005 and ran back to pick up a pickup truck, probably mid-90s model with no remote unlock.</p>
<p>I got the door open, but could not start the truck.  After a couple minutes of trying, I ran back to the customer and brought him back to the truck.  Turned out that it was a truck of a similar age/model of his truck, and the key worked in the door, but not the ignition.  His was a couple aisles down.</p>
<p>I think he felt bad for me, because he still have me a decent tip, even though he basically had to walk all the way back to pick up his car.  (I was volunteering, and tips benefited a charity, so I am sure that had something to do with it as well)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess my mom and I were one of those lucky few who had interchangeable car keys for her Honda Civic and my Honda Accord. We would use the keys to unlock and start each others cars.</p>
<p>Her key would sometimes get stuck and we would have to wiggle it out, but it was pretty interesting! Never got locked out of my car!</p></div>		</li>
