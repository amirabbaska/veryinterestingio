			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be mentioned that TV makers got 4K from cinema because it rolls off the tongue really well for marketing purposes. </p>
<p>4K for cinema is <del>21:9 and</del> 4096x2160 res. It also has a minimun bitrate 100MB/s, I believe. </p>
<p>The DCI sets all that stuff.</p>

<p>EDIT: I get it, 21:9 isn't the aspect ratio. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4096x2160 is the cinematic resolution typically, but it's not a 21:9 aspect ratio. 3840x2160 is just the resolution closest to cinematic 4k that maintains the 16:9 aspect ratio, while also being conveniently twice the resolution of 1080p in both height and width. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UHD = 3840 x 2160<br />
4K = 4096 x 2160</p>
<p>So no, they're not the same. However they're often used interchangeably, even though they're different resolutions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we are talking about movies 4k is wider. Movies have wider aspect ratios than TV. The vertical resolution is the same, 2160. The horizontal resolution is different to account for the wider screen, 4096 vs 3460. </p>
<p>In terms of buying a TV it's the same thing because tv makers use 4k as a marketing gimmick because it just kinda sounds better than UHD. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>DCI actually doesn't specify a minimum bitrate, only a maximum. Most 2K DCPs are probably around 100 though.</p>
<p>This is probably because DCI concerns itself with compatibility more than quality. If you want to show a shitty version of your movie that's up to you, but if you want it to be guaranteed to play at all you need to follow this standard. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the only people that try to minimize the size of their DCPs are people who've made shorts and are trying to send them digitally or on USB sticks. For features you're probably delivering a CRU so size is not really an issue. I tend to ask for 150 for 2K and the full 250 for 4K, even if there's nothing much to call for that high a rate, and I've never been advised against it. But if there was a reason to reduce then I'd love to hear about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also really common on phones and tablets.  I'm sure we'll see more QHD TVs when UHD becomes standard and QHD becomes the go-to resolution for lower end or smaller TVs.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I’m sure 4K itself would look better either way, but I like to DSR games up to 4K so I don’t use Anti Aliasing. Any AA that really makes a difference on my PC throttles my framerate at 2K</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, Dolby Vision allows the dynamic range (light to dark) values to be adjusted in real time to accommodate the needs of each individual shot, which is referred to as &quot;Dynamic Metadata&quot;. The other main HDR format &quot;HDR10&quot; sets a single dynamic range for a whole movie/episode. Dolby Vision requires specific hardware and a license fee, while the slightly inferior HDR 10 is free, and has the widest distribution. </p></div>		</li>
