			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this mostly because one of the complications of migraine that I get is that i lose my proprioception.  So my own arms will look like someone else is standing behind me putting their arm forward.  </p>
<p>It is a trip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I've had aura migraines twice and had this, also the entire right side of my body goes numb and I forget who I am, and everyone I know for about an hour, trippy &quot;static jaggies&quot; in my vision... then I puke and have the worst headache if my life for 3 hours. It's like a mix of a bad acid trip and a stroke. </p>
<p>2/10 wouldn't recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't get the pain any more.  I get the complications and the dull base of the skull headache.  I do sometimes have a limb go partly numb or lose some language function if it is a really bad one (along with the proprioception disruption).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also related is kinesthesia, which is your brain's sense of your body's motion without seeing it (whereas proprioception is static position).  Kinesthesia and proprioception together allow for muscle memory (knowing the current position and desired of your body parts and sensing and actively, but subconsciously, controlling the motion from one to the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your eli5 is wrong. Your brain has a mental map of where all of your various body parts <em>should</em> be. That's what enables proprioception. It's also part of what causes phantom pain when a body part is missing. The brain <em>is</em> constantly communicating with your body, but the map in the brain is the important part.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wrong is so strong :/ maybe I was mistaken, but I'm not sure about that, either...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the limbs, the proprioceptors are sensors that provide information about joint angle, muscle length, and muscle tension, which is integrated to give information about the position of the limb in space. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're also wrong, well half wrong. You've only covered the neurological side of the voluntary muscle map in the brain. You forgot to mention propioception also relies on special nerves in the core of skeletal muscles which stretch to relay the current position of the attached joint.</p></div>		</li>
