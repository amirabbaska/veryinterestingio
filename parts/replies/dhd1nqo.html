<p>I heard someone yesterday ask if we lived in a post-paper shredder world, since everything could just be backed up to a microsd card. We might soon find out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Business records would involved contracts and money transfers. Those would have records and traces beyond the reach of those being subpoena.</p>
<p>If the subject of an investigation purposely destroy these documents it falls into the classification of spoliation of evidence. Spoliation has three possible consequences: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in jurisdictions where the (intentional) act is criminal by statute, it may result in fines and incarceration (if convicted in a separate criminal proceeding) for the parties who engaged in the spoliation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in jurisdictions where relevant case law precedent has been established, proceedings possibly altered by spoliation may be interpreted under a spoliation inference, or by other corrective measures, depending on the jurisdiction; </p>
</li>
<li>in some jurisdictions the act of spoliation can itself be an actionable tort (civil liability).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these individuals may have small participation in the transactions (assume a lawyer executing a contract). Why would they risk further civil or criminal liability to protect Flynn or any other Trump associate?</p></div>		</li>
