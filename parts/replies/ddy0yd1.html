			<div class="markdown"><p>It's 25Mb/s (not MB), and that's under a perfectly optimal setup on Bluetooth 3. Bluetooth 2 only supported 2.1Mb/s, and you probably won't even get that when your headphones are on your head and your phone is in your pocket. At a range of 15-20' it's entirely possible that the connection will drop down to a couple hundred Kb/s, which is why your phone is compressing it.</p>
<p>A2DP can support basically any codec (as long as the transmitter and receiver support it) but pretty much all you'll see in the wild is mp3/mp4.</p></div>		</li>
