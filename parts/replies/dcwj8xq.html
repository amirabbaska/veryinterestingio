			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add that the fact that an executive order is issued or a bill is passed into law does not mean that it will be financed. For example issuing an executive order to build a wall between the US and Mexico authorizes the project but it does not pay for it. Congress is not compelled to find a way to make it happen. </p>
<p>Also, there is a process for putting detail into statutory language called rule making. The federal agency implementing the law issues a notice of proposed rule making which is published In the federal register. </p>
<p>This details exactly how the agency plans to operationalize the language in the statute.</p>
<p>This is followed by a public comment period when the various stakeholders weigh in. The agency considers the comments, then issues the final rule. The final rule addresses the comments publicly, explaining why and how the comments were integrated into the final rule, or not. </p>
<p>Everyone follows that final rule, which can actually be modified with subsequent notices of proposed rule making. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congress writes laws the Constitution leaves the President the authority to carry them out, which means the President also has the ability to direct his employees (agency heads) with implementation details of his choosing.  Many laws are quite general, and President's can use the general nature of these laws to order specific actions.  </p>
<p>Further, presidents often push quite hard at the bounds of what the text of a law says.  </p>
<p>In the Japanese Internment Order, congress authorized the President to punish persons who willfully destroyed War Materials, and the president interpreted that authorization to mean I can order the Secretary of War to set up areas of the country where Japanese people must leave and live in internment camps.  </p></div>		</li>
