			<div class="markdown"><p>Why wouldn't the finite speed of light prevent that from happening? Didn't expansion increase the size of the universe to be many times its age in light years? And if that is the case, and the universe is expanding (and the expansion speed is accelerating) wouldn't that make it impossible for light to 'catch up' and do a full loop around?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like the paradox is talking about if the universe was static, as in not expanding. So the darkness of the night sky proves that the universe, if infinite, is expanding?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The darkness of the night sky is attributable to the finite <em>age</em> of the universe. The observable universe can only be as large as that age times the speed of light.</p>
<p>It is <em>also</em> the case that the universe is expanding, and models suggest that ultimately the observable part of the universe will get progressively smaller as distant space expands away from us at faster than the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's correct. Seeing the same star in two directions could only happen in a universe that is smaller or expanding more slowly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The first time the light from a star reaches you, it will have traveled simply the distance between you and the star.  The 2nd time it passes you, it will have traveled the distance between you and the star PLUS the length of the universe.</p>

<p>You missed one. Yes, you will (theoretically) see the star twice from one direction, but you also see it from the other direction, since whatever is in front of you is also behind you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ya I ignored that since OPs drawing seemed to be only considering one direction.</p>
<p>My larger point was that, any light which has traveled most of the universe will be zero.</p></div>		</li>
