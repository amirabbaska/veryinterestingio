			<p>Ok, honest question here.  What about people who don't live close enough to a city and have wells instead of a connection to the grid?  <br><br>Growing up I lived out in the boonies and we had well water.  Actually, I've always preferred it over city water no matter where I lived.</p>		</li>

			<p>(Deep) Groundwater is often microbiologically safe as no bacteria and other pathogens survive being in the ground for so long. <br><br>It does however, often contain a lot of iron and other metals which are not really harmful, but can make the water have a brown color and bad taste/smell.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, deep wells tend to be microbially safe.<br><br>No, they aren't always iron rich or harmful. It depends on the groundwater source. Near where I am there isn't a lot of iron, but the water is hard and has an issue with hydrogen sulfide (which stinks.)  I do agree that ground water can have other issues that can impact taste/odor. </p>		</li>

			<p>When we drill a new well and install a pump the well is chlorinated to 100ppm and is either surged (up/down/into the aquifier) or allowed to sit in the line.  Then the well is flushed until you have a chlorine residual of zero and a microbial sample is taken for analysis.  The lines/pumps have check valves that don't allow water to run back down the line and maintain a water prime on the system.  <br><br>Anytime a pump is pulled for maintenance or for a camera then the well is chlorinated again.<br><br>We have iron, high hardness, and high hydrogen sulfide so we have to be very careful to maintain an anaerobic condition or we get iron bacteria growth slimes.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>I work for a water plant that has been setting up a new well field for the past 10ish years to get out of an older well field due to withdrawal limitations and growing consumer demand.  The well driller that has the contract for those new wells handles more than just drilling, dropping, and walking away.  He, also, handles the camera work for the problem wells, pumping/drawdown/well yield tests, and possible site locations. I don't know how much his contracts are for the actual drilling, but I know the most recent camera and pumping test on an older well was roughly 10k.<br><br>His part of the contracts don't include the microbial testing, I do that since I work the lab so it stays in house. I also do any of the water parameter testing that I'm set up for if he asks for it.<br><br>He's an old timer with a wealth of knowledge so I try to be onsite when I have free time to pick his brain.<br><br>I currently hold a Bachelor's of Biology, B-well license (going for A-well in the fall), and lab certifications.  </p>		</li>

			<p>afaik all new pipes are flushed thoroughly, and probably chlorinated a lot to clean the piping as much as neccessary. Once laid nothing can come in, as they always work with positiv pressure (so if there's a crack, water can't come in)</p>		</li>

			<p>Is there some site or source I can use to learn more about my local tap water? The tap in southern Mississippi is yellowish and had a distinctly salty taste. If you fill a bathtub, you can't see the bottom by the time it's full. Everyone around here has grown up with it, but as someone who grew up in a major city in the NE, I'm still a little freaked out after being here for a year </p>		</li>

			<p>A quick google search of the local water treatment plants could point you to where your water comes from. The municipality that governs the water treatment facility should have public information regarding periodic water tests. When I live, they have a quarterly newsletter that I receive ( I requested it) electronically stating bacteriological tests, iron levels, sulfur levels ect.  <br><br>Alternatively you can contact your water company as they can tell you which facility supplies your water. </p>		</li>

			<p>Arsenic can be very concentrated where i live (NH).  We require a pretty intense filtration system for our well water.  It can be pricey but considering the alternative it's worth it.  Even well water can change greatly so important to test your water regularly.  I've seen our Arsenic range from 50ppb to over 300ppb (both above the guidelines in our state, but still represent a significant fluctuation)</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; wells<br><br>  The water is usually drawn from a deep aquifer. All the bacteria, vegetable matter, faecal remains, animal remains, etc., are in the top layer of soil. There's nothing to for bacteria to feed on in the aquifer, so there are fewer bacteria. The higher layers of soil and sub-soils should filter out any nutrients from the water before it gets to the level of the aquifer. It SHOULD be clean, BUT ISN'T ALWAYS. <br><br>  Old wells were hand-dug, had to be wide enough for a man to work in, stopped as soon as they reached water and were open at the top; they are liable to contamination. Modern wells are drilled boreholes, with an electric pump at the bottom, are deeper and are sealed at the top and at the sides by the plastic well casing. They are more likely to be clean.<br><br>   Water from wells can be contaminated, by dumps, former industrial activity, dissolved chemicals or contamination of the aquifer, so the water should be tested and treated if necessary.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Usually wells do not require any treatment to be safe to drink. Best thing to do is periodically have it tested. I've seen prices from $30 to $75 to check just for bacteria. If it does come back positive with bacteria/coliforms usually the well can be sanitized with chlorine. The other major problem with ground water is Iron. Its really not harmful but it just the aesthetics. People just don't like to see red water. If you have a well with high iron and you add CL the iron problem will become much worse. </p>		</li>

			<p>Good comment here.   Public water systems in the US (as well as Canada as you say) are required to meet water quality standards which are higher than bottled water.   Now some bottled water may be better than tap water, but they aren't required to meet public water quality standards.  <br>Www.nrdc.org/water/drinking/BW/exsum.asp<br>According to this report, approximately 1/3 of all bottled water do not meet tap water standards.  </p>		</li>

			<p>I've programmed the control systems for entire potable water plants, and I have a background in fluid mechanics, and this description is absolutely correct.<br><br>The plant I work with starts off by filtering the water through a sand filter, which gets rid of the sort of pathogens that won't be affected by chlorine (larger ones). Then we add chlorine to maintain a certain residual chlorine reading. The storage tanks after the filtering and chlorination steps are designed to have a large enough volume to ensure the water contacts the chlorine for a certain amount of time, while the potable water pumps send the water out onto the potable water header from the tank.<br><br>Also, I'm also backing up the idea that if you keep your system at a higher pressure than what surrounds it, then leaks will cause water to leave the system, effectively keeping the inside of the pipe clean. I use this concept often with air, where I'll add an air line to a cabinet located in a dusty areas that absolutely must stay clean, and it works. Even in a really dusty area with corrosive contaminants in the air, the inside of such a cabinet stays pristine.<br><br>The only thing I'll disagree with is that a brita is never useful. I poured a cup of water from my city tap the other day, and if it came out of it was a colour that I'm confident would not meet ministry turbidity requirements.</p>		</li>
