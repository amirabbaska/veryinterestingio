<p>Growing up I lived out in the boonies and we had well water.  Actually, I've always preferred it over city water no matter where I lived.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It does however, often contain a lot of iron and other metals which are not really harmful, but can make the water have a brown color and bad taste/smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, deep wells tend to be microbially safe.</p>
<p>No, they aren't always iron rich or harmful. It depends on the groundwater source. Near where I am there isn't a lot of iron, but the water is hard and has an issue with hydrogen sulfide (which stinks.)  I do agree that ground water can have other issues that can impact taste/odor. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Arsenic is a common grund water contaminant in many areas of the world (including large parts of the US). The dose is generally not enough to kill people, but can often be large enough to give long term effects.</p>
<p>If you have a private well, you should have it tested (not just for this, but for other contamination - sometimes contamination seeps down along the path the well was drilled).</p></div>		</li>

<p>The water is usually drawn from a deep aquifer. All the bacteria, vegetable matter, faecal remains, animal remains, etc., are in the top layer of soil. There's nothing to for bacteria to feed on in the aquifer, so there are fewer bacteria. The higher layers of soil and sub-soils should filter out any nutrients from the water before it gets to the level of the aquifer. It SHOULD be clean, BUT ISN'T ALWAYS. </p>
<p>Old wells were hand-dug, had to be wide enough for a man to work in, stopped as soon as they reached water and were open at the top; they are liable to contamination. Modern wells are drilled boreholes, with an electric pump at the bottom, are deeper and are sealed at the top and at the sides by the plastic well casing. They are more likely to be clean.</p>
<p>Water from wells can be contaminated, by dumps, former industrial activity, dissolved chemicals or contamination of the aquifer, so the water should be tested and treated if necessary.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>PS There was a mass food-poisoning in London some years ago (12 or 14) , caused by organisms (crypto-sporidium) getting into deep wells that had previously been clean. The water supply became contaminated and water had to be boiled until the problem was rectified. Many illnesses, no deaths, ISTR.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is up to the homeowner to treat and disinfect.  That water system is too small for any governmental oversight.</p>
<p>Many well and pump companies will come out and install a water treatment system that rivals municipals, for a price, and then ongoing O&amp;M costs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually wells do not require any treatment to be safe to drink. Best thing to do is periodically have it tested. I've seen prices from $30 to $75 to check just for bacteria. If it does come back positive with bacteria/coliforms usually the well can be sanitized with chlorine. The other major problem with ground water is Iron. Its really not harmful but it just the aesthetics. People just don't like to see red water. If you have a well with high iron and you add CL the iron problem will become much worse. </p></div>		</li>
