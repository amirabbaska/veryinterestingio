			<div class="markdown"><p>This must be the behavior that leads to a pattern between square numbers. 1 + 3 = 4. 4 + 5 = 9. 9 + 7 is 16. 16 + 9 is 25. You can move upward from two known squares to the next one by adding the difference between the two known squares plus two. So if you know that 11^2 is 121 and 12^2 is 144, then 13^2 is 144 + (144-121) + 2.</p>
<p>It's rarely useful, but if I suddenly need to know 17^2 I can work upward from 12^2 if I need to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh... My understanding was that you could always add the current and previous X to the previous square to get the value you want. IE:</p>
<p>X^2 = (X-1)^2 + X + (X-1)</p>
<p>Base case:<br />
X=1<br />
X^2 = (1-1)^2 + 1 + (1-1) = 0^2 + 1 + 0 = 1</p>
<p>Now, for X=2:<br />
X^2 = (2-1)^2 + 2 + (2-1) = 1^2 + 2 + 1 = 4</p>
<p>It's always been a quick way for me to calculate larger squares if I can start at a simpler base... say, going from 20^2 to 23^2, would be 400 + (20+21) + (21+22) + (22+23). Simple additions that I can do sequentially.</p>
<p>Not good for most mathematical applications, but it's helped in a pinch.</p>
<p>EDIT: The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3v10w9/why_is_it_that_if_you_add_any_sequence_of_numbers/cxjrxze" target="_blank">following comment</a> by /u/kevhito perfectly illustrates why this works.</p></div>		</li>
