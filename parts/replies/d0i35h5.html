			<div class="markdown"><p>The wheels are sloped, so the wheel is actually larger on the inside than on the outside. When the train gets to a left-hand corner, it gets pulled to the the right – the outside of the turn (like you can feel in a car), which puts the right wheel's bigger section and the left wheel's smaller section in contact with the track.</p>
<p>What would happen if a vehicle had a large right wheel and a small left wheel? It would turn left! And so does the train! The slope on the wheel just perfectly matches the amount it has to turn to stay on the track.</p></div>		</li>

<p>*edit: alright folks, question closed, no more replies please.</p>
<p>*edit: okay, you got me, there's actually a large cash prize for the 100th person to give me the exact same explanation.  keep 'em coming, maybe today is your lucky day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although since the rift uses convex lenses in front of the screen it increase its apparent distance, it's possible all objects will be blurry, depending on how near-sighted you are.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep, and that's also one of the reasons that the 3D effect is imperfect</p></div>		</li>
