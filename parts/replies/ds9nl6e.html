			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be stupid to use one of the 50 largest known primes if you want the primes to be secret. Cryptography works fine with primes with 100-200 digits and they are found with completely different methods.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primes used in cryptography are significantly smaller than this one, if fact this prime would be one of the worst ones to use as factoring a number involving it would be trivial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You just explained a naive working of RSA.. that doesn't answer the question at all.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we're only at 2048-bit primes currently for safe implementations.  The primes they're finding now are orders of magnitude larger.</p>
<p>This is a poor answer.</p></div>		</li>
