			<div class="markdown"><p>Coozies absolutely help keep drinks cold. They don't cover the whole can, but the part that does get covered is next to a poor conductor of heat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do this every time I go to the beach. Since I ride a motorcycle and cant really bring a cooler, I just wrap the food/water/beer in my spare clothes and they stay quite cool the whole time.</p>
