			<div class="markdown"><p>Velocity does have an effect on the gravitational field of the object, but not in that way (it's similar but not identical to what happens with the static EM field of a moving charge). The mass is the mass and remains the mass. Relativistic mass is bs.</p>
<p>But this is not the point: I'm dismissing OP without getting lost in the details by claiming <em>any</em> relativistic effect is negligible, because it has to be at least of order (v/c)^(2). </p></div>		</li>

<p>How about this thought experiment?:</p>
<p>Would you agree that if you define a spherical boundary around the Earth, as long as no mass/energy leaves that boundary, the Moon should continue on its same orbit? As long as the mass/energy inside the boundary remains spherically symmetric, regardless of what I do to the Earth, the Moon should be unaffected, correct? I would assume so.</p>
<p>So, let's say I have a few pieces of fancy equipment. One is a large machine that I can feed raw matter into and have it convert mass-energy directly to electrical power. The other is a large, spherically symmetric set of centrifuges that are capable of accelerating to an arbitrarily high speed. (Not violating conservation of energy, they simply can rotate arbitrarily fast without being destroyed.) These two big spherically symmetric centrifuges are nested one inside the other, thus allowing rotation while keeping the net angular momentum zero.</p>
<p>I hook these two machines together, and I dump more and more matter into the mass to energy converter. As I dump matter in, its mass-energy is liberated, and converted into rotational kinetic energy in my giant centrifuges. </p>
<p>Eventually, after very long process, I feed the entire Earth into the machine. The Earth is gone, with all of its mass-energy used to accelerate these big centrifuges. </p>
<p>So, what happens to the moon? No mass or energy ever left the boundary I drew around the Earth. Yet, the mass that remains is almost zero compared to the original value. All of the mass energy of the Earth has gone into accelerating my centrifuge to an absurd fraction of c. </p>
<p>If the concept of relativistic mass is bunk, or if an object's velocity doesn't affect the gravitational force it produces, what happens with my centrifuge? </p>
<p>Obviously the equipment needed for this is absurd, but like discussions of relativistic rockets going 0.999c, the physics should still work even if materials and engineering make the device in question impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inertial and <em>passive</em> gravitational mass are linked via the equivalence principle - which implies everything falls down at the same speed. Active gravitational mass (the attraction of other objects) does not have to be the same - although no experiment ever found a deviation.</p>
<p>The attraction felt towards a moving object is complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which black hole? If you mean the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy, not only is the zone where relativistic-gravitational effects (such as time dilation) are present is of absolutely negligible size, but moreover the gravitational field of the black hole is also negligible and it has no effect on most of the galaxy. The mass of the galaxy is overwhelmingly larger than that of the black hole.</p></div>		</li>
