<p>Basically anything with resistance will produce heat when current is applied, the longer the distance the more heat, this is why it's recommended to NOT string multiple cords together.</p></div>		</li>

Watts are a measurement of power and are defined to be Joules/sec.<br />
Definitely not the same thing and both units are used all over physics and electrical engineering.</p>
<p>What u/ferretpaint said is technically correct, length is proportional to resistance and P=R*I^2 so for the current they mention applying, heat would go up. If the welder is constant voltage, what they said isn't quite relevant though and you're on the right path. If the welder is constant-current, then they're applicable. If it's just a half-dead car battery...</p></div>		</li>

<p>At the risk of getting off topic, that's not the reason for not stringing multiple cords. The actual reason is that in the event of a short the resistance of the cable is higher. This may lead to a situation where the current is not high enough to trip the breaker or fuse quickly enough. In the case of a fuse, it may never blow, leaving the cable to cook forever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So given the situation you are saying, the cord overheats probably and shorts.  With a high resistance system, the voltage would have to drop to compensate and the current would go up.</p>
<p>If the current goes up, wouldn't that trip the breaker since older breakers look at current draw, and newer ones look at both?</p>
<p>Also, if the cord shorts wouldn't that lower the resistance from what ever it was previous as it cuts a corner and bypasses some of the resistance that was there originally?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My childhood home had one pipe that would always freeze if we got around -30° F. We always used a welder with really long leads from the pumphouse to the kitchen sink. You're right about it being the pipe as that's what heats up as you pass current through it. </p>
<p>I would be extremely leery of hooking up a generator's typical output of 120 or 240 V AC. That sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's funny. Working at a frozen pizza plant I remember the cream yeast pipes freezing. They ran outside the plant in a couple spots and were supposed to be running hot water.through them when not in use. This would get shut off occassionaly and pipes would freeze
We would hook welders up to the pipes as well to thaw them. Ahhh fun times.</p></div>		</li>
