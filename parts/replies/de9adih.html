			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not strictly true.
Low saturation , regardless of how high you are, are bad. Just because everyone is saturating at 80% doesn't mean you shouldn't worry</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about the pulse.  A missing part from most of the explanations on here is that a pulse oximeter is calculating each wavelength's signal in terms of  light transmittance and this light transmittance is constantly varying (for both wavelengths/colors) due to the pulse.</p>
<p>When a fresh pulse of blood comes through the arterial end of the vasculature, the near-infrared color is heavily attenuated and the visible not as much.  When the pulse has passed, we can compare the levels of each signal again to get an idea of the oxygenation of the pulse.</p>
<p>So, in a way, it's self-calibrating.  The only thing that really matters is that there's a strong pulse.  Cold fingers make pulse oximetry tough, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100% is considered undesirable as an EMT. If we are giving oxygen treatment we are supposed to try and keep it around 96-97% - So it's perfectly fine to not be at 100%</p>
