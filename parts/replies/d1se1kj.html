			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer, very thorough. I want to look more into this, for a few years now I've had a recurring nightmare that wakes me up terrified. It's very inconvenient and I'd like to stop it if possible.</p>
<p>EDIT:
People are trying to help but it's hard with such a vague description so I'll elaborate. The dream is a nuke dream, or some other instakill disaster but usually a nuke. The &quot;setup&quot; part of the dream I don't always remember, but the part that shakes me awake is screams or shouts from whoever I'm with, followed by the detonation and instant death: a ringing in my ears as whatever I'm &quot;seeing&quot; in the dream gets freeze framed and the colors and outlines quickly bleed to white. This is what I imagine an instant, nothing-you-can-do death would be like, I suppose. I'll wake up, my heart slamming, and clench for awhile before I realize I'm not about to be erased it was just the dream again. It's awful. I get it once a week at worst or once every two weeks at best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no /u/zbonn181 but when my kids have recurring nightmares like this, I will make them describe it to me in detail and once we've discussed it out loud (and I assume the frontal lobe gets a hold of all that nonsensical fear happening in the currently, relatively dormant amygdala) then the nightmares stop. I suggest trying to discuss the nightmare out loud in detail with someone. They tend to go away after that... for whatever reason. Again, this is purely anecdotal. I didn't even stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like I said, random af; but you compelled me to read an advice comment from the second sentence. Reading advice comments to problems I don't have isn't my forte. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>from kindergarten to the 6th grade i had reoccurring dreams of the creepiest shit ever. The first part is pretty benign, imagine some like lego/megablocks tinkertoy work shop creepy shit followed by some full out hr giger, zdizslaw beksinski, wayne barlowe shit. The sky, everything and to add to it we have pure nightmare fuel from the alien death queen broodmother and her freaky ritual shit going on. Ok that part is fucking next level, there is some sexual inneudo shit going on like this thingy pierces this thingy and fucking screaming ohmygod, like it's advancing levels of intensiveness and all of this permeated (what really matters) by the feeling of being overwhelmed, unable to comprehend Like as if i, a spec in the universe is trying to overlook myself as some omnipotent being. freakyshit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a weird personal thing that wont make sense to anyone else. I thought a lot about &quot;facing your fears&quot; and when the witches and ugly creatures showed up in my dreams I tried to fight back instead of being afraid and trying to exit my dreams. Trying to exit my dreams seems to be a bad habit I had that would cause me to wake up in fright. &quot;facing your fears&quot; is a meaningless cliche so what I was actually doing is letting my bad thoughts win and seeing just how afraid I could actually make myself. Then once I realized nothing actually happens when the worst I was fearing appears I was able to fight back.</p>
<p>This makes no sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, I feel you. As a kid I had recurring nightmares about a serial killer for probably a year. I'd just die or try to escape. Eventually, I managed to kill him in my dream and I've never had another one of them since. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember that for certain nightmares I used to have when I was little, I could consciously recognize I was having a nightmare while still having it. </p>
<p>At that point I would &quot;close&quot; my eyes in the nightmare and reopen them to try and open my eyes in real life to wake up. I distinctly remember trying this in the face of my bully once, only to reopen them in the laughing and jeer face of my antagonistic elementary school bully. I tried again and woke up in my bed.</p>
<p>Please some one tell me this is a thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I edited my comment to include the dream so it makes more sense. I tend to wake up from it because I died, so I'm not sure what I can do to turn it around if that is the solution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you snore? Seems like a strange question but this type of violent waking can be related to sleep apnea where you literally stop breathing while sleeping. Even a long dream can be created in the brain in an instant so sometimes it feels like a nightmare. Just something else to consider. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that a known thing? Because I've been having a lot of dreams lately that involve action (me running or fighting) or intense emotion that gets me worked up. I've known for some time that I snore and have sleep apnea, and I was thinking that might be causing it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always wondered how complex dreams that feel like they take hours but in reality happen in a few seconds. For example, recently I had a dream I was in a crashing plane over the ocean (it was terrifying how realistic it was, I never experienced a dream where everything was so vivid. It was like 4K dreaming) and as the plane was crashing I could hear the warning beeping in the cabin going off and when the plane crashed I woke up and realized the same beeping was the sound of my alarm clock that just started beeping. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Awesome answer. A question arose while I read the part about our frontal lobes being nearly inactive during dreams. If this area of the brain bring inactive causes us to lose critical thinking and therefore the ability to realize we are in fact dreaming, is an abnormal amount of activity from the frontal lobes what causes us to lucid dream? In lucid dreams, we are aware that we are dreaming and have the power to control our dream, which seems like it requires higher-than-usual amounts of critical thinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have this same question so hopefully someone can answer. I'd also ask if our frontal lobes are working more than normal, does that mean our sleep is less beneficial (recovery/evolutionary theories)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This line of thinking, that frontal lobe activity is inactive while dreaming, makes me think of how in some people with frontal lobe dementia, the personality may change drastically,  and inhibitions may lessen. I wonder if there's  any correlation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd wager that there's a pretty good chance that frontal lobe activity could be linked to lucid dreaming, that's a very interesting idea and I'm glad you brought it up.  I actually lucid dream quite frequently (I sort of taught myself to for a while) but that never occurred to me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can't be true. I have realised I'm dreaming sometimes - usually when a freaking tiger pops up in the middle of the DIY store and climbs on top of a paint can display interrupting my route to the dodgems that are over by the wallpaper racks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this misses 99% of your post, but I figured out how to read a micrometer in my dreams. We dont have digital ones, and one night I just had a dream about the micrometers at work. Next day I went in and asked someone &quot;Hey does this say x? How about this?&quot; and I could read it just fine.</p>
<p>An ex of mine forgot her WoW password for a few months and simply couldnt play because who remembers security questions? She had a dream about entering her password and then tried the password as soon as she woke up (at like 2 AM lol). It was the right password.</p>
<p>So I'd be willing to argue that &quot;The problem solving theory&quot; is fact. No sleeping doesnt instantly solve a problem, but its completely, undeniably possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone studying the dream theories; no, you didn't. You already subconsciously figured out how to do so, your brain consolidated the information, and as it was being processed from the hippocampus, you likely then became aware of your knowledge. We don't learn any new information or knowledge in our dreams that we didn't already have, however, there are some theories on how we process what we know. </p></div>		</li>
