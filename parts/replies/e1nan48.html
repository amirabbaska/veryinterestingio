<p>The byte is a relatively recent invention, and not at all as commonly used as you probably think. There used to be computers running all sorts of different numbers of bits to a byte.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bytes are not a new invention.  They go back to the first computers.  You also seem to think that the 8 bit byte is new.  It's not.  There have been various systems built that have different word lengths (number of bits in a byte).  8 is very common and not new.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most modern computers store all information 32 bits at a time. Even single-bit Boolean values are given an entire 32 bit block of RAM since it simply isn't worth packing them any tighter than that, and unless a programmer goes out of his way to change it, that's how they're sent over the internet (along with an IP address and packet header).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Modern computers tend to use 64bit words.  32 is legacy and is being deprecated.  Legacy systems have all kinds of word lengths.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Last I heard, French developers still referred to bytes as octets, though this was about a decade ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Octets refer to IP network addressing.  Anyone that supports or writes for IP uses the term octet.  It's not bit/byte terminology.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bits, on the other hand, had become essentially globally standardized by the time the internet was invented, so they can be used to measure speed without worrying about what hardware someone is using.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bits are the base level of information in a computer.  They are intrinsic to how computers work, and were 'standardized' from day one.</p>
<p>Speed is measured various ways, and bits are not the only unit of measure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(I'm sure there's still someone, somewhere, working on making non-binary bits)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They would be called something else.  BIT = Binary digit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fact of the matter is, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte" target="_blank">the standard &quot;byte&quot; was only finally formally defined as 8 bits in 1993</a>.</p></div>		</li>
