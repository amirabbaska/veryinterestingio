			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me give you a practical example :</p>
<p>. If you open a command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Linux) and type the command &quot;ping www.reddit.com&quot; , you'll learn that Reddit servers IP address is 151.101.129.140. </p>
<p>. You can take note of this on paper, or still better, inculde this information in a given textfile of your OS, if you know how to and where.</p>
<p>. If tomorrow the core of the DNS is nuked, several cities across the USA, but the city where Reddit servers are hosted survives, you could still reddit by typing this address on your browser.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that isn't the only address.
My machine is currently using a different IP for Reddit because load balancing across multiple devices/addresses is a must for a large application to remain stable and fast.
The IP you listed happens to be one of their nameservers which should then point you to their hosting provider fastly.net who will serve you a page from local content.</p></div>		</li>
