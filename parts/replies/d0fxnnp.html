<p>Amputees get phantom limbs, where they feel say an itching on their right hand, even if they don't have a right hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been wondering.</p>
<p>If you scratch the end of the stump, what does it feel like?  Is it like: &quot;That spot is my thumb, but just to the left is the back of my hand.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sometimes these mirror boxes are used to trick the brain into thinking the limb is still there and releasing tension. By putting both limbs in and flexing them both in the same manor, you can work out cramps etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Gets rebounded to you as an error message.</p>
<p>Kinda similar, where that error message is just the &quot;phantom pain&quot;.</p>
<p>At least, that's as ELI5 I can get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is the ELI5 scientific answer, since everyone here seems to be talking from personal experience. There is a part of your brain that every nerve is mapped to. For example, look at your fingers and imagine that somewhere in your brain they are numbered 1-5, with subcategories for each nerve segment (Think 1.1, 1.2, etc.). What would happen if your middle finger (digit 3) would be cut off? Since the finger is no longer there to give or receive stimulus, over time the brain kind of deletes that empty space by mapping the adjacent nerve endings to it. Now where 3 used to be, 2 and 4 now incorporate their own mappings into that spot. This is the reason why some people are saying that they can scratch a different part of their body and feel relief. Boom. And here is a picture for how it looks mapped to the brain <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/1421_Sensory_Homunculus.jpg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/1421_Sensory_Homunculus.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>
