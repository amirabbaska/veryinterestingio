			<div class="markdown"><p>Who supplies the medication? Is it a specialty warehouse or what? </p>
<p>I have never ever seen anyone actually bring medicine in except for once at CVS. Even then I'm not sure what it was as it could have just been some other merchandise.</p>
<p>I know Walmart for instance gets daily shipments on all but Sunday. I never had to wait two days for it, even for special ordered prescriptions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're wholesalers, but specifically for medicines and medicinal supplies. So basically they buy them from the manufacturers and sell them to us, so yeah basically they are stored in a big warehouse somewhere. My dad actually works in some of these warehouses from time to time fixing their machines, and they are huuuuge. </p>
<p>We can normally have anything in either that day, or the next. There are some trickier medicines like Unlicensed medicines, or High tech which we sometimes have to order directly from the manufacturers , but these are a rarity and generally people using these medicines prefer to leave their scripts on file so they arent normally left waiting.</p>
<p>If something is short supply, well then yeah we cant get it straight away. Usually we can get what we need from a secondary supplier (wholesaler ) but if not then the pharmacist will ring the prescribing doctor and ask their permission to supply an alternative.</p></div>		</li>
