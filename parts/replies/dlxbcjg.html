			<div class="markdown"><p>What i also know is that this is the digestive system we're talking about. 2nd most energy demanding activity/function the human body can do, main source of energy and resources for your body and evolution has taken every precaution - your intestines have a protective barrier, many immune defenses and is even in symbiosis with your bacterial floral that can also protect you against foreign substances and microorganisms so most cases, you don't even notice. Not to mention your stomache acid which is a strong chemical barrier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know for a fact i can go from entrance to exit in under 8 hours. e.g last night, ate cashew nuts at around 12.30am. The tail end of my morning business at 6am (5.5 hours later), sure had a familiar grainy consistency of cashew nuts. Transit times, like most human traits, vary widely in the population. I'm generally on the faster end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, same here, food goes through me pretty quickly. There is a pretty big variety. I usually go several times a day, some people go every other day. When I was younger I was quite shocked to hear of people who go once every other day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It generally has to do with your metabolism and several other factors. If you're under 25 and active, you'll have a much faster turnover rate than someone in their forties who doesn't exercise. This is why young people have less knowledge on fiber additives and hemorrhoid treatments. By the time the average American hits 50, these are going to be regular issues. </p></div>		</li>
