<p>since at least the late 1800s &quot;mobilization&quot; was one of the most important aspect of a military. That is the first country to be able to get their military together, ready, and in the action, has a decisive advantage. </p>

<p>To further this comment,  Nowadays if you have an effective military, if you really wanted to mess some stuff up, you could fly in, and destabalize an entire country within hours if all they had was a police force, and make it yours.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about having a military for the military's sake either. Military spending is a good way for governments to 'stir the pot' as it were. Investing in military contracts filters money down in to all the  industries and companies that supply the military, keeping jobs afloat and stimulating the economy.</p>
<p>Take Trident for example, yes it'll cost billions, but that isn't money that just dissapears, it goes to hundreds/thousands of UK businesses and stimulates a ton of growth in the technology and engineering sectors. This is good for the economy as a whole.</p>
<p>Tl:Dr Military spending is a way for a government to stimulate it's economy also.</p>
