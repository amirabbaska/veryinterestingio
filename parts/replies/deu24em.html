			<div class="markdown"><p>Savings rates don't discredit the idea that Japanese speakers don't fully think about the future in the same way. This implies that saving always necessarily has to do with the future...it doesn't. Utterly flawed reasoning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The linked article in the top comment of this thread assumes the opposite, that a language with weak future tense terms correlates to more saving, not less.</p>
<p>I suppose the idea is that the future seems more precarious in such a language so the speakers save more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>English doesn't have a future tense either. We also add context, like &quot;will X&quot; or &quot;might X&quot; instead of changing the verb. Co.pare with the past tense, which changes the verb itself, run to ran, sit to sat, cook to cooked, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>-ed words are past participles, not a tense. Our version of 'changing the verb' is just by adding 'will' or 'going to' or 'had' or 'has' or whatever in front of the verb. It's no different functionally to how languages like Spanish and French do it, where the ending of the verb changes, rather than the preceding word.</p></div>		</li>
