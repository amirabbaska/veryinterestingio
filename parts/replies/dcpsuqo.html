			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I vaguely knew about different phases, but it wasn't something that my schooling taught so it was just things I picked up browsing Reddit, I guess. Is there any noticeable difference in III and I_h if you view them next to each other? (assuming you could, idk)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Ice III is partially stable, so if it is created and then taken out of its container, it would remain as Ice III at least temporarily. </p>
<p>The biggest difference is that Ice III is denser than water, while I_h is less. So, if you put Ice III into your drink, it would sink to the bottom. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this answer from an engineering perspective, you're not necessarily going to crack the container. What's far more likely is that the container will deform or stretch long before reaching 43,000 psi and the resulting change in volume will be sufficient to significantly drop the pressure. You can freeze water in an airtight nalgene bottle without getting anywhere close to 43,000 psi. If the container cracks, it's probably cracking at a much lower stress than 43,000 psi and it probably stretched before it got there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting.  Shouldn't they have equal density if neither the mass or the volume change?  I'm imagining a tube that can withstand the necessary pressure filled completely with liquid water and frozen to Ice III.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In real life you can find almost what you're looking for (and one of the other phases) if you leave bottles of water out on the porch for long enough in the winter. If there aren't any air bubbles and the water is pure enough, it won't freeze solid and therefore wouldn't change volume (at normal freezing temperatures anyway). The second you shake it or open it or otherwise move it, the whole thing crystallizes at once.</p>
<p>It's super fun!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly unrelated note:</p>
<p>It takes energy to crack a vontainer.  When water freezes and cracks a container, where does the energy to crack the container come from?  </p>
<p>Put it this way:  if you put a gram of water at 0deg in a container (just big enough to hold the water, also at 0deg) and put it in in a isolated room.  Then extract extract exactly enough heat to freeze the ice.  The container should break.  (Assume we have a way of extracting the heat directly from the water and not the container)</p>
<p>Then you put exactly that amount of energy back into the water.  Would the ice be water at 0deg again?  Or would the water be at greater than 0deg, because of the energy that was needed to crack the container?</p></div>		</li>

<p>not really.  you extract enough heat to freeze the ice <em>minus</em> the energy to break the container.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>since that is less (because of the <em>minus</em>) than the energy released on freezing, it will not melt the ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And what mechanism of energy transfer that allows energy to be expended by forcing/cracking thr container?  Where did that energy come from, how was that energy stored before it broke the container?  Was it heat (I find that hard to believe)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait,  show your math on this.</p>
<p>Because if it takes a removal of 500 units of energy to freeze the water, and it takes an addition of 250 to crack the container, you're saying that extracting 250 units will freeze the water and crack the container. But 250 is not enough to freeze the water so how can you say that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking about this from the other side, lets say you have a container capable of withstanding the amount of pressure up to 43kpsi. You start drawing heat out of the container. What happens? The water stays liquid, but the pressure increases. It cannot expand due to the container and cannot form ice at the current pressure. The water will stay liquid until either the pressure vessel gives and the volume is available to make ice at the lower pressure, or until the pressure is sufficient to make a different type of ice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it stayed liquid, it wouldn't take up all the volume at those pressures.  A small fraction of it freezes, more the lower the temperature gets.  At the Ih-III-liquid triple point, all remaining water freezes into Ih and, mostly, III.  The maximum pressure is around 30kpsi.  43 would be if you increased pressure at constant temperature until it froze, which isn't what we're doing.  We're lowering the temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basic thermodynamics tells you that there are only two possible reasons lowering the temperature would crack the container.</p>
<p>The first is that allowing the water to expand and freeze releases more energy than it costs to break apart the container. Keeping the container intact would actually require <em>more</em> energy in total.</p>
<p>The second has to do with entropy. Counter intuitively entropy can actually increase by forming crystals (even without any attractive forces), if this is the case thermal fluctuations would tend to push the container apart. This force is probably more subtle than the first one, but it shouldn't be underestimated.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not possible, the entropy of the solid will always be lower than the entropy of the liquid at the same temperature.</p>
<p>Otherwise you could get exothermic melting.</p></div>		</li>
