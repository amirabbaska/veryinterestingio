			<div class="markdown"><p>Just curious but what about their feet? I understand the feather part completely but their feet seem to just be skin and bones. Especially birds with long thin legs. What is keeping them from freezing up? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First of all, if it's really cold, birds will try to cover as much of their feet as possible with feathers. Second, birds that deal with cold temperatures have a mechanism to prevent heat loss. Warm blood flows into feet through arteries, which run next to and are often surrounded by veins, which carry cold blood back into the body. The warm and cold blood flows opposite directions (countercurrent) to facilitate heat exchange. Therefore blood reaching feet is barely warmer than the surroundings, to prevent heat loss.Blood returning to the body is warm enough to prevent body temperature from dropping. This way the feet can be supplied with blood without losing much heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There feet will be much colder than their bodies all the time, they just have to remain above freezing, they don't need nearly the same minimum temperature as organs or brain. They also tend to either stand on one foot with the other tucked into their feathers or sitting down on both feet. And like the other guy said, their veins and arteries going into their legs are specially overlaid each other to allow heat exchange to pre-warm returning blood with the heat of outflowing blood, returning some of that heat back to the body rather than shedding it out into the air. Plus I imagine the actual flow amount is really small, it isn't entirely uncommon for some birds to get some frostbite on their toes during especially harsh winters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always assumed they do get cold but the birds don't care precisely beccuse they're skin and bones with a minimal vascular system, so not much body heat is lost.</p></div>		</li>
