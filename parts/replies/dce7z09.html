			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to play off of your whole god and morality bit, I would argue that it was humans who created the morality of god and not the other way around.  If god exists, Then he didn't come down and tell us what is and is not moral.  Humans themselves came up with what is and is not moral and attributed it to god to justify morality.  Different gods throughout the religions of history have had different morals because the people who believed in those Gods had those morals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In my mind, some political opinions are obviously wrong. Some make me angry. But I hope I can still calmly imagine a world in which they are true (or think of examples when people tried to make them come true) and think through the implications in order to have an argument with someone about them.</p></div>		</li>
