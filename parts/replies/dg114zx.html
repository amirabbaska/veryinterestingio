			<div class="markdown"><p>When it's not dyed(like it is now) my hair shows more colors when I'm in the sun than the light brown I typically have in the winter. Light brown, sunlight brings out blonde streaks, and I'll also get some red mixed in (much more subtle). It's kinda cool, but I like my hair dyed red so I'll have a hard decision to make this summer haha</p></div>		</li>
