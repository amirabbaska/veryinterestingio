			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of it is priming (the appeals to core affect), some of it is framing  (usually issue ads that influence thinking about a policy using some heuristic preferred by the researcher/advertiser) some is oure emotinal induction  (violent imagery and ominous music elicits anxiety, for example), and most is classical conditioning, which is combined with the above processes  (i.e. we induce anxiety while showing you a picture of Trump so that eventually you associate Trump with anxiety).</p></div>		</li>
