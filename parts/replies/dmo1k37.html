			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the atmosphere is far too dynamic. Although a tropical system can stay relatively motionless for some stretch of time, it is eventually steered by mid- to upper-level winds by a passing trough. Tropical systems rely on warm water to feed their heat engine, but they can even transition to extratropical systems as they are swept to higher latitudes. At that point, the storm system is reliant on vertical structure, and a mature extratropical system will actually choke itself out from the upper-level support it needs to maintain its strength. Think of any storm system as a way to correct an instability in the atmosphere: warm air at the surface for extratropical systems, or excessively warm water for tropical systems. Once that source of instability is exhausted, there's nothing to maintain the storm system.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, thank you! And what might happen if, say, the jet stream fed into the top of the system (supposing a system which rose high enough for this to be an option)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The jet stream is actually an important part of the life cycle of many extratropical cyclones, as the &quot;entrance and exit&quot; regions from the curvature of the jet provide the upper-level support for a storm system to deepen, and eventually cut off that same supply.</p>
<p>Consider a low pressure system at the surface: that air has to go somewhere... up, right? If there is divergence aloft via assistance of the jet stream, that can help with intensification, as the rising air has an outlet to escape, and the low pressure system deepens. Eventually this scenario self-corrects itself, though. The physical details of this occlusion process are extremely interesting (as it involves temperature gradients as much as straight wind dynamics), but unfortunately, despite several attempts to type up an answer, I'm just not pulling an explanation I'm proud of. If you search for extratropical occlusion you should find some good material, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc, it's mostly because of how huge Jupiter itself is. The storm itself is much larger than the Earth, so it takes a lot longer for it to wind down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, this is the comparison to Jupiter, I guess. A gas giant probably doesn't behave all that differently than a planet with no land in terms of storm dynamics. I remember reading in graduate school a paper about a climate simulation of a planet with no land; I'll have to see if I can dig that up this afternoon if you're interested, because I think it would be relevant here.</p>
<p>I typed out a much longer reply here, but I'm afraid I don't want to speculate too much. The truth is that we don't have any ocean planets to observe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hurricanes need massive amounts of energy supplied by the warm ocean air evaporating off warm seas at tropical latitudes. They are heat engines; remove their energy source and they gradually lose power. Land masses eventually occur at all tropical latitudes, so a hurricane will hit the land and lose its main energy source. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you are saying is we can stop all hurricanes by periodically dropping giant ice cubes into the ocean, <a href="https://youtu.be/0SYpUSjSgFg" target="_blank">thus solving the problem once and for all.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. Not an expert, so correct me if I'm wrong, but notice that hurricanes grow and stabilize at sea, and weaken when they hit land. Jupiter has no land to disrupt the storm, at least not at any elevation meaningful to the great red spot. The atmosphere is more uniform, and there are no land masses or disruptive features such as mountains to make more complex earth-like wind patterns exist. Notice how the gas giants have winds that don't really change in latitude, the weather bands move with the rotation of planet and don't seem to mix in any meaningful way except at the edges of those bands, like so.</p>
