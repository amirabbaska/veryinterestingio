			<div class="markdown"><p>Because in a small tribe of people you would notice what others are up to. Young girls likely wouldn't be having sex until around the time they hit puberty. Women who were sick might not have been having sex. And there were probably other situations where healthy, fertile women weren't having sex for social reasons (e.g., they were only supposed to have sex with the leader of the tribe, but he was out on a hunting trip for three months, etc).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention women would easily understand that having a period meant they weren't pregnant. Not pregnant, then sex with a guy, then lack of period two weeks later is a pretty easy example of cause and effect. </p>
<p>Plus the kid would look like the guy. You would have to be pretty dense not to connect the dots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It needs to be mentioned that women who are pregnant stop having PMS. Observing animals in heat and also mating rituals would have made the connection easier to understand. The drive to procreate is a strong one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that many tribes had taboos on sex for extended periods of time, almost as if running an experiment or to emphasize the relationship between sex and pregnancy.</p>
<p>Among the Sambia (not their real name) there is a taboo for two years following the birth of the child, no sex for the woman.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first signs of pregnancy usually happen about two weeks after conception(missed period). An observer may not notice, but the woman sure would! Wouldn't take too long to figure out what was going on. If the first sign was giving birth, sure, it would be more complicated. </p></div>		</li>

This is the worst eli5 I've seen with this many comments because the amount of irrelevant religious comments I had to scroll through.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, we never really &quot;learned&quot; how to reproduce. We have evolved from organisms who evolved from organisms and somewhere down the line sexual reproduction and the sharing of DNA became a thing. It was engrained in the DNA of our ancestors, just as it is engrained in ours. Put a male and a female into a room that have never heard anything about sex and they will eventually figure it out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously, I'd have thought this would be the obvious answer. If anything, it's our conscious knowledge of the correlation that more often curbs the behavior than promotes it, let alone acts as any kind of requisite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not saying that redditor is right (because keeping animals came <em>very</em> recently in the history of humans), but I think their idea is that most animals have a gestation period far shorter than humans' nine months, so the effect would have been easier to notice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. If you were to keep sheep you would see that the female sheep (ewe pronounced you) come into heat once a year. The sheep have sex, then a month later are visibly pregnant. An entire flock gives birth at roughly the same time, within a month or so. The gestation period is around around 5 months. </p>
<p>Shepherds tending to flocks of goats and sheep would have been reasonably likely to connect the dots. Shepherds did figure out that the traits of the ram that has sex with the ewe influences the traits of the lambs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My family had animals when I grew up.  You'd see all animals having sex. You'd see cats getting horny in certain periods and shortly after being pregnant. You'd see that chicken eggs didn't hatch unless the rooster rode them. You'd have a female dog that never got pregnant until that one time the neighbours dog paid her a surprise visit before you threw him out of the back yard. </p>
<p>If you're not oblivious to the world I think this causality is easy to deduce.</p>
<p>Edit: typo and chicken thing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chickens lay eggs all the time without a rooster.  Do you think all your omelettes were fertilized?  Battery hens never see a rooster in their entire lives, yet you can still have that yummy yummy egg mcmuffin.</p></div>		</li>
