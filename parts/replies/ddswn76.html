			<div class="markdown"><p>In which step?   In Step 3, you write it in machine language, basically a &quot;machine language to assembly language translator&quot;.</p>
<p>By step 4 you could write it in the assembly language you created in step 3.</p>
<p>Basically, in each step you use the output of the previous step to create the new product. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But all the steps say &quot;write&quot; code in machine, assembly, or higher. It doesn't say how talking in 1's and 0's tells the computer to do anything but turn a switch on or off. If I had a roomful of light bulbs with a switch for each, I could play with them all day and not come up with a computing machine. I'd just have blinking lights. Something major is missing from the explanation. Are the 1's and 0's networked somehow? Are there functions like math hard coded on circuit boards that the 1's and 0's are manipulating? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Step 4 is the issue, where you jump from physical to digital. He's not clear on how you suddenly go to inputting it digitally, when you haven't explained the difference between digital and physical input and how the machine can now detect the latter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I am not understanding what assembly actually is. How does that actually get translated into the ones and zeros?</p>
<p>I understand the ones and zeros and logic circuits. I understand the use of things like punch cards. But that is where my understanding ends. How does this &quot;language&quot; interact with the hardware? How does the hardware know what to do with it?</p>
<p>The missing link for me is the literal translation from code to hardware.</p>
<p>As I write this out, I think I am starting to grasp it... but not quite. I feel like I am going to have one of those moments where the floodgate is released and everything falls into place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point! What happens is something like this, called bootstrapping:</p>
<ol>
<li>I write a lot of assembly.</li>
<li>I get tired of writing assembly, so I invent a new language called &quot;C&quot; which is much easier to write.</li>
<li>I use assembly to write a simple program (a &quot;compiler&quot;) which will transform my language C into assembly.</li>
<li>I write a new compiler in C which transforms C into assembly, and compile it with the program I wrote in step 3.</li>
<li>I continue to add new features to my language, each time using the old compiler to compile a new compiler that can handle the new feature.</li>
<li>Repeat step 5 until my C compiler has all the language features I want.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For those with some programming background (or not) and want to try their hand at some Assembly coding, I would suggest checking out <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC-3" target="_blank">Little Computer 3 (LC3)</a>. It is a computer model which we used heavily in my intro CompE classes designed for teaching concepts of how registers, ALUs, Muxes/Decoders, etc.. all work together to solve complex problems all with 16bit binary instructions. Here are some  <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cse240-Fall05/handouts/lc3guide.html" target="_blank">simulators</a> and <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/msKvp.png" target="_blank">diagrams</a> to show how it works and to let you try your own hand at Assembly code.</p></div>		</li>
