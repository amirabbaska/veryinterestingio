			<div class="markdown"><p>To be a good pigment, the compound needs to be able to absorb visible light, which has a low energy level.  In order for the compound to be able to absorb low energy light, it needs to have electrons which can move between lots of different energy levels that are close together.  If there are a lot of different energy levels that are close together, it often means that it will be easy for some of the existing bonds to be broken and new bonds to be formed if exposed to highly reactive chemicals.  If it undergoes a reaction like this, it will break its ability to continue to act as a pigment.  Bleach and hydrogen peroxide are good examples of highly reactive chemicals that are good at doing this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can check on wiki what is a chromophore.
Basically it is a long chain of atoms with conjugated double bonds found in the molecule responsible for color. When it receives a photon (energy light). This energy is absorbed and raise an electron to an excited states (see quantum energy level on wiki).  </p>
<p>Excited state is unstable and this electron go back to ground state by releasy also energy in the form of light, more so visible light equal to a specific wavelength responsible for the color (see visible spectrum on wiki). How long is this chain of double bond basically affect the color observed when the electron go back to his ground state. More specifically it affects the gap between the ground and first excited state where it will equal a specific wavelenght corresponding of what color we will see.</p>
<p>For example, Chlorophyl found in leaves has a specific chromophore which return energy that looks green to our eyes. Sometimes the transmitted light is in the ultraviolet like the molecule anthracene</p>
<p>Bleach destroy this molecule by oxydation.</p></div>		</li>
