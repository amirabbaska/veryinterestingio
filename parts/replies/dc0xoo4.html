			<div class="markdown"><p>I like answers like yours. In my opinion, this is exactly what ELI5 answers are supposed to be. That is, if the answer-er doesn't explain what he is actually talking about (in the case of this post, for example, the RTG), it's not an ELI5 answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot Curiosity had one too. I wonder what the expected lifetime of that one is, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Fueling_of_the_MSL_MMRTG_001.jpg" target="_blank">slab of 4.8 kg / 11 lbs plutonium dioxide</a> (here glowing from the decay). A guess is that it'll have mechanical failures before it stops being able to power the rover? Still cool that it'll be able to pull through regardless of dust on any solar panels, and Martian summers as well as winters. I love RTG's - to hell with controversies about nuclear power, haha... Given the limited quantity and use, and the highly warranted use cases I think it's among the best applications of radioactives today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, RTGs of the kind used in space don't have moving parts - they use thermocouples to generate electricity.  They are inefficient, but light, and when your power source literally glows red-hot, the inefficiency isn't a big deal.</p></div>		</li>
