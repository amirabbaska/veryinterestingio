			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe? It would be more like an enclosed submarine. The photosynthesis required to produce more oxygen isn't possible because the plant is dead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also, the fruit wouldn't photosynthesize, just the leaves, right?  so even if it was on the vine, he would probably run out of air sooner or later.  Though, he'll probably be fine by breathing through the Antman shaped hole in the fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, for a while after being plucked from the parent plant or the root bulb, a plant will continue photosynthesis for a while longer until it runs out of water (which makes it possible)</p>
<p>It wouldn't be able to do so in the water though. Roots have high surface area and are better equipped to suck water and nutrients from the ground vs a cut stem.</p>
<p>We had leaves in my biology class that were plucked from a tree, a day later after being sealed in a container, the cells were still showing signs of activity, such as the stomata opening and closing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fruit photosynthesize at a very low rate. It is likely, though I have no data at hand for pepper, that the internal atmosphere is rich in carbon dioxide and deprived of oxygen. Google for internal atmosphere in apple. There's a really good paper by Bart Nicolai in Belgium wherein they mathematically modeled the atmosphere inside. It's very low in oxygen. </p></div>		</li>
