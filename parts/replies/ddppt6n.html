			<div class="markdown"><p>For the uninitiated, equation (5) expresses the proper time <em>s</em> (the time elapsed according to the accelerated observer) in terms of the coordinate time <em>t</em> as measured by the inertial observer. The equation is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>t = (c/a) sinh(as/c)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <em>a</em> = constant proper acceleration of the accelerated observer. (There is actually an error in the equation.) Since sinh(z) is a strictly increasing function of <em>z</em> with sinh(z) ---&gt; infinity as z ---&gt; infinity, we see that there is no such &quot;asymptotic coordinate time&quot; that the OP suggests. In other words, for each proper time elapsed there is a corresponding (finite) coordinate time. It's not like an object falling into a black hole or something where there is not a 1-1 correspondence between proper and coordinate time.</p>
<p>However... you are going to have to wait a long time even for a rather small proper time. Note that sinh(z) ~ e^(z)/2 as z --&gt; infinity. (Indeed, the relative difference between sinh(z) and e^(z)/2 is less than 1% for z &gt; 2.5.) Conversely, note that s = (c/a) sinh^(-1)(at/c) ~ (c/a)ln(2at/c). For even a moderately large value of <em>s</em>, you need a very large value of <em>t</em> since the logarithm grows so slowly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you both for the reply.  I think I worked out what I did wrong, and now I see the curve of time dilation effects doesn't actually create an asymptote... it more or less straightens out.    </p>
<p>Thanks for explaining it!</p></div>		</li>
