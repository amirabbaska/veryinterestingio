			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is a problem for people stuck in the twentieth century, but those of us in 2016 with lcd monitors don't have that problem because the screen refresh is done differently.</p>
<p>Fwiw I checked with my dslr and the only difference the shutter speed made was in the brightness of the picture, no refresh artifacts showed up at all</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seems that this is caused by LCD displays toggling the backlight to control brightness in a process called pulse width modulation. More here: <a href="http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/pulse_width_modulation.htm" target="_blank">http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/pulse_width_modulation.htm</a></p>
<p>So if you record with 100% brightness it won't flick even with high shutter speed, but if you put low brightness it will unless it's PWM free display.</p>
<p>Here's a video that demonstrates it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlUHBQDlYgA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlUHBQDlYgA</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broadcast video engineer here, you're right that dimming an LCD backlight can cause flicker on video cameras. Just last week this happened at work and as soon as they described the problem to me I knew what to do (raise it to 100%). Later I found out that someone had adjusted the backlight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is more of an issue with CRTS - I thought maybe OP saw this effect on a older movie or tv show. Refresh rate + shutter speed still cause issues on for most monitors and video cameras though.  </p>
<p>In your test you went the wrong way. You need to increase your shutter speed, not lower it (which makes the image brighter). <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sQOVZUa.mp4" target="_blank">here is the &quot;banding&quot; effect</a> on your post. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't see how an lcd would behave like that. My understanding is that the light shines from the back continuously and only the liquid crystals change, (more or less - some also alter the intensity of the back light(s) in order to produce darker areas.)</p>
<p>I'm not saying it couldn't do that however, just that I don't know why it would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fluorescent lightbulbs flickering is actually dangerous in machining environment. If you have a very fast spinning cam and a flickering light, you might get the impression that the cam is stationary or rotating very slowly (and thus safe to handle) while it's in fact spinning very fast (and deadly)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing about this stuff, I assume &quot;cam&quot; doesn't mean camera ha - I was pretty confused at first. You can find lights advertised as 'flicker free' so I'd go with that instead of risking death</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that has been true since CRTs were popular. The pixels in an LCD screen kind of fade between colours, there isn't a line by line refresh of the screen like cathode ray screens had (which is what you are describing).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will still happen for an LCD, even though the pixels all change simultaneously, if your camera has a rolling shutter (very common) and you're using a shutter speed slower than the screen's refresh rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This only happens on screens with strobing (backlight goes dark when the image is updated, creates illusion of additional smoothness) or a screens PWM controlled brightness. Neither is very common. Most LCDs will appear solid on all types of cameras.</p></div>		</li>
