			<div class="markdown"><p>All of the aforementioned points are true...especially with regard to painting from photos instead of from life.  However, as impressive as the technical ability is in photorealistic art, I often find myself asking, &quot;Why?&quot;  What is the point of copying a photograph of Morgan Freeman down to the last mole and freckle on his face?  How is that any more compelling than the original photograph, other than the fact that it was tediously copied in paint?  Old Masters weren't copying - they were interpreting.  Seeing and creating with their own unique vision.  What seem to be haphazard brush strokes up close on a Rembrandt painting suddenly come together to create a perfect likeness of his sitters when the viewer takes a few steps back...his own interpretation, executed in a way only he could do.  I do agree that today's artists with today's tools and technology are able to render with much greater detail than artists in the past.  But &quot;blow them out of the water&quot;?  Not even close.</p>
<p>Please note I am stating my own opinions, not presenting them as facts.  I am aware many are enthusiastic about photorealistic art...I just prefer to see the artist's unique touch in their work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was alleged during the 17th Century a Dutch artist Vermeer had use of a camera obscura to create super lifelike (for the time) masterpieces. This is an artists set of lenses allowing whole scenes to be reproduced/reduced to an area over the canvas so a hand painted copy can be made.</p>
<p>Now there is a certain controversy over if/how Vermeer actually used one however last year (2014) the final documentary of Tims Vermeer came out showing how an inventor named Tim re-created one of Vermeers works, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Music_Lesson#/media/File:Jan_Vermeer_van_Delft_014.jpg" target="_blank">The Music Lesson</a>.</p>
<p>He made everything from scratch, he showed the process of grinding lenses for the camera, how he built every piece of the replicated Vermeer scene room, how he cried over the dots of the carpet and ended up with what appears to be a perfect copy after 5 years of hard work.</p>
<p>Its a truly amazing documentary, not just from an art pov but materials science and history too, plus goes a long way to suggest Vermeer must have been using one (I wont give away the clues he found, youll just have to watch it ;) )</p>
<p>I highly recommend it even if like me youre more geek than artie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read theories that when you see the jump from the somewhat crude medieval paintings to the relatively very realistic paintings that came after, it was due to the use of a camera obscura. </p>
<p>This is a pretty big LPT you figure would have spread like wildfire among artists. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't disagree with anything you said, but I didn't really bring that sort of thing up either because it's a little bit beyond the bounds of a typical ELI5.</p>
<p>That said, again, I generally agree with you. A painting indistinguishable from a photograph might as well be a photograph. It's an impressive exhibition of technical skill but ultimately it brings very little to the work. I think there's some potential for interesting conceptual uses of the work, like doing photorealistic paintings of heavily photoshopped photographs, which becomes a sort of comment on legitimacy and &quot;photorealism&quot; as an idea. Photorealistic paintings of photographs of other paintings (where you can see the frame, the canvas texture, the light glare on the surface, etc) also becomes kind of an interesting &quot;meta&quot; choice. There's interesting things that can be done with it. That said, it seems like most hyperrealistic painters today are more interested in exhibiting raw skill than applying it to compelling ideas or compositions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Old masters also copied from projections. Look at many portraits and see they are holding goblets with their &quot;left&quot; hands. Left handedness was not common. It is believed using light and mirrors assisted the great masters to project what they saw onto the canvas</p></div>		</li>
