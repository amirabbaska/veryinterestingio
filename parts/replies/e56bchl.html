			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an excellent book by Rick Hanson PhD (Berkeley): <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36025434-resilient?from_search=true" target="_blank">Resilient</a></p>
<p>The book is about how you can use mindfulness practices (mental workouts, really) to train your brain to weaken negative thought habits and to get better at constructive thought patterns.  </p>
<p>The brain is like a muscle and it gets good at what we use it for.  If we constantly ruminate over negative experiences then our brain will get increasingly good at doing that.  This book is a training manual for breaking that negative cycle and achieving a healthy mind.</p>
<p>The book is highly practical, well organized, easy to read, and is solidly based on science and professional practices in the fields of psychology and neuroscience.  It also comes in audiobook format, which you might even find in your library.</p>
<p>Humans have the unique ability to use reason to defy our natural instincts when they are counterproductive and to modify our behavior patterns in more positive directions.  This book teaches practical ways to achieve that end.</p>
<p>He also has a pretty helpful <a href="https://www.rickhanson.net" target="_blank">website</a>.</p></div>		</li>

Isn't the brain actually <em>like</em> a muscle, not an actual muscle?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meditation and introspection is the way to go. Take some time to sit and clear your mind. In the same way that ignoring the dishes in the sink doesn't get them done, neither does putting off facing the difficult issues that come about from life. Honestly, doing the dishes, and general household chores is a great first step towards improving your state of find. At least it has been for me. Feels good to take care of a minor problem such as that and see the clean outcome. Tackle each issue that bothers you one at a time, starting with the smallest. If you keep putting them off, you may find that the imposing stack of issues becomes overwhelming, and therefore harder to get a handle on. Best way to start to solve those issues is thinking introspectively. Reflect on your actions and choices, try to understand why you made them. If you're honest, you'll often find that you don't like the reasons behind some of your actions, and that's a good thing. Try to take that into account the next time you find yourself in a similar situation. Tons of people lock things they don't want to deal with away in a vault in their head; opening that fault and pulling out the issues one-by-one can help alleviate the negativity bias. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response! In addition, I think it is very important to understand what a memory is and what triggers memories. Whenever you experience an event, there are many forms of stimulation that are simultaneously being paired with the event. This can range from smells, colors, specific visuals, symbols, physical sensations, sounds, songs, etc. Memories are triggered when you are exposed to the same stimuli or similar stimuli that prompt your brain to engage in covert verbal (thinking) and visual behavior (imaging). The extent to which those stimuli evoke those behaviors depends on the value that the event had (how amazing was it or how terrible was it). Like explained in the original response, negative events tend to have significantly higher value, even though it was terrible, which makes those stimuli paired with the terrible event more likely to trigger the thinking and imaging or the &quot;memory.&quot; </p>
<p>In addition, the higher value the event has, the more dissimilar stimuli will evoke those same responses. For example, a war veteran with PTSD who had bad event pairings with gunshots may have thinking about that event evoked by way less intense auditory stimulation like a party popper.</p>
<p>I think it is important to understand memories as behavior that gets triggered rather than something locked inside your brain. When you do this, it is easier to identify what triggers memory and you'll start to understand more about how value of an event can make it more likely for these memories to be triggered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this does explain why fiction (films, books, etc.) focus on challenges rather than 'everything is fine' stories, it is not entirely correct. </p>
<p>We actually have a bias to see a rosy past and future. We generally perceive our personal world as more positive than it 'actually is'. </p>
<p>People who experience higher than average levels of anxiety or depression however can get a negative bias, and ruminate etc. like the above post mentions. </p>
<p>Considering many people experience such levels of anxiety or depression in contemporary Western society, this might be one the above answer rings true to so many.</p>
<p>Supporting the positive outlook idea, there is something called 'fading affect bias' - we actually forget negative information faster than positive, meaning we end up with more positive than negative memories (serious trauma excluded). </p>
<p>All of this I think makes evolutionary sense as a continuously depressed population is unlikely to propagate. Those are optimistic are more likely to be proactive and survive. There are loads of theories out there actually, but I don't know them of the top of my head. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured you needed both to propegate properly, people too sullen and they don't produce or reproduce. People too jovial and carefree and they tend to not pay enough attention to very pressing matters. On a macroscopic scale either end of the spectrum could have disasterous results for a society or tribe.</p></div>		</li>
