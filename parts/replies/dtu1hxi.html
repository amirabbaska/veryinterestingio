			<div class="markdown"><p>I currently have mono right now and have been ill for about 7 weeks and can confirm. Lost a decent amount of weight too. Sucks knowing that eating makes me get better slower lol. I miss the feeling of being hungry and, well, doing anything for that matter</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aw. I hope you get better soon.</p>
<p>In your case, I think you'll be happy to know that eating won't necessarily slow your progress.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the good news is also horrible news. You see, mono is short for Mononucleosis, and is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Since it's a virus, it attacks the body a bit differently from a bacteria.</p>
<p>Usually, bacteria is an organism that kind of just gets into your body and floats around, maybe replicate and absorb some nutrients here and there. Viruses like EBV require living hosts (because viruses are technically not &quot;alive&quot;). This means that when the virus is introduced into your system, it will find a host cell and inject its DNA into its nucleus. It will use your cell's ability to replicate DNA to replicate the virus instead, thus multiplying the virus. It will sit around in a cell for some time before the cell is packed with so much virus DNA that it kind of explodes, with little baby viruses running off to find other host cells. Viruses use the host directly, but do not require any nutrients to multiply like bacteria. Therefore, whether or not you eat won't really affect how quickly you heal, even if the lack of appetite is there.</p>
<p>Thus, I highly recommend you eat. Especially since you lost a decent amount of weight, and even more so because you're up against a virus. Your body will need all the energy it can get to keep looking for those pesky invaders and get rid of it, and you'll need the energy to replace the cells lost due to the virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanations for loss of appetite due to illness from bacterial versus virus! I am wondering if you can ELI5 how my &quot;broken heart&quot; and losing my appetite may be connected.  I am &quot;hungry&quot; always, but the stressful end of my most recent back-and-forth break-up has triggered an occasional loss of appetite.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had Glandular Fever (UK name for mono) when I was 16. It's a right bastard of a virus - sending you wibbly healing waves. Look after yourself dude and get plenty of rest (Netflix included) . Eat whatever you feel up to, even if it is junk food - milkshakes were about all I could handle for a good few weeks of my innings with it. </p>
<p>Also, don't rush back to whatever you usually do - build activity/work/college up again <em>slowly</em>. I can't enthuse this enough - if you feel like you need to rest... listen to your body because <em>you need to rest</em>.  I rushed back into full time college and gigging a few evenings a week and wound up with CFS/M.E which knocked 4 years outta my life and I'm still only functioning at about 75% of what I was before mono.</p>
<p>Wishing you a speedy recovery! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what my doctor said. Yup I've been doing little and am okay with that. CVS sounds awful and I feel for you. I couldn't imagine feeling this way for 4 years. Wishing you all the best!</p></div>		</li>
