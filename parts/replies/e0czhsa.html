			<div class="markdown"><p>MD here. Cortisol is not immediate acting. Steroids produce changes in the nucleus of your cell which takes time.  A very widespread asthma study showed that IV vs. oral steroids had the same onset of action (around 6 hours). I would suggest continuing your search for an answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s hard to do at this point when everyone is basically saying the exact same things - “they don’t know how to deal with being tired because they can’t communicate.” Thanks, y’all. I’ve never met a baby before but now I feel totally prepared! /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That supports the answer to OP's question.  When adults know it's bedtime they (hopefully) understand that they need sleep even if they aren't tired, whereas infants may be exhausted but not feel tired, and don't understand the need for sleep well enough to go to sleep, instead responding to whatever they currently feel, such as stress hormones, which would be accumulating from exhaustion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't provide a source, for all we know they could be lying. Wouldn't you wanna factcheck something before integrating this into your knowledge for life?</p>
<p>Edit: a selfproclaimed MD just spoke out against this, again no source!</p></div>		</li>

<p>An actual, legitimate explanation. I have no idea if it’s right, but it’s a hell of a lot better than, “kids are dumb.”</p></div>		</li>
