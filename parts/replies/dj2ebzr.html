<p>Your writing seemed to imply Theory of Mind == having one's own ideas and goals which isn't exactly the same thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I oversimplified my idea. The point was that it should have an ability to evaluate itself and it's own goals and ideas which requires ability to attribute different mental states to itself. Even the stupidest ai has a goal but it only becomes relevant if it also has an ability to actually think about the goals. </p></div>		</li>
