			<div class="markdown"><p>If you allowed that, now every single program that takes file names as input has to have handling for this escape characters, or the programs will malfunction, crash and burn with (some) legal file names.</p>
<p>You generally don't want to do stuff that's for little gain and is likely to cause thousands of programs to crash and burn. There is much, much value in having a system that's hard to screw up. Like, file names requiring no processing and being copy-pasteable as-is.</p></div>		</li>
