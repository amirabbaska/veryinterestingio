			<div class="markdown"><p>So if it is extremely unsafe without vitamins, back to OP's question, doesn't that mean if a fat person starved he'd die due to lack of vitamins before his body used all his fat cells?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, losing too much weight in a short amount of time can be really dangerous to your <a href="http://win.niddk.nih.gov/publications/gallstones.htm#f" target="_blank">gallbladder</a>, potentially affect your liver, as well to your metabolism. It shouldn't be done without proper medical guidance and monitoring.</p>
<p>A gradual and steady weight loss is recommended over a rapid weight loss.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yikes, so this person burned 3500 to 4500 calories per day...  * 382 days, his fat reserves were for more than 1.5 million calories?  </p>
<p>Seems incredible but by my admitedly imperfect calculations he would have lost about 430 lbs.  (1.528m calories / 3555 cal per lbs = 429 lbs of fat, slightly more then 1lb per day) </p>
<p>Which, taking error factors into account and a possible calorie count from the yeast, is actually plausible.</p>
<p>So not accounted for here is possible lowering of metabolism (cal/day) as the fast continued...  And all these numbers are extremely tentative guesses, but I thought the numbers would make no sense going in, which isn't the case.</p>
<p>This gives me new appreciation for how difficult it is to lose weight.</p>
<p>I wonder if it felt weird to start eating again...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are better estimators which take TDEE and LBM during the period of a diet into account somewhere on the interwebs.</p>
<p>You also have to take into account with that large of a deficit and not intake of dietary protein, an absurd amount of lean body mass loss will occur too. Lean mass is estimated to be considerably less than 3500cals/lb.</p></div>		</li>
