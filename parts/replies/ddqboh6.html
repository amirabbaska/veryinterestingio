			<div class="markdown"><p>It varies by person too. This is the heart of the dress debate. The actual pixels where very light blue and gold. So people that didn't automatically adjust for the washout from the camera flash thought there was some soft blue light tinting the white. Those that could adjust for the camera flash could see the true colors. In this case, seeing in more absolute colors actually resulted in the wrong outcome, it took context cues and comparison to get the right answer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused by your optical illusion example.  In the top row closest to the camera, I see blue, yellow, red, blue, green in both pictures.  None of the squares changes colors?  They changed shades, but not to different colors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The two &quot;blue&quot; squares you see in that row in the left picture aren't blue. They are grey. In fact, they're the exact same shade of gray as the &quot;yellow&quot; square you see in the right picture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really good way of looking at it. So as a colorblind person I basically lack the &quot;perfect pitch&quot; eyesight, because I often do have to reference other colors when looking at one I have trouble with. I can't just look at a color and say green, I need to compare it to yellow first to see the difference; same with purple and blue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do we? In my mind perfect pitch for vision would be being able to give the RGB code of arbitrary colors, and I'm not sure how good humans are at that in general (even sticking to the relatively simple problem of colors on a screen - colors in the real world are more tricky). We can probably (almost) all reliably recognize pure red, white or black, but how about various shades of fuchsia or brown or grey? </p>
<p>(edit) more discussion here: <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath578/kmath578.htm" target="_blank">http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath578/kmath578.htm</a></p>
<p>Conclusion: yeah okay we probably do have something like perfect pitch for colors, and knowing the right rgb codes is not a very good analogy.</p></div>		</li>
