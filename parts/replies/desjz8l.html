			<div class="markdown"><p>My doctor actually. I was pregnant in the summer and got dehydrated easily but still felt like i had to pee even if only drops of urine come out. I asked her about it because pregnancy urination should be frequent but have volume and not be literally constant with minimal output.</p></div>		</li>
