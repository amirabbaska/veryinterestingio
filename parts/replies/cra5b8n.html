			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a little bit of clarification from an engineer. </p>
<p>The reason why the beam vs arch thing works is due to Tensile vs Compression stresses in objects, and the ability of structural materials to handle those stresses. </p>
<p>When you have a beam, and it bends, the top part is bending inwards, causing the material to &quot;squish together&quot; creating compression stress, while the bottom end is &quot;pulling apart&quot; creating tensile stress. Looks a lot like <a href="http://s.hswstatic.com/gif/bridge-ct.gif" target="_blank">this</a>. </p>
<p>Now, concrete, like a lot of ceramics and ceramic dominated composites, is very strong in compression, but almost negligibly weak in tension. This is the main reason we add rebar to concrete, to give it tensile strength. The beauty of the arch however, is that is that it makes tensile stress a non-factor in the the structure. <a href="http://www.kdietrich.com/thesis/d9a-research/section%202%20science/section%202-0%20science_files/image031.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> is the best picture i can find after a few minutes on Google. You can see that the arch causes all the bricks to want to expand in what would normally be tensile stress, but because the bricks' expansion is impeded by the neighboring bricks, they instead press against one another horizontally, creating compression stress (which the concrete is very good at handling) and no tensile stress (which concrete is very bad at handling). </p>
<p>Because of this, the bridge will will last much longer than a flat sheet of concrete, which must endure tensile stress.
However, the bridge will eventually break down, due to a number of factors that range from environmental exposure, to beta decay, to fatigue cycles that the bridge must endure when someone walks over it. Walking over the bridges causes it to bear load, become unloaded, and eventually bear load again when the next person comes through. It's sort of like bending a piece of plastic inwards and outwards again and again until it breaks.</p>
<p>The thing about the solid ground is mostly true as well, though the romans would actually bury very large stones in the ground at either end of the bridge, which the base of the bridge would press against horizontally, again creating primarily compression stress. We don't think of ancient societies as being particularly advanced, but you better believe that the romans were amazing engineers, and that in my opinion was the propellant in their meteoric rise to dominance.</p>
<p>Edit: A bit of clarification on fatigue cycles. A fatigue cycle is when an object is put from compressive stress into tensile stress and back again. Now, an arched bridge has negligible tensile stress, but it does have ~some~ tensile stress; however, because that tensile stress value is so small, the fatigue cycle will have very little impact on the concrete compared to your driveway which undergoes a dramatic fatigue cycle every time you walk on/drive over it. Every fatigue cycle will reduce the Yield Strength (the amount of stress it takes to make something bend), and Ultimate Tensile Strength (the amount of stress it takes to make something break) of the material until it is no longer able to handle the stress it's loaded with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your clarification on fatigue cycles isn't very accurate. Fatigue cracks can occur due to any fluctuation of load (stress ratio), even if the building never experiences compressive stresses. Also, fatigue cycles actually do not lower the Yield or Ultimate stress of the material. Failure is primarily due due to net loss of area due to cracking and stress amplification at crack tips, not a reduction in the fundamental properties of the material.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a dozer operator, at our pits, the truckers load themselves with a loader.  I can only be at one pit at a time with the dozer, and these guys are always digging out the piles like this =( and complaining that they have a high wall that's going to fall on their machine, which is true.  I don't know how many times in safety meetings I've asked them to dig from the piles like this =) so a high wall doesn't develop, but they just don't get it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good answer.</p>
<p>There are thre reasons we don't build in the old roman style.</p>
<p><strong>1) It is more expensive today.</strong>  In a lot of roman structures they mortared in stone.  Carting around good stone is more expensive to pouring concrete around steel rods.  Don't believe me?  Compare a granite table top to the cost of some steel rods. But back in the Roman Empire that was reversed.  Iron was the expensive component and stone was the cheap component.  Additionally arches use more material than post &amp; lentil if your goal is to create a flat surface on top.</p>
<p><strong>2) It is weaker.</strong>  Concrete and rebar is much stronger than concrete and stone.  Our structures have to carry more weight moving at MUCH faster speeds than anything the Roman structures had to carry.  </p>
<p><strong>3) Roman great works were made to last.</strong>  This is not some commentary on how great the Romans were and how short sighted we are.  If the Romans were going to go to the bother of building a bridge, aqueduct, etc. it was because their was a big need for such a project and there was no foreseeable point in time that the project would not be important.  These would be projects upon whom literally tens of thousands of people would depend on them for decades.  However that small community bridge built by you might be as advanced as a roman highway bridge, but that modern bridge was going to service a few hundred people.  And in 10 years the community will likely grow and we want a bigger bridge.  Why build something to last 500 years, when you suspect you will want to tear it down in 10 to 20?  The Romans would not have solved your problem with an elaborate &amp; sophsicated bridge for just a few hundred people.  All they would have done is maybe throw up some extra ropes so that fewer waders would drown when they crossed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Archaeologist here. Romans themselves didn't for most parts build in what you call &quot;roman style&quot;. They made almost everything with concrete and bricks (opus cementitium), but we have mostly the great public works that were build with expensive materials as populist statements so they lasted to examine today. &quot;Roman great works were made to last.&quot; is circular reasoning based on predisposed evidence. They botched up public buildings, too, I could cite the <a href="http://www.stadt-koeln.de/mediaasset/bilder/rathaus/praetorium_1.jpeg" target="_blank">Roman Praetorium in Cologne</a> for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Roman great works were made to last&quot; isn't circular reasoning. </p>
<p>Palaces and cathedrals (and the Colosseum, which served as a cathedral of sorts) being built as symbols of Roman power were obviously built to spare no expense. And only the &quot;great works&quot; have been left standing, because their construction would necessarily need to be great to last 2k years. The shoddy concrete driveways where you would park your chariot, and other &quot;not great&quot; works built on the cheap with insufficient lime or without pozzolan would have long since cracked and eroded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>haha we do actually. It was about 1-2 inches thick new, I guess our contractor decided he could save some money and we wouldn't think to check the driveway construction. I think there are some skipped steps all over the place in this house (it's up to code though). But the thing is 20 years old somehow, but it does look like the fucking Mississippi delta</p></div>		</li>
