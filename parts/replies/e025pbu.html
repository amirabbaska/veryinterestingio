			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife dumped about a 1/4 of a bottle of hot sauce on a taco when she was having her chemo.  Not because she likes hot sauce, but because she couldn't taste it.  She didn't get sick, and from spending time with patients, a lot of them don't. Even when they are on AC which is pretty harsh.  My wife wanted to eat, loves food, put on a bunch of weight during chemo due to the corticosteroids she had to take.  But her tastebuds did not exist.  She did everything she could to find flavor, and until the chemo ended and they came back, nothing helped.  </p></div>		</li>
