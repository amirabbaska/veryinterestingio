<p>So in what other way do teeth heal?</p>

<p>Doesn't healing mean regrowing damaged parts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To answer your first question, teeth are always under attack from bacteria forming the biofilm(amongst other things). Bacteria lower the pH level on the tooth surface and this leads to demineralization. Through the buffer systems saliva has, it can bring the pH up again to the normal levels. However saliva can't always penetrate the forming plaque and the pH will remain low on the tooth surface. </p>
<p>Another thing saliva does is clear the fermentable foods from the mouth. Again, it depends the levels of saliva each person secretes and it's not as effective everywhere. Also, sticky food will take longer to get cleared.</p>
<p>Throught antimicrobial factors (lysozyme, lactoferrin, agglutinins, peroxidases) it can inhibit the microbial metabolism and adhesion, but these factors have varying efficiency.</p>
<p>These systems are mostly preventing the demineralization. But saliva can also remineralize the enamel by precipitating calcium and phosphate ions. This has a healing effect on early lesions. All this happens on the tooth exterior. From the interior, the pulp through odontoblasts can form secondary and tertiary dentin(the 'scar-like' tissue), which would fit the 'healing' term more. </p>
<p>But that's why I said the healing is a bit different, since with some help from us (hygiene, better diet), our body can stop the lesion progress any further, but can't repair the damage already done ( the exception being the early lesions, which are reversible and can be fully remineralized).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Now I need an ELI5 for this. Are you saying our saliva can coat our teeth with enamel? I understand it can be a minuscule effect but is that what's really going on? Your english is better than most people I know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side point on bacteria is they create a biofilm. That film gets in and covers the exposed tooth, probably preventing healing. </p></div>		</li>
