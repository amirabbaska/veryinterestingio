			<div class="markdown"><p>Hilbert spaces are not the only normed linear spaces having a inner product. Hilbert spaces are by definition inner product vector spaces which if seen as a metric space, where the metric is induced by the inner product, are complete, i.e. every cauchy sequence is convergent. Hilbert spaces are a subclass of inner product spaces, who are a subclass of normed vector spaces, who are a subclass of metric spaces, who are a subclass of topological spaces.</p></div>		</li>
