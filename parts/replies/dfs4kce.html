			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of having the sensor turn with the phone, it probably be cheaper to just have a square sensor and have the software throw out the top and bottom edges of the picture no matter the direction the phone is held. And it could still give you a square option (which the iPhone already does) that gives you all captured pixels from the sensor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly. But a square sensor either takes up a lot more space in the phone (if you want to maintain the longer axis) or requires a reduction in resolution (if you want it to fit int the space currently slotted). There's no solution without tradeoffs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Functionally it won't actually take more space, it's already in a spot with a circular region reserved for the lighted area. The real reason is cost, it makes the electronics about 33% more expensive and there are other orientation dependent limitations that start coming into play (the pixel layout starts mattering, both the display and CCD actually have red, blue and green pixels, and the best picture is obtained when you match the order of the CCD to the order of the display, you'll get weird artifacts if you're mixing vertical and horizontal orders). Also CCDs are generally read in entire rows and read out sequentially like that, flipping them is an expensive operation and can drastically slow down the camera (can't even start processing the frame until the entire frame is done reading, then you can flip it, then process it).</p>
<p>Overall the whole problem is just something that adds significant costs and would only provide a minor benefit, when rotating the phone with your hands works just fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I agree. But any mechanism to rotate the sensor with the phone will take up even more space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if they install an extra camera sensor which is orientated horizontally? To be fair, it's costly, but probably cheaper than a mechanism to move the sensor.</p></div>		</li>
