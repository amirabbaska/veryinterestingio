<p>Let that water evaporate and the salt will crystallize back to salt crystals, and you've created energy from the matter.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That terminology is a bit misleading, as evaporating the water costs energy, so you're not taking (free) energy from the matter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>What does it take to convert matter into energy? A chemical reaction will do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Just... No. That's not matter being converted into energy. That's energy stored in the chemical bonds being released. It's like compressing a spring. You don't increase the mass of the spring (or anything) by doing that.</p>
<p>I didn't read your whole answer but it's just a big bowl or wrong from the get-go.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This means it takes energy from the water and turns it into matter (the saltwater solution).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again. No. Leaving aside this example in particular, a chemical reaction (let's say photosynthesis) is not energy turning into matter. The matter in the system before and after is exactly the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are converting part of the matter that makes up, say the bonds in some nitrate into kinetic energy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again. No. You are not converting the bonds. You're literally turning matter into energy. You literally lose mass at the end of the chain reaction which is not the case for a chemical reaction which loses none.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated, chemical bonds do indeed change mass. This is true because of relativity - mass is simply the resting energy of a system (energy not accounting for momentum). The amount of energy is less than a nuclear reaction because the forces are weaker but the underlying physics is the same. Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy" target="_blank">nice article</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not sure why you were so confident that chemical reactions have nothing to do with mass but I hope you understand your error now and retract your original comment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Except... You do?</p>
<p>Weigh an uncompressed spring and a compressed spring and there is a measurable difference in mass. The chemical reaction is the same deal, binding energy makes up part of the mass. Even in hadrons, their mass primarily comes from the binding energy that holds them together, not from their quarks. You can't discount the binding energy of a molecule as &quot;not mass&quot; and say all of that proton is &quot;actual mass&quot;. And even the mass of quarks isn't really mass as we'd recognize it, it's just energy that's been bound up in the Higgs field.</p>

<p>I'll just add that it's not <em>easily</em> measurable, but it is measurable. It would take a very sensitive piece of equipment and making sure the act of compressing the spring didn't knock off a few molecules. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, you absolutely do. It's not easily measurable, but you do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your explanation.  It should be a book.  For someone like me, who did not have much formal science education, itâ€™s very helpful.</p></div>		</li>
