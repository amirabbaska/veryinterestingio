			<div class="markdown"><p>Simplified explanation: </p>
<p>It's possible to measure other properties of the particle that'd give you a hint about the state without you being sure about it. Or you can send a signal to your particle that'd flip it's state, 0-&gt;1 or 1-&gt;0, but since the signal is the same in both cases, you learn nothing from that, still you interacted with it.</p>
<p>It's very exciting and interesting stuff! It's not even that hard to understand the basics if you start with the beginning and learn little by little. There's no secret trick to become a scientist, just as there's no secret to becoming an athlete, you need to practice a lot and work hard. With discipline almost anybody, except people with conditions out of their control, can become either. </p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is that you're certainly smart enough to learn enough stuff to finally understand it. It may not be your cup of tea though, and that's ok too, as long as it can make you dream little!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its the math. Everything seems to get explained by some equation and i barely got through highschool math with a c-</p>
<p>Ive listened to various people give lectures like feymans one about particles vs waves and the 3 slit experiment. But i dont know how to follow along when people start using equations like its an answer in plain english. Shrug. I cant do it im just glad there's people out there that can.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't assume you're not smart enough to understand it, honestly, if I've learned anything studying physics it's that the way that most people understand anything difficult or complex is just by trying to understand it for a long time. </p>
<p>And I think why a lot of stuff in quantum mechanics can seem really difficult is that it requires one to understand a lot of foundational concepts before you can understand things above it. For instance quantum entanglement, quantum teleportation, bell's inequality, ect, were all things that I would read about on wikipedia but never really feel like a I actually &quot;really&quot; understood. But I've found that if you understand a lot of the underlying mathematical concepts (mostly stuff from linear algebra, differential equations, complex numbers, ect), then a lot of the stranger concepts can suddenly be a lot more approachable. And it wasn't until all of that foundational knowledge from all of that school combined with a quantum class for me to finally actually understand a lot of concepts that alluded me. </p>
<p>TL;DR, I think people underestimate how much they can understand, and that understanding is often just about putting in the time to understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top comment used the example of electrons. For example, let's use Helium. We know one has to be spin up and the other has to be spin down. And it makes sense that if you know one's value, you'd know the other.</p>
<p>Are there other systems of entanglement? In the case of Helium electrons, the system is extremely local. Are there systems not local? For example, systems light years apart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody can say for sure that there are no such systems. As an example, a pair of photons can be entangled and sent in opposition directions in Interstellar space. If the two photons are lucky enough not to interact with anything, just cruising through the void for X billion years, they'd still be entangled even if they're 2X billion years apart.</p>
<p>It's not hard in a lab to create such pairs that are a few meters apart, that's still ~ 10^15 , 1million times a billion, times farther apart than the protons in an helium atom.</p></div>		</li>
