<p>I don't know if it's been posted elsewhere, but here's a digest of last transmissions from crashed planes. <a href="http://www.planecrashinfo.com/lastwords.htm" target="_blank">One is just &quot;Mountains!!!&quot;</a></p>
<p>My personal favorite is the Polish pilot who mustered the lyricism to declaim: &quot;Goodnight, Goodbye, We Perish!&quot; before crashing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is right. That was the co-pilot apologizing for in correctly appying the flaps on take-off after Pete, the captain, had conceded and let him handle the flaps his way. They had been having a good natured discussion about the best way to handle them, both men being firm in their positions and the captain decided to give in this time. </p>
<p>The aircraft lost all hands and was destroyed so utterly that you can still find pieces of it in the field it crashed in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea how this has been gilded (Three times now, wow, jk FOUR TIMES, SIX, FUCKING, TIMES), it's completely inaccurate.</p>
<ol>
<li>Planes are constantly immersed and bombarded with radio signals all the time.  And yes, cell phones work using radio signals, so the distinction between this point and the radio interference point is moot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not just cell phone radio signals either, general FM radio stations, EMT, fire and Police bands, amateur radio operators, TV signals, marine craft, and all cell phones of people on the ground. This is a fraction of all the signals propagating through the air at any given moment.  And the planes work fine. </p>
<p>There is not a single case in recorded history of a plane going down because of cell phone interference.  They swim in it all day, every day, as well as a myriad of other signals.  These things are designed NOT to interfere, and are appropriated to different radio frequency bandwidths by the FCC, they do not talk, they cannot talk.</p>
<p>Pilots have never, and will never hear &quot;cell phone clicks&quot; in the headsets.  They operate on completely different frequencies, using completely different systems.  You couldn't hop on their radio even if you wanted to.</p>
<p>Trying to portray how hard it is to land a plane doesn't mean anything in the context of whether or not cell phones interfere with aeronautical equipment. </p>
<p>None of this is true, it's by and large layman speculation, please stop upvoting this. </p>
<p>The FAA just says to do that for liability's sake.  It's like trying to talk to your friend who's IMing you, and you're on a landline phone trying to IM back, it's never going to happen.  </p>
<p>On top of that, it's also not even the FAA that cares about cell phones, it's the FCC...so anyone who mentions FAA you can dismiss as having no clue what's going on...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I was sceptical since another comment on reddit said that no interference has ever been detected, but they do it just as an extra safety measure. </p>
<p>I'm thinking even if there's a 1 in a million chance of crashing because someone had their cellphone on, they would have more serious measures of verifying if everyone's cell phone is off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Radio spectrum is regulated so a phone signal will never interfere. However, it is possible to 'hop on' with illegal broadcasts (usually pirate radio stations) at the right frequency. I haven't heard of planes actually crashing, but City Airport in London has come close to temporary closure because of pirate radios causing interference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure! But an amateur/pirate radio broadcaster on a transceiver and who knows what else, is a substantially different situation than someone with a cell phone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The requirement to turn off cell phones, portable computers and other electronic devices on takeoff and landing of a commercial aircraft that OP is asking about is driven by an FAA regulation, specifically Part 135 (which governs commercial flights), part 144. <a href="http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=57263405e2636ba074064c103126063e&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se14.3.135_1144&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">Portable electronic devices.</a></p>
<p>tl;dr: No-one can operate an electronic device unless the commercial operator of the aircraft has determined the device won't interfere with navigation or communications. (Exceptions are made for portable voice recorders, hearing aids, heart pacemakers, electric shavers and certain portable oxygen concentrators.)</p>
<p>I mean, I'm only a private pilot operating under Part 91, and I still remember my Part 135 stuff.</p></div>		</li>
