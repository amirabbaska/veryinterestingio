			<div class="markdown"><p>Are some men deficient in prolactin? And can this cause other problems?</p>
<p>I ask because I have never had a refractory period and, when I was younger, could achieve up to 7 orgasms without breaking stride (now I simply get too tired after 3). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No negative side effect that I know of.  I read a study that compared a &quot;normal&quot; group of males' blood levels to one guy without a prolactin spike after orgasm. </p>
<p>It's thought I that in the &quot;caveman days,&quot; prolactin was actually a sort of survival mechanism. To keep it short,  it kept males' mind off continuous sex,  and they could then focus their attention on hunting/gathering again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought the benefit of the refractorary period was that in if the male was to continue having sex once orgasm he might pull the sperm out of the woman and reproduction would not occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense that the refractory period was evolved by rewarding individuals who were inherently polygamous as well. This period encouraged individuals to move on after sex, thus allowing said individual to find another cavewoman to snoo. In doing so, he spread his sperm across many individuals, ensuring a much greater chance of reproduction  than if he were to just keep orgasming and blow his entire load into only the 1 woman. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn dude, I'd love to be in your shoes. I'm 22 yrs old and need to get tested for low T-levels (or high prolactin, for that matter) sometime because for the last 2-3 years, I've been jerking off once a week only, usually once every 2 wks. Literally cannot fathom wanking my dude multiple times a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me for about 5 or 6 months last year, and I'm positive that it was a result of the drugs I was taking. I had the sex drive of a shoe. It was miserable. Hope you get it fixed man.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get it checked but unless you rule out: diet, sleep and exercise as the reason youre low i would stay away from trt. 90% of guys would disagree but thats because they rack the disciprine and just want steroids. Sign up for a gym and do compound lifts like squats. It'll get your shit going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless your testicles have an issue with producing testosterone, then simple hormone/test boosting activities should do wonders for you. </p>
<p>Exercise: Lift bro. Particularly squat as it releases a large amount of test and gets your balls back to producing more.</p>
<p>Sex: If you don't have a partner, you need to beat it more often. Seriously. Once a week or once every 2 weeks is wayyy to low. Beat it like it owes you money; at least once every day. Get some candles and treat yourself lol. This will boost your testosterone levels. I always felt that real sex works better though; maybe it's a placebo effect, maybe it's cause rough sex is awesome, but that's my opinion.</p>
<p>You need to eat healthy. Try and replace as much fast food as you can with cooked, lean (non-fatty), protein-rich, and vegetable filled meals. </p>
<p>As a 22 male, if you're a normal individual (your balls function normally,) you shouldn't be experiencing a drop in testosterone levels significant enough to require synthetic testosterone (steroids and what they treat low-T with.) The natural decline in testosterone as a man ages, which all males experience, shouldn't occur until ~25 years of age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you happen to know if it has other side effects in men? <del>Like, I've heard of some men lactating (maybe not the same stuff from women, but discharging at least...)        Could it also cause that, Or</del> What is the downside for men to take it?  I mean, that seems like a handy sex aid. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It reduces prolactin through mechanisms involving dopamine. Cabergoline belongs to a group of drugs called dopamine agonists. Side effects do NOT include lactation (opposite actually as super high prolactin can cause lactation in men), but do include compulsive behavior including reckless gambling. Cabergoline also affects the heart valves in a negative way in high doses.  This is absolutely not a drug to take for shits and giggles to try to improve sex.  Dopamine agonists can change your personality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just once, it'd be nice to see a drug commercial as positive as this comment. Side affects do NOT include: lactation, severe nausea, loss of sensation in the scrotal region. If you experience vivid hallucinations, it is unrelated and you should probably just enjoy it while it lasts.</p></div>		</li>
