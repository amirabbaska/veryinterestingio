<ul>
<li>your keyboard is probably being logged</li>
<li>what's on your screen is probably being recorded</li>
<li>your microphone is almost certainly recording</li>
<li>your files are probably being uploaded to some leet server </li>
</ul>
<p>I mean, most they're probably likely to see is your ugly mug and the window behind you. </p>
<p>Seems to me like the camera should only really be a concern for celebrities who don't want their tits on the internet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember when the kinect came out and I had to swap my old Xbox out for the new one because of a manufacturer issue (surprise). My dad was concerned about the webcam recording you all the time and listening to you he said Obama would be able to watch me or anyone in the room. I didn't use the Kinect, but I had to think, why would Obama want to watch me binge Netflix in my underpants?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much a response to anyone who's saying &quot;oh my god but like the government is spying on me, listening in on all my calls&quot;... But why would they want to? They are looking for terrorists... Not that you slept with Brian and now Dave is pissed! </p>
<p>The only good argument I've heard is that the step the government takes to listening to anyone's calls, putting cameras on every street etc, is one step closer to having a totalitarian society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The whole &quot;I've got nothing to hide, why should I care&quot; attitude is pretty dangerous. Even if you are just binge-watching Netflix and not doing anything insidious, would you be comfortable with knowing that you <em>could</em> be observed at any time? With having no guaranteed privacy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to be pretty stupid to install a rat from some script kiddie. Regardless of your status I think covering your webcam for your own privacy is a good habit.</p>
<p>And if it's not a script kiddie I think Snowden's leaks about programs like optic nerve should be enough of a scare. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Best solution if you really are worried about it is to get a desktop. No mic or camera unless you plug one in. Id imagine what you do on the computer is more sensitive than whatever your webcam can see anyway. I dont hold my credit card in view of the camera. Worst case would be they catch something embarrassing to blackmail with. I think more people have illegal movies or programs on their pc than do illegal things in front of their webcam. That combined with the financials makes the non mic/cam functions of the pc more worrisome imo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always tell people this.  My friend asked why I don't cover my Kinect when I'm not using it.  So I asked him &quot;what would anyone gain by taking the time and effort to hack my Kinect just to either watch me stare blankly at the TV while playing video games or seeing the empty room when I'm not playing?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinect doesn't just watch. It listens. It can know what music you listen, what TV you're watching, etc, just from hearing it. Also, I doubt the room is truly empty. They can learn your tastes in furniture, learn how you decorate. Anything that passes in front of that camera. Shopping bags from Wal-mart or packages from Amazon, Red Bull cans on the coffee table next to the Taco Bell bag.</p>
<p>And you won't even notice when the Taco Bell ads and that show you watch pop up on Xbox Live.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol at people thinking someone is going to hack your Kinect for advertising when simply following your internet browsing history will do a much better job and is much simpler/legal.  This is next level paranoia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>[Spoiler Alert for those that haven't watched the webcam episode in season 3]</p>
<p>A teenager gets filmed while he masturbates, threatened to be exposed unless he does certain tasks. Then the story reveals lots of other guys are threatened, also older guys, it goes as far as making two of them rob a small bank. </p>
<p>So my comment suggested you CAN make money out of spying the webcam. I was just being funny, as it's just a movie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an episode about blackmail initiated by malware that collected webcam video.  It's great TV and I'd recommend avoiding spoilers if possible.</p>
<p>It's a bit of extrapolation from the usual extortion that does happen, but it drives the point home</p></div>		</li>
