			<div class="markdown"><p>Crystal structure and alloy has a lot to do with hardness, ductility, and a number of other parameters. Example: annealed 1000 series aluminum is dead soft, and really sucks to machine. Add some alloy elements and heat treat it, and you get 7075, which is quite hard. Same thing with iron alloys. Depending upon the alloy elements and heat treat, you can get anything from soft mild steel to support hard high speed tool steel to any numbers of stainless steel to self sharpening maraging steel. </p></div>		</li>
