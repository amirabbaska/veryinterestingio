<p>When pure ethanol encounters water it very quickly attempts to return to the azeotrope phase.</p>

<p>That's not how it works, this is a common misconception.
Ethanol does not naturally 'seek' out its azeotrope when mixed with water. You can add as much water as you like to ethanol and get any combination you want, because ethanol is miscible in water.</p>
<p>An azeotrope is <strong>not</strong> some type of super stable mixture of ethanol and water. You can easily cross an azeotrope using a different form of mass transfer (molecular sieves, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervaporation" target="_blank">pervaporation</a>, etc), or by adding a third component (typically benzene).</p>
<p>Go ahead and take a look at this azeotrope off wikipedia. Its not ethanol and water, but its close enough:</p>

<p>The azeotrope is a point you can't distill past, because the vapor pressure of each component is the same at a given set of conditions (That's another way of saying they have the same boiling point). Once you're across the azeotrope, you can continue to purify the mixture through distillation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct that there's nothing magic about the azeotrope unless you're boiling at atmospheric pressure - but the description this guy gave stands and is a wonderful illustration of <em>feeling</em> the mixing of a 100% water-miscible compound with water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add Benzene, and make it a 3 component distillation.</p>
<p>You could cross the azeotrope by adding a small amount of higher purity ethanol.</p>
<p>You could change the pressure<del>/temperature.</del> (Thank you /u/TheLemoning)</p>
<p>You could use membrane distillation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pervaporation" target="_blank">pervaporation</a>.</p>
<p>You could use a molecular sieve.</p>
<p>As a few people pointed out, you could add something reactive with water to convert it to something else.</p>
<p>You've got a lot of options to get past the azerotrope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;going past the azeotrope.&quot; It doesn't matter what your liquid mixture is, the first cuts will be the azeotropic ratios. If the liquid mixture is close to the azeotrope, the BP will remain mostly consistent through all the cuts, and the distillate will be the azeotropic mixture. If the liquid mixture is way off in proportions,  one component will be used up faster. Then the vapor temp will start rising as the cuts become more of the abundant second component.</p>
<p>This would mean that you can get 100% ethanol only if you start with a mixture higher than 95.6%. For example if you start with 98%, you might get a 100% ethanol cut in the last cut. It wouldn't be practical either because it would be a tiny cut and you'd lose a bunch with the bottoms.</p>
<p>You need another process to break an azeotrope in a practical way. Sometimes you only need to add another component. With halogenated solvents, it can be as simple as adding salt. Not sure if that would work with ethanol.<br />
(EDIT: This last statement was in originally, but it's wrong:) Molecular sieves work too, but I don't think they're really used in scaled up manufacturing, they add a lot to the cost especially for ethanol since you're talking about 60Â¢/lb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, why not? In honesty, our ability to auto-regenerate and the fact that every second that alcohol is in our body is a second where it is becoming more dilute makes the in vitro/in vivo comparison a bit hard to quantify.</p></div>		</li>
