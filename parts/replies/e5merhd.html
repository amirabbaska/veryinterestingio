<p>I know right!!  How amazing is that to have something that was alive &quot;preserved&quot; for millions.. MILLIONS.. I SAID MILLIONS, of years, for us.  Had that not happened, or had we never found it..  I mean it's all just amazing.  How many other things like this were destroyed before we really understood??</p></div>		</li>
