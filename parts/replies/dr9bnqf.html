			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that has to be pointed out is the ISP's are not dumb and know what their customers views are.  They may or may not care from a raw business standpoint in markets where there is no real consumer choice, but that doesn't mean that they are going to take a major PR hit or anything.  They can play the long game and so changes are not going to happen until people accept it (they will - people's attention to move on to the next horrible thing the government or society brings us)</p>
<p>When customers forget and move on, thats when changes happen - and they will happen slowly and gradually.  </p>
<p>Even people's calls for Congressional action will be a waiting game.  I am willing to bet that Congress will rabble about it until their voters become complacent until the next things gets their attention and they will move on.  Various presidents have tried getting Congress to do something for years and they have not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. The rule change has to go through the White House Office of Management and Budget and then get published in the Federal Register (that's when opponents can file lawsuits). There's usually a delay period after publication before the rule change will take effect. </p>
<p>It'll probably be a few months before the rules are officially repealed. </p></div>		</li>
