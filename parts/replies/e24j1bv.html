			<div class="markdown"><p>Watch videos of the Japanese tsunami - it's very similar to this. But yes, there are different types and it depends on several things. Earthquakes can cause different tsunamis than landslides/meteor strikes, usually leading to a fast surge. Also, the coast has an impact too - if it is steep and narrow (like a bay), the tsunami will probably be more like what you're thinking of.</p></div>		</li>

The one in Japan was a rare kind. It was bubbling up as it overtook the areas in the videos. I don’t remember very well but I think that was because of the shape of the continental shelf leading up to the coast.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Here you can kind of see the &quot;wall of water&quot; effect. A tsunami is basically a surge, but remember most videos are taking from a higher vantage point. From the ground, the front of the surge may be 10 feet high or more, and may look like a &quot;wall&quot; to a person on the ground.</p></div>		</li>
