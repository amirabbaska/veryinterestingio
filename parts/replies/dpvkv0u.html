			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes spiders have evolved very cleverly into thousands of species with strategies for catching different kinds of prey. For example the aerial ladder-webs of Scoloderus are an adaptation for catching moths. Moths have a layer of scales that easily detatch, allowing them to just fly away from regular webs. But once it's lost scales, it's vulnerable. So the moth tumbles down the ladder, and gets caught.</p>
<p>Another strategy is used by the Bolas spider, who basically goes fishing, with a sticky blob on a line, to catch the moth in one go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine at some point its a matter of physics.  Spider web glue is just acting as an adhesive, and its very effective... but it won't work on something that is relatively immune to adhesives.   For instance, the bug that sheds its scales just won't get stuck because no matter how strong the adhesive is, it can't magically transport between the bug and its scales..</p>
<p>There are other constraints as well, like how the spider needs to be able to move around on the web as well. It can't truly be a inescapable net.  Anything the spider can do, other bugs can technically evolve to do.  </p>
<p>So, evolution isn't going result in an infinite arms race of measures and counter measures within a single scope.  At some point you'll reach diminishing returns or physical limitations. More likely, you'll just have changes in direction of the arms race (e.g. bugs that avoid detect and avoid webs, flying spiders, bugs that eat spiders, etc).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never mind that there is room in the ecosystem for spiders, their hunters, and their prey to coexist.  Natural selection is more than an arms race.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If spiders are successful despite some insects being able to escape their webs (which they are), then there is no evolutionary pressure to evolve further. However, this doesn't mean that a new random mutation couldn't occur at some point which would allow this newly mutated spider to capture the previously un-capturable insects.</p>
<p>The point is it's all random. But most spiders are doing just fine at the moment, so it's not all that sad :-)</p></div>		</li>
