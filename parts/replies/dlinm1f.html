			<div class="markdown"><p>Optics engineer here. Violet is a real color. It occupies 380-450 nm and the human eye is sensitive to it. Red is harmonic with it. Red and blue do not produce violet in the eye the way they produce purple. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen this fight about 3 times on Reddit now. People will come to tell you that purple doesn't exist, that it's an illusion. Their proof will be that there are no purple lasers. They will not understand how much power it takes to generate light around 400 nm. They will insist, even when someone comes in to tell them they've seen a purple laser in the lab, that such a thing can't exist. The average person will seem incapable of understanding that there's a difference between light phenomena and color phenomena. The parent comment of yours, despite being wrong, is the coolest sounding, so it will be the top comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an optics physicist. My thesis was on UV lasers and reactive mesogens. Purple is not the same as violet. You <em>can</em> have a violet laser. That's not the same as a purple laser. </p>
<p>Edit. Sorry I realized which post you're referring to. Interesting observation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this has more to due with differing definitions of &quot;purple&quot; vs &quot;violet&quot;. Common American English tends to use purple as the overarching color. Violet and Magenta etc., are often treated as shades of purple, like crimson and scarlet are shades of red. Others may be more technical, and reserve purple only for those colors that are a combination of red and blue light, with violet being an entirely seperate color. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow optical engineer here, can confirm the low 400's definitely look purple.  I think they are thinking of Magenta which isn't a monochromatic color.</p>
<p>Also did you go to UofA?</p></div>		</li>

When the green and uv are stimulated, biologists believe that their brains do the same thing, and nicknamed the perceived color as bee-purple.</p></div>		</li>
