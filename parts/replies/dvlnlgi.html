			<div class="markdown"><p>You do it when the parts being grafted are young, so the ratio of 'phloem and Cambrian' tissue is high relative to the 'xylem'. I did see a thing about a large tree in japan they cut down and into chunks. Then used metal frame pieces stuck inside the dead internal part to support the weight, and put it back together again. It was a pretty pro move, I wouldn't recommend trying it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a deer tear a young apple tree in half a number of years ago. We took the top, duct taped it to the base and waited. It survived but it's stunted compared to the other trees, probably had to put too much energy into repairing itself. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Seems like it's a little bit of luck and skill. Proper wax sealing and patience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For people seeking more information, the terminology he and /u/supremely_uneducated mean when they say 'phloem and Cambrian' is phloem and cambium. </p>
<p>Cambium is tissue that gives rise to cells that ultimately make up the xylem and phloem, which is the pathway plants use to transport water and minerals where they need to be in a plant. </p>
<p>Cambrian is a period in geologic time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, that confused me. I wondered how trees had such <em>old</em> tissue in them! </p></div>		</li>

In which case, trying to re-graft the tree would be a moot point. You'd be better off asking a geologist.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Does cambium produce xylem and phloem directly or does it stimulate other cells to do so? ('give rise to' is not very clear.)</p>
<p>Is only phloem a pathway that plants use to transport water and minerals or xylem and phloem? If they both do it what's the difference between the two? If only phloem does, what is xylem? </p>
<p>Where exactly are these tissues located in a tree?</p>
<p>Your explanation gave rise to more questions than it answered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this true of all species? For instance, some redwoods can consume water directly through their leaves instead of using only their root system. Would this still be insufficient as a sole water supply?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coastal redwoods need something like 100 to 150 gallons of water per day to replace the water they lose daily thru transpiration. They weigh something like 3 million pounds and half that weight is water.
Because they live in a foggy coastal environment they get about 40% of that 100-150 gallons per day back via their canopy roots up among the leaves and from water that collects in depressions in their large branches. </p>
<p>Sequoias need a little less water per day but they get all of this thru their roots. Despite growing in hotter, drier inland areas they grow close enough to streams and rivers so that the water table below them is constantly replenished. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be sufficient, but your talking greenhouse (&gt;95% humidity) and nearly constant misting. For a large tree it's not really going to work (foilage increases the water demand), it could possibly keep it alive long enough for a graft to succeed tho.</p>
<p>On the other side, you must gradually acclimate plants from a greenhouse to outdoor conditions or they dry out and die very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many species have been found to do foliar uptake. Redwoods were just the first it was published about. But yes, foliar water uptake alone even if it was in an environment with frequent fog cannot support a tree for long. It's really just a supplement during the dry season, which also happens to be the foggy season.</p></div>		</li>
