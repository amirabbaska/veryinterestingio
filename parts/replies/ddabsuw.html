			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a very well written response. Thank you. Let's say the broker was paid commission that correlated to the growth of the investment. Wouldn't that solve a lot of problems?  Then they would have incentive to get a larger return for the customer. I suppose this could lead to riskier investments?</p></div>		</li>

<ul>
<li>A 25 year old wants a portfolio that targets high growth.  </li>
<li>A 60 year old wants a portfolio that has low risk.  </li>
</ul>
<p>For me, my retirement portfolio lost about 1/2 it's value during the last crash and stayed down for years.  That was fine, I won't need that money for a few more decades.  And, it's now recovered and is making money again.  However, if I was retired, I would have needed that money to live on.  I couldn't afford for it to lose 1/2 it's value.    </p>
<p>So, a good broker will move a person from high growth (high risk) investments when they are young, to low growth (low risk) as they get older.  If you tie their payment to returns, they now have intensive to keep older people's money in riskier investments than they should be in.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To provide the counter-point by people in favor of regulation, the IRA system is more or less a loophole around the protections of ERISA because IRAs are a tax thing and not a pension thing. (There are a lot of annoying places where this happens, like the fact that tax law recognizes multiple employer plans, but pension law only recognizes multi-employer plans which are a different, mutually exclusive concept).</p>
<p>Basically if you have money in a 401k or other retirement account, the person running the plan has a duty under federal law to make prudent investments for you and that duty is enforceable by the participant and the Department of Labor. However, before this regulation, there was no duty to stop people from doing stupid things when they withdraw their money from the plan (for good reason; if a retiree wants to spend their 401k assets on a cadillac instead of a camry, why should we tell them otherwise). The problem is that the IRA system works by having people withdraw all of their money from the plan and put it all into an IRA, not spending it on a cadillac, but just moving it from one investment to another.</p>
<p>The problem is that these second investments, before the regulation, had no law requiring them to be prudent. In many cases all that happened was that you took your money out of a 401k plan run by your employer with very low fees (you get economies of scale if you group your investments with other employees) and moved it into an <em>identical</em> investment, except now without the economies of scale, so you paid more. In the worst case scenario you were paying <em>more fees</em> for <em>worse investments</em>, all because the person who told you to move to the IRA got a bonus based exclusively on his ability to charge you more than is reasonable. </p>
<p>So when people claim that the fiduciary rule might force people to not use IRAs at all because no company will be willing to manage an IRA fund under such stringent regulation, one response is &quot;Good, that was the plan in the first place. Keep the money where we [the DoL] can see it.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pensions that are underfunded are usually, but not exclusively, those that are exempted from DoL regulation. State pensions, obviously excluded for federalism reasons, and Church Plans (which, at least until the end of this Supreme Court term, includes massive hospitals with tens of thousands of employees who just so happen to have a vaguely religious name and at least one priest on their board of directors). There's a lot of very draconian procedures for properly funding a DoL regulated pension plan because if it's underfunded the government is on the hook for a portion of the missing cash (through a public insurance company called the PBGC). Even then, the DoL doesn't actually manage money, it just tells people what they <em>can't</em> do; so your criticism is essentially to say &quot;if the DoL isn't stopping every single manager from making bad investments, then they might as well stop none of them.&quot;</p>
<p>Even forgetting that, your question shows a misunderstanding of the difference between a defined-benefit pension plan and a defined contribution plan (most commonly a 401k). You can't take your DB pension fund (underfunded or otherwise) and convert it to an IRA, you can only do so with a DC plan. Moreover there's no problem with funding of DC plans because, by definition (barring actual straight-up theft of the assets) they're always 100% funded. </p>
<p>The DoL regulations, admittedly, haven't been <em>spectacular</em> with regard to DC plans (under Bush they straight up didn't care, almost aggressively so, Obama tried to makes strides including through the fiduciary rule regulations). But really it's better than a wild west where a poor retiree is being pressured by a suave salesman into a variable annuity when he knows what neither &quot;variable&quot; nor &quot;annuity&quot; means and the only advantage that investment has over pretty much any other choice under the sun is that it gives the person selling it a massive commission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: the DOL didn't just say &quot;ok folks from now on all financial advisors must act in their client's best interest&quot; and say that's the new rule. They said &quot;we have a few hundred pages of new things the financial industry has to do or else we might fine you and your clients might sue you, get ready by April 10, 2017&quot;. </p>
<p>ELI an adult:</p>
<p>The Obama administration and the DOL rule used the straw man fallacy to promote this rule change and in doing so glossed over real policy debates. </p>
<p>From google:</p>
<p><em>A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not advanced by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be &quot;attacking a straw man&quot;.</em></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>If you say the rule ensures that <em>all advisors must act only in the customer's best interest</em>, then you are implying that anyone who opposes the rule is obviously trying to allow advisors to act in ways that are NOT in the customer's best interest. </p>
<p>So among many things, here are some of the debatable policy issues:</p>
<p>1) whether or not the additional cost of complying with the new regulatory framework will be passed along to the customer. If this cost is larger than the cost of customers being in suitable but expensive investments then the rule is a net LOSS to the public</p>
<p>2) what is the definition of best interest? </p>
<p>3) who should be responsible for looking out for your money? At what point is it your own responsibility to understand costs and benefits and fire your investor if you can get better or cheaper service elsewhere?</p>
<p>4) does the department of labor even have the authority to issue new rules like this? (This is more of a separation of powers and rule of law issue)</p>
<p>5) if a company wants to create a proprietary product, such as an annuity or insurance policy, should their be a cap on what they can pay their sales force to market it?</p></div>		</li>
