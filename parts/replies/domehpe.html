			<div class="markdown"><p>The eyes stay in whatever position they are when the person dies.  If the person dies with open eyes, the eyes stay open.</p>
<p>If rigor mortis has set in, the muscles will all be stiff and it would be difficult to manually close the eyes.  If someone closes the eyes on a body either before rigor mortis sets in, or after decomposition has started to relax the muscles again, then the closing would be easy like in the movies.  cc /u/CritterTeacher</p></div>		</li>

<p>In any case, the muscle in question performs both functions.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>In conventional propositional logic, this would entail that the claim &quot;You use a muscle to X or Y&quot; is false. I say &quot;conventional&quot; because you can specify that you allow inclusive disjunctions, where both X and Y being true means that &quot;X or Y&quot; is true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of a disjunction (X or Y), only one of the terms (disjuncts) needs to be true in order for the entire disjunction to be true. </p>
<p>So, the entire statement &quot;It will be cloudy or partly-cloudy&quot; is true if, for example, the claim &quot;it is cloudy&quot; is true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is not the case here. If it would be &quot;Do you use muscles to (open or close your eyes)&quot;, then the question wouldn't have much sense left in it. What else would you use? I'm also a SW developer, but in some cases you need to understand the context and semantics, not just the syntax.</p></div>		</li>
