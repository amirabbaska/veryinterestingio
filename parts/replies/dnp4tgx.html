This makes it easy to monitor the state of charge in a low power application like in a phone, by just measuring the voltage. Electric cars and other high power applications need Watthour totalisation counters and temperature sensors to keep the battery safe, so a more precise estimate of capacity can be calculated in such a system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're both right, but compared to NiCad which goes from 1.2V to 1V and lead acid that goes from 2.2V to 1.9 per cell, both of which have horizontal discharge curves in the middle, Li-ions are noticeable more sloped so voltage measurement gives useful information of state of charge. But as you said, trickery like load averaging and temperature compensation in the battery meter helps monitoring Li-Ion batteries even more precisely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's steep only in the very beginning and end of the curve; the middle plateaus into a very shallow slope. If the internal resistance of the battery causes a voltage drop of about 100 mV per cell or so you might get thrown from one end of the plateau to the other under load, so that your &quot;fuel gauge&quot; jumps suddenly from e.g. 80% to 20%, and back up again as the load decreases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, as the graph shows, the voltage curve is pretty flat over the usable range of the battery.  That's why measuring voltage does not work to estimate remaining life for a LiIon battery.  It takes more complex techniques, such as putting a test load on the battery temporarily, to measure remaining life.</p>
<p>You may be thinking of NiCad batteries - for a NiCad, voltage is a good indicator of remaining charge.</p></div>		</li>
