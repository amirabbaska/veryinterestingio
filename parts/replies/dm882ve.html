<p>The light bulb is basically a filament of wire inside of a closed gas bubble. The microwave is generating a varying magnetic field that induces a current into the wire inside of the light bulb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind? We microwaved incandescents, fluorescents, neons, halogens, some brillo pads, a circuit breaker, a screwdriver, some eggs...</p>
<p>OK, some of those weren't light bulbs. All the light bulbs did light up, for a short time. The halogen was a good one, the brillo pad was awesome. The eggs blew up.</p>
<p>We got bored and were throwing out a microwave. We weren't able to kill the microwave, but we melted the door.</p>
<p>We did stand behind a makeshift barrier as we were conducting these experiments.</p></div>		</li>
