<p>There are a few issues that can cause that.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many meth users that get really bad don't practice good hygiene and that can cause skin and teeth issues due to neglect. On top of that, meth's stimulant qualities can cause excess sweating and oil production, and the skin issues that come with oily skin and poor hygiene. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many meth users will not eat. Amphetamines in general act as an appetite suppressant, so if they are high all the time, they likely aren't eating much. That causes loss of fat in the face, and the drooping skin you see. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the side effects of meth is formication: the feeling that bugs are crawling on or under your skin. Users that experience that end up scratching at their skin on their arms and face (and other places that are less noticeable).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meth can slow the blood flow to the skin, which means it doesn't heal as quickly. Lots of acne from #1 and lots of skin picking from #3 result in long-lasting, hard to heal sores on the body. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Meth reduces the amount of saliva in the mouth (cotton mouth). That's a HUGE issue. Saliva is critical for oral health, dilutes and washes away acid produced by oral bacteria/soda/food. Without saliva, they have the perfect breeding ground for cavities. Without good oral hygiene and extra cavities, they end up with black holes for teeth. Depending on the person, this can happen within a year of use.</p>
</li>
<li>High people fall. I have unfortunately been around enough addicts in my life, I can say with certainty that people on drugs fall. They lose balance, etc... and end up with wounds in places most people wouldn't. I've seen terrible arm/leg scrapes, face banged up, etc... like they were drug by a motorcycle after falling down steps. That leads to more skin issues, breaking off teeth that were half rotted, etc...</li>
</ol>
<p>So... that's what causes faces of meth.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, forgot to say that ADHD meds are unlikely to cause those issues when taken as directed.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problems with falling while high is you have delayed or no reflexes, so you don’t lift up your arms to protect your face. That’s why there are nasty fall injuries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll just add that Sudafed is also very similar to meth. But it's got an additional alcohol group and so doesn't go into the brain. Sudafed's main effect is to dry your mouth and sinuses to help relieve your cold.</p>
<p>This is why meth has the same drying effect on your mouth, it's also working as a decongestant!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lesions are almost always the result of people picking at their skin. High or continuous doses of stimulants can cause psychosis and hallucinations, including believing that you have bugs or other things in/on your skin.</p>
<p>The gaunt facial features can be caused by poor diet or eating habits in general - people on stimulants don't eat very often. Additionally, many of the adulterants or byproducts found in street meth are essentially poisons, and consuming them habitually can lead to changes in physical appearance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they can. It's caused by psychosis, exacerbating by sleep deprivation. </p></div>		</li>
