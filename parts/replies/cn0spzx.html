			<p>First off you have no idea what you are talking about, the government is not fabricating data. There also isn't one inflation rate. Its calculated many different ways, all of which are in general agreement that it is currently below 2%. <br><br>Just think about it logically. Gas prices are really cheap right now. Our economy is based on the price of energy. Cheap energy makes everything cheap. Prices are not increasing at high rates if the price of fuel is so cheap.<br><br>Finally I realize there is no point in arguing with you. If you are in the camp believing that the government has the ability to fabricate inflation data without economists noticing then you are nuts. </p>		</li>

			<p>The CPI-U consistently over estimates inflation. This is the estimate the government uses for the cost of living adjustment for federal programs (the standard inflation rate). Most economists (actually every economist agrees) that it over inflates the inflation rate, which is more accurately measured by the GDP deflator. The government rate over adjusts. You, like the gentleman above you have no idea what you are talking about.<br><br>Edit: I hate dealing with you people. Source what you are saying. I will source everything I just wrote.</p>		</li>
