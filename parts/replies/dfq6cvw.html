			<div class="markdown"><p>Fruit and veggies with skins tend to do this. Take and onion or a cucumber slice and snap it so that just the skin is left keeping it together, then put it in the microwave and it will spark. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that source misses a big one: localized areas can heat up much more than the surrounding areas and popping can occur when the water in those localized areas boils. So, small areas are hot and pop, while the overall food might still be cold or have cold spots.</p></div>		</li>
