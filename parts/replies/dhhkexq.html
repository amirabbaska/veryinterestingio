<p>And... you're right. There are a lot of adaptive feedback mechanisms available to help mitigate these problems, but application is dependent on the inputs, and if you build a sloppy fixture or stamping sends you crappy parts, the robot is just going to go where it's programmed to go, and if it's off 1mm relative to the part, you get squeeze-out/expulsion, and possible corrosion issues.</p>
<p>On the other hand, human labor on mass production is incredibly expensive, and so if you have 1 TGW per 10,000 in mass production, warranty eats that and it's perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p>If the parts are perfect, and the locator strategy is perfect, a robot will win 100% of the time. Except, nothing is ever perfect, and humans have better feedback mechanisms. It comes down to what's important (money). I don't say that cynically, either. I'm happy to pay $40,000 for a Mustang versus $250,000 for a &quot;perfect&quot; Rolls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a robotics engineer, but I question whether such a thing could be cost effective in terms of the time required per unit, as well as in the much greater number and sensitivity of sensors required. And on the other end of the process, your average Toyota customer isn't checking the sealant seams in the trunk, so there's no payout in being able to charge more for the additional quality.</p>
<p>For the Rolls Royce, paying for a human to (quickly and easily) perform this task probably pays out in the additional profit you net from selling a luxury item. To automate it, you'd no longer be able to claim that step was hand-finished, potentially lowering the value on the Rolls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct. There are cameras that can mount on the robot where it can measure gaps by using shadows. It can take some of the variables out but it takes more cycle time. You'll see things like that on large volume runners. With a car like a Rolls, they don't have enough volume to do trial and error to fine tune things with robots. </p></div>		</li>
