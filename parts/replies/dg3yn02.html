<p>They took the last four passengers to book the flight and asked them to leave.</p>

<p>That's different from what's reported on news. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When no one volunteered, Bridges said, a gate agent told them the airline had used an algorithm to randomly select four people to get off the plane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming airline somehow does prefer random selection over &quot;the last X to book&quot; for removal, my <em>speculation</em> to the reasoning would be that &quot;the last X to book&quot; poses concentrated risk to those X buyers, that would often put them off from buying unless the price would also be lower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Involving the police to force the passenger was illegal and that is where the controversy comes. But according to FAA rules you are required to comply with the airline, they offered the passengers about $1000 worth of compliance for the airline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's funny and disturbing to think, sure they can ask them to leave all they like but asking and forcing are two different things. </p>
<p>From the articles I read, United needed to get these employees  to the destination, it was a 5 hour drive from their current location, and they had something like 20 hours before they had to be there.  Rent a limo, hell go rent a Bentley and drive them... instead they beat the crap out of the poor guy and  (I hope) it's going to cost them at least 8 figures in the settlement. </p>
<p>Edit for more fun:  Look at the CEO's statement following this incident, it proves exactly where their mindset is when it comes to customers who paid money and have a right to the seat.     From a strictly business standpoint if United <em>really</em> wanted those 4 seats for their employees they just start offering an ever increasing amount of cash. Obviously $800 wasn't enough to make anyone want to miss their flight.  You keep bumping the price up till someone cracks, and yes someone <em>will</em> crack.     Now instead of paying out maybe $5 or 10k to bump people who were rightfully there, they get to pay millions upon millions to this guy, and then a whole lot more in bad press, lost revenue, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe it was the last in first out, I think it was selected randomly from whoever paid the least. So First Class passengers would be in no danger of losing seats.</p></div>		</li>
