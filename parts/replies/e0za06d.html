			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend used to hate it but i ALWAYS need to hear some sort of audiobook/podcast to fall asleep fast. Scientific/history stuff works best :)</p>
<p>It's such a habit that no matter the circumstances i can plug in my earphones, listen to something and i am able to almost instantly nap away, no matter how tired i am. Usually i put on a sleep timer of like 30mins but i often drift away afyer like 5mins. Maybe there is some sort of conditioning going on, but i won't complain (it's not that i have the URGE to take a nap, i can also happily listen for hours. But shutting my head off and being able to focus on something else than the everyday bullshit enables me to relax that much). </p>
<p>Maybe you can try to form a habit like this and learn to fall asleep faster that way? Pretty sure it won't work for everybody but my gf is slowly adapting as well, haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can pass out anywhere anytime, even after long hours of sleep, it's almost like reverse superpower. I used to sleep on the weekend for 2.5 days straight, only waking up every 10-12 hours for 2-3 hours to eat/bath. When I was at college I had to drink triple espresso every 2-3 hours or I'd sleep in class. Now I take meds which works really well! But I wish I can sell these extra sleepiness - I'd be a billionaire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cue one of the greatest discoveries known to man: The caffeine nap.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Take a dosage of caffeine (your preference).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Immediately lay down for a nap.</p>
</li>
<li>Wake up 15-20 minutes later ready to wrestle a unicorn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: corrected “queue”  to “cue”, I don’t think the caffeine nap works if you’re standing in line</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True this, with 3 kids this is a soild tactic to survive the afternoon. Since the two big ones dont nap anymore i get super tierd. Chug a big mug of coffe/down a red bull. Put on Paw patrol or some random disney and set an alarm for 20ish minutes. </p>
<p>After that its time for unicorn wrestling on the trampoline. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to fall aspleep completely. Just closing your eyes and resting can make a big difference. I even set alarms at 10 minutes and repeat two times, to avoid falling too deep, because then I'll be very groggy.
Listening to some audiobook (Youtube) with a calming voice also helps a lot to give the brain a break. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your alarms are ruining your sleep, within 0-30 minutes you are getting light phase sleep and a bit of rem sleep (rem is key for a sharp mind), all your alarm is doing is preventing you from going into rem sleep properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A 20min nap isn't the same as actually sleeping, it's a rest period. When I take a power nap, I figure it takes about 10-15 minutes where i am dozing away and perhaps 5 minutes where I am completely relaxed and become unaware of my surrounding. It's more about shutting yourself off to distracitons and relaxing than actual sleep. Earplugs or anything else that removes external stimulations may help.</p></div>		</li>
