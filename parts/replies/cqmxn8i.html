			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any sort of chemical mechanism that can get exhausted? </p>
<p>I guess I'm thinking by analogy to neurons - isn't some component of muscle fatigue due to an over-use of the neuron, which results in depleted levels of potassium (or maybe accumulated potassium in the muscle? I can't be sure, I'm not a chemist or a biologist or really an anything-to-do-with-the-brain-ist).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There may be, but from what I understand it's muscular:</p>
<p>&quot;The center of each chromatophore contains an elastic sac full of pigment, rather like a tiny balloon, which may be colored black, brown, orange, red or yellow. If you squeezed a dye-filled balloon, the color would be pushed to the top, stretching out the surface and making the color appear brighter—and this is the same way chromatophores work. A complex array of nerves and muscles controls whether the sac is expanded or contracted and, when the sac expands, the color is more visible. Besides chromatophores, some cephalopods also have iridophores and leucophores. Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates that create iridescent greens, blues, silvers and golds, while leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, making the animal less conspicuous.&quot; (<a href="http://ocean.si.edu/ocean-news/how-octopuses-and-squids-change-color" target="_blank">src</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the pattern which is placed on their skin from their eyes seeing the pattern and reproducing that on their body, or is it a basic color receptor on the other side of the skin?</p>
<p>Also do they recreate exactly or do they create a pattern approximation (eg camp pants)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, &quot;these strange structures are composed of muscular hydrostats—similar to the octopus’s arms and to our tongues—which can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. As such, it can 'provide structural support while allowing fine, dynamic control of the skin’s three-dimensional texture.'&quot; (<a href="http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/2014/02/10/how-the-octopus-creates-instant-3-d-camouflage-on-its-skin/" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they use chromatophores.  The predominant chromatophore being melanophores, but dermal xanthophores, erythrophores, iridophores, and leucophores (all initially named based on their colour) are also present, allowing a wide variety of colour responses.</p></div>		</li>
