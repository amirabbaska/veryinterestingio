<p>Ftfy, I assume you didn't mean estimated time of arrival and instead wanted to make a public service announcement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, I don't know in this case.  What often happens is that heating drives the water out of the crystal, leaving you with the anhydrous version.  Blue copper sulfate pentahydrate crystals turn into a white powder when heated over a flame.  Adding water turns it blue again but, as the structure has been broken up by the loss of water, you don't get the nice big crystals back.</p>
<p>You would be able to repeat the experiment by redissolving the solid in more hot water and boiling off the added water but it would be difficult to repeat the exact concentrations given in the video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Too an extent. You can't redo it forever as the solution will get dirty and lose potency over time.</p>
