<p>Question: &quot;If every person on Earth aimed a laser pointer at the Moon at the same time, would it change color?&quot;</p>
<p>tl;dr: No, but the answer to what it would take to accomplish it (and more!) is much more entertaining.</p>
<p>If this sort of thing strikes your fancy, I also highly recommend the XKCD &quot;What If?&quot; book, which includes this question/answer, and the audiobook is read by Wil Wheaton.</p></div>		</li>
