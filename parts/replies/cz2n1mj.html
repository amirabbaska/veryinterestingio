<p>What if once the refineries are finished, the oil barrel is at $200? I guess they don't expect the oil barrel to stay that low forever... right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the the reason oil prices are so low right now is because of this investment happening in the U.S. and other places entering the market. The types of oil we are able to extract and refine is expanding with new technology. The new types are more expensive to extract and refine than the older fields and refineries, but it was still a profitable investment at old oil prices. At new oil prices, these new ventures that aren't even ready to operate yet and are still requiring lots of investment backing will be operating at a loss when they are completed. Meanwhile, the old guard is still making a small but significant profit at these low prices, and they are taking the hit in the short term in the hopes that they can hold out long enough for the new firms to fail; otherwise they face losing market share forever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't work that way.  To make a refinery profitable, you need to process a lot of crude oil.  You need to process so much crude that you really can't stockpile it on-hand because you don't have deep enough pockets to buy the crude oil, refine it, pay people to work at your refinery, store it, and not go bankrupt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it still be profitable even if they don't plan on buying more crude later on? would they just sell the refinery to someone else after the 5 years?</p>
<p>Are there people just buying crude and storing it without any plan to process it themselves?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, You can't just warehouse crude oil. It produces H2S, which will give you a bad case of dead if you get near it. The cost to store it would make it wildly uneconomic to do. It would be cheaper to leave it in the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in the Oil &amp; Gas industry and have a PhD in Structural Engineering. A refinery is typically designed for 25-40 years of operation. Whether it out-lives that period or not is up to lots of luck, and constant maintenance and revamping. However, the actual design life for refineries is typically shorter than that of--say--your average bridge, which is designed for a 50-year lifespan.</p></div>		</li>
