<ul>
<li>
<p>P-value means the probability of getting your result or a more extreme result by random chance <strong>if the effect you're studying is not there</strong> (if the null hypothesis is true). So mathematically P(result|no effect).</p>
</li>
<li>That <strong>is not</strong> the probability that the effect is not there given your result, which would be P(no effect|result). This is what we would really want to know but p-values don't answer that question.</li>
</ul>
<p>So p-values give answers to questions you would not even want to ask if you knew a better way to ask what you really want to know.</p></div>		</li>
