			<div class="markdown"><p>I was trained at The Second City by the great late Don Depollo. They teach that people laughed at two things â€“ shock, and or recognition. Great material elicits a combination of the two. Cheap shot material relies on overuse of swearing to go for the shock laugh. Next time something makes you laugh, think about this and figure out which it is. </p></div>		</li>
