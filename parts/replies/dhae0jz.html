<p>Not at all. Oceanic &amp; continental crust differ in their structure and mineralogy. </p>
<p>Oceanic crust is usually thin (say less than 10 km), and has a higher density than that of continental crust. It is relatively richer in Fe &amp; Mg-bearing minerals, and poorer in silica than Continental crust.</p>
<p>see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust" target="_blank">Continental crust</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_crust" target="_blank">Oceanic crust</a>.</p>
<p>There are several blocks of continental crust which are mostly, if not completely submerged. e.g.: the <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v248/n5445/abs/248202a0.html" target="_blank">Rockall-Faeroe plateau</a> and the recently announced  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealandia" target="_blank">Zealandia</a>.</p>

<p>well, you've already covered a few ... &quot;<em>water blown away by stellar winds? sucked down into the mantle by tectonic activity? Unevenly distributed up in deep trenches</em>&quot; ... I guess you should also add glaciation (just look at the wild fluctuations in terrestrial sea-level during the Pleistoc√®ne glaciations), seasonality (re: the annual migration of the Martian polar icecaps), and various chemical transformations including fixation in hydrated minerals and dissociation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mind if I ask you a question or two? I was wondering what exactly happens to the crust after a volcanic eruption. Is there just a void where all the lava and rocks were at or does other parts of the crust fall in and take its place? There can't be an endless flow of lava, can there?</p>
<p>Sorry if this isn't the place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something lacking from this discussion is that an ocean planet with a deep enough ocean actually starts to form high pressure ice at its base. So the planet moving out from the crust would be rock-&gt;ice-&gt;water. Now I don't know if that layer of ice would interfere with tectonics in the crust. Additionally I recall reading a journal article once about the possibility of tectonics in the ice layer. I don't really have time to write out a long post now, but if you see this and want to know more I can point you to some scientific journal articles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And when I think of eustatic sea level I don't think of solar wind or subduction (though apparently the latter has locked up quite a bit of water in the mantle). I think of ice formation and oceanic ridge spreading rates (younger crust is hotter and sits higher on the mantle). But we do have a lovely magnetic field that other planets don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, most of your analysis appears to be based on a rocky planet model (no real surprise there), but the question itself appears to be driving toward another question: Is there plate tectonics underneath Europa or Ganymede's oceans? How would the presence of high pressure ice VI, VII, VIII, IX, etc between the liquid water and the rocky mantle affect the propensity for plate tectonics, especially with the lighter metals contributions expected for the rocky core</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard to say how those higher pressure polymorphs play into the picture, and I will await with trepidation any probe which will bring info which might enlighten us in that regard.</p>
<p>For the time being, it appears risky to transpose plate tectonics to Jovian &amp; Saturnian moons. As far as I know, while some of these show clear signs of geologic activity [Io and <a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/45961119/Ongoing_hydrothermal_activities_within_E20160526-31948-1vnwbrr.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1494275061&amp;Signature=%2BaFz05rfL6U7iW%2ByaYww%2BFNvN%2BE%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DOngoing_hydrothermal_activities_within_E.pdf" target="_blank">Enceladus</a>, notably], this appears to be tidally-driven  which is completely different than the diffuse radiation-heat engine we witness here on Earth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The source of the heat is different but at the end of the day Earth's core is active and supposedly so are many of the moons' discussed here. So what would you expect to occur differently as a result of the tidal heating? Is it the stretching and pulling that you aren't sure how to account for?</p></div>		</li>

So about mars, why doesn't the &quot;water on mars&quot; question still exist if we can't see any subduction zones on the now dry surface?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water on Mars question is still very actual. There are several things we still don't know:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When, exactly, did liquid water on Mars become scarce,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where did it come from? Cometary impact, Mantle degassing or Other?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How was this water affected by seasonality and weather patterns?</p>
</li>
<li>How much water is bound in martian minerals?</li>

<p>and a host of other questions as well ... it is a quite active area of research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It seems that from the progression of the water question: from canals and seas; to dry planet stripped of water and atmos, from the loss of a electromagnetic field, that we are now really only trying to analyse whether or not trace amounts remain. Or what happened, Not whether there is some mystical hidden ocean of water.
Appears like Mars is really and truly a dead planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't answer your questions, but it's interesting and relevant. I'm a Geological Engineer and one of my professors was in charge of the USGS studies that evaluated aerial photos and surface data to determine the possibility and nature of fluid on Mars. I will share what she told us:
Mars has deltaic and submarine fans. &quot;Fans&quot; are large washes of debris coming off of a steep slope onto a flatter plane. They form when the stability of a slope face is compromised and can no longer support the soil and rock material on it. The material then collapses and runs down the side of the slope, spreading out to disperse its energy when it reaches a flatter surface. From above, the resulting debris looks like a fan. Fans often form in the same places and can occur on top of each other hundreds of times. There are several types.
A deltaic fan occurs at a river delta, where an active river meets the sea and pushes all of the sediment it has carried into the ocean. The sediment lands on the steep slope leading down to the ocean floor, and after enough build-up, the slope will fail to support the weight force of the sediment and will collapse. Sediment runs down the side of the slope, partially suspended in water. A fan will then form on the ocean floor. However, sediment will travel a longer distance if it is suspended in fluid, so deltaic fans are usually long and tongue-like. (Surface fans are short and fat.)
Aerial photos of Mars show areas with several deltaic fan deposits alongside and on top of each other. This indicates at one point there were rivers leading into a massive body of fluid on Mars. It also indicates that these fluid bodies were active for a long time, due to the number of deposits and the indication of a migrating river delta. However, sediment transport is not specific to water, i.e. we can't guarantee that the deltaic fans were created by water, we can only guarantee that they were created by a flowing liquid fluid. Geologists are fairly sure that Mars had rivers and oceans of some variety, we simply can't make the leap that they were formed by water. </p></div>		</li>
