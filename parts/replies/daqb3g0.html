			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites. This means they absolutely must hijack a host cell in order to reproduce. Microbes like bacteria and protozoa have a function to sustain life by eating and reproducing. They already contain metabolic pathways and ways to move. Viruses, on the other hand, do not have a goal except to biosynthesize their nucleic acid into the host they're attached to and create more of themselves. I personally see them as nonliving because they lack certain features and don't have a defined purpose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Something simply consuming and spreading isn't alive. Fire, for example, arguably fills those criteria, yet isn't alive etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No life has a&quot;defined purpose&quot;. The same physical laws that govern viruses also govern all other forms of life. I think it is more a question of how we define life. Viruses can easily &quot;survive&quot; outside of hosts in many cases. It's just that they require a host to transcribe and translate their genome. The only thing they are lacking, in my opinion, is any sort of metabolism for energy production. But why would they need it? They have found a niche that allows them to proliferate wildly without the need to uptake or metabolize anything</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really correct to place viruses between &quot;dead and alive&quot;. A better phrase would be between &quot;lifeless and alive&quot;. In order for something to be dead, it would have to have been alive at some point. Likewise, we don't call a rock &quot;dead&quot; but rather &quot;lifeless&quot; or &quot;non-living&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends on where you draw the line, and what criteria you draw the line with.</p>
<p>OP's comment is saying that &quot;The Line&quot; is constructed by humans and is not a property of the natural world. It IS still useful, it just has blurry edges because the natural world is very gradual as it changes from thing to thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the blurry mess for taxonomy of chlamydia, naked mole rats, platypuses - </p>
<p>Check out idiopathic familial insomnia or fatal familial insomnia. It's a prion fatal disease that is inherited. The aberrant protein is already present in your genes. </p>
<p>Check out the Alu sequence. Some viruses were so commonplace for years that our genetics simply &quot;absorbed&quot; them into our own code. They used the number of repeats for certain viruses present in a hosts DNA to try and track migration patterns. </p>
<p>Then you have the serious dilemma of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Have their own genetic material. Replicate. Generate energy and waste. Stuck inside another cell. So fancy schmancy organelle or trapped symbiotic critter?</p></div>		</li>
