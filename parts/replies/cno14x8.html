			<p>Could you explain how 10km is roughly twice the height of Everest? I believe its about 8.8km tall as measured above sea level.</p>		</li>

			<p>Considering the base of Everest is nowhere near the ocean I would assume a meaningful height measurement to be from base to peak.<br><br>While the base of a mountain is pretty subjective to define it is usually tied to the average elevation and grade of the surrounding area.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Topographical prominence is what you're reaching for I think yet it's still generally a poor expression of how gargantuan a mountain is.<br><br>It's particularly not useful when it comes to Everest because topographical prominence relies on parent peak which Everest by its nature does not have. Its full height = its prominence.<br><br>So the simplest thing when talking about tall mountains is just to take sea level although that means Everest's base is basically on the sea shores of India.</p>		</li>

			<p>What is short lived in this geological timeframe? Months, years, centuries? </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; The Giant Impact Hypothesis<br><br>The consensus is that the entire crust of the earth was turned into a sea of magma from the impact. Some of which was ejected into space and is what formed the moon. Earth was basically a ball of liquid. I'm not sure how mountains could form in such an environment. It was too hot for rock to exist in a solid state. In fact, the earth was probably the &quot;flattest&quot; it's ever been at that stage in its life.</p>		</li>
