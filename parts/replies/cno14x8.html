			<p>Could you explain how 10km is roughly twice the height of Everest? I believe its about 8.8km tall as measured above sea level.</p>		</li>

			<p>Considering the base of Everest is nowhere near the ocean I would assume a meaningful height measurement to be from base to peak.<br><br>While the base of a mountain is pretty subjective to define it is usually tied to the average elevation and grade of the surrounding area.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Topographical prominence is what you're reaching for I think yet it's still generally a poor expression of how gargantuan a mountain is.<br><br>It's particularly not useful when it comes to Everest because topographical prominence relies on parent peak which Everest by its nature does not have. Its full height = its prominence.<br><br>So the simplest thing when talking about tall mountains is just to take sea level although that means Everest's base is basically on the sea shores of India.</p>		</li>

			<p>What is short lived in this geological timeframe? Months, years, centuries? </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; The Giant Impact Hypothesis<br><br>The consensus is that the entire crust of the earth was turned into a sea of magma from the impact. Some of which was ejected into space and is what formed the moon. Earth was basically a ball of liquid. I'm not sure how mountains could form in such an environment. It was too hot for rock to exist in a solid state. In fact, the earth was probably the &quot;flattest&quot; it's ever been at that stage in its life.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually the giant impact would not have created these tall of mountains being powerful enough to make the surface of the Earth wholly molten.</p>		</li>

			<p>That touches on one of the unanswered questions about the Giant Impact Hypothesis. A direct impact would have transferred enough energy to completely liquefy the Earth, and yet we can't find any evidence of the planetary differentiation that should have occurred after that kind of event. This has been cited by many researchers as evidence that the impact did not occur, did not occur in the way we think it did, or that our models of planetary differentiation are wrong. While the math says that the planet should have liquefied, there's no evidence indicating that it did.<br><br>Either way, it's not relevant to the point being discussed. Even if we're not talking about the moon or Theia, the Earth was struck by massive impactors and other protoplanets after its Archaen crust formed, and there's little question that the Earth already had a crust when the Late Heavy Bombardment began. There's no reason to believe that the impacts of that period would have been incapable of generating peaks at the scale we're discussing, as shortlived as they might have been. <br><br>The cleaned up original question was, &quot;Is it possible that a mountain taller than Everest ever existed?&quot; If you look at the entire 4.5 billion year history of the Earth, the answer is almost certainly yes.</p>		</li>

			<p>Isn't there a theoretical mathematical constraint?<br><br>I remember seeing video showing there is relationship (mathematically) to the tallest hill of sand you can created by just pouring sand upon itself and Mt. Everest (i think)</p>		</li>

			<p>So does the large mountain on mars mean that Mars' crust is thicker or that the magma underneath as solidified? I do remember learning it was a volcano. </p>		</li>
