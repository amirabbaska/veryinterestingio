			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's an ELI5 answer: different drugs effect different receptors (and receptor subtypes) in different ways. Serotonin and dopamine are far from the only receptors that recreational drugs effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While technically true, the only reason different areas are affected at different levels is because different areas have different densities of different receptors. So the most telling aspect of a drug are the receptorsâ€‹ that it hits (along with it's affinity and efficacy at those receptors). When a chemical gets in your brain it doesn't stay in one region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought this as well one day and I think I reached a conclusion. I have no idea if it's correct, but it seems to make sense. Basically dopamine acts in our brains, so for it to have an effect there, it needs to be there. If we just took dopamine, it probably wouldn't go to our brain and would be destroyed by our bodies. Instead, we take things that, as a result of being &quot;destroyed&quot; in this way, release dopamine. </p>
<p>Is- is this correct? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so heres the deal. In order for something to pass through the blood brain barrier, it needs to be small and non polar. If you look at the structure of dopamine, and then the structure of amphetamine, you will notice they are very similar, but dopamine has a bunch of extra branches I guess that don't let it through. I'm more then happy to talk about the chemistry, but its not ELI5 friendly, though its not hard to understand.</p>
<p>Amphetamine passes through the BBB fairly easily, which means that you are getting a ton of dopamine because they act basically the same in the right place in the brain. </p>
<p>Taking just dopamine, like the drug called L-dopa, which treats Parkinson's,  is basically filling your body with dopamine, and has a lot of side effects. The way they get around this, and make taking straight dopamine actully useful, and effective in the brain is by taking another drug with it that prevents it from being broken down by a special metabolite, and allows it to have some special reactions that make it useful.</p>
<p>Its all very cool, and if you are following what im saying simply googling the process I described bit by but will fill you in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watch the movie Awakenings with Robin Williams. It's a true story of what happened when they administered l-dopa without carbidopa. Basically it's great for the brain but highly toxic to nerves in the rest of the body when it's administered alone. You're better off taking tyrosine which is how your body creates dopamine from food, but there are some limiting factors that protect you from the awful effects of pure dopa.</p>
<p>Pure dopamine doesn't cross the blood brain barrier. There's no transporter. L-dopa does, but then it also gets converted to dopamine outside the brain, which causes the movement disorders. Things like carbidopa are there to limit peripheral conversion, but it isnt perfect so eventually it's going to cause problems...just at a slower rate.</p>
<p>Interestingly the plant mucuna pruriens has both dopa and the protective carbidopa, along with other useful protective chemicals. In ancient India it was used to treat Parkinson like symptoms, and seems to have a better side effect profile. It still probably carries some of the risk of modern combinations, but it's certainly superior to what we were using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine, on its own cannot cross the Blood-brain-barrier (BBB), only select molecules like glucose can. Besides Dopamine if given IV, is mainly peripheral in distribution and has profound effects on the heart.
However, we can use a precursor/prodrug of Dopamine, which can indeed cross the BBB, which is Levodopa.
Levodopa is one of the main drugs used in Parkison's Disease. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dopamine is not able to pass what is called the &quot;blood-brain barrier.&quot; The BBB separates the blood/circulatory system from the brain. The BBB is important because it filters and prevents a lot of toxins and other nasties from reaching the brain even if it gets in the blood. </p>
<p>The 'end result' does not equal the perceived effects whatsoever. It's not about the actions of neurotransmitters, its about the activity of particular circuits and how they interact. </p>
<p>L-DOPA is dopamine that is made soluble through the BBB. It doesn't get you high, it just temporarily fixes the symptoms of Parkinsons, a neurodegenerative disease that destroys dopamine neurons especially, and leads to overall lower dopamine activity, leading to reduced motor control, seizures, and other bad things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To paraphrase for ELI5,</p>
<p>Drugs either bind or inhibit the binding to neurotransmitters or various receptors in the body, which gives us the advertised effects of the drug.</p>
<p>Different drugs with similar targets of effect can work differently based on the size and shape of the drugs chemical formula, or even the chemical makeup itself.</p>
<p>Think of it as a faucet, if you open it halfway, a bit of water flows, versus if you open it all the way or not at all.
This alone can cause different responses. It's not always like accelerating a car, where more gas is more speed. Sometimes pressing the pedal halfway in neurotransmitter systems gives one effect where pressing it all the way gives a different effect</p>
<p>Neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin (etc) work in a spectrum of areas to varrying extents, not simply 1 outlet.</p>
<p>If you mess with one area you're likely messing with a lot of areas, depending on binding affinities. </p>
<p>Meaning, the drug might not work on some areas because it doesn't bind as well as dopamine, or it might work really good in other areas because it's actually better than dopamine at binding based on its shape or the chemical makeup. This would be because of the different receptors in the brain/body.
Not every dopamine receptor is exactly the same. (Which goes for the other neurotransmitter systems as well)</p>
<p>Also, some drugs don't even have target sites. Alcohol just messes with every neurotransmitter system by being a third party. It causes some inhibition of the binding of some receptors and either promotes the release or inhibits reuptake of some other neurotransmitters. So that's to say some drugs could work in that manner as well and still give the effects other drugs give.</p>
