			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a neat theory, and it sounded crazy to me on some intuitive level so I did some poking around Google scholar and hey, the first study I found supports you: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11493720" target="_blank">increased pollen count during thunderstorms is not correlated with asthma attack rates or severity, and ozone concentrations are</a>. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lightning does make some ozone, but the thunderstorms definitely <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/thunderstorms-ozone-atmosphere-18600" target="_blank">bring ozone down</a>.  It's a weather effect caused by the storm that allows stratospheric air to move down.  The effect reaches as far as 60 miles ahead of the front.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although it was called a thunderstorm... there really was not much in the way of thunder and lightning. It was mostly just a crazy rainfront sweeping over. Was fun watching it hit, though.</p></div>		</li>
