			<div class="markdown"><p>would eating a VERY low carb diet, theoretically, eliminate a lot of the bad bacteria? since it has very low sugar to no sugar to feed off of?</p>
<p>chicken and nonstarchy vegetables basically. or just chicken.</p>
<p>what is bad bacteria in this case anyways?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good questions!  It's difficult to eliminate all carbs from the diet because they are fairly ubiquitous.  Fruits and vegetables have complex carbohydrates that are generally considered a part of healthy diet but are carbohydrates nonetheless.  Keep in mind that you need to feed the healthy bacteria to complete with the bad.  But simple carbohydrates, found in processed or concentrated sugar products, are worse for the mouth and the whole body.  </p>
<p>&quot;Bad&quot; bacteria in terms of oral health are generally acidophilic.  This means that they thrive in an acidic environment.  That's why something like soda pop wreaks havoc on the teeth.  It's very acidic (pH around 2 while teeth begin to demineralize/dissolve around pH 5 and a neutral healthy mouth is around 7.5) and a source of simple carbohydrates.  As we observe the oral cavity move from health to disease, we tend to see a bacterial shift from aerobic gram positive species, to anaerobic gram negative species, to finally spirochetes in more advanced periodontal disease.          </p></div>		</li>
