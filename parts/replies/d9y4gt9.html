<p>Although EXTREMELY slow.  It's still mindblowing</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: they did not build it in &quot;mineshaft&quot;. Thanks autocorrect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the insight that Alan Turing had. He built a formalism &quot;Turing machines&quot; to describe any kind of computation machinery (this was around WW2, computers were just around the corner). Later he realized that Turing machines could also describe Turing machines; now called Universal turing machines. And just in case you didn't know who Turing is, he led a final and large effort at breaking German encryption machine used in WW2 using a custom electromechanical machine to test large numbers of possibilities automatically.</p>
<p>A similar concept, a bit later, interpretation towers, programming languages are &quot;evaluated&quot; through a program called the interpreter, turns out the interpreter can interpret another language interpreter (or the same language if you're into self introspection), ad infinitum; the problem /u/0Zyn described appears too, the language at the top of the tower will be interpreted very slowly. This is mostly an academic test for mastering programming in the large, but it's still taught in a simple form in universities (see McCarthy Lisp meta circular evaluator, the SICP book [free online], or 3-lisp by Briant Cantwell Smith, or more recently <a href="http://www.is.ocha.ac.jp/~asai/Black/" target="_blank">http://www.is.ocha.ac.jp/~asai/Black/</a> with a talk by Nada Amin <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrKj4hYic5A" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrKj4hYic5A</a>)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the U of Florida and the School Board of Alachua County (Florida) I was a VM Systems Programmer on IBM mainframes. I worked with IBM's VM OS from 1981 to 2001 when I retired.</p>
<p>I followed the mainframe research closely. In the late 1990's someone ran VM 47 levels deep before the hardware became unresponsive.</p>
<p>Also, in the late 1990's, IBM ported Linux to VM and started referring to the VM OS as a Hypervisor. I participated in workshop where seminar attendees installed Linux as a VM. We all got certificates and pin-stripped Tux pins.</p>
<p>IBM configured multiple Linux servers stripped down to run single apps for load balancing: FTP, Email, Web Servers, etc. The VM Hypervisor could spawn additional Linux VMs as required. For example, if a particular Linux VM became unresponsive, I new one could be spawned from the last viable checkpoint of the failed one.</p>
<p>Additionally, IBM could combine several of their mainframes as a single entity in a &quot;tightly coupled&quot; fashion: Shared memory and shared DASD (Direct Access Storage Device(s)). Using Beowulf, IBM did that with Linux, as well.</p>
<p>Back then these machines were supercomputers which were more powerful than the totality of the tasks assigned them. Today, services like Amazon's AWS are evolutionary results mainly of IBM's efforts with VM, which came to light in the 1960's with CP-40 and to the general user community in the 1970's as VM/370.</p>
<p>Hope this spreads some light on the historical underpinnings of VM.</p>
<p>Aloha.. Allen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the XP installation is the 64 bit version, yes.</p>
<p>A 32 bit machine won't have enough memory to support that many Windows guest OS. You might be able to get four guests deep with 4GB if they're lightweight linux distros. Not using Windows. &quot;Real&quot; or virtual, an OS has real memory requirements.</p></div>		</li>
