This isn't due to the black hole though, there's just a TON of shit in the way that we can't see through. Fortunately, the galaxy is a disk, so we can look above and below the galactic plane, meaning that only a small portion of the sky is actually obscured. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I thought the galaxy revolves like a disk?  The whole dark matter problem?  The angular velocity is (largely) conserved?  Wouldn't what is behind the galactic core will always be behind the galactic core from our vantage point, we can't rotate around and see what's behind it because whatever there is orbiting too.  It'll always be a big 'ol blank &quot;who the hell knows&quot; unless we either a) learn to see thru somehow or b) send out ships/probes/whatevers to where they can start seeing behind the core and message back to us.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the edumakaction. Seems the popsci description of &quot;galaxies spin like disks&quot; isn't entirely accurate. Big surprise =P</p></div>		</li>

Is it just comparing what we can see of it, and other galaxies and a bit of math to give a model of our galaxy? Obviously we haven't taken a full picture of our own galaxy seeing as we're barely making our way out of our own solar system with a single probe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The central black hole is <em>massive</em>, but it's not that big, at least in terms of volume. Even a black hole with the mass of our galaxy would only have an event horizon radius of about a light-year, and of course, most of the galaxy isn't in that central black hole. The actual thing is only about 16 million miles across. At our distance, that's nothing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>by &quot;thing&quot;, are you referring to the area of the sky it can obstruct?</p>
<p>serious quesion: I read recently that Stephen Hawking calls black holes singularities because they are practically zero dimensional on the order of Planck-lengthed. But I read it in a comment on the internet and wasn't sure of its validity. It made sense though, as black holes that orbit each other can do so hundreds of times a second and send out gravitation waves. If they were large, that would cause the masses to exceed relativistic speeds. I wondered then if the &quot;volume&quot; of a black hole (or any reference to length when talking about its size) was then a reference to its event horizon.  But here you have stated they are different. (interesting tidbit, according to <a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-06-star-black-hole.html" target="_blank">phys.org</a>, S2 moved to within 17 light hours of the center of the galaxy back in June, and was going .025c)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the entire mass of the galaxy collapsed into a black hole, it would have an event horizon over 5 trillion miles across, but the central &quot;super massive&quot; black hole it currently has is only about 16 million miles across?</p>
<p>Am I misusing &quot;super massive&quot; here, and confusing it with the one at the center of the universe? Also, if I'm not, and remember correctly, isn't the Milky Way spinning around a binary black hole?</p>
<p>Pardon any mistakes and please set me straight on that if I'm mixing up facts/theories.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does the length of the orbit vary for other stars?  It's clearly not just simply &quot;a solar system writ large&quot;, because the stars are moving every which way.  Do closer stars orbit faster and further ones slower, or do they all kind of hang roughly together?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a complex question that is still being studied. Earlier data on this problem actually led to the inference of the existence of dark matter. In general, yes the ones further out orbit faster in velocity, but with longer orbits. But the odd thing is that the outer edge is going faster than expected. Also, stars seem to travel in waves that help create the galaxy's spiral arms (I don't remember much detail about this part.)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Aha, but I do!  The arms obviously don't rotate rigidly.  If they did the spiral arms would quickly wind up due to the differential rotation of the stars and spiral galaxies would be very short lived things, relatively quickly losing their arms.  </p>
<p>Instead, the arms we see are density waves, areas of the galaxy where the stars basically get into a traffic jam.  Like a traffic jam, the jam itself stays in roughly the same spot while the individual cars approach, <del>slow down while in the jam</del>, and finally leave the other side of it.  There is actually a really cool animation of it <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/b/ba/Galaxy_rotation_wave.ogv/Galaxy_rotation_wave.ogv.360p.webm" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_rotation_curve</a></p>
<p>&quot;The rotational/orbital speeds of galaxies/stars do not follow the rules found in other orbital systems such as stars/planets and planets/moons that have most of their mass at the centre. Stars revolve around their galaxy's centre at equal or increasing speed over a large range of distances. Instead, the orbital velocity of planets in solar systems and moons orbiting planets decline with distance.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>If you ignore the gravitational attractions between the stars and consider them orbiting a massive galactic nucleus, it works exactly like this. Faster near the center and slower at the outside.</p>
<p>That's of course not how it works, but it's still a good approximation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh, that's guaranteed.  Everything is moving and changing in complex ways, no star is orbiting in a perfectly circular path around the galaxy, and the sky will never repeat itself.</p></div>		</li>
