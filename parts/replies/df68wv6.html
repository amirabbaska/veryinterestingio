			<div class="markdown"><p>They had nicotine free cigarettes for a while in the late seventies. They were okay for a while, then started tasting weird, the you caved and bought 20 Rothmans. Because of course without the drug you crave they don't scratch it itch and taste vile- the stopped selling them fairly quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it was long before GMOs - I rather think they just removed the nicotine. John Players  Black did them so you might find something online. It certainly tasted like tobacco, but not quite right- no 'hit'. It's about thirty years ago... The boyfriend had them not I.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The consensus is that vaping is about 95% safer based on the chemicals you inhale. Mostly that's due to nothing being burnt. You can still get some nasty stuff like diactyl in some e liquid and you can produce phormaldehyde if you burn too high and for too long. Having said that even then it's less than in cigarettes and to produce it you need to burn so hot and dry that it would be really really unpleasant to vape. The study which showed it was pretty flawed. The long term effects are a bit grey, but due to the lower levels of dangerous chemicals it's pretty much 100% sure that it's safer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just that nothing is being burned. The <em>amount</em> of 'stuff' that is actually vaporized and/or burned is reduced by a ridiculous amount. Think, if I use four to five drops of my eliquid that's the equivalent of about one cigarette. Instead of inhaling one burning cigarette, I'm vaporizing 4-5 drops of liquid. </p>
<p>This is the same thing that's going on with thc oil. I can smoke an entire blunt/bowl/joint, <em>or</em> I can take a dab that weighs all of a tenth of a gram.  Vaporizing is making smoking healthier just based on the amount of material required. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nicotine doesn't reach temperatures that allow for high amounts of NNK/NNN to form. Those nicotine derivatives are metabolized into carcinogens. That is what I would guess they mean by burning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The formaldehyde study is completely nonsense. You'd have to burn the diactyl so hot it would cause severe burns before even reaching the temp required to produce formaldehyde. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure Diacytl is only used in butterscotch eliquid flavours. It's illegal to use in vaping products in the EU now the new legislation is in anyway. Don't know about anywhere else though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And you would have to vape so much of it to cause a problem that you would need to vape those juices 24/7 for decades if not longer  to see any symptoms. And there is about 100 times as much diacytl in cigs then in e liquid.  And no one has gotten popcorn lung from them.</p></div>		</li>
