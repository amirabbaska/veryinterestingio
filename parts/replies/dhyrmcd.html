			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't that simple.  Manufacturers sell to pharmacies, who sell to people based on prescriptions from doctors, who take different insurance companies to handle their claims.  Anyone with half a brain can go to multiple doctors and multiple pharmacies across different networks that mostly don't talk to each other, and voila, it's <em>very</em> hard to tie the overage in use to an actual person.</p>
<p>I work for one of the top three pharmacy benefits management companies.  We have access to about 60 million people's pharmacy claims data no matter which pharmacy or doctor they go to, as long as they put their claims through insurance.  We are in probably the best spot to identify and interact with opioid abusers across the country, with a couple key limitations even we have to work through (biggest one being people who pay out of pocket and don't interact with their insurance).</p>
<p>My team is the one building pretty much all of our opioid models right now.  There absolutely are indicators and potential predictors of abuse.  The problems, however, fall into a couple places.  Knowing that someone raises all the flags for opioid abuse doesn't necessarily mean they're addicted themselves, they could be dealing or just an outlier with a legitimate need.  Any approach to identifying something as complex as an addiction at a national scale is necessarily going to be probabilistic.  So... this leads to the biggest problem. Without absolute certainty, which it's frankly impossible to achieve at the scale of this problem:</p>
<p>What do you do about it?  My company is owned by the largest health insurance provider, so we can do things like refer people to rehab facilities or have doctors call them on the phone and try to talk through it, but how many addicts or dealers will really find much help in that?  We can't compel people to go, we're not law enforcement. Should we refer everyone we flag to law enforcement?  That's a legal nightmare with tons of liability, and will get a lot of addicts into jail instead of helping them.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Statewide Prescription Monitoring Programs accessible to prescribers and pharmacists have helped alleviate some of the doctor shopping. Pharmacies have to report the details of all controlled substance prescriptions dispensed to the program, and it was searchable by patient name. At my previous retail pharmacy job, we were required to view the PMP for certain &quot;target&quot; drugs, like oxycodone, dilaudid, and methadone, and we could also refer to it for any other concerns, like multiple, frequent, small quantities of painkillers from emergency rooms. </p>
<p>While PMPs have largely alleviated the doctor shopping in states that have them, I think the largest diversion comes from people &quot;playing by the rules&quot; and getting chronic opiate prescriptions from unscrupulous doctors and then selling them. It was not uncommon for me to fill scripts for Oxycontin 80mg, #60, plus Oxycodone immediate release 30mg, #120, add Soma or Xanax, Gabapentin, etc etc, EVERY MONTH for the same patient. They see the same doctor, they fill the same scripts every month on time, never ask for them early, never get additional scripts from the ER, and always bill their insurance.  They started with lower doses and quantities that escalated over time, which is normal due to opiate tolerance. Sketchy? Probably, but how do I know, as a pharmacist with no access to the patient's previous medical history, MRIs, diagnostic test, etc, who is taking the meds and who is selling them? I do my part, make sure there are no &quot;red flags,&quot; and I have to trust that the prescribers are doing their part. It's a hard situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Canada, you have access to one doctor and one global health plan.  My doctor and pharmacy deal with one (additional) insurance plan per patient.  We pay for extra coverage etc.</p>
<p>What I found, being that we have several type of very difficult to get medications, is that all you need to do is quit your regime and start selling to the highest drug using bidder (if you are intent on selling pharmaceutical drugs)</p>
<p>I had a prescription for <del>Adevan</del> Ativan that I stopped taking about half way through, and I brought the pills back to the pharmacy for proper disposal.  I could have kept them and easily sold each pill at a huge profit, if that was my intent.</p>
<p>Does this seem to be an issue there as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from my personal life, I get drug tested routinely however I also have crippling anxiety, to the point of my whole body shaking when I do anything outside of my daily/normal routine (little more extreme I'll share more details if anyone wants to know but just want to keep it simple for now).  </p>
<p>So I have a prescription for Xanax. My prescription is very liberal with how much I can take because of how terrible I presented to the doctor, (because it was outside of my normal routine) but also made a point I don't want to take more than needed, if any medication because I cannot be sedated for my job. Plus I'm generally okay not taking it at all about 3 days a week.  </p>
<p>So when I started this my script was for 0.25mg and I was prescribed to take 1 to 2 pills 1 to 2 times a day as needed. So worst case scenario I can take 4 pills a day. Now no doctor can write a prescription and no pharmacy would fill for me to go to a pharmacy get what I think I'll need and then go back for more if I need more. So doc has to write it for 4/day and I cannot skip a month of getting it filled because of my frequent drug tests. So if I only take two pills every other day I still have massive amounts of extra after a few months that, could potentially end up being abused. </p>
<p>This isn't exactly pain pills but people that are in chronic pain may do something similar  and all the meds are accounted for. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is spot on, with one difference. With most opioids you can't just have a doctor write a prescription with X many refills. They can only write one prescription at a time. My doctor's can't even send them electronically, I always have to go to their office to get the physical piece of paper to give to the pharmacy. It is so frustrating when you feel like shit and have to drive an hour to get a prescription for something that could help. </p>
<p>Beyond that, you're completely right that the doctor will always write you a prescription for the most you could need within the month because insurance will only let you get one bottle per month. They try to do what is best for the patient within the ridiculous insurance system we have. In my case, my body didn't respond well to the first two opioids he prescribed but I did tolerate the third. That meant I had two bottles with 100+ pills just hanging around my Medicine cabinet that I couldn't use and one I could use, all of which were properly prescribed. </p>
<p>Looking back, I'm lucky the pharmacy didn't flag me for something because I had so many prescriptions within just a few weeks. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just going to make a similar point. A lot of people with legitimate prescriptions for controlled substances (legitimate meaning they're under a doctor's care, not abusing their meds and not selling their meds) often end up with extras or leftovers at the end of the month. Or they have a short term need for opioid pain medication, like surgery or dental procedures, that keep the pills that they didn't need so that they have them on hand &quot;just in case&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have panic disorder which may or may not be what you have as well. I recognize and understand completely the scenario you are describing. I take clonazepam as a maintenance med instead of xanax for a variety of reasons, and the SSRi's were worse for me than just taking nothing. I do have a script for xanax however, because a few times a year I may need it (lowest dose available .25mg). I actively avoid taking it because I don't want to risk dependency or the possibility of building a tolerance and it not working when I need it to. That means though, that I have dozens of pills sitting in my medicine cabinet that are past expiration date, or just wont ever be used. Doc cant write me a script for just 5 pills because he can't predict when I may need one but writing a script for 30 means that there are certain to be &quot;extra&quot; pills that I won't ever take. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone to data mine a problem like this, they need access to the data, which gives you two obvious problems straight away:</p>
<ul>
<li>HIPAA - fines could be in the millions of dollars for screwing up, per patient.</li>
<li>Data is <em>valuable</em>, medical data even more so. No way anyone would want to share their data here. We are talking 100s if not 1000s different companies, who would need to agree on what to share and how. That's simply not happening</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: And before anyone says anonymise it - yeah, no. There's no such thing as anonymous, when it comes to large enough data sets. If you have the anonymous data set and correlate it to your own patient data set, you could quite likely find your patients within the data set. (And you can't let patients have multiple anonymous keys, as it would defeat the purpose of the data collection).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'd also like to reinforce this - if your dataset is comprehensive enough to predict likely indicators of abuse, it's probably also rich enough to personally identify and flagrantly violate the privacy of that individual. </p>
<p>And if you intend to prevent opiod abuse you're probably going to need to identify the individual anyway to block them from access. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I hope you appreciate that this subreddit is designed to be able to allow complex situations to be explained for laymen, not actually for children. We merely request that the vast majority of people are able to understand the answer you are giving.</p>
<p>I've read your comment, and the context it is asked in, and I am approving it. I believe the comment is, for the large part, a good, simplified answer to the large problem raised by /u/KingNewbie. </p>
<p>I would however ask you to keep in mind for the future that we believe there is no problem that cannot be attempted to be explained to the layman, and that the issues hardest to explain to the lay man are often the best additions to our subreddit.</p>
<p>With that said, thanks for your answer! It's great to get responses from people directly involved the field the OP is asking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use to work In a pharmacy as a technician. It's a problem because 50% (may be a bit exaggerated) of the prescriptions we receive are for pain killers. If we denied a quarter of the people who came in we'd get lots of complaints to upper management who would put pressure on us.</p>
<p>The only people who get denied are people who hop around pharmacies and have clearly been denied in the past, have filled the same prescription elsewhere and took a copy of it, or those who come staggering in very hostile and clearly under the influence. Most addicts are smart enough not to do that.</p>
<p>It's easy for an addict to complain to corporate that we were profiling them for whatever reason. Addicts are relentless and will find a way.</p>
<p>The pharmacy is not the issue, the issue is that opiates are some doctors entire business. They make all their money off these people and they are well known by pharmacists in the area. We had 3 doctors who were notorious for filling anything their patients asked for and we always checked the profiles of patients to see their prescription history. </p>
<p>Usually if they had followed the rules and always got their prescriptions on time and never tried pulling anything shady then there would be no realistic excuse to not fill it for them. Most addicts are smart enough to follow the rules. (With the exception of occasional desperate ones who come in crying about getting their prescriptions stolen, etc.) </p>
<p>I had a girl once who went to the extent of getting a police report so we could refill. We did it the first time and then she brought in another police report and we finally turned her down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you not report the doctors? It seems like this is the actual answer here, and should be top level.</p>
<p>Clearly the doctors are over prescribing so there needs to be some recourse for the doctors that do.</p>
<p>For instance the town in WV where the population is 400 people but there were 9 million hydrocodone pills shipped to one pharmacy there over two years. That's roughly 31 pills per resident per day. <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/12/22/506550248/drug-firms-make-millions-by-sending-opioid-pills-to-w-va-report-says" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/2016/12/22/506550248/drug-firms-make-millions-by-sending-opioid-pills-to-w-va-report-says</a></p>
<p>This problem at it's core CLEARLY boils down to the FACT that somewhere some people are making a shit load of money to either cause or let this epidemic continue. Whether it's the pharma companies, Doctors, politicians, the FDA or any combination the fact of the matter is that nobody cares to fix it because it would be too easy to stop such an obvious problem if they did.</p></div>		</li>
