			<p>Since you're forty, i'm going to assume you went to college in the early 90s; according to <a href="http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=76" target="_blank">this</a> website, for the 1990-1991 school year the average college tuition for a four year public university was 9,374 dollars a year, or 5,693 in 2011 dollars. Compare that to 16,780 dollars a year for 2011-2012 school year. When you add in the fact that minimum wage hasn't gone up despite prices going up and the fact that the number of jobs that DON'T require a college degree is shrinking every year, you can see where it starts to become a problem.</p>		</li>

			<p>what?  minimum wage has more than doubled since I was a kid.  It was 3.35 in 1989, when I got my first part time job.  Then went up to 4.25, then 5.15 until just 8 years ago.  Now it's 7.25.<br><br>24 hours at the university I go to (started back taking night courses a couple years ago) runs about $6,000-7,000.  That's not quite double what it was when I went to Missouri-Rolla in 1992.  Minimum wage has essentially doubled, college tuition has essentially doubled...</p>		</li>

			<p>According to <a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/2014_MinimumWageCPI1.png" target="_blank">this</a> graphic, minimum wage hasn't gone up nearly enough to keep up with inflation and rising costs of living. <br><br><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2013/12/04/5-facts-about-the-minimum-wage/" target="_blank">Adjusted for inflation, the federal minimum wage peaked in 1968 at $8.56 (in 2012 dollars). Since it was last raised in 2009, to the current $7.25/hour, the federal minimum has lost about 5.8% of its purchasing power to inflation.</a></p>		</li>
