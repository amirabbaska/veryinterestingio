			<div class="markdown"><p>The amount of useable for fission U235 is much lower in the Oklo reactors than in other natural Uranium. Normal is 0.7%, Oklo has figures as low as 0.4%. This is how the anomaly was found - sudden very low figures for U235 for ore from a specific area. </p>
<p>Fission reactors split the U235, thus the amount of it is steadily declines over reactor usage time.</p>
<p>Note that almost the entire difficulty of making reactor/weapon grade Uranium with a U235 part of 3.5% is in enriching it from the natural 0.7%. See Manhattan Project, Iranian atom program, Stuxnet zentrifuge sabotage etc. It makes NO sense economically at all to use Oklo ore for that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The traces of the natural reactor were discovered by analysing materials from the uranium mines at the site. The uranium extracted over the years when the mines were operational was used for producing electricity, although the mines have now been exhausted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, naturally occurring uranium doesn't have enough of a U235 concentration for nuclear reactors or weapons. It would take more ore from those mines but we already have to enrich it for it to be usable anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear weapons usually don't use uranium though. Plutonium-239 is the main isotope used for nuclear weapons, as it's much more economical than Uranium-235.</p>
<p>It does decay considerably faster than U235, but still slow enough to not really lose appreciable amounts on human time scales. And it decays to U235 anyway, which would still be able to take part in fission chain reactions (albeit less effectively).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true, but...you need to bombard U238 with neutrons in a reactor in order to get Pu239.  Which means you need U235 to make Pu239.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But you only need low-enriched uranium to run a reactor. Enriching from the naturally occurring 0.7% to about 3.5% is a lot less work than enriching all the way to 80% or more.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It leads me to maybe a stupid question: at this point in the age of the universe, can we not expect any more super heavy elements to be created?</p></div>		</li>
