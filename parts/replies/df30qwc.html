<p>2) Recent Event. March 17 (UPI)</p>

<p>The Education Department wrote Thursday in a Dear Colleague Letter that a previous letter from President Barack Obama's administration is no longer in force. In 2015, agencies were barred from charging interest of up to 16 percent of the principal and accrued interest on the loans if the borrower entered the government's loan rehabilitation program within 60 days of default.</p>
<p>Almost 7 million people with $162 billion in loans held by guarantee agencies are affected.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I used to pay back Sallie Mae, now I pay back Navient. And boy are their people aggressive and downright annoying. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Navient is also really aggressive about calling family members. They really shouldn't, with how often they call them, but that loophole they use is they can contact family &quot;to confirm my contact information&quot;. </p>
<p>So they call up my family and say &quot;this is Navient calling for sonofaresiii about <em>a personal banking matter</em>&quot; (which is very obvious). I don't care all that much because my family knows I'm poor as shit, but it could be embarrassing for a lot of people. And is pretty clearly meant as an embarrassment tactic </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless your family member us a guarantor or something, they're not allowed to repeatedly call them. I used to work in compliance for a debt collection firm (I'm in Canada but we managed US debt) and the rules were pretty strict. </p>
<p>You can only call family or a workplace for location info and, iirc, you could only do it once, after making contact. May have a case for harassment there, seems very anti-CFPB. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sallie Mae would change how payments were applied to unpaid loans in such a way to generate fees (for example, spreading a payment out into loans that don't have payments due and leaving the due payment partially unpaid). This happened to me two or three times during the years I was paying off loans with them.</p>
<p>That is why I hate Sallie Mae.</p></div>		</li>
