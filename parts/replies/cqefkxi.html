			<div class="markdown"><p>if there's one thing I wish I could convey to people it's that a reactor is simply something which permits reactions to occur.  A cigarette lighter is a chemical reactor.  People freak out when they see the term &quot;reaction&quot;, as though reactions aren't responsible for existence as we know it.  </p>
<p>The same thing goes for &quot;nuclear&quot;.  If one of the fundamental forces of nature is named after it, then it's far more common than most of us can comprehend.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even more so with &quot;chemicals&quot;. Everyone says &quot;gross, it's full of chemicals&quot; or &quot;they make it using chemicals&quot; which is just ridiculous. Everything is &quot;full of chemicals&quot;. Everything is made with chemicals.  Chemicals are everything!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, there is an obvious understanding of what people mean when they talk about chemicals in that way. There are essentially two definitions, the literal scientific one, and the one that essentially means man made chemicals. It's similar to Communism.. There is one, technically correct definition, meaning a stateless, classless society in which means of production are owned publicly and then the one that people tend to use when referring to places like China and North Korea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once asking a question on a homebrew forum. I was amazed how quickly I alienated the community there when I referred to the fermentation step as a &quot;reaction&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, technically it's not a reaction, it's a series of enzymatic reactions taking place inside living organisms. 'Fermentation reaction' sounds wrong to me, and I have a bachelor's in biochemistry.</p>
<p>Calling it a 'reaction' suggests that there's a simple chemical process that converts saccharides into ethanol with high selectivity, and that's simply not true.</p></div>		</li>
