<p>If you find who is doing it, ask them to please turn their power down (its illegal to boost CB over 4w) If they refuse, report them to the FCC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife had a similar problem with her computer speakers at work.  They were picking up a nearby radio station.</p>
<p>The easiest fix is to use a ferrite core.  I bought ones similar to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ferrite-Core-Cord-Noise-Suppressor/dp/B0002MQGEK" target="_blank">these</a> and they fixed her problem.</p>
<p>Assuming you have the cord length buy one with a hole wider than your cord and wrap it a few times though the ring.  Do it towards the middle of the cord length.</p>
<p>If you don't have the length for loops buy one that is the same size as your cord and put it near the middle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened with my cheap pc speakers as well, scared the life out of me when I first heard it. I got up in the morning to go to work and heard russian voices in our living room.</p>
<p>Can't have been a nearby station though, as I live in southern Norway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably (2).  Do you have any cooking pots?  Bundle your cables up as much as possible and surround them with the pot.  That should silence the ghost station.</p>
<p>The same happens to me with cheap headphones when plugged into my computer</p></div>		</li>
