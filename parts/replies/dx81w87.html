<p>Vasovagal syncope ('fainting') is caused by your brain triggering a reflex that actively slows your heart rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have very low blood pressure and have the vision blur sometimes as well. This is something that I've been able to manage without medication. I'm just aware of it and can now be provocative. (Not getting up too quickly, wiggling my feet, toes before standing, sitting up in bed for a few seconds before getting up) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m like you actually! I don’t take meds...just make sure not to shoot up out of my chair when I stand.</p>
<p>It’s always standing (not sitting up like you experience.)</p>
<p>It was waaay worse when I was younger when my BP was I think 80/60. Back then half the time I stood up my vision faded to a maroon color.</p></div>		</li>
