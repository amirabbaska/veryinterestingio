			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the press releases have all been careful to say &quot;potential&quot; and &quot;evidence for&quot;, but that level of nuance is often lost in popular reporting. Another thread of evidence, though, is the time delay of the planet's transit, which is not likely to be an instrumental glitch but could be caused by gravitational interactions with an undetected planet. From our <a href="http://hubblesite.org/news_release/news/2018-45" target="_blank">press release</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In addition to this dip in light, Hubble provided supporting evidence for the moon hypothesis by finding the planet transit occurring more than an hour earlier than predicted. This is consistent with the planet and moon orbiting a common center of gravity that would cause the planet to wobble from its predicted location, much the way the Earth wobbles as our Moon orbits it.</p>
<p>The researchers note the planetary wobble could be caused by the gravitational pull of a hypothetical second planet in the system, rather than a moon. While Kepler has not detected a second planet in the system, it could be that the planet is there, but not detectable using Kepler's techniques.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanna add that 1. media isn't monolithic, and consequently 2. some media outlets/formats cover these sorts of findings much more carefully and responsibly than others.  </p>
<p>Most of the coverage I've seen of this result actually goes to great pains to note its still-tentative, as-yet-unconfirmed nature and to detail where exactly the key uncertainties exist.  </p>
<p>A big, largely unacknowledged problem underlying constant debates over media accuracy and public trust is that lots of people don't actually get their news from remotely reliable sources, and furthermore often have significant difficulty properly understanding what they're consuming due to things like basic deficits in reading comprehension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The research team at Columbia involved in this search has a REALLY good YouTube channel called Cool Worlds.</p>
<p>David Kipping is an excellent presenter and does a great job explaining the data in a clear way, and the channel uploaded two videos yesterday on the evidence for a potential exomoon.</p>

<p>in my opinion as an exoplanet astronomer, that is by far a more likely estimation for the signal seen here</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your skepticism is more directed at our instruments though, not the odds of these exoplanets we're studying having exomoons, right? I would think that with as abundant as moons seem to be in our own solar system, surely we expect them to be just as abundant within other solar systems. Once we have the instruments to detect exomoons easily, I would expect they won't be hard to find at all..?</p></div>		</li>
