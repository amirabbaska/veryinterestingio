<p>Just for reference, that'd be about 3 days for a 5MB file like a modern photo or wallpaper.</p>
<p>An 800x600 BMP file (I have no idea what format Voyager uses) is about 1.5MB, so that's still almost a whole day for a single snapshot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite the opposite.  There was no image compression, but there was a forward error correction code <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Golay_code" target="_blank">(Golay Code)</a> which roughly doubled the number of raw bits sent so that we could be sure every bit of the image was received exactly as it was sent.  Simple compressed data is a serious problem for transmission, if you miss just a single bit, the whole image can get borked.</p>
<p>By the time Voyager 2 got to Uranus (1986), the flight computer could be sent new code that repurposed it (temporarily) to add a vastly more complex <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenated_error_correction_code" target="_blank">concatenated code</a>, which reduced the overhead to about 7/6 (instead of 2/1), and is surprisingly similar to what is being used by satellite TV today.  They also added <em>lossy</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding" target="_blank">delta compression</a>, reducing the sent bits to three from eight per pixel.</p>
<p>20 Watts of power, 3.6 meter dish, 3 <em>billion</em> km away = 29.9kbit/sec (theoretical peak)</p>
<p>And the feats it takes to build the receivers that can track and resolve that tiny signal are utterly amazing too.  Think 270 foot dishes with liquid helium cooled amplifiers.  To resolve the confusion in different data rates being posted for the High Gain Antenna - it ranged from 7.2kb/s to 29.9kb/s depending on the time of day - thus what earth dishes were pointing in the right direction - see <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4227/Chapter04/04_Network_Operations.pdf#page=26" target="_blank">Figure 4-8</a> for a cool graph (Australia rocks).</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.bernd-leitenberger.de/voyager-uranus-neptun.shtml" target="_blank">Here</a> is an excellent description &amp; details (in german).

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd only want to use lossless compression, so JPEG and the like are not not options. You wouldn't even want to throw away the &quot;noise&quot; at the bottom of the signal, because there might be something there that you could extract with more-sophisticated analysis later. Now I want to do some research into what encoding scheme was actually used. </p></div>		</li>

I would imagine the format was proprietary, but the both Voyager craft were able to take almost 20,000 images each, so a day to transfer a single photo wouldn't be practical.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, the high-gain antenna <a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/spacecraft/instruments_hga.html" target="_blank">could transmit up to 7200 bits/second</a>. Still nothing compared to current tech, but not quite as terrible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voyager has multiple transmissions in its 115 kbit/s rate.  The 7200 bit/s you mention is the data captured and recorded when it doesn't have contact with earth - meaning it is more than just those pictures, but also other science instruments and spacecraft status (engineering) data.  There is a lot of interference at 8.4 gigahertz, so a ton of error correction are used in spacecraft - cuts down the actual throughput.  The data rate goes down with distance in radio communications (law of inverse squares) so the rate drops as it travels further out. The generators are producing less and less power over time, so there is less power available for the radio antennas.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  There is limited storage available on the spacecraft.  Spacecraft aren't able to use off the shelf electronics because of the radiation that they encounter in space; their components must be radiation hardened.  This means that they are quite a bit less capable than the computers that we're used to using.  For example, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has 20 GB of flash memory, while the Curiosity Rover has only 2 GB.  </p>
<p>Even though a spacecraft designed today would have significantly more storage (I'd hazard a guess that they could manage 32-64 GB), if we want to fit it with one of those spectacular super hi-res cameras, then its memory will only be able to hold a couple of images at a time.  If it then takes a month to transmit one image back to Earth, the amount of images we could take is severely limited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't expect memory would be as much of a problem now. IIRC, unlike processors, controllers, etc, which have to be BJT-based, memory on spacecraft, even when sold as &quot;radiation-hardened,&quot;  is essentially off-the-shelf technology, just in a constantly self-checking RAID of sorts. Factor in SSD-driven improvements in the technology and availability of memory, and you can probably comfortably fit 256 or 512 GB on a spacecraft if you start designing it today. That said, BJT-based computing is still fugly and horribly expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't this be less of a problem going forward, seeing as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Atmosphere_and_Dust_Environment_Explorer#Lunar_Laser_Communication_Demonstration" target="_blank">LADEE's Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration</a> in October of 2013 was a success? Transmitting 64GB of data at 600mbps (lower than they demonstrated) would take just under 15 minutes. The LLCD was essentially proof that we can do high(er) bandwidth downlinks, at least as far out as the moon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since the transmission power of the spacecraft was a constant value regardless of distance from the earth, they had to decrease the bit rate to maintain the same probability of error.  This works because at a lower bit rate, you transmit more energy per bit, making your overall signal to noise ratio better </p></div>		</li>
