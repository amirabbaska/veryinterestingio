			<div class="markdown"><p>Daniel Kahneman (a famous behavioural psychologist who also won the Noble Prize in economics) talks about two systems in the brain -- the unconscious one which makes most of our decisions like 'I want to go to the fridge' or `there are no cars so I'll cross the road now' (he calls system 1), and the conscious one which switches itself on when it thinks the unconscious one cannot do the job properly, and can do things like mental calculations and weighing complicated pros and cons (system 2).</p>
<p>To me mental exhaustion usually means system 2 is running out of steam. There's an area of psychological research called 'ego depletion', ego being the system in the brain that regulates and allocates concentration (similar to system 2), arguing that ego requires mental resources and becomes exhausted. I suspect this is a similar thing to when you use system 2 for a while and then you gradually lose your capability to keep doing so (ie after intense studying for a couple of hours). I think researchers used to relate this to glucose levels but, of course, disproving the glucose idea does not discredit the ego depletion idea, which has lots of experimental support.</p>
<p>Zynna this sounds a bit like your second point. Do you agree that this is sort of the mechanism behind what you're talking about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Secretly most of my research is in the field of 'ego depletion', but it's a dumb &amp; confusing term so I thought that it didn't need to be in the basic explanation.  You're exactly right, &quot;disproving the glucose idea does not discredit the ego depletion idea&quot; (and that's what's happened), although I've came across at least one professor who didn't seem to understand this and thought that they were somehow magically linked ideas.  </p>
<p>There are some studies using System 1 and System 2 in the context of depletion - I've even ran one, and found that people rely on more &quot;System 1&quot; processes when they are fatigued.  But, like almost all nice and simple psychological theories, the dual-process model (System 1 and System 2) has also been increasingly refuted in recent years.  Not to say that there's nothing to the theory, but the two systems are highly overlapping, generally work together, and aren't really distinct systems at all (not neurologically at least).  But the general idea is right, people tend to act more &quot;system-1-y&quot; when they are fatigued or depleted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you missed the part about neurotransmitters filtering back into the neurons.</p>
<p>Basically, inside a neuron, signals are carried by ions.  The ions pile up on one side, and take time to get back to the start.</p>
<p>Between neurons, there are larger molecules.  They exit the axons (long part) and connect with the dendrites (shorter part).  The connection is called a synapse.  </p>
<p>As a synapse is triggered, it becomes less responsive to being triggered.  This is because of recovery time for the synapse, and because the ions inside are more depleted.  </p>
<p>This is good, because the neurotransmitters accumulate in the synapse, and you do not want the synapse locked &quot;on&quot;.  For a bad example, look up seratonin syndrome.</p>
<p>So, mental fatigue is basically running low on transmitters, and activations reduce.  Using other parts of your brain still works, because they are not depleted.  </p>
<p>Reward seeking is because dopamine is a pretty pervasive override, and can reduce the amount of signal needed to activate many target neurons.</p>
<p>Also, neuroplasticity comes in here.  Ions and neurotransmitters exert a very real pressure.  They cause cell walls to bulge where they flow (effectively low pressure areas, but not exactly).  Cell structures tend to maintain this new bulge if it's active.  Skeletons of proteins and fats fill in.</p>
<p>Memories are distributed, so no one synapse holds a memory.  It's the overall network that holds it, and a memory is a feedback loop across large numbers of synapses.  Multiple memories are all laid on top of eachother, based on the time it takes signals to propagate, how far they go, etc.</p>
<p>Maybe this is an ELI10, but my kids absorbed this at 4-6.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good explanation of how synapses work!  The reduction in activation immediately after repeated use that you've described isn't the cause of mental fatigue, though, it's the cause of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_adaptation" target="_blank">neural adaptation</a>.  Adaptation is also really cool, though, and explains things like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afterimage" target="_blank">afterimages</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Synaptic fatigue leads to long term depression and potentiation.  This type of neuroplasticity prevents a whole region from hitting signal limits.  </p>
<p>It is, at the very least, coincidental with the mechanisms of mental fatigue not caused by sleep cycles nor physical fatigue.  I do not have research refs to tie it together.  I am fatigued, AND overriding some regions by way of caffeine too late in the day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post but I think the common parlance on this subject can be a little muddling. You don't really ever &quot;run out&quot; of neurotransmitters except under really exceptional circumstances (neurodegenerative disease, severe mental illness, extended drug binges etc), and your actual levels of dopamine and noradrenaline stay pretty constant since they're very easily synthesised from your diet and your brain has a constant supply.  The attenuation in regulating your emotions is usually due to receptor up or down regulation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Run out meaning less available for signal transmission, not as in broken down.  Vesicles migrate away from synapses, and may be transmitted faster than reuptake.  So the remaining are conserved for more dire situations, etc.  Synthesis takes time as well, much more than the time to dump them out of a neuron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the ions pile up? iirc the two ions just alternate up and down but basically in place passing the charge to the next one. its not like dopamine hits the dendrite and then an ion flows down to the axon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actual gates that open and close, allowing K+,  Na+ and Ca++ to flow (or be pumped) into and out of the cell, all along the membrane.  </p>
<p>The cool thing is the gates are not unique to neurons; they're found in some prokaryotes too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the sleepiness one has kinda already been done.  For non-sleepy mental fatigue, your brain gradually becomes less reactive to the task-relevant stimuli ... so there is a smaller neural response to errors, and there is less neural discrimination between relevant and irrelevant stimuli.  And then there's increased neural response to reward-relevant stimuli.  A couple different parts of your brain keep track of &quot;how long have I been doing effortful/not-fun things&quot; and  and then that value is included when your brain starts calculating where it is going to allocate its attention. It isn't really a hardware change so much as a software change.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Can we hack or turn off these parts of the brain, so that we don't tire so quickly? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider for a second what you're asking here. If people really understood what's happening with these processes in the physiological sense, it would imply profound insight into how the brain works in a holistic sense. If anyone (especially if the industry overall) had those insights, various industries would do so much more with them than just sit around waiting for someone to ask about them on Reddit. You'd probably see far more advanced AIs in lots of technological industries, better treatment options in the fields of neural and nervous medicine, better developed approaches in the fields of psychology and psychiatry, etc.</p>
<p>Researchers have <em>ideas</em> about how the brain <em>might</em> be working when these kinds of things happen, but it's important to remember that really very little about how the brain actually <em>works</em> (in the ways that map physical causes to behavioral effects) is properly understood.</p></div>		</li>
