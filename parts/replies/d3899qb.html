<p>Do you have more information, or a link, where we can learn more about this and maybe even see one of the rolls?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is standard gorilla glass 2. I've seen the japanese made chemically strengthened glass do something similar.</p>
<p>I was really thinking of products like willow glass (corning propaganda showing the roll available here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra22NTz5gvw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra22NTz5gvw</a>). As I understand it, the willow glass and the like are the same type of glass before the ion replacement strengthening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would extra thickness protect against scratching and abrasion? Those things already only affect the outermost portion of the glass, so why would making it thicker have any effect?</p></div>		</li>
