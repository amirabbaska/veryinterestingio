<p>If you have 4-5 kids &amp; they have 4-5 kids, you're looking at splitting up the family fortune 16-25 different ways.  Even without foolish use of money, this can severely dilute the money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>families grow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a huge part of it people aren't stressing enough.</p>
<p>Let's say the original rich couple starts out with 10 million dollars.  Each couple down the line has three children.</p>
<p>Generation 1 is two people, which gives each person 5 million dollars.  More than enough to live off the interest without having to touch the initial fortune.</p>
<p>Generation 2 is three people, plus their spouses makes six, plus generation 1 is 8.  1.25 million dollars per person.  Still good, but it's going to require some extra income.  You can no longer live off the interest, even though the fortune was never touched.  But let's say that everyone's working and supplementing their salaries with interest from the 10 million dollars.</p>
<p>Generation 3 is 9 people, plus generations 2 and 1 makes 17.  588k per person.  Without working, even if you live a perfectly average life that money is gone within 20 years.</p>
<p>So in just two short generations, even in ideal circumstances, the personal share of the fortune has gone down by over 80% (there's that number).  If nobody's adding to it, it's just a mathematical inevitability that it's all gone by the time generation 4 rolls around.</p>
<p>No frivolous spending is required.  Human populations grow exponentially, which means that no matter the size of the initial investment and no matter how moderate they are with their spending, it's all gonna be used up within 4 or 5 generations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While there is some truth to this it ignores that the two people living off the investment income of the 10 million don't have to be spending all of the income and the 10 million pot can be growing, significantly.   If you've got 10 million to invest, you can afford the risk of having some of it in higher risk but higher yield investments and can easily be making 1 million per year with a significant portion of that being tax free. Lets just for arguments sake say they want to live on $750k per year which is pretty nice.  So $250k per year for 30 years is another 7.5 million not counting the compounding investment income of the part of that that gets put in earlier. So lets say it's another 10 million.      If they &quot;scrimped&quot; and lived on &quot;only $500k per year they'd be easily over 30 million. </p>
<p>Still diluted by exponentially growing generations but it takes longer than it would initially seem.  And if the original couple is smart, they don't just give it to their heirs, the establish a trust with conditions on wether or not a given offspring gets much of the money. Like they are required to actually work and make something of themself til they are at least 30 for example. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now we should examine the interest, lets say on average someone has a kid at 25. So for gen 2, 25 years interest, gen 3, 50 years interest, and gen 4, 75 years. Assuming the market average in the US, we average about +10% a year in investments, though you would likely do better if you were rich and could afford financial advisors etc. This would take that 10M in g1, make it 121M for G2, 1.5B for G3, and 18B for G4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Living in a country (the United Kingdom) where most of the private wealth is owned by aristocratic families who have owned it for hundreds or thousands of years, this is a little confusing to me.</p>
<p>Clearly, certain families are very good at holding onto their wealth for many generations, despite never doing much or any actual work. Often, this is because they own large amounts of land, and the people who live on or farm this land pay rent. Sometimes they also own companies or shares in companies, which allows their money to continue to grow. So long as they don't do anything terribly stupid, they will each at least &quot;earn&quot; enough money over their lifetime to cover the inheritance taxes when they die, and can pass their entire holding onto their heir.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In 2009, the UK population of sterling HNWI’s stood at 106,110, a -16% reduction from 2007, and in
EUROs, the UK HNWI stock reached 198,000, accounting for almost a quarter of all European HNWIs
(Datamonitor, 2009). The credit crunch has squeezed the HNWI and MA populations in the UK, due
primarily to declines in the value of property and real estate portfolios, reductions in share prices,
the devaluation of other market investments, and a reduction in remuneration and bonus packages.
The highest proportions of HNWIs live in London and the south-East of England, but the highest
growth rates are in Northern Ireland and the north-east of England. The MA population in the UK
was estimated to be 5.1 million in 2009, which has declined by -17% since 2007 (Datamonitor, 2009).
The MA market is concentrated in London and the south-east, but substantial growth rates have
been experienced in Scotland and Northern Ireland. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's a fact that something like 80% of the current millionaires in the US are first generation. </p>
<p>Granted, because of the vasty larger amounts of money involved at the very top, most of the money is in the hands of a relatively few families that have had it for generations but numerically speaking, most people with a lot of money earned it they didn't inherit it.  Certainly they didn't come from dirt poor backgrounds in most cases, and there are significant advantages for someone from an even slightly well off family but the idea that it's impossible to start from little to nothing and get rich is absolutely not a myth. It's harder than it used to be but it's far from impossible. </p></div>		</li>
