			<div class="markdown"><p>Mind you, the exhaust expelled from the 'Big Blow' turbines was exceptionally hot. There's a story about one being left running under an overpass, and the concrete above beginning to melt.</p>
<p>They also had a particular talent of making roasted bird.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Concrete is composed of interlocked silicate crystals with WATER as part of their structure. If you heat concrete it will eventually explode, as the vibrational energy of the water molecules in the concrete becomes greater than the molecular binding energy in the concrete, and the water escapes as steam, leaving a dehydrated silicate powder. At this point you would know the concrete was destroyed.</p>
<p>Most of the remainder will eventually fuse, if you raise its temperature further, but this isn't any longer concrete, as we know it.</p>
<p>The steel contained within the concrete could theoretically melt, but since the max output temperature of the Big Blows was about 500 F, and the melting point of steel is around 1500 F, then this also did not happen.

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a follow up, couldn't many of these issues can be fixed with modern technology. Could you use batteries and/or super capacitors to avoiding running the turbine at low speed or where noise is a constraint?</p>
<p>As for fuel, if they use more fuel per output than diesel engines, why would power plants use them? That directly conflicts with efficiency concerns of modern power generation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what's already been pointed out, the most efficient turbine plants are combined-cycle. The first cycle is like a plane, where burning fuel expands and turns the turbine. The second is water heated by waste heat from the first to produce steam and turn the next turbine.  </p>
<p>Single-cycle turbine plants are not much more efficient than the best modern piston engines (around 40% thermal efficiency) while combined-cycle plants can exceed 60%. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Power plants work differently.  They use heat to generate high-pressure steam, and send that through a series of turbines to extract work from it.  That process is very efficient.  For a gas turbine engine, it's the expanding gases from the combustion itself that turns the turbine.  While capable of generating high power, it's not as efficient in terms of % of the original thermal energy that is converted to electrical energy.</p>
<p>The reason they don't do heat-&gt;steam-&gt;turbine-&gt;generator setup on locomotives is that it's much too bulky.  The steam turbines scale up very well and can be made more efficient as they make them large.  If you tried to scale it down to a locomotive size, it would be much heavier and less efficient than the diesel electric setup they currently use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all power plants use Gas turbines, for example coal fired or nuclear power plants use steam turbines to transfer energy into mechanical energy for the generator. </p>
<p>Gas turbines efficiency in generating mechanical energy (which is the goal for trains) is surprisingly low, worse than diesen engines. That's because a lot of the energy escapes with hot exhaust gases.</p>
<p>The reason why you can build really efficient power plants with them, is that you can combine them with a steam turbine. So basically, there is a gas turbine powering the generator, and from it's exhaust they generate steam, which is used by a steam turbine that also helps power the generator. Actually the steam turbine usually provides more than half the power. You can reach 60%+ efficencies with these power plants.</p>
<p>This requires a lot of space, and adds a lot of weight obviously, so it wouldn't be viable to put it on a train.</p>

ps:There are many more nuances, i can ellaborate if someone is interested</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Turbines are more efficient at max power, whereas diesel/diesel-electrics are more efficient at max load.  Trains require that performance at max load, as it takes significant torque to get that train moving; not exactly the right use for a turbine.</p></div>		</li>
