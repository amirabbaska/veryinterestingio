			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is exactly what it's detecting.</p>
<p>All matter emits light based off of its temperature.  This is called 'blackbody radiation' if you want to look it up.  The hotter the temperature, the higher the frequency of light being emitted.  Keep in mind that this isn't a single specific frequency but a distribution of frequencies that looks like a hump centered around a particular frequency - but it's the same distribution for all matter at a given temperature.</p>
<p>At room temperature, human body temperature, etc, the light being emitted is mostly infrared and virtually zero visible light is being emitted.  However, when things become hotter the light emitted can creep up into the visual spectrum.</p>
<p>This is why super-hot metal <em>glows</em>.  That brilliant cherry-red glow is the blackbody radiation from objects at around 900C.</p>
<p>This same effect is also where things like campfires get their light and color.  The fuel particles pyrolized (vaporized) off of the wood from the extreme heat flow upwards, since in the middle of the fire there's no oxygen to burn with.  As it ascends it gets heated up until it glows that red/yellow color, until it finally reaches the boundary of the flame where there's oxygen again, and it burns.  Note that while campfires are hot enough to emit visible light, they're still emitting far more infrared light than visible light.  Same goes for incandescent bulbs, which produce light by super-heating a tungsten filament.  That's why you feel the heat on your face.  And why an LED light can be just as bright as either of those, but not feel hot at all - because the LED light isn't emitting tons of infrared.  Just an equivalent amount of visible light, which really isn't that much energy and so doesn't 'feel' warm.</p>
<p>This is also why, when things like metal get really hot, they glow white instead of say, ~~ green~~ <em>blue</em>.  Because as the thing gets hotter and hotter, it'll start emitting yellow and green light, but it will still be emitting <em>tons</em> of red light.  So it looks white to us.  The only way to get something to glow <del>green</del> <em>blue</em> would be to make it so hot that the center of the distribution is shifted beyond the visible spectrum.  There it would emit almost entirely UV light, a little bit of blue, and no red.  Technically it will still be emitting more red and blue than ever before, as the total light emitted at all frequencies increases with temperatures, but the <em>ratio</em> will be distinctly blue.</p>
<p>Though God help you if you look at anything bright and hot enough to be emitting concentrated cancer-light.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> - that's what I get for typing things up when I'm tired.  I should have used a blue-glowing material as an example, not green.  Blue will always dominate over green as you shift the spectrum that way, so you're never going to get a 'green' looking distribution from BB radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also why color temperature of lights is measured in K. That is the temperature in kelvin that something would have to be to emit that color of light. So a 5700k light is the same as if something were just 5700k or 5426.85 degrees celsius.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no way to get something to glow green, because by the time you get it hot enough, the dominant color is now blue. The black-body spectrum is so wide in the visible range that no matter the temperature <a href="http://www.techmind.org/colour/blackbodyglowinfinity.png" target="_blank">it will never look green</a>. To get something that looks green you need a narrow peak of light in the green wavelengths, and there is just no way to get that from black-body radiation. This is why nothing ever glows green from heat alone, to get that you need some kind of chemical reaction that produces or filters light (e.g. burning certain materials).</p>
<p>For basically the same reason, nothing ever glows bluer than a faded bluish-white, like the above graphic shows. As you increase the temperature, the peak and most of the energy will be in the ultraviolet (that we can't see), but the spectrum will always extend into the visible range, with a distribution of energy that looks that color to us. It doesn't get any steeper towards blue as you increase temperature. It'll cook you with UV light or X-rays, but the color in the visible part of the spectrum will still be a faded blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to the comment above, the reason why humans would look like they freeze in space without protection is because of the pressure differential. You know of the changing boiling temperature of water as you increase in altitude (ie decrease airpressure)? Well with the vacuum of space, any liquid would boulder and evaporate instantly similar to how things like gasoline evaporates off your hand. Even though it is boiling away, it feels cold because it's pulling out your heat energy to change from a liquid into a gas. Now amplify this with the amount of liquid we have on our body surface and the fact that all of it would evaporate almost instantaneously due to the extreme low pressure, you get more or less frozen by your own spit, snot, sweat and anything else that in exposed to the vacuum. Your blood boils too but is conveniently packaged in a skinbag.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of.  The electromagnetic spectrum is <a href="https://www.miniphysics.com/electromagnetic-spectrum_25.html" target="_blank">huge</a> and the frequency depends on temperature.  You don't need an infrared camera to see that something is cherry red (about 3000 degrees K) or is white hot (about 6000 degrees K). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hard vacuum boils every single wet surface in contact with the outside (lungs, stomach, mouth, skin, you name it), and liquids absorb heat when evaporating, which has a much bigger effect on cooling a body that is exposed to the vacuum  of space</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking the same thing, but this option never seems to get any traction.</p>
<p>I wonder what the ratio of heat loss from radiation to vaporization is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oh vaporization is definitely the biggest cause</p>
<p>Radiation is only significant when past the red-hot section of &quot;hot&quot;</p>
<p>otherwise convection is several orders of magnitude more important as a heat transfer medium</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vaporization will be really quick, so it's hard to talk about &quot;ratio&quot; - the total lost won't be big, but locally, over where the water is, a lot will be lost fast. You won't appreciate your lungs and eyes freezing over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have roughly the right idea, but it’s filled with misinformation.</p>
<p>There are three basic forms of heat transfer: Conduction, convection, and radiation. </p>
<p>However, there are other forms of heat transfer, one of those is called evaporative cooling. I’ll get to that in a bit.</p>
<p>The instance you mentioned (cold air contacting skin) would actually be considered convection, as heat is being transferred from a body to a moving fluid. Conduction would be more analogous to someone touching a hot stove.</p>
<p>In space, heat can be transferred in two important ways. If a human body does not have a protective barrier on, it is true it will experience radiative cooling. However, this would not be considered black body radiation, because the human body is reflective and likes to emit some wavelengths more than others. The most deadly form of cooling would be evaporative cooling, however. Since space is a vacuum, moisture from your body (skin, eyes, mouth, soft tissues) would immediately boil in the low pressure and evaporate off of you. Evaporative cooling draws energy off of your body due to the fact that matter requires extra energy to vaporize, even after reaching the boiling point. This is known as “latent heat of vaporization.” This same process is how sweating cools you down.</p>
<p>Assuming we’re only talking about dying via heat transfer, it would take a lot longer than you would think to freeze to death in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may not be the best person to answer this, because I have no background in human physiology (my background is Mechanical Engineering), but I would assume that you would die of other causes first. Since evaporative and radiative cooling are relatively slow processes, in terms of depleting bodily energy, that likely wouldn’t kill you very quickly. Ironically, you might likely die from absorbing too much energy (gamma radiation) before you die of heat transfer off the body. Your body would absorb A LOT of dangerous cosmic radiation. However, I think the likely answer is a process known as “Ebullism.” This happens when gas bubbles form within the fluids inside your body. The expansion of gasses will damage your cells everywhere and lead to stroke, paralysis, and death.</p></div>		</li>
