			<div class="markdown"><p>There are 13 official root name servers and quite a few more official ones using different protocol spread all over the world (~600+), so it would take a large scale coordinated attack to disable all of them, not to mention most isp modems/routers come configured with your isps dns servers, so backups over backups and you can configure your system to use either googles or opendns servers :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the early days, when my DNS routinely went down, I would keep a list of IP addresses of my favorite sites so I could just skip the DNS in a pinch. I would feel like such a failure now if there ever were a global DNS outage.</p>
<p>Edit:
TIL: Google's <em>DNS</em> IP address is 8.8.8.8. That's like the Internet's 1-800 number. Too bad it doesn't work to connect to. The following are Google's address ranges. Good luck figuring out which one(s) it's using at any given moment. Apparently they change based on demand and server algorithms.</p>
<pre><code>64.68.90.1 - 64.68.90.255
64.233.173.193 - 64.233.173.255
66.249.64.1 - 66.249.79.255
216.239.33.96 - 216.239.59.128</code></pre></div>		</li>
