			<div class="markdown"><p>TempurPedic is a good theory but it's absolute shit for anyone who shifts a bit while sleeping or while getting comfortable.  The foam softens against your body heat and when you shift around it leaves an imprint that takes several minutes to fluff back up.  Like if you laid in wet concrete and then let it dry, and tried to lay in it again in any position but the <em>exact</em> one that made the imprint.  It wakes you up anytime you move because you can feel the edge and slope of the imprint where you were a minute ago.</p>
<p>TL;DR Fuck you, Tempur Pedic.</p></div>		</li>

Some types of Tempur rebound faster, BUT not everyone loves them. That's usually when I used to transfer people to a hybrid mattress. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some wicked hard Tempurs that I don't like at all, but it usually takes about 2 weeks for your body to adjust to a mattress. There are softer versions (seriously like clouds) that are better but you still could be sore. I was when I first got mine. </p></div>		</li>
