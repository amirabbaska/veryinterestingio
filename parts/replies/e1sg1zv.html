			<div class="markdown"><p>There's two ways to approach tensors; I don't know which historically came first. This is best explained by just concentrating on one particular case: a bi-linear form T from two-dimensional space R^2 to R. Let's look at this in the context of the two methods:</p>
<p>1 ) The coordinate free approach that is more popular with pure mathematicians (at least whenever it more convenient, I'll comment on this later). Simply put T is a transformation from R^2 x R^2 to R that is linear in each term; that is for T(x, y), if you freeze y and consider it as a function x -&gt; T(x, y) then it is linear. Similarly for freezing x and y -&gt; T(x, y).</p>
<p>The important point here is that what a tensor is doesn't depend on an arrangement of numbers, i.e. it is more than just a matrix. A matrix by itself isn't a tensor; a matrix commonly represents something in a particular coordinate system, such as a linear map or a quadratic function. What you want it to represent depends on the context. A tensor is an idea that exists outside a particular choice of coordinate system, so it more than just a single matrix. This is best understood by method 2.</p>
<p>2 ) The coordinate approach (or also referred to as the index approach). In this case the tensor (for our case) is a family of matrices for every conceivable coordinate system (where the matrices could change from point to point). Now the members of this family don't exist independently of one another. There are special rules for how members from different coordinate systems are related depending on the change of coordinates transformation.</p>
<p>The important thing to take take away from this, at least from a geometric point of view, is that a tensor contains geometric information, which is more than just a single matrix. There are many texts for engineers and scientists that get this wrong, they like to claim that a tensor is like a vector with more indices, such as a matrix. Their problem is leaving out the coordinate change behavior. For example, the matrix of second derivatives of a function is NOT a tensor; its components don't transform by the right rules when you change coordinates.</p>
<p>Now, when is method 2 popular with pure mathematicians? In geometric analysis, when you look at partial differential equations involving geometry, it is sometimes helpful to not hide the index details. For example, in Ricci Flow calculations the Riemannian metric is changing. Index free notation tends to hide the Riemmanian metric and it is easy to make a mistake if you work in a purely index free format.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 version:</p>
<p><strong>Vector space:</strong> (very) generalized version of 3d space. Slightly more in depth, when you learn about vectors the first kind you deal with are very similar to coordinates for locations in space. Then you tinker with the number of dimensions, then you tinker with the the numbers the coordinates themselves can use, then you do so kinds of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Products of vector spaces:</strong> vector spaces combined in a particular way (such as combining the x axis and y axis to make the xy plane).</p>
<p><strong>Duals of vector spaces:</strong> I got nuthin, on the ELI5 level at least. Sorry. Think of them like vector spaces' evil twins maybe? If you're familiar with matrices, if you wrote your original vectors as rows, the dual space vectors would be columns, so that when they multiply you get single numbers. Generalize the crap out of that to get dual spaces. </p>
<p><strong>Multilinear Map:</strong> Map - function. Linear - f(a+b) =f(a + b). Multilinear - that works component wise. </p></div>		</li>
