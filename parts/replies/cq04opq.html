			<div class="markdown"><p>A dirty bomb is a <em>lot</em> easier to make than a real nuke, and making a miniaturized nuke is even harder than that. And that's talking about something small enough to be a missile payload - something a guy can carry in a briefcase is even beyond that in miniaturization. </p>
<p>The North Korean nuclear tests were likely large, immobile devices and even those fizzled - poor yield. They would have made a bigger explosion if they knew how. The secret sauce in nuclear weapons design is all the tricks about getting a good yield, and there's a lot more to it than the basic design type. What are those secrets? Dunno man, they're secrets. But clearly North Korea doesn't know them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_North_Korean_nuclear_test" target="_blank">The first North Korean test was probably a fizzle</a>, but is there any evidence that the later ones <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizzle_%28nuclear_test%29" target="_blank">fizzled</a>? The yields are a bit uncertain, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_North_Korean_nuclear_test" target="_blank">last test</a> was probably about half the yield of the Hiroshima bomb - about the same size as India's first test. Unless the bomb was very large, that doesn't qualify as &quot;grossly failing to meet expected yield&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That was with 50s era technology. It wouldn't be too difficult to scale down.</p></div>		</li>
