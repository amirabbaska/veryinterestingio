			<div class="markdown"><p>Its about cashflow management and the fact that gas stations purchase and store their gasoline causing prices to change between the station's purchase and its sale to you the consumer.</p>
<p>Let's assume that you have a 1,000 gallon tank at your gas station. On January 1 it cost you $1,000 to fill that tank and you expect it to last until January 30 before it needs to be filled again.</p>
<p>On January 15, the cost to fill that 1,000 gallon tank rises to $2,000. You have 500 gallons left in your tank. If you sell those 500 gallons at the price that you bought them at, you will not have sufficient cashflow to purchase 1,000 gallons on January 30. You must increase your prices immediately so that when January 31 rolls around, your previous 1,000 gallons will hopefully have generated enough cash flow to enable you to buy 1,000 gallons at the new price. Yes, it will be short, but it will be closer than it would have been if they had simply sold the remaining 500 gallons at the original price.</p>
<p>Let's go the other way. On January 15, the cost to fill that 1,000 gallon tank falls to $500. You have 500 gallons left in your tank. If you sell those 500 gallons at the price that you bought them at, you will have extra cash flow on January 30 and you will have more profits. That's good. If you sell those 500 gallons at the price that you will pay on January 30, you will be selling the 500 gallons at a loss, which is bad. Prices will go down only as demand at that station goes down (i.e. price competition). </p>
<p>To summarize: When prices are rising stations must increase prices at the pump to generate enough cash flow to purchase more gas later at the higher price. When prices are falling stations do not decrease prices to avoid selling their previously purchased gas at a loss. Outside pressure such as competition will drive their prices down, but that is obviously slower the opposite phenomenon of rising prices. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a totally absurd explanation for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most gas station owners have the cash flow to pay for gas at any price, they're not filling their tanks paycheck-to-paycheck. That is to say, they're not forced to raise prices</li>
<li>If raising prices would make the gas station owner more money, s/he would do it regardless of the price of the supply. That is to say, your scenario isn't a good explanation for why the owner would want to raise prices</li>
<li>If the issue was just the lag time between tank full-ups, any station that was filled weekly would already show lower prices from their most recent fill</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His explanation is only absurd if it's posed as the only reason for this imbalanced elasticity. He barely glossed over at the end why pressure is unequal in both directions. There is tremendous pressure to increase prices when crude goes up because competition is not w factor, and very little pressure when prices go down since competition plays an effect but it's far from a perfect market. People like to pretend they'll shop around for gas but most of the time they'll pay an extra $1 to fill a tank in a more expensive station because it's conveniently placed. </p>
<p>So, when crude goes up, stations react individually, but when crude goes down, stations react in competition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they probably do have the cash to compensate for whatever losses they may incur by not raising prices in response to raising oil prices .. but it is a business. Why would they be ok with doing nothing and losing profit when it's possible to raise the price up and break even or better? If they followed that model, they would quickly be out of business. As for the second point, yes the owner would always want to price their gas very high, that's logical. However, there are gas stations every few blocks. When there is competition trying to undercut you and even a few cents/gallon will attract many people, there's no long term benefit in having the highest prices because you will soon go out of business. Third. All these points are related. There is a fine balance of making enough profit to continue business while undercutting your competition. Gas stations will sometimes even get into price wars, where close stations will continually drop their prices throughout the day because even 1 cent lower than your competition will gain you many customers. So it is not <em>only</em> the lag time, though that does help to explain some of it. But really it's just the business, what the customers expect and accept when going to the pump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also allows the station to slightly undercut any other station in the area already selling more expensive fuel and drive traffic to their store for inside sales (drinks, snacks, oil, any attached restaurant concept, etc) which is where they make most of their money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are a lot of factors (local competition being another one), if the stocked oil was expensive it will be sold so, if the prices are rising even cheap oil might be sold at higher prices, if demand is high (weekends, holidays, start of vacation time) prices rise and so on, same goes to a lesser extend for dropping prices, prices drop before elections and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct. </p>
<p>Source: Worked at a gas station. Price per gallon was estimated cost to refill the big tank. There's also very little profit margin. Most places use cheap gas as a loss leader.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People are selfish assholes? Price of a gallon of gas is not based on the cost of oil. It's based on supply and demand. The price wouldn't drop a dime if companies knew that people would still buy the same amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true at all. There is so much competition in the oil market, businesses only make 3-5 cents per gallon sold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would actually be surprised - the price that gas stations pay for gas to buy it from oil refineries is one of the lowest margin price structures in the modern economy. A typical well-run refinery makes, at most, 2-4 cents per gallon.</p>
<p>At the gas station, obviously markups vary. But many stations hold the price down to drive traffic into the store.</p>
<p>Gas is a very, very low margin business once the crude hits the refineries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's a perception, but may not be true. I'll guess confirmation bias and cynicism.</p>
<p>When you <a href="http://statsciolist.blogspot.ca/2015/03/petrol-price-exploration.html" target="_blank">look at the data</a> it appears that changes do happen in high correlation, perhaps with a lag of about 3 weeks -- which makes sense as price changes of supply need to work their way through the process to market delivery.</p>
<p>Now as to whether they correlate more highly on upward slopes than downward slopes isn't exactly answered here, and is more or less the question left at the end of this analysis.</p>
<p>It's certainly possible, and even for non-cynical reasons. Dynamic behaviour of systems (particularly non-linear) is an interesting topic I did a lot of research on in my Masters and PhD. Take speculative markets, from stocks to baseball cards to tulip bulbs. As values rise, people may be hesitant to jump on board since we have no reason to believe it will continue to rise, but it seems to be doing so. It rises incrementally as we watch for stability. But, if the value starts falling we tend to race to dump it as quickly as possible, thus creating the self-fulfilling prophecy of a tanking value. Speculative bubbles tend to build slowly but drop quickly. </p>
<p>Some sort of similar dynamics <em>could</em> be at play with oil vs gasoline prices. But I don't see the data suggesting there's even an issue. The point is that the price of crude and pump prices for gasoline do appear to behave in a way we'd expect, including a lag.</p>
<p>It's hard to answer a perception question. If you had hard data to quantify what you are talking about, that would be something addressable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you buy gas wholesale for $1, and sell it for a $1.50, then gas goes up to 1.10 wholesale, you're going to increase the price of what you have on hand so that you have the same profit margin when you have to replenish your supply.  You'll also tack on more to the retail price to guard against future increases in price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that took you about 3 hours to raise the price.  When the value drops by half it takes 6 months for prices to reflect that, there is no corresponding 'lowered the price cause we already guarded against an eventuality where oil was more expansive'  maintaining profit margins don't drive business, profit seeking does</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the same example above, if the price falls to $0.90 you may lower your price a bit. Market pressures will try and get you to lower the price but concern for further price changes plus the profit motive fight back against that.</p>
<p>Also, &quot;loss avoidance&quot; drives business too. Does the entirety of the reddit user base not know that Profits <em>and losses</em> exist?</p></div>		</li>
