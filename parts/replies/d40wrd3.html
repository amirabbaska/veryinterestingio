			<div class="markdown"><p>There's more to it than just differences in absorption.</p>
<p>First, insulation is mostly provided by dead air space within the fabric. Cotton not only absorbs a lot of water, but the fibers expand to take in that water. This fills in all of the gaps in the fabric, pushing out all of the dead air space. Wool fibers are stiff and sort of kinked up, and because of the outer shell they retain that form even when wet. The inner core of a wool fiber still absorbs water, but it doesn't expand much past its original size, so there's still dead air trapped between the fibers, which provides a great deal of insulation. The fact that the water is trapped <em>within</em> the fiber also keeps wool from feeling wet against your skin, even when it's soaked</p>
<p>Second, wool actually dries <em>more slowly</em> than either cotton or synthetics. Now, you might object and say that a soaked wool shirt will dry more quickly than a cotton shirt, and you'd be rightâ€”but that's because the cotton shirt absorbed a lot more water in the first place. The water that wool <em>does</em> absorb takes a while to evaporate, because it's stored in the core of the fiber. It has to get past that scaly coating.</p>
<p>This is actually a good thing. Synthetics dry very quickly, but as they dry the evaporation pulls heat away from your body (just like when you sweat). If you wear a soaked synthetic shirt in a cool breeze, you'll get very cold very quickly. This is called the &quot;flash-off&quot; effect. Thankfully, since synthetics don't absorb much water, they'll be dry quickly and you can start warming back up (cotton, not so much). </p>
<p>Wool keeps you &quot;warm when wet&quot; by <em>retaining</em> its water. Because it dries more slowly, the flash-off effect is less pronounced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish this was at the top.  Cotton can actually be a very good fiber for clothing in dry weather.  The pronounced evaporative cooling effect can be a good thing when keeping you cool--but only so far, as a soaked shirt will continue to cool you until cold.</p>
<p>I find wool to bee the same--because it absorbs so much water, after high-output activities, it will cool me too much (maybe because I sweat a lot) when I'm no longer creating heat.  This might be less pronounced when in a high-humidity environment.  However, the downside to that is heavy fabric.</p>
<p>Synthetics are better for high-output activities in all weather if you ask me.  During high output, there is little absorbtion, plenty of cooling effects from evaporation, and soon after completing high-output activities the residual heat dries out the fabric before you cool down too much.</p>
<p>I love wool--it breathes very well (knit).  However, I no longer wear it on my top (shirt, headwear) during activity.  When I'm lounging around or just walking somewhere, wool feels great.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question because it highlights one of the advantages of wool.</p>
<p>You saw <a href="http://www.terralana.co.nz/images/woolfibrexsection-fade.jpg" target="_blank">this cross section of a wool fibre</a> where I mentioned the scaly outer layer that repels water. On the other hand, the inner &quot;core&quot; of the fibre can absorb water quite well. This means that the water vapour from your sweaty feet can gradually be absorbed into the core of the wool (it gets in through gaps in the scales) while the outer layer remains fairly dry. This makes the fabric feel &quot;dry&quot; despite actually containing a significant amount of water.</p>
<p>Compare this to synthetics which are <a href="http://66.media.tumblr.com/9e52b51e6f606361b5c20503f9024ab5/tumblr_mqqfpw4Ecs1qkssp4o1_1280.gif" target="_blank">basically solid tubes of plastic</a>. They can't really absorb any water at all, so all the water from your sweat is forced to coat the surface of the fabric which feels &quot;wet&quot;.</p>
<p>Cotton is similar to wool (since it can soak up water) but wool has more favourable comfort characteristics because of the outer coating (I am a wool sock fanboy).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about all the new &quot;performance wool&quot; garments that are being marketed? For instance, I've heard a recommendation for merino wool socks for working well at both hot and cold environments.</p>
<p>How is merino wool a jack of all trades as far as keeping your feet cool and dry in a hot climate or warm in a cold climate? Or is it being a wool blend with a synthetic fiber have something to do with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been slowly replacing all my socks with merino wool socks from Darn Tough. They are expensive, but it's been darn near one of the best decisions I have ever made. My feet have never been more comfortable.</p>
<p>Boxers were my big upgrade last year. I switched out all my cheap cotton 10-to-a-pack hanes/fruit of the loom wal-mart specials with high quality Ex-Officio Give-n-Go Sport Mesh with a 9&quot; in-seam. Also up in the running for the best decisions I've ever made. Once again expensive, but no more swamp-ass or sweaty balls, no more chaffing, everything just stays cooler, and it is so much more comfortable, with the 9&quot; in-seam they are long enough that they get enough friction against your legs that they never ride up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I worked labor I had to survive -40 and +49 weather for 12 hour shifts. I always wore nylon socks underneath and wool socks ok top. In the summer the wool wicked the sweat out of the nylon and my feet stayed cool and dry. In the winter they retained my foots heat and stayed warm. It wasn't until I started wearing dress socks and leather shoes that my feet started to get a bit swampy. </p>
<p>TLDR: nylon under and wool over is best </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. To answer the second question, wool wicks moisture away from your skin, allowing it to evaporate from your body heat while not being wet against your body. I wear wool socks most of the time (thin ones in the summer).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting when you consider the source of the two materials. Cotton holds water to help germinate and nourish seeds, wool repels to keep the animal underneath dry. Pretty obvious, but I've never looked at it in that context before.</p></div>		</li>
