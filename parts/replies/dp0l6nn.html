			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm more like a tank with an in flow and out flow. it has no control over how much is flowing in. Not without the addition of a pump (pulling in more radiation). It can reduce the size of the outlet though (get better at absorbing radiation without it travelling on). </p></div>		</li>
