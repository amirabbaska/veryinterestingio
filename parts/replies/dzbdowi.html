			<div class="markdown"><p>It should also be noted that not finding multiple fossils of the same dinosaur in the same place isn't necessarily an indicator against social behavior - the circumstances required for fossilization to occur are fairly narrow, specific, and rare.  So the fossils we have represent an infinitesimally small sampling of the flora and fauna that actually existed in any given time period.  </p>
<p>E.g., one such set of conditions would be that the animal died near the bank of a fairly stagnant lake with deep enough silt that it's body sunk into it without being eaten by other scavengers, and that lake later dries up and those deeper sediment layers are compressed to rock, allowing the body to decompose in place and be slowly supplanted with inorganic minerals without fully breaking down structurally.  If T. rexes rarely hunted near such lakes, then the fossils we have could mostly represent a narrow swath of stragglers who lost their packs and couldn't manage to hunt alone and died of starvation in the most convenient places possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying is we could just have fossils of all the scrawny weakling T-rexes who couldn't hunt very well?</p>
<p>Also, does that mean we've found a lot more fossils of dinosaurs or other creatures that lived in/around deep lakes?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im sure someone knows all this and I am just thinking, having no knowledge about this, but I wonder if because they theorize birds are descendents of dinosaurs, would it be crazy to suggest the t-rex migrated to mate during a season like we see some birds here do?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of the world's bird species do not migrate. It's only <a href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/natures-home-magazine/birds-and-wildlife-articles/migration/which-birds-migrate/" target="_blank">about 40% that do</a>.</p>
<p>It's certainly a possibility, but remember that amphibians, insects, fish, jellyfish, mammals, and reptiles migrate, so in that regard there is nothing more special about birds migrating than any other group of animals doing so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>40% is a very large portion of the whole, much larger than I expected it to be.  I would assume this includes species that relatively short migration distances, but it’s still a huge amount.  If you consider that in colder climates the percentage of migrating species is probably higher, as well as the higher species diversity you see in tropical climates it seems much more significant.  </p>
<p>But as you said this also makes it less remarkable, but it’s still important information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a heads up, Avians are not &quot;descended from&quot; dinosaurs, they are classified as actual living dinosaurs. They (and their sister clade Crocodilae) are the only clades that survived.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: completely forgot about Crocodilae, credit goes to /u/Bigluce for the astute reminder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Modern day actual living dinosaurs are descended from pre-meteor dinosaurs though, so its still true. </p>
<p>Fudging around the definition of what a dinosaur is is more confusing than clarifying. (unless African Greys are descended from Giant African Greys that hunted stegosaurus.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this is a stupid question, But let's say that dinosaurs were around right up until humans, like they all died out and then humans came along a few years later. Would it be easier to figure this stuff out if it wasn't as long ago, or is it just the simple fact that none were alive when people could have recorded history about them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well sabre tooth tigers were around at the same time as humans and we don’t know everything about them. Sperm whales exist today and it’s only relatively recently that we discovered that they hunt freaking giant squids that live in the absolute darkness of the deep sea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be easier because we'd have more evidence left behind. Dinosaur fossils had to somehow make it through millions of years before we could find and study them. If they needed to only survive a few thousand, I'd expect we'd have a lot more dinosaur fossils to study.</p>
<p>But we still wouldn't know <em>that</em> much more than we do now. It just might be easier to find evidence in your scenario.</p></div>		</li>
