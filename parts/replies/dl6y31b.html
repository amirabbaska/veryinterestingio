<p>No, not really. Most people didn't -- and still don't, for that matter -- have the kind of disposable income that would allow them to do that.</p>
<p>As late as the 1970s, the BBC was routinely wiping master tapes of shows, many of which had been broadcast exactly once, because they didn't think anyone would ever want to watch them a second time. That's why, for example, so many 1960s episodes of even massively popular shows like <em>Doctor Who</em> are simply missing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also wiped masters of television shows because that master film was expensive as hell, the BBC is publicly-funded, and you could re-write over the top of existing shows as many as ten or so times before the tape became unusable. It wasn't just that they didn't think people would want to watch it again, it was fairly cost-effective in a time when Thatcher was actively trying to tear the BBC apart.</p></div>		</li>
