</blockquote>
<p>Well, I can't speak to your sanity, but no, it is not an attempt at suffocating you.  In fact, some think it is the other way around.  One nostril gets closed down so that the cilia can sweep away dust particles and stuff.  Extra mucus gets produced to aid this process.  After a couple of hours that nostril is clear and is re-opened.  Then the other one gets shut down for maintenance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God I hope this gets elaborated. I'm in the same boat as you. Was talking to my SO the other day and mentioned how I can only breathe out of one nostril at a time, thinking it was normal. She told me that she can clearly breathe out of both and now I feel like a mutant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically, these are the <em>circadian</em> rhythms. (I believe from Latin, <em>circa</em> around, <em>dia</em> the day): <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circadian_rhythm</a></p>
<p>The daily rhythm is broken into 90 minute cycles in mammals. You can measure this. Take your temperature with a decent thermometer every 10-15 minutes for a few hours and you'll see it go up and down within a normal range. </p>
<p>The temperature you measure will be tied to how alert or tired you feel. If you are under-slept, you will feel a wave of tiredness hit as your body temperature falls into the low end of the cycle. Then after 20-30 minutes, you might start to rally.</p>
<p>If you want to be a scientist, you can do a blind study by taking a friend's temperature, recording it without telling him, and then asking him to rate his energy level.</p>
<p>You can do a double-blind study by taking his temperature, not looking at the result, but passing the thermometer to somebody outside the room to read. Then ask your friend how he feels and recording that separately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to psychedelics, but it is noticeable to those of us who suffer from allergies.  We will often be breathing through one nostril while the other is plugged with snot, or is dripping like a faucet.  A few hours later it will be the other side that's plugged with snot while the other is clear again.</p></div>		</li>
