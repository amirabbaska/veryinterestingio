			<div class="markdown"><p>GE has a technology called “Trigain” that really makes reds pop. I don’t know if it comes in a portable, user friendly fixture (as opposed to like strip lights and highways) but damn, it would be great for filming something bloody. It’s like watching someone turn the red on when you flick the switch.</p>
<p>Edit: responding to your mention of why certain LEDs have weaker CRI’s. Also, some LEDs just have lower kelvin, but you would want something adjustable.</p></div>		</li>
