			<div class="markdown"><p>Myself and both of my sons do this, while my wife had never even heard of it. She never believed me about it when I told her I did it, but once they were born, she was blown away and became a believer when she realized our newborn was sneezing every time he was moved into the sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reflex may be autosomal dominant. Every person gets one set of genes from each parent. This means that your wife's two sets of DNA inherited from her parents both contain the recessive gene because she does not have the effect. You may be dominant/recessive if you have another child without the effect but since both of your sons have it, you could also be dominant/dominant. Both your sons with the reflex will be dominant/recessive for this trait due to your wife.</p>
<p>Since it's an easily observable effect, you may be able to track it in your family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was about to write a nearly-identical post! My wife thought I was crazy until the same thing started happening to our son. I've had many other people in the past tell me that they've never heard of it, either. I find myself wearing sunglasses whenever it's remotely light out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that I saw, I believe in the wiki, was that there was a theory that photic sneeze reflex developed as a beneficial evolutionary trait when our ancestors would be living in wet, dirty caves, so that when the left and walked out into the sun they would sneeze and propel microbes and stuff from their nose. Just mentioning this cause it was kind of a cool theory.</p></div>		</li>
