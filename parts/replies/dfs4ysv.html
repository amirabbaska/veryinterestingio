			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually is a concern about gene therapy (making sure you change the right thing)! The caveat here is that if we're looking at overlapping open reading frames, they mainly exist in mitochondria, prokaryotic, and viral genomes. In prokaryotes, it is unlikely that the CRISPR areas would have any overlapping open reading frames, given that the CRISPR areas take parts of viral DNA into the genome in order for interference, therefore they are designed to be edited. That level of variability makes it unlikely that such a fine-tuned system like overlapping open reading frames would be in that area. </p>
<p>Fortunately, we don't quite have to worry about overlapping open reading frames in mammals since we don't use them! We do have to make sure we know precisely what we need to change and where though.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I'm not up-to-date on the latest methods of gene therapy, but if we're looking at methods like adenoviral therapy, IIRC the gene that you're inserting doesn't even integrate into the genome. What happens is that the viral vector (with the gene of interest integrated into the viral genome and the &quot;virulence&quot; genes often edited out) delivers the therapeutic gene to a cell, which produces proteins from that therapeutic gene that are needed. </p>
<p>Interestingly, improper genetic integration is a concern in labs as well. If you have a particular plasmid into which you're trying to insert a specific gene, you'll often use a reporter system to ensure proper genetic integration. In this sort of system, you may make sure that you're integrating a gene into a recombinant site (a place where the genes can overlap and swap). To ensure proper integration, you'll make a gene that looks like this</p>
<p>------x--gene--neo^r ---x----reporter2---</p>
<p>Here, the x stands for a recombinant site, where the genomes can overlap and swap. gene stands for the gene of interest, neo^r stands for neomycin resistance, and reporter2 is a gene that codes for a protein that makes something that kills the cell when exposed to medium with reporter2 trigger.</p>
<p>When trying to put this gene into a plasmid (that you later put into a bacterial or yeast cell culture), one of 3 things may occur. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nothing happens</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recombination occurs only at the x sites (what we want)</p>
</li>
<li>The whole illustrated gene gets stuffed into the plasmid somewhere</li>
</ol>
<p>To test this, once we have put the modified plasmid (we don't know which of the 3 happened yet) into a cell culture, we can plate it on culture with neomycin (an antibiotic) and reporter2 trigger. Here's what happens to each of the 3 options (respectively)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>No cells grow. Because the gene of interest was not integrated into the plasmid at all, the plasmid does not give the cell it's in neomycin resistance, thus it doesn't grow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cells grow! The cells have a plasmid that is resistant to neomycin, but they don't have reporter2 in them, which means that the genes swapped in the right way! This is good.</p>
</li>
<li>No cells grow. While the cell has neomycin resistance from the gene, it also has reporter2, whose protein product interacts with the reporter2 trigger and kills the cell. </li>
</ol>
<p>You can see how many different steps we have to use for experimentation on a plasmid, now imagine how many you have to use for a human genome! </p>
<p>Another issue with gene therapy in the human genome (aside from ethics) is that AFAIK we don't have something like a CRISPR area, where we could &quot;easily&quot; insert therapeutic genes.</p>
<p>If you're unclear on any of these points or would like for me to expand on anything here, feel free to reply to this post. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's the closest to what OP is asking about. While there isn't anything precisely like .zip files (from my understanding it means a repeat of data is encoded as a specific number, that repeat is indexed in a legend--like a map's legend--then the data is replaced with that number) in DNA as far as I know, these are methods for improving genetic economy (reducing genome size to be as efficient as possible). I'm not even sure I'd precisely call it reuse, because while the DNA in question is being used multiple times different things can be done to it every time, but that's semantics at that point. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this splitting hairs a bit?  Reusing a sequence keeps the total length down and allows more than one product.  </p>
<p>While the primary sequence information is reused, the rest of the protein-level information from that sequence may be novel.  So this compresses some info, just not the DNA level info.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes I think it just depends on what your scope is. </p>
<p>If you consider just one of the gene products e.g. protein A, then none of the redundancy in A's gene sequence is reduced by implementing overlapping reading frames. </p>
<p>But if you expand your scope to include 3 products of a given length (A,B,C), then certainly overlapping reading frames can triple your ratio of data:output compared to the alternative of using separate sequences for each protein.</p>
<p>But there is a catch which is that the overlapping genes have to be compatible with one another, and I assume that in most cases this actually requires some amount of mutual conformation between the overlapping sequences. </p>
<p>Which brings up the question: how do overlapping genes evolve?</p></div>		</li>
