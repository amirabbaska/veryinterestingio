			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm in no way a Marine biologist, but a quick google around shows that sperm whales, at least, will do one long deep dive (up to 1400m/4000' deep) followed by a whole series of shallow dives and/or sitting at the surface. To me that indicates that they're allowing a recharge of their tissues.</p></div>		</li>
