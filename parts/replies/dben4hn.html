			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you! But I really have no choice. I work from home, so every day is a constant battle between self discipline and Netflix. It also doesn't hurt that my SO is an even bigger movie fan than I am. When we first started dating he'd occasionally pull out some obscure movie and say something like, &quot;Oh, you've never heard of Terry Gilliam? Please allow me to BLOW YOUR MIND.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
