			<div class="markdown"><p>When UV light hits oxygen (O2) in the upper atmosphere, it splits into two separate oxygen molecules. So you've got a bunch of O floating around. If the O hits another O, you get O2 (oxygen) again, but if an O hits an O2, then you get O3 â€“ ozone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I study air quality. Now who wants to hear about ozone formation?!?!? Anyone?</p>

<p>I do, I do!</p>
<p>I do not deny climate change whatsoever. I just think that the topic should be presented to the public much more as negatively affecting the air we breath than altering the global temperature. This is not because the temperature effects should be lessened, but because preying on the direct health effects for themselves and their kids is a far easier sell. </p>
<p>Is there data enough to talk about the effects such air quality has on people? Certainly in Beijing (where people can likely chew their air) it's an obvious point to make. But how about for us in the rest of the planet?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the two are caused by different emissions.  We actually already <em>did</em> fight that battle, and air quality in North America and Europe is much improved (though obviously more can, and is, being done). </p>
<p>As you say though, that was a much easier sell - the effects are more direct and you can generally see the problem directly.  Also, most of those pollutants are easier to filter at the point of emission than CO2.  (Being able to export a large amount of those emissions to China has helped - the effects also tend to be more local than CO2).  </p>
<p>Tackling the global warming issue is going to be a much bigger pain to deal with, which is a large reason <em>why</em> so many don't even want to believe in it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Fully agree with this statement. Had an excellent professor who helped shift this perspective for me. People rarely care about environmental issues because things like economic stability or job security are more pressing and immediate problems in their lives. But the rippling effects of climate change already negatively impact people's health and quality of life (which in turn can affect their ability to work). </p>
<p>Environmentalism could benefit from a shift of focus. Convince folks that it's in their best interest to keep our air and water clean for THEM, not just the little critters and plants. Show people how pollution directly damages theirs and their children's health. I already love trees and endemic tortoises and all that, I don't need to be convinced. Getting the other portion of the population to come around will take some more strategic tactics.</p></div>		</li>
