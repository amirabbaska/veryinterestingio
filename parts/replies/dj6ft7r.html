			<div class="markdown"><p>When I started to take dance lessons and learn about music, I would count out the beat in my head in order to keep time. </p>
<p>By the end of a particularâ€‹ly intense weekend dance conference I could have a conversation while still counting the beat internally. While driving home, I was two songs in on the radio before I realized that I was still doing it. I finally had to turn the radio off in order to stop. </p>
<p>The mind can do strange things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every morning when i wake up i have a different song playing in my head, like a radio.  No regular, daytime thoughts have started to fire yet, so i can hear the song quite clearly. </p>
<p>I've started to keep an excel spreadsheet.  The weirdest one is &quot;I got a woman&quot; by Ray Charles.  A song I don't own from a guy I don't listen to.  Often times, it's surf rock songs, who's names I can never remember, because it's hard to remember names of surf rock songs.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, &quot;Hoist the colors&quot; played 3 days after I saw Pirates, and &quot;It calls me&quot; played 3 days after I watched Moana.  So there's some kind of 3-day lag pattern emerging.</p></div>		</li>
