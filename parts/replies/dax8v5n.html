			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of things will happen before then. There are brown dwarf stars that will in theory outlive the universe not sure how that's possible but hey it's a cool well founded theory. The heat death of the universe isn't the end (just the end of the productive cycle of star birth and death,  and when the average temperature of the universe is near 0K) there will be mind-boggling amounts of time after that that other cool stuff might happen with infinite time. There is a theory that an amorphous space cloud will behave like neurons in a brain and become sentient and aware of the universe. It's one of those infinite monkeys on infinite typewriters theories though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lack of heat means zero energy. Lack of energy means that all molecules are too far apart to interact with each other ever again.</p>
<p>No more entropy. No more energy that does work on anything else. </p>
<p>No stars exist past heat death, by definition.</p></div>		</li>
