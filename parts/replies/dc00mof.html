			<div class="markdown"><p>The mind over body effect is almost certainly not just a mix of biases. To suggest the mind has no influence over the body is to suggest they are clearly demarcated. But that's easy to disprove with the physiological effects of emotions e.g., tears from crying. </p>
<p>I think what you're seeing as wrong is really two different abstractions. Instead of talking about how the brain releases less stress chemicals when we believe we are being treated and how that influences the immune response or what have you, it's been abstracted to talking about beliefs and curing sickness. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the placebo effect does not care if the effect measured is caused by biases or a &quot;mind over body&quot; effect. It simply means, &quot;In research Y, patient in the control group report/have the effect X&quot; noting else. It says nothing of the sources of X. It is irresponsible to attribute this to a &quot;mind over body&quot; effect when the tool used isn't meant for this. You can end up with an idea of the placebo effect as a therapeutic tool and this is dangerous.</p></div>		</li>
