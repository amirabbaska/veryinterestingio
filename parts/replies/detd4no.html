			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems ethical, however logically wouldn't it make sense to try and save at least one person by getting them to the hospital straight away? What if the ambulance stopping and waiting meant both people died instead of just the one that was hit by the ambulance? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if you leave and the person in the back dies but the person in the road could have been saved?</p>
<p>We don't know, so we have to try and help both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it takes some time to determine if the person they hit is alive or not. You can't tell if you keep driving. Then there's the question of what would happen to the person you hit. Can you just keep driving and leave them in the middle of the road with no way of stopping the rest of the traffic and hope police or the other ambulance gets there soon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure, but I would say split up and leave one paramedic and equipment on the scene and the driver continues on to the ER. At the same time the ER sends out another van. That seems to be the most fair and logical way to do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't imagine ever leaving a patient like that even if you had 2 or more attendants.  you can't transport a patient without an attendant in the back with them. Otherwise it's not an ambulance, the patient can't very well suction themselves or perform CPR or administer drugs etc.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it just work to also put the person hit into the back of the Ambulance and drive off?</p>
<p>OP said fatal, so I'm assuming obviously fatal, like a smashed head or something. I would choose to drive off in that scenario, I know for certain one person is savable, I'll take my chances and go. Not before calling a second ambulance though.</p></div>		</li>
