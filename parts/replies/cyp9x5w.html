<p>The reason for this is there is no way to exert a force on the ball in a direction other than through the center mass.</p>

<p>Really? In the absence of friction, if a force is exerted with a component tangent to the ball, that would cause the ball to start rotating.  Friction isn't the only force that could do this...I'm not sure why all forces must be pushing on a line through the center of mass.  They might have a <em>component</em> in that direction, sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>my point is how do you exert a force in a component tangent to the ball? It would simply slip across. You're absolutely right that if you exert a force tangent to the ball, it will start rotating, but there's no way to do so.</p></div>		</li>

<p>there'd be no conceivable way to rotate the ball at all</p>

<p>what about putting it in a sling and spinning the sling. Now the ball is rotating about the end point of the sling. After that, reduce the length of the sling. As the radius of sling decreases, it speeds up (like a figure skater pulling in his arms). What happens when the radius of the sling is zero? The ball in the end of the sling will be spinning on its axis with the original momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>why would the ball be rotating about the end point of the sling? the ball would be moving around in circles, but it wouldn't have any spin. No friction, remember? It's a perfectly smooth ball, so there's nothing to push it in any spin direction.</p>
<p>In your example, the ball would be <em>vibrating</em> towards the end, and when the radius becomes zero, it would simply be stationary.</p></div>		</li>
