			<div class="markdown"><p>Fibrillators are used to stop normal heart function during specialist cardiac surgery. Nowadays to stop the heart (asystole) a solution referred to as cardioplegia is used. However in some difficult cases they may use a fibrillator to keep the heart in fibrillation giving some coronary flow but not beating wildly.</p>
<p>Fibrillators use much lower ac voltages to keep the heart like this. Sometimes just stopping the fibrillator will let the heart go back to a normal rhythm, most of the time they will defibrillate the heart to stop fibrillation and restart a rhythm.</p>
<p>As for asystole, that is when there is no electrical activity. This is more a problem of electrolyte imbalance which needs to be fixed before trying to get the heart started, as the movement of electrolytes in and out of the cells is what conducts the electrical signals of the heart.</p></div>		</li>
