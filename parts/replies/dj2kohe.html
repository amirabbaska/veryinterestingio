			<div class="markdown"><p>This is half true.</p>
<p>No one ever paid that 70% rate. Why? You used to be able to deduct <em>everything</em> from your taxes. Maximizing your deductions used to be huge and there were a million ways to do it.</p>
<p>Many people, especially rich people with tax people great at deductions, paid a much lower rate.</p>
<p>After an economically disastrous 1970's Congress lowered rates and closed a lot of those loopholes. The economy roared for the first time in a decade. Many loopholes have been reopened though and rates haven't raised which is why good tax reform would close loop holes and potentially be able to lower rates without losing revenues.</p>
<p>The beef I have with modern day Republicans is that there's no understanding that you can't <em>just</em> lower taxes. You have to either close loopholes or raise revenue in other ways. Taxes are how you drive society to behave in certain ways. </p>
<p>I personally think raising the corporate rates would be fine, but then give corporations massive tax brakes for creating good jobs (above the median salary) in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To back that up with some data: In 1979, the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/historical-average-federal-tax-rates-all-households" target="_blank">average effective tax rate</a> on the top 1% was 35%. In 2013, it was 34%. In 1996, it was even higher than in 1979. In the 80s, it did go as low as 24.7%, though it's not clear how much of this was due to the recession and how much was due to the tax cuts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tend to think that similar effective rates and reduced tax subsidy shenanigans are more effective. Any time I hear &quot;job creation&quot; I feel like someone is about to sneak a fast one on me. Some federal funds are being diverted (or reduced), benefiting some politicians and a corporation (increasing barriers to entry, and opacity of competition). Employment happens naturally and the only way a politician typically helps is by changing stale rules that previously prevented it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The US already has an absurdly high corporate rate and corporate taxation is one of the most inefficient ways to raise money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a big difference between marginal and effective tax rates.   Since WW II, federal taxes have consumed 17 - 20 percent of GDP.   Do you think the government had some giant windfall during the high marginal rate years?</p>
<p>Currently the effective tax rates are fairly close to the past for high wage earners, lower for low wage earners.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...In 1958, approximately two million filers (4.4% of all taxpayers) earned the $12,000 or more for married couples needed to face marginal rates as high as 30%. These Americans paid about 35% of all income taxes. And now? In 2010, 3.9 million taxpayers (2.75% of all taxpayers) were subjected to rates that were 33% or higher. These Americans—many of whom would hardly call themselves wealthy—reported an adjusted gross income of $209,000 or higher, and they paid 49.7% of all income taxes.
In contrast, the share of taxes paid by the bottom two-thirds of taxpayers has fallen dramatically over the same period. In 1958, these Americans accounted for 41.3% of adjusted gross income and paid 29% of all federal taxes. By 2010, their share of adjusted gross income had fallen to 22.5%. But their share of taxes paid fell far more dramatically—to 6.7%. The 77% decline represents the single biggest difference in the way the tax burden is shared in this country since the late 1950s.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but only tells part of the story in the US. Before 1916, the US only imposed income taxes briefly to pay for the Civil War, and there was an attempt to impose them in the 1890's, but that was overturned by a Supreme Court decision. So, from 1776 to 1916, with the exceptions noted above, the income tax rate was ZERO. The US had zero income tax for more years than it has an income tax at any rate.</p>
<p>As for &quot;sustainable&quot; - the history of 60's England was one of entrepenuers and rock stars leaving the country because of the confiscatory tax rates. Educated people who expected to make money - mostly doctors - left England for other Commonwealth countries (like Canada) in what was called the &quot;Brain Drain&quot;. Capital is mobile, and people will move from their home countries if the gov't gets too greedy. So, whether or not this is &quot;sustainable&quot; depends on your definition of the word. If your people are free to leave, can you continue to run your country when the brightest and most able people are leaving? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the income tax might have been zero but taxes were paid, often excise taxes on specific products (alcohol, sugar, etc).  there were also tariffs on many imported goods, which were of course passed on to the consumers</p>
<p>not to mention revenue from the sale of land taken from the first nation peoples</p>
<p>finally, deduction deductions deduction . .. .  yeah, the tax rate might be 70% or whatever but by the time deductions exclusions etc etc etc are applied it is a fraction of that.  mitt romney is paid $55,000 a day from his investments and gets taxed at a lower rate than most americans</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Federal government expenditures as a percentage of GDP were much, much lower prior to the introduction of the income tax. Americans weren't just taxed differently; they were taxed less. Excepting the occasional spike for wars, federal government spending averaged around 3% of GDP right up until World War I, after which it grew to about 20% of GDP around 1980, and has been there give or take a couple percent ever since. The federal government now spends more as a percentage of GDP in peacetime than it did during the Civil War.</p></div>		</li>
