			<div class="markdown"><p>One fact I gleaned from my doctor was that it is possible to lose the ability to generate mucous in your nose.  I took a solid hit in karate and had a massive nose bleed.  The inside of my nose was completely caked with blood.  He advised me to soften the blood with saline and keep the whole thing moist or I'll risk drying out the whole membrane and it won't recover.  After that I would have had to manually keep my nasal passages moist with sprays and he said it was pain and would make me much more susceptible to virus and bacterial infection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting; am an MD and I've never heard of anything like this. Can't find anything on a literature search either (granted, I'm drunk and barely motivated).</p>
<p>Did he recommend a specific branded product, or a saline mixture you could make up yourself? </p>
<p>Edit: After actually looking, nasal saline is a common recommenddation after surgery, and would make sense to use after bloody trauma.  Purpose seems to be to dissolve blood to allow easier breathing and quicker healing.  Didn't see anything about protecting mucous production, but it could be true. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He just pointed me to off the shelf nasal saline spray.   If I remember right I think I was also to put Vaseline up there at night.  It was about 20 years ago now.  He was a pretty knowledgeable GP.  He also did emerg work (that is how I met him). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love everything about this comment. </p>
<p>You start by establishing credibility and then curiosity, but immediately dispel the notion that you're going to put off-hours work into this. Also you're drunk and me too so that's fun. Then you top it off with a healthy dose of skeptical cynicism that seems to come from a place of genuine concern that this guy's doctor might not have his best interest at heart </p></div>		</li>

<p>Study was specifically for peanuts, but I suppose it follows that this would work for other common food allergies as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very slightly related.  My Mom was a clean freak when I was a kid.  Lysol for everything and when I did get sick I was always on an antibiotic immediately.   All throughout my childhood and into my teens I suffered from chronic sinus infections and allergies.<br />
FFW 20 years.  My wife and I are both nurses.  Have 3 kids. Constantly exposed to germs.  I haven't been sick a day in over 2 years.  My wife, like once in 8 years.  Kids never miss school due to illness.
Point being, some exposure to allergens and germs is beneficial (within reason).  Let your kids get a little dirty.  </p>
<p>Edit:   Last sentence.  Not like that!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it is all environment. I grew up in the country, around farm animals. Spent my time playing in mud and creek water, wrestling with dirty animals, spent weeks in the summers without a bath. No lysol ever anywhere. Parents thought doctors were for the dying. They were the ones that if one sibling or neighbor kid got sick, they put you with them so you would catch it too and get it all over at once. I am allergic to everything under the sun. Animals, grass, trees, foods, dust, pretty much anything you can be allergic too, I am. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On another related note, don't claim to be allergic to things if you're not sure. </p>
<p>Penicillin is a GREAT drug but a lot of people claim to be allergic to it thinking that they'll get some super antibiotic, like the next level up if they claim PCN allergy.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately for them, PCN and other drugs in the same family are actually the first choice for many things, including strep throat and animal bites.  Many people claim the allergy and then get downgraded to the second or third most effective antibiotics. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Relatedly: redefine your definition of &quot;allergic reaction&quot;. It's common for patients to believe they're allergic to a given antibiotic because they were prescribed a course and developed nausea/vomiting/diarrhoea from it. This isn't allergy, it's a normal side effect of the medication. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mother has a serious penicillin allergy. She sloughed off her skin and almost died back in college because of it. They told her she probably wouldn't survive another exposure. It runs strongly in her family-- one of her cousins can't take penicillin, amoxicillin, any -cillin. My childhood doctors told my mother and me to always tell providers &quot;deadly family allergy to penicillin.&quot; I've never taken it as a result. Is there any way to confirm an allergy without taking it? I have a six-year-old, and his pediatrician has it in his file about the family history, and won't prescribe it to him, either.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We are less clear on why allergies happen, but some hypothesize that they occur due to infants and children living in environments that are far too clean. Their immune systems don't have anything to fight, so they start fighting random things instead. </p>

<p>Does that explain why as an Indian I've rarely heard my peers having the astonishingly diverse amount of allergies I see in Americans? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, yes. People in developing countries basically don't have allergies, and this is one of the major hypotheses why. If you've lived in India your whole life it's entirely possible you've never met someone with a serious allergy because our immune systems evolved for a world where we would come into contact with tons of pathogens from the moment of birth. Sanitation practices seen in the developed world are definitely better than dysentery (which is why the strides Modi is attempting in that direction are promising), but they seem to also cause allergies and asthma because the immune system doesn't know how to deal with a lack of threats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall a radiolab broadcast about hookworm parasites relieving allergies.  Something about the hookworm saliva causes the immune system to weaken slightly.  Not enough to kill the host but enough to let the parasite, parasite.  And enough to relieve allergies.  Apparently allergies are genetic but those genes were not a negative because chances are in the past you had hook worms to mask it. </p>
