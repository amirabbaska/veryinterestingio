<p>For example, take 5000 out of that population of 10 million and they get moved somewhere else. The would populate that whole area and their genes alter in response to the new environment/food/predators over a long period of time. They would be bring diversity back to the old group they originated from right?</p></div>		</li>

My understanding is that they might still be able to reproduce like the europeans and the native americans, which in a biological scale werent seperated, but if the europeans had left the natives alone for...... millions of years maybe we would have two different species (that cant cross breed)</p></div>		</li>

<p>With fewer breeding pairs you'll have more risk to fatal mutations but every mutation isn't fatal.</p>

<p>I don't believe that's the issue. The lack of genetic diversity is alleles going to fixation, not mutations killing them off. Inbreeding can permanently breed in a &quot;bad&quot; trait in small inbred populations, which eventually takes over the entire population. This &quot;bad&quot; trait might not even be seen until it matters.</p>
<p>The risk is that they are now all weakened as a species at being able to handle changes, due to lower diversity. A single thing like a new pathogen they didn't evolve to survive, or a changing climate can wipe them out. With more genetic diversity, the likelihood of some of them surviving would be higher, but if their genes are at fixation they have to depend on those random mutations to hopefully survive it.</p>
<p>This happened at some point to the cheetahs, where only a few survived some sort of ancient catastrophe but they somehow repopulated. As a result there's very low diversity in them.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But at the same time it can permanently breed in a good trait as well, no? So it's a matter of luck there. If you pick 2 bugs with bad traits, then your population will likely be worse off than if you picked 2 bugs with good traits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have duplicates of every chromosome* (One from parent). Usually we can manage as long as at least one of them is ok. Inbreeding increases the risk that both of chromosomes have the same defect.</p>
<p>* male mammals only have one copy of the X chromosome. (Which is why men are colorblind more often than women.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the point is that the environment is constantly throwing new stuff at you, so sometimes a trait is good and sometimes the same trait is bad. For example, being big might be an advantage for defense against being killed, but turns into a disadvantage when the food supply temporarily drops. With a diverse gene pool, you’re ready for either event. But if you fix onto just one option, you lose that flexibility. Now multiply that concept by 10,000 different traits. </p></div>		</li>
