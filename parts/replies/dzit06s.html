			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, I'll try that; part of the problem is that I live in a different country nowadays, which is why I was no longer a part of his day to day life - that's also the only reason I'm still on his Facebook, since he literally deleted all his friends from the UK. If I'd still been close, I probably would have had him committed. He sometimes leaves &quot;goodbye forever&quot; messages, and then talks about how he's going to see his ex-wife and kids. That one had me really worried, luckily nothing happened.</p>
<p>I'm going to try your trick, it's the best one I've heard so far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the trick, there is pretty much no way. If you tell him frankly you are obviously in on it. If you try to do it more subtly then you are here to manipulate them. </p>
<p>That's the sad thing about it. No matter what you will say or how you will say it it will only reinforce what they already think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine if you're going to be next piece of the puzzle pushed out of their life the only option is heartfelt concern. The explanation would need to include an acknowledgment of their own, including its possibility, and that you also have  recurring theory of your own and then gently give them the information you have found. Dont claim they are anything, only speak of <em>your</em> concerns. All we can do is make the information available, this kind of paranoia means we cant even plant the seed we can only leave the dirt and seed in the open next to a book on gardening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tread lightly, and stay involved, is my only recommendation. Gather evidence of their paranoia in case you need to commit them to a mental hospital. A friend of mine developed these symptoms,  drove away every one who loved him, and died of an overdose while attempting to self-medicate. Everyone knew it would happen, but nobody took that next step to prevent it. It can be hard, forcing help on people who don't want it or claim not to need it. But not as hard as decades of regret and misery knowing something could have been done.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If he's showing signs of self harm or drug abuse, drag his behind to a mental health professional immediately, kicking and screaming if need be.</p></div>		</li>
