			<div class="markdown"><p>The big lakes in the Ozarks are basically flooded ravines and valleys, and the shorelines end up looking kind of like fractals.  So depending on how short the base unit of measurement, you get much more &quot;shoreline&quot;. I think veratasium did a pretty good video, here, <a href="https://youtu.be/I_rw-AJqpCM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/I_rw-AJqpCM</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There would be a unique answer for every discrete 'yardstick' length you used, I'd imagine some of them are more practical than others, they should trend the same, provided they are sufficiently small relative to the minimum <del>lake</del> feature size.</p>
<p>For practical purposes a length of around 10m is probably pretty decent if you care about only lakes larger than a small pond (100m²).  <a href="http://limnology.wisc.edu/personnel/sites/default/files/ehstanley/files/winslow_et_al_fwb_2014.pdf" target="_blank">This Paper</a> shows different yardstick lengths, while all lakes show increased shoreline length with decreasing yardstick length, smaller lakes are dis-proportionately effected until the yardstick length is about the square root of the area in m² (fig5).</p>
<p>tl;dr: the shoreline as a function of elevation should behave similarly for sufficiently small yardstick lengths, and give you an elevation of maximum <del>area</del> perimeter (though that <del>area</del> perimeter will grow arbitrarily large as you decrease the yardstick length).</p>
<p>I'd say another factor that obfuscates results, are we talking about just water that can access elevations at the sea level from the ocean, or all area below some elevation?</p>
<p>It's a significantly different problem, since one includes inland lakes and the other doesn't</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem isn't easy, you'd have to have a perfect topographical map with the resolution of your yard stick above and below the waterline. A lake wouldn't normally be considered coast, but as soon as seawater reached that level it would become such. </p>
<p>At every elevation, even assuming a smooth coastline there is a possibility of an inversion in coastline due to valleys flooding. A really simple <a href="http://imgur.com/Bgaw6j1" target="_blank">example here</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what I'm saying is, even though the <del>area</del> permieter rises to infinity as we drop yardstick length, the location of maximal <del>area</del> perimeter should remain the same.  I'm just hypothesizing that below a certain length scale, all coastlines experience the same amount of coastline exaggeration due to their fractal nature.</p>
<p>What we really care about is approximating the macro coastline well, since it will be the largest difference between elevations.  the fractal content should remain the same regardless of elevation, and thus, below some critical length scale, we should see a clear peak.</p>
<p>E: your plot still has an elevation with clearly defined maximum shoreline</p></div>		</li>
