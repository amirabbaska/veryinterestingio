<p>The next question is -- did the PETM cause a mass extinction? The answer is that no, it did not. The Paleocene/Eocene is associated with a faunal changeover but not a mass extinction.</p>

<p>Could some of that be due to having a recent mass extinction (~10 million years prior). Assuming the survivors were very generalist animals, is it possible that not a lot of species were particularly specialized?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was digging through studies on the Permian–Triassic a while ago and the general consensus is that geologic sources(aka hydrates thawing out due to climate change of some kind) was far too slow to match the data and give rise to an ultra fast release event.</p>
<p>The general idea was it was a perfect storm of</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1</strong> Accumulated biological feedstock at bottoms of oceans.</li>
<li><strong>2</strong> Introduction of new genes among methane producing organisms that allows faster and more efficient methanogenesis in the accumulated biomass from point 1.</li>
<li><strong>3</strong> The Siberian Traps volcanism causing an unprecedented event of ocean fertilization of nickel and so on that eliminated the rate limiting factor of the microbes from point 2.</li>
</ul>
<p>So it was entirely driven and caused by biological activity, climate change would've been a secondary effect but we can't be sure of how much extinction that caused as the biological flareup would take a toll on the ecosystem just on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fine explanation with one major flaw. The extinction seems to have affected the terrestrial realm just as much as it did the marine realm, so marine ecosystem collapse cause by a biological cascading effect is insufficient to explain it. Terrestrial flora and fauna all took a massive hit at the P-T. Event insects experience an extinction, which is significant because this may be the only time that's ever happened. The timing of the extinctions on land and sea is also in step, suggesting that the event(s) which caused the extinction were globally ubiquitous. Moreover, the massive carbon excursion seen in the marine realm can also be found in the terrestrial realm. This strongly suggests an event which affected global climate via atmospheric perturbations of the Carbon cycle in some way. If there are any studies you know of which suggest a biotic collapse of marine ecosystems could cause a similar collapse on land, please let me know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the other thing about methane is that is has a much shorter atmospheric lifetime (~10 years) than other notable greenhouse gasses like CO2 (lifetime of hundreds of years). So, in order to <em>sustain</em> high levels of methane in the atmosphere, you'd have to have to sustain a higher emission rate of methane. If all of the methane stored in the oceans was released at once, that would perhaps be better than if it was released over a period of hundreds of years or so. Releasing it slowly over time would be more likely to cause a major extinction, IMO. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The primary sink of methane is through reaction with the hydroxyl (OH) radical.  So the rate of change of methane (d[CH<em><em>4</em></em>]/dt) is equal to the OH concentration [OH] times the reaction rate (with a negative sign since it's a loss):</p>
<p>d[CH<em><em>4</em></em>]/dt = -k[CH<em><em>4</em></em>][OH]</p>
<p>If we assume the OH concentration is fixed (constant), this is a separable ordinary differential equation.  The solution to this kind of equation is an exponential decay:</p>
<p>[CH<em><em>4</em></em>] = [CH<em><em>4</em></em>]<em><em>0</em></em>e^(-k[OH]t)</p>
<p>where [CH<em><em>4</em></em>]<em><em>0</em></em> is the initial concentration of methane.  Since we assumed that [OH] levels are fixed, we can write:</p>
<p>[CH<em><em>4</em></em>] = [CH<em><em>4</em></em>]<em><em>0</em></em> e^(-t/tau)</p>
<p>where tau is the &quot;atmospheric lifetime&quot;.  So <strong>the atmospheric lifetime is the time it will take before the concentration will reach a third of the initial concentration</strong>.  Or put more simply, it's just a measure of how quickly the methane will react away.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Atmospheric lifetimes is the time it takes for the concentration to reach about 1/3 of the original concentration.<br />
(Time until it reaches 1/e concentration).</p>
<p>The halflife time in the atmosphere is 8.4 years.</p>
<p>The reason why one big release would be (long term) better is because of diminishing returns I assume. But on that I have to read up more to be sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it is the time it would take for the molecule to be broken down or otherwise removed from the atmosphere.  In atmospheric sciences or likely any environmentally-oriented field, there is the concept of sources and sinks.  A sink is a process or group of processes which remove something.  If the source of methane is greater than the sink's ability to remove it, then it will accumulate.  So yes, a slower rate of methane release would result in a stabler environment assuming it is roughly within the sink's ability to remove it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is important to note that methane is a <em>significantly</em> stronger greenhouse gas than CO2.  One reason for this is that the strongest absorption bands of CO2 are already pretty saturated in the atmosphere because of its relatively high concentration.  Essentially, adding more CO2 to the atmosphere decreases the radiative forcing of the next CO2 molecule.  This isn't the case for methane.  While it is true methane can break down into CO2 and water, they would not have as great of an effect as the original methane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the concentration of methane vs water vapour we can dismiss this is as insignificant, especially when considering turnover, in regards of water vapour.</p>
<p>Regarding CO2, well there's only one carbon in methane so you're not getting more than one CO2 from each methane. And given that CO2 is much weaker than methane the end results of methanolysis is a lower greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>And methane is counted in parts per billion(co2 is in parts per million), so a complete and instantaneous breakdown of all atmospheric methane would cause an almost invisible bump in the CO2 graph.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can try to provide some perspective from the terrestrial side of things. Peatlands across regions (permafrost and otherwise) account for 3% of the Earth’s surface yet maintain possession of up to [30% of the world’s carbon soil stores]( <a href="http://www.biogeosciences.net/5/1475/2008/bg-5-1475-2008.html" target="_blank">http://www.biogeosciences.net/5/1475/2008/bg-5-1475-2008.html</a>) and previous estimates of total soil carbon [did not account for permafrost stores]( <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01381.x/full" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01381.x/full</a>). Accounting for deep Carbon storage in permafrost doubles the current estimate of the [total high-latitude soil carbon pool]( <a href="http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/pep/Schuur2008_Permafrost_Bioscience2.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/pep/Schuur2008_Permafrost_Bioscience2.pdf</a>). Despite new bounds on the estimates of total carbon and nitrogen storage on permafrost less is known about the potential for it to be cycled to the atmosphere in the forms of greenhouse gasses [carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide]( <a href="http://epublications.uef.fi/pub/urn_isbn_978-952-61-1352-4/urn_isbn_978-952-61-1352-4.pdf" target="_blank">http://epublications.uef.fi/pub/urn_isbn_978-952-61-1352-4/urn_isbn_978-952-61-1352-4.pdf</a>). The inclusion of permafrost processes in global climate models could shift terrestrial ecosystems north of 60°N from being a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/108/36/14769.full.pdf" target="_blank">sink of carbon (27 Pg +/- 7) to a source (4 +/- 18).</a> Also, [Mack et al. (2004)]( <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7007/abs/nature02887.html" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7007/abs/nature02887.html</a>) showed that increased nutrient availability in a changing climate leads to net losses of carbon and nitrogen from deeper soil layers, despite the fact that increases in temperature and nutrient availability are expected to lead to an increase in primary production.  In addition to loss from deep permafrost, [warming enhanced winter respiration which offsets two-fold increases in growing season carbon storage]( <a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/13-0602.1" target="_blank">http://www.esajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1890/13-0602.1</a>) </p>
<p>TL;DR – There is a lot of organic matter stored in the form of carbon and nitrogen northern peatlands and permafrost. Methane fluxes from thawing permafrost to the atmosphere might cause a lot of climate forcing but there is a still lot we don’t know. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fluxes are also important. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Would you expect this to be temporary? I would think that with warmer temperatures, decomposition of the newly thawed permafrost would have a limited amount of SOM to decompose meaning eventually they would be a net C sink again.  Just not initially.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first instinct is that it would indeed be temporary, but on a geologic timescale - there is so much new material to be worked with that I don't imagine C-limitation as a near-field consequence, perhaps decades/centuries but production will keep that incoming carbon pump going to some extent as well. </p></div>		</li>
