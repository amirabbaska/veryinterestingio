			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't, it flows from high to low potential so it will keep flowing in a direction as long as the potential is getting lower. It doesn't even have to be a circuit as current will flow in any direction that provides lower potential (like ground) but current will be insignificant if the resistance is high (like the difference between a straw and a pipe) . However in applications like high voltage lines, arcing can occur even through air because the voltage is so high that even when resistance is high the current is still significant (I =V/R).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, arcing happens because current causes heat, enough heat causes the air to ionize, which significantly increases its current carrying ability.  this is the principle behind the jacob's ladder, and why the spark climbs despite the wires moving farther apart- because the heated air rises, and it's that heated air that is the path of least resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electricity doesn't &quot;know&quot; anything. Individual electrons are subject to electrical potentials. The electrons are drawn to areas that are deficient in electrons (positive) and repelled from areas that are electron rich (negative). The speed at which the electrons move is dependent on the conductivity of the material.</p>
<p>Circuits are just paths where the conductivity is high enough to allow an appreciable number of electrons to flow.</p>
<p>As a side note, what we call an insulator or a conductor is just an arbitrary amount of conductivity. Electricity will still flow through an insulator, albeit at a very low rate. This is why unused batteries can discharge over time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me try to explain using an analogy. </p>
<p>Imagine a hose with marbles inside of it. Now, let's take a spare marble in our hand and push it into the hoses. Virtually instantly (to our eyes) a different marble will pop out the other side of the hose.  Now what if we put a plug on the other end of the hose? When we try to push the marble into the hose, we can't. There isn't room. In this analogy, the hoses are like wires, and the marbles are the electrons inside of them. Pushing marbles into the hose is the same as having a battery supply a voltage to the system. Plugging the hose is the same as adding an insulator or opening a switch to stop the circuit. </p>
<p>When you activate a circuit, the electrons already inside the system start to flow. If the circuit is broken, then the electrons already inside the system stop you from adding more to the system. In this way, the electrons can tell which part of the circuit is &quot;on&quot; and which part is &quot;off&quot; because the &quot;off&quot; parts are already full of electrons and just can't accept any more. </p></div>		</li>
