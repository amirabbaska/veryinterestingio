			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the read.</p>
<p>I think if you put as much effort into that, into doing your own entrepreneurial thing you could probably have a local window cleaning, flower delivery, dog walking etc. business.</p>
<p>The hard truth is business is all about selling, and people hate selling. So they get into mlms because they think the selling will be minimised/easier because it is peer to peer - instead you just lose your friends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, although at least from the actual numbers he mentioned, it doesn't sound like he actually spent that much money.  Starting your own business will usually at least take a little bit of startup capital, even if it's just to buy supplies, print fliers, and buy some basic equipment.  As for MLM, I don't think there is any rule that you have to sell to your friends and family only.  I know they always recommend that because it's easy, but there are plenty of people out there to sell to that aren't friends and family.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I told them point blank to not peddle that stupid shit to me. According to them, they are just trying to get enough &quot;loyal customers&quot; to generate spending cash on the regular.</p>
<p>So far, it doesnt work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They all encourage it greatly which is ironic becuase it's very bad strategy and a last resort. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Oh no.....those fuckers try to sell(poorly).</p>
<p>They take the easy way of starting a business....MLMs basically package a very bad business plan but present it as gold they're handing you to utilize....except you need to sell it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, this is well written.  Amazingly I haven't had any contact with any MLMs in my life.  I live in small town Texas, seems I would have or would know people that are, but I don't, so maybe employment is decent here and it really is a Midwest thing, or maybe it's because I don't go to churches. But I am keenly aware of them.</p>
<p>I do wonder what the MLM of the 2030s will be... there's the gravy train right there if one can just find a model and start it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My initial clique in world financial group was actually targeting Texas because the &quot;demographic&quot; was &quot;hot and ready&quot; (vulnerable) to our lessons, so many individuals headed over there to spread their business. They rarely hit small towns though because less money to be made. Small towns are more for selling product than recruiting, but they would recruit anyone that boosts their stats so they can get to the next level and make more money.</p>
<p>The best mlm platform is the ability to participate without forcing individuals to buy their product. Cutco for example was what an east coast friend of mine got into, she was forced into buying the stuff and selling it asap. Those platforms don't do well because it requires too much immediate investment , it needs to be slow and gradual. </p>
<p>With that said,  it might become more discrete, offer points instead of money and is free to be a part of or something. You get addicted making those points you can buy stuff with, that would benefit someone numerous of ways whoever gets the idea running and markets it first. I know some exists but they never kicked off because of how amateurish it feels how they do their websites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>WFG is like that.  I'm not in it, but I know you can just purchase insurance from one of the agents, or you can join and just sell it without purchasing any products.  And the $100 you paid would most likely be errors and omissions insurance.  Something that state law requires that anyone selling insurance or financial products buy.  WFG most likely isn't making any profit on that.</p></div>		</li>
