			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a cave in West Virginia that exists in the middle of a cow pasture.  It looks like a little depression in the filed, but if you push the grass aside, it's a 30' fissure to the cave below.  There's a few sets of cow bones down there, and sometimes there are sticks around it.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently watched a video where a man was narrating a camping trip in Arizona. At one point, he stood on a fault line where one side was granite and the other limestone. The vegetation on either side was completely different all along the line within the space of a few feet. It was amazing.</p></div>		</li>
