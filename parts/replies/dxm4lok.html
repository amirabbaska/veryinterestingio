			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no clue, but in a way, it kind of changes my perspective on the world. If flies see life much faster than we do, do their lives feel even shorter to them than they do to us? Also, does a turtle's perspective of its life feel longer than we feel like our own life is because it's so slow? Perspective vs Reality is weird, man.</p></div>		</li>
