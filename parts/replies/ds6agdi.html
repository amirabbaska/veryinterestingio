			<div class="markdown"><p>Seeing this a lot in Ireland also, been an explosion in new gin distilleries the last couple of years so we'd expect to see plenty of new whiskey brands coming down the line! Harris gin is great, I'm quite partial to Shetland Reel also! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly the gin boom is quite ridiculous. Gin is selling at a higher price per litre than some decent whisky, which is quite absurd given one of the two products takes a couple of days to make and the other about 20 years...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you have to wonder how many of these companies will survive long term. Some of them aren't even distilling in Scotland, just using a Scottish name and slapping some shite about mountain streams and machair on the label</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time is really irrelevant though. People will pay a premium for a gin that has an unique or excellent taste, just like people won't pay a premium for a long aged whiskey that tastes like garbage. I'd pay more for MacAllan 10 or 12 Year Old (when they still sold them in Scotland rather than the stupid Gold, Amber, Sienna) than the 21 Year Old despite it taking twice as long to make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fell the same way with the Glenfiddich 12 over the 21. I'd pay more for the 12 if I had to. </p></div>		</li>
