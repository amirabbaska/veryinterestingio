			<div class="markdown"><p>In most cases, I'd think they are eaten by a scavenger pretty soon after. There are a lot of animals where that is their speciality. Regarding where these animals die, I'm guessing they're not thinking about this much like we do. Here in Phoenix, a lot of birds die when it starts to get hot at the beginning of every summer. They just fall from trees, it seems, because they're just in random spots around the city. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have about 20 acres of forest and range it fairly often, so I'm using that as my source.  Things die all the time (Squirrels, deer, birds, etc..)  Deer are probably the largest animals that wander my land, and if I notice one die on the day of, it will be reduced to mostly hair and bones in just a couple days due to scavengers and bugs and whatnot.  The bones themselves are even gnawed on by squirrels, mice and some other animals.  </p>
<p>The dead smell doesn't actually last very long since it gets eaten fast and really only noticeable in warm weather.  You don't see it much again because things eat most of the bits.  All that will be left of a deer is a partial skeleton (as animals will carry off some of the bits). That skeleton itself will be covered by leaves and underbrush pretty quick as well, you'll only see it if you're looking for it or happen to step on it.</p></div>		</li>
