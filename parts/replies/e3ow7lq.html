			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s amusing me how few people are mentioning/upvoting this one.  Plastic bottles break down, adding micro plastics and even plastic loving bacteria to the cap and opening.  Go for stuff in glass jars with metal lids, and as unenvironmentally (helluva sort of word) friendly as it sounds, don’t reuse plastic bottles.  Get yourself a proper reusable bottle , water filters, and quit buying single use plastic ya tools...</p>

<p>Honey's definitely something that benefits from buying local in good non-reactive container if it's an option.</p></div>		</li>
