			<div class="markdown"><p>At Mr. Luqman's discretion, smugglers pay for fuel and load it into tanker trucks. Refined products from the Akrish refinery are driven more than 200 miles to Syrian villages near the Turkish border, according to Mr. Muslem. The fuel from Mr. Dada's operations was also being trucked to Turkey when he was in charge. Now, though, it makes its way to Islamic State-controlled parts of Iraq, including Mosul, Mr. Dada said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100,000 barrels is worth about 8.2 million (opec basket price) so whoever is buying it is getting it at a 5.2 million dollar discount if they are only making 3 million a day.  Even more once you consider transportation and the fact they are refining some of it. </p></div>		</li>
