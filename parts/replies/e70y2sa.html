			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that's what they meant, and if I understand the subject correctly that would go from placebo effect to metaphysical. As I understand it placebos are effective regarding symptoms and improving the bodies immune system, but I'm confident in assuming that you can't 'believe' damaged DNA into existing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't label it as metaphysical, which is non-science. Psychoneuroimmunology is a real field, based on the interaction between your immune system and your psychology. There are serious scientists trying to answer questions related to mood or mental state and immune response. Even though feelings, depression, etc., are generally perceived as &quot;mental problems&quot;, there is underlying chemistry in your brain and blood as a result or cause or symptom or whatever of these conditions that may have an impact on the function of other parts of your body.</p>
<p>Who's to say that stress responses from reading warning labels over a long period of time doesn't have an impact on DNA transcription errors or cancer formation or impact of cancer causing agents on the body? You're possibly changing your body chemistry when you read the label, and that might affect something else.</p>
<p>We just don't have data, and it's way too early to just write it off as nonsense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn’t meaning specifically cancer, the warnings are multitudinous and manifold - I was more meaning that if you’re repeatedly told that something will adversely affect your health in one of so many ways (cancer, emphysema, pleurisy, gum disease, tooth decay, erectile dysfunction, etc etc etc just in the case of smoking), is that not a strong enough suggestion to cause the same mechanism as positive placebo action to come onto effect, but with negative results?
Surely if the action is strong enough to regress the bone growth in osteoarthritis, it’s not much of a leap to assume it might cause the onset or hastening of one or more of the ills associated with smoking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a great question. Although it may be more of a placebo effect. If you are told something is going to happen, and it then proceeds to happen, to what degree could that possibly have an impact? </p></div>		</li>
