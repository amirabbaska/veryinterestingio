			<div class="markdown"><p>Thus far, attempts to cross-breed them have been unsuccessful. To be fair, Sudan was too elderly to survive mating pretty soon after his transplant to Ol Pejeta, and one of the female northern whites has a bad hip and the other has ovarian cysts, so the opportunities to event attempt natural crosses were slim. (I study botany and entomology, not animal physiology, so I’m just relaying what colleagues at OPC have told me. No idea if it’s pre- or post-zygotic problems.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understood that there was a hybrid female born in the Czech Republic when the last group was still there... is that not the case? I believe she passed away about 5 or 6 years ago.
San Diego zoo global is also trying to use surrogacy techniques with banked cell lines from 12 individuals, so there’s that.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately they don't seem to be able to produce hybrids, but there is a plan to use the southern white rhinos as surrogates. </p>
<p>In Germany, they have stored sperm (possibly eggs too?) from the northern white rhinos, and in <del>South Africa</del>Kenya they have the last two living females whose eggs can be extracted. These are then fertilized in vitro, and the general idea is to implant them into female southern white rhinos, so that they give birth to northern white rhinos.</p>
<p>In the 19th century, the southern white rhino had a global population in the double digits, but because of conservation efforts, it now has a global population around 20,000. I really hope we can see a similar recovery with the northern white rhino in the 21st century, but it'll be a long shot. The necessary technology is expensive and requires skilled labor, and the biological aspect of it, (like manually fertilizing an egg under lab conditions and getting viable embryos) is still in the 'taming chaos' stages. And don't forget that the northern white rhino population was on the knife's edge of extinction before, and now it's in free fall towards extinction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the San Diego Zoo Safari Park is working on using southern white rhinos as surrogates. They have a &quot;rhino rescue center&quot;  and I believe they attempted implementing a female last summer, although I'm not sure how that turned out (I'm assuming it didn't work, since that would likely have been big news if it did)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you said about rhinos is to my understanding correct but from my knowledge domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) are a sub-species of the Canis Lupus species, as well as the other wolves/dingos like the Eurasian Wolf (Canis Lupus Lupus). So technically domestic dogs, wolves, and dingos are subspecies of the Canis Lupus Species or am I completely wrong?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In recent years it seems that biologists are using genetic differences in subspecies to call them separate species even though some set of genetic differences would be expected for non-interbreeding populations with minor morphological and behaviorable differences. It's hard to get a straight answer these days as to what is species vs a subspecies</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think one of the more <del>layman</del> antiquated definitions for 'species' is that two animals of different species generally cannot interbreed, while animals of different subspecies might be able to breed. </p>
<p>Apparently there is not a single defintion for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" target="_blank">'species'</a>. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Like domestic dogs are similar species to wolves, foxes, coyotes etc NOT subspecies.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not a good example. Many consider dogs to be a subspecies of wolf, and foxes are actually an entirely different genus. The only apt comparison in the group is between wolves and coyotes, which are two species in the same genus.</p></div>		</li>
