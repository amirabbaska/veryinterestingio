			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there are rehearsals. Not full rehearsals, but a general run through beforehand so that contestants know where to look, what happens when, etc. like a graduation rehearsal. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't call that a rehearsal, more just making sure you don't have your contestants looking like gormless idiots on TV. That was a problem this guy who does a Wheel of Fortune type game at anime conventions had before he started screening his contestants. One time he got 3 people up there (in a 3 person game) who didn't know what vowels were.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Must depend on the show. I was on one recently and they certainly told us what to do and where to look, but it was a friendly, one-minute chat before the cameras started rolling rather than a 'rehearsal'.</p>
<p>But yeah, I learned that an inexpensive-looking talk show in my city cost $5 million per episode to make. A few thousand in prize money definitely pales in comparison, rehearsal time or no. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone lied to you. It's not remotely plausible that each episode of a talk show costs 5 million. Game of Thrones season 1 was about 5 million an episode. This is 5 years old but has the Tonight Show at 350k per episode: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tonight-show-in-nyc-costs-less-to-produce-2013-4" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tonight-show-in-nyc-costs-less-to-produce-2013-4" target="_blank">https://www.businessinsider.com/tonight-show-in-nyc-costs-less-to-produce-2013-4</a></a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is right. I was on a judge show and they paid up to 5k of a settlement, plus $300 cash, hotel, transportation to and from hotel AND your hometown. I was curious how they could afford to just drop cash like that, and then I learned exactly what you described. I bet all the payouts they do for an entire day, which is all day back to back shooting, isn't even close to the cost of the celebrity judge. It's quick and they're &quot;interviewing&quot; the people leaving as the next trial is starting, beside the people for the next case who are already makeuped and microphoned up. Then it's gtfo your rides already here and your trains leaving soon. </p></div>		</li>
