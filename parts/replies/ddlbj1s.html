			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Are the left radicals organized in any particular order or do you just flip until you find the one you are looking for?... Is this method of finding words very complicated to use, or does it just seem complicated in my head because it is a totally foreign concept to me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: <em>Remember Chinese characters are originated as drawing symbols of basic concepts like wood 木, water 水, human 人, which evolved into radicals. The current form of characters is a simplified version of the symbols. Somehow we organized these in an easy to read form is based on the stroke number, then the complexity of the concept.</em></p>
<p>HongKonger here. For us Cantonese users, the &quot;radicals&quot; are also sorted in stroke numbers. It is listed on the first few pages of the dictionary. And when you reach the section for the radical, there is a small list on top of the page so that you can locate your character easily by remaining strokes.</p>
<p>Radicals doesn't always appear on the left. Example 國(country), the radical is 囗(symbolically means something in group, often mistaken as 口(mouth)); or 龜(tortoise), the character itself is the radical. Or even 這(this), the radical is often mistaken by young learners to be 辶(3 strokes, we call this he &quot;boat&quot; radical), in fact you have to search for 辵(7 strokes). So after the index of radicals, there is a special index for &quot;hard-to-find radical&quot; and they are listed in stroke order too.</p>
<p>Some dictionary offer the the conversion of these weird radicals on the radical index. Consider 部 and 除, they have the same written radical 阝(3 strokes, we call this the &quot;ear&quot; radical), and in fact if it is on the left, it's main radical should be 阜(8 strokes), if it is on the right, it's 邑(7 strokes). So some dictionary will state: &quot;阝(左)，見阜&quot; (for this radical on the left, refer to 阜).</p>
<p>Nobody uses pronounciation search because nobody learn them in school in HK. Cantonese syllables are complicated and not that intuitive.</p>
<p>However for advanced users like me, modern dictionary contains Chinese Input search. Much easier to locate hard to find radicals.</p>
<p>Hope this exaplains well :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really nice explanation. Thanks. I'm just starting to learn hanzi and two free apps on Android that have helped are &quot;in flow&quot; for reading and Chinese handwriting reader for writing. There's also an open university app which helps you learn strokes and order. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The radical isn't always on the left, and there are a limited number of them.  Usually dictionaries have a one page index showing on which page each radical begins in the dictionary.  They are ordered by stroke order.</p>
<p>The dictionary I have also has a full index for every character showing which page its entry appears.  This index is ordered by pronunciation using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bopomofo" target="_blank">bopomofo</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It definitely sounds harder because it's entirely alien.  I used to think that type of dictionary was ridiculous! As your familiarity with how Chinese characters are constructed grows, it becomes easier and easier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excel would most likely be sorting by Unicode value. Latin characters have their values increment in alphabetical order (although the uppercase and lowercase letters are widely separated, so in software it's usually checked as if it was all upper or lower case). There's probably some logic to the order for Chinese characters, but I don't know what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm actually not sure.  I should say, that I don't actually know Chinese.  I studied Japanese in school and just happened to know that Chinese and Japanese have similar systems for organizing dictionaries.  In Japanese, they typically order words based on how that word is pronounced.  There are 46 syllables that make up every Japanese word and they have a specific ordering.  So it works pretty much like alphabetizing something in English and this is how they would organize something like books on a shelf in a bookstore.  I know that Chinese has a similar system called pinyin, I just don't know if that's how the Chinese typically order things. </p>
<p>I tested this out on my computer with Excel.  The way it orders characters is not based on the stroke order and it's not how I would expect to see those words ordered in Japanese, so I'm guessing that it is based on Chinese pronunciation.  It's also entirely possible that it's not organized in any correct sense.  East Asian Languages tend to get the shaft with software support.  I've seen some software where the ordering system is &quot;alphabetical by what the English translation of this word would be&quot;</p></div>		</li>
