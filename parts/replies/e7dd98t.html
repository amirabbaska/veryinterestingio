			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, Groucho can walk onscreen and I start laughing. You're right about the regional differences, can't imagine everyone in the same town pronouncing a word the same way let alone an entire country. It just surprised me when I heard 'saxophone-ist' (from Benny Krueger to Rudy Wiedoeft in an old film short) because I'd (UK) never heard that pronunciation before. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My spelling was to indicate the pronunciation, not how it would appear in print. In print, you are correct.</p>
<p>In any case, as others have said, some say FLEW-tist, others say FLAW-tist and I think I recall FLOUT-ist. Perhaps I don't hear it enough to know how most people say it. And HS was too long ago, when I was in the school's marching and concert band.</p></div>		</li>
