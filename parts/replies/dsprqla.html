<p>I'm kinda dumb lol</p>
<p>So somewhere down the line, the merchant has to &quot;identify&quot; itself before it takes the money, right? Is this what the &quot;credit card processing permission&quot; means? Is there a standard procedure, like what happens during fraud? Can the merchant be at fault for accepting a transaction from the thief?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a dumb question at all.</p>
<p>Yes, a merchant needs permission from its bank to accept a credit card payment, including a merchant account number. The bank can cancel this if it feels the merchant is not taking enough security precautions, or is engaging in crime.</p>
<p>If they take your number and run up charges you didn't request, the punishment can be very severe.</p>
<p>If they use your number to order stuff from another merchant's website, that other merchant may not get paid, but won't get in serious trouble as long as they followed the standard procedure in accepting the card number.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My sister-in-law works at a bank, so she has a pretty good knowledge of this sort of ting.  She and my brother went out to dinner, got really bad service and didn't tip.  She later saw that the charge to her credit card had a tip added.  She called the manager, who didn't seem to take the matter seriously and wasn't terribly interested in going through the receipts.</p>
<p>So she contacted their credit card processor knew exactly who to talk to and what to say.  A few days later she got a very desperate call from the owner, informing her the server and the manager had been fired, her meal had been comped, and the he wanted to offer her a $50 gift certificate.  Apparently his credit card processing was about to be turned off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>also &quot;the merchant&quot; isn't one entity.  it's every customer service, IT, accountant, outside consultant, whatever person that works or has access to the system.   there are still plenty of companies that have employee access to customer credit card info.   just because the company doesn't condone stealing your info doesn't mean employees' don't.    </p>
<p>modern ecommerce platforms operate under self governed standards called PCI.   PCI operates in several levels.  at the lowest level, it's honor system that my site is secure and my process is secure.   but it still is only just a few lines of code to take that credit card you entered and save it or email it   instead of only just sending it off to the card processor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember too that, at least in the US, law mandates that credit card holders are entitled to a number of powerful protections. I've had my card number stolen a few times and fraudulent charges made more than once. I haven't been responsible for any of them and usually, it's my bank noticing the oddball transactions before I've ever looked at my statement. </p>
<p>So yeah, a store COULD take all your info and run up your bill but you're not necessarily at risk for having to pay the charges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's why I almost never use my debit card.  With a CC I have all those protections plus the buffer that I've only lost the fraudulently barged credit temporarily. With a debit card, it ties up your actual cash, even if you charge it as credit.  Yes, you'll eventually get it back after desputing the charges, but that takes time and your cash is inaccessible until it's resolved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If someone used your card fraudulently and you dispute it, it is the equivalent of that transaction being completed with counterfeit currency:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the fraudster uses your payment info to buy something</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the merchant accepts payment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the merchant is then contact by your bank to say the transaction was fraudulent and deducts the payment from the merchant</p>
</li>
<li>you get your money back and the merchant is out the money</li>
</ul>
<p>think of it like conterfeit currency</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>fraudsters pays with fake bills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>owner takes fake bills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>owner cannot deposit fake bills</p>
</li>
<li>owner is out money because he was frauded  </li>
</ul>
<p>Merchants have a responsibility to assure they are not frauded. They can ask and copy your id, and would use the id to confirm you own the credit card. responsibility is unfairly shifted to merchants, but that is just so consumers will trust credit cards and keep using them. </p>
<p>if a merchant is hit with many disputes, or if they do certain things that may tarnish the card brand, then Visa, amex, discover, mastercard could black list them. They get put on a thing called a &quot;match list&quot; which is accessible industry wide. if a merchant is on the match list, no one can hook them up to credit services. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth nothing this is why credit cards are changing to use chips. Chips implement a protocol using one-time codes such that simply replicating the data from a single transaction isn't sufficient to clone a card. Unfortunately, they still don't work for online transactions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All of this takes extra work, and I doubt that MasterCard would stop processing payments for the less IT savvy customers until fraud gets a lot worse.</p>
<p>Seriously, look at their half hearted joke &quot;MasterCard Secure code&quot;/&quot;verified by visa&quot; - they obviously don't think that their customers will manage anything more difficult than entering a password in an iframe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that part of this is because the US has had online verification of credit cards for a very long time, plus robust consumer protection laws. Online verification makes it very easy to validate/verify every transaction at the point of purchase. With the exception of pay-after-you-use like restaurants, substantial fraud is easily prevented.</p>
<p>The chip-and-PIN systems used throughout Europe were designed to support offline use (for merchants without a phone line/Internet connection). Whereas in the US its long effectively been required to have an Internet connection or phone line to process every single transaction. All of these differences make comparing the total system security very difficult.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They <em>can</em> use tokenization, but AFAIK it's not a requirement of EMV.  Things like Android Pay do use it, though.</p>
<p>Chips don't really help with online purchases. I think the only real protection is the security code on the back of cards and IIRC merchants aren't supposed to save/store that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is safer, though, because most online purchases are invisibly processed by a third party company where the numbers will be shielded from view by most people. At a restaurant you literally hand your card to a low level employee who walks away with it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As I said in an earlier reply,  in most of Europe and Canada,  Australia, etc etc,  that no longer happens.  The &quot;low level employee&quot; brings the card machine to your table,  <em>you</em> put your card in the machine, press a few buttons to confirm the amount and enter your PIN, then take your card.  The LLE never gets his/her hands on your card.</p></div>		</li>
