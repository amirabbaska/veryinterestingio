<p>However, when I have drunk munchies, I tend to make more of a thing of it and plan for something epic than just eating a quick bowl of cereal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So true. I realized that the best trick to prevent overeating is simply to not wait until I'm starving before having a meal. </p>
<p>Me when slightly hungry: &quot;Kinda hungry but been trying to get more fit lately I don't mind eating a bit on the lighter side today&quot;</p>
<p>Me if I wait a few hours before getting food: &quot;Let's literally order everything on the meal today&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add that there might even be a habitual behavior to it too.</p>
<p>If you learned to drink with mates and then always went for late night foods after, then you might have food cravings after a few beer in a bar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this, consumption of a lot of heavily carbonated beverages (beer, soda mixers etc) expands the stomach with gases and liquid. The body speeds up digestion to make room for them only to contract and feel more empty when the fleeting filling is gone. </p>
<p>If you're hungry you can fill yourself up on water alone for 20 minutes or so until you pee it out and you fee even hungrier. If you swallow a bunch of air you will feel full and bloated until you pass gass. Your uncle wasn't kidding when he burped to &quot;make room for more&quot;. </p></div>		</li>
