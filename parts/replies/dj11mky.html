			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember; there was also higher power demand leading up to the test. So the plant was operating at a higher range when it should have been cooling down. They then rushed the reactors to a lower operating range leading to the reactor poisoning among other issues... it's also speculated that most of the entire staff was undertrained and couldn't identify what was happening until it was too late. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read this some where and am not qualified to explain but I hope someone can chime in. The oh shit moment was when they realized it had started to get out of control so they put the control rods aggressively back in hoping to shut down the testing situation. But that particular design, the insertion of the rods temporarily accelerated the reaction. And they lost control. Please someone chime in. I find all this very interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that was part of the problem. The bottom 6&quot; or so of the control rods ADDED reactivity (different material than the rest of the rod). It was designed that way to even out the way the core burned out. It not good for safety. They also pulled rods out farther than they were procedurally allowed to. So once the burnable poisons turned, many of the rods were all the way out.</p>
<p>The last factor was the core had a positive void coefficient, meaning when steam is made in the core, it adds reactivity. This was because it was a graphite moderated reactor. When they put the rods in, it created a bigger steam bubble (it was a boiling water reactor) in the core, putting them past where they could control the reactor.</p>
<p>At that point, the steam bubble grew so big that the pressure of it broke the vessel head off and shot it through the building above. That was the explosion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the time they realized they screwed up till the boom was only a couple of seconds.  That core was gonna go prompt critical they just helped it along</p></div>		</li>
