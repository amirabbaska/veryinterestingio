			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, force is the rate of change of momentum, which is M*dV/dt. The mass of the ant is tiny and even if you have an acceleration of 100ms^2, an ant with mass 1 mg would experience a force of 0.1 N. </p>
<p>So if an ant hits you at that accelartion, you'll feel a 0.1N force. To put that into perspective, it would feel like there are 10 ants resting on your hand. </p>
<p>And given my experience of squishing ants, I think an ant can survive feeling as if there are 10 ants stacked above it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eeey! :D I like this. </p>
<p>I read an old British <em>QI</em> (&quot;Quite Interesting, based on the BBC TV show of the same name) book, and it explained how crazy some physical interactions are if you really look deeply into the science behind them.</p>
<p>For example, when a car travelling down the freeway hits a bug, the bug splats on the screen and dies horribly, but that's not the whole story. The bug and the screen both decelerate on impact to a speed of 0, which of course silently obliterates the bug, but when that part of the screen's speed changes from the speed of the car to a speed of 0mph (to match the bug), the glass screen <em>springs back</em>, and this is what causes the very loud 'click' sound!</p>
<p>Also, glass cracks at the speed of sounds. This doesn't have anything to do with my previous ramblings, but i wanted to end on a marginally relevant and slightly smaller paragraph for the purpose of aesthetics.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Might want to clarify that the V is velocity, not volume. I typically assume V is volume and v is velocity, but that might just be how it's shown in my physics textbooks</p></div>		</li>
