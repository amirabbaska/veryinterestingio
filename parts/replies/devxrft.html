			<div class="markdown"><p>Timbres for instrument types also are due to the body of the instrument and the absorption/reflection of sound waves. For example if I were to make a bass out of rosewood (a very dense brittle wood used in mallet percussion bars) it would sound much less boomy, and full compared to an ash or maple bass. This is due to differences in wave propagation through the air and the body.</p></div>		</li>
