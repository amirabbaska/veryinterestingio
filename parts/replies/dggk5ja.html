			<div class="markdown"><p>This change also fueled the new American Dream that everyone should go to college in order to survive. But spoiler alert, there aren't enough jobs in America for every college graduate now so we have people STILL earning low wages but also now have massive student loan debt [We also have an administration that's currently stripping us of student loan repayment protections that the last administration put in place, but that's another conversation]. If you're not already stuck with student loans, do yourself a favor and really think about your future before diving into college. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do you really, REALLY need to get a college degree to do what you want in life or will a trade school, certification, etc. give you the same outcome? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do need a degree, are you willing to take longer to graduate than your friends (ie, more than 4 years)? If so, take breaks to work and save money in order to not need student loans. They're a scam! It took me over 7 years to graduate but I came out with a lot less student loans than my friends. This, along with working an extra job this past year, allowed me to already repay back all of my student loans (4 years after graduating). </p>
</li>
<li>If you do need a degree, are you willing to relocate for your career? And I don't mean across the state. I mean across the country or even around the world. That's the reality we live in now. If you aren't willing to relocate, take another good hard look at my first paragraph.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may only be a teenager or in your early 20's, but you have the tools at hand to make a well informed decision about your future that could place you far ahead of your peers. Good luck!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All these points are valid but seems no one has mentioned how the insurance industry really has impacted these changes over time. There was a time when no one needed insurance because most things were reasonably priced; we have sacrificed wage increase that should exist with an entire industry that bankrupts most people after just one use of the service. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ultimately inflation of most services and common products (insurance, cars, homes, education) have all risen. Intertwine that with scarce, low-income jobs, you end up with our current situation. Many speak poorly of millennials, but in all honesty, they were born into a significantly more complicated and incredibly expensive socioeconomic system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody needed health insurance because healthcare itself was in its infancy. If your problem couldn't be solved with some penicillin, a cast, or an hour long surgery, the doc would just shrug and wish you well. </p>
<p>These days, we have robots performing microsurgery, drugs that are literally tailored to an individual's genetics, and a slew of lifestyle drugs that prior generations would have considered ridiculous luxuries. There are certainly some major problems with the way healthcare is handled in the U.S., but at the end of the day, it's not fair to compare things to 50+ years ago. That shit was cheap because it was primitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More that those conveyor belts didn't need guys to stand next to them, really. There's a much larger labor force than there was before, but easy to access jobs are concentrated in the service sector, which for decades had a militaristic resistance to unionization, while jobs that people were trained for are being taken by technological advances.</p></div>		</li>
