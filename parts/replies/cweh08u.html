			<div class="markdown"><p>There are actually some words for these numbers:</p>
<p>70 = septante</p>
<p>80 = octante (old) or huitante </p>
<p>90 = nonante</p>
<p>which are used in Belgium or Switzerland for example. </p>
<p>The 60-10 (70), 4-20 (80) and 4-20-10 (90) form is from our celtic roots which used a vincésimal system (base 20), during the middle age, the vicésimal system was more common (ex 30 was &quot;20 et 10&quot;), if you read some Molière writings, you can see some numbers written this way. So, one in all, the French french numbers names is a mix of decimal (modern) and vincésimal (original, celt) system, where the Belgium or swiss one is decimal only.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Dutch-speaking Belgian, I have been taught in French class that the forms septante and nonante exist, but are not the official or preferred way. Being the language whores that we are (4 in most high schools), we adapt to this of course. Never heard of huitante, that's only in Switzerland I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huitante sounds weird for me too, but I'm French and have only been in Belgium so I'm more used to Octante, I'm not really sure where Huitante is used, it just doesn't sounds right to me, the root just feel too different from SEPT-ante and NON-ante that are directly from the Latin. I know that &quot;huit&quot; comes from the latin OCT- but I can't imagine how you went from one to the other as it sounds so different, many drunken nights maybe.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm pretty sure that &quot;Neuvante&quot; doesn't exists, so Huitante really doesn't makes sense to me :p</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why my favorite numbers in French are 97-99. The fact that 97 is &quot;four twenty ten seven&quot; is just fabulously ridiculous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless your teacher is the type to say &quot;nineteen hundred ninety-nine&quot; instead of &quot;one thousand nine hundred ninety-nine.&quot; I was taking french in '99 and I said &quot;dix neuf cent quatre vingt dix neuf&quot; every freaking day lol.... But yeah, either way it's fun times.</p>
<p>When the year became &quot;deux mille&quot; i didn't know what to do with myself, i was so.... unsatisfied. lol</p></div>		</li>
