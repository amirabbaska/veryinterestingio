			<p>Wow. That's almost just as stupid as calling the letter W a 'double U'.</p>		</li>

			<p>Best I can tell you is that it's the remnants of a base 20 system. I can't tell you exactly why it only affects numbers 70-99, other than to guess that there weren't as much use for those numbers. <br><br>Then you add in the weirdness that France (and not other French speaking countries) have for tradition, and you can understand why France alone didn't change to septante, huitante, and nonante.</p>		</li>

			<p>Basically, <em>a long time ago</em> we used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigesimal" target="_blank">vegidesimal system</a> (base 20, opposed to our decimal system, base 10), and word like quatre-vingt-dix are just remains of this old system.  <br>Other crazy words existed, like vingt-et-dix (twenty and ten) for 30, deux-vingt (two-twenty) for 40, trois-vingt (three-twenty) for 60, etc. !<br><br>You'll notice this doesn't explain why not use septante instead of soixante-dix, but hey, we never claimed to be entirely logical ! (There's probably a good reason hidden somewhere in history though)</p>		</li>
