			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's pure salt (NaCl), nothing, until it melts.  If it has additives/is not pure NaCl, you might get some interesting chemistry, I don't know.</p>
<p>(Interesting fact, NaCl melts at a much higher temperature than either pure Na or pure Cl.  Gotta love those ionic bonds.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maillard and caramelization are two different set of reactions using different reagents at different temperatures and leading to different products. Your answer seems to imply they are the same thing, just with different reagents.</p>
<p>To simplify a lot:
With reducing sugars and aminoacids at 135-140°C you get the Maillard reactions, which in the end, after creating some sticky intermediates, gives you brown-yellow, nice smelling and tasty compounds you'll probably want in almost every recipe.
With just sugars and no proteins, at 160° C you get caramelization, which leads to yellow-red-brown, slightly acidic, slightly bitter and rich-smelling compounds which are nice in a number of recipes. With anything organic at 180°C and above you get black compounds (not pure carbon), most of which are foul smelling and very bitter. You <em>may</em> want some of those in your recipe, basically when you are smoking meat or fish and when coffe or cocoa beans are roasted. Some kinds of food should never be brought at such high temperatures because they may lead to potentially carcinogenic compounds.</p>
<p>It is not easy to obtain pure carbon by burning something made of complex, highly reactive organic compounds: it takes the right amount of heat, a lot of time and a little oxygen (but not too much). </p>
<p>Carbon itself isn't that bitter, not as much as burnt food.</p></div>		</li>
