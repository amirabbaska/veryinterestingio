			<div class="markdown"><p>The T52 and the SZ-40/42 were used for (radio)teletype traffic, and while based on a similar concept to the Enigma, in that it was electromechanical and used rotors as part of the cryptographic process, it was very different.</p>
<p>The Kriegsmarine still used Enigma machines to communicate with their ships, but high command stuff would go over teletype links enciphered with T52 or SZ-40/42. Though the Kriegsmarine Enigma machines <em>were</em> different from the standard Heer/Luftwaffe machines (especially with regards to the M4 machines).</p>

<p>What is very cool, is that the &quot;first&quot; computer, the COLOSSUS was built to crack the SZ-40/42 codes used by the OKW on their teletype links. (The Turing-Welchman Bombes not being computers in the least.)</p></div>		</li>
