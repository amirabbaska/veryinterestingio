			<div class="markdown"><p>Channel Tunnel used giant boring machines far enough under the seabed that the rock/chalk above was strong enough not to collapse in.  The tunnels were then reinforced with concrete.  Interestingly, they dug from both sides and met in the middle.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a difficult question to answer, mainly because u/MrDowntown mentioned <em>three</em> different methods of tunnel construction and you asked if that's the way the Chunnel was built....</p>
<p>The Channel Tunnel is actually three tunnels. These tunnels were created by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_boring_machine" target="_blank">tunnel boring machines</a> (TBMs). As the material was excavated and removed, the machines advanced and the walls of the tunnels were reinforced.</p>
<p>The material being excavated was chalk, which is both relatively easy to drill through and also impermeable to water. (Though the first few miles of digging on the French side required the TBMs to be of a type that held water at bay somewhat, as there was greater water permeability at that point.)</p>
<p>Work proceeded from both directions. The English TBMs ended up drilling down and were buried in place (and ended up being used as electrical grounds); the French TBMs were dismantled and removed from the tunnels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, three tunnels. Two with a single track each for the trains (both English and French railways run on the left) and a third to act as a service tunnel or for evacuation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched a documentary on the building of one of the many underwater tunnels in my area (Norfolk/Virginia Beach). They're truely amazing pieces of engineering, and also truely amazing traffic creators. Tourist and visitors and a handful of locals completely loose their shit when encountering these roadways to hell. 55mph speed limit, but you're rarely ever going to hit that. The newest tunnel doesn't have this problem though... Quite the opposite in fact. It's 35mph in the midtown tunnel heading west, but everyone drive 55-70mph because it's a few feet wider and taller than the other, much older tunnels, as well as brighter. </p></div>		</li>
