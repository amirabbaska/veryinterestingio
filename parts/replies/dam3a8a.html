			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading articles and comments bashing T-Mobile for violating net neutrality and having to take a step back (as an employee) and look at 'Binge On.' They just kept adding apps to the list of what is zero-rated so it seemed fair enough. Glad they cut the BS and just went unlimited. </p>
<p>With all the backlash I saw with Binge On, I can't imagine the shitshow that would result if they did what AT&amp;t is doing. It's like the hypothetical scenario of why net neutrality is important incarnated. Verizon did the same thing with their Go 90 too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Knowing someone at T-Mobile who was tangentially involved in the Binge-On program, you are right, they tried to get everyone they possibly could to get on the program.</p>
<p>Additionally, they are trying to work with YouTube to get this setup as well, but there's apparently a lot of issues to work with, but it is ongoing.</p>
<p>Music streaming as well, has basically been setup to all that is possible, with the only exceptions that arent on Binge-On, being either owned by competitors (or ISPs who are effectively competitors), or not large enough to really go through the standard process, and they are working on getting this resolved.</p>
<p>Program's still ongoing though.</p></div>		</li>
