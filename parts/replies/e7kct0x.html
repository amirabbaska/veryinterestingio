			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what happens when people faint. The blood pressure can't sustain blood being pumped up to the brain so the bodies response is shut everything down and you fall and gravity can get blood to the brain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Might be a bit anal, but it's not like the body's response is to fall in an attempt to get to a horizontal position - there's no intelligent design here. The brain's oxygen supply decreases temporarily and we collapse simply because we can no longer maintain consciousness, not as a protective reflex. That we (normally) end up in a position that facilitates cerebral blood flow is just lucky.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will make you very tired because of the on/off experience. You could obviously suffer depression because of this or become very elated. Think of being scared by a fierce dog or having a “fun” experience like one of those sling shot things at the Fair. Both produce the same effect, but one has pleasurable thoughts (woo that was fun, I’m glad I did it) against “that dog could’ve torn my throat out). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, unfortunately...if your CNS is activating the “flight, fight, or freeze” response chronically, and your body is consistently exposed to the stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol, there can be negative long term effects. High blood pressure, ulcers, IBS/digestive issues, greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes, to name a few. Our body has developed a fantastic way of protecting us and keeping us alive in dangerous situations, but when our body is in that “flight, fight, or freeze” mode for too long or too often (either through extreme stress and trauma or through an anxiety disorder where this response is activated incorrectly), it can be dangerous to our health. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, he's confused. The overall response in a sympathetic stimulation will be an increase in BP, secondary to overall vasoconstriction (exceptions are heart and skeletal muscles. Why would you want to drop your BP in a stressful situation? You don't. </p></div>		</li>

<p>beta 1 has positive inotropic effects which means there is a stronger contraction</p>
<p>beta-2 causes smooth muscle relaxation systemically (most affects blood vessels)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding of it was beta 2 receptor were in bronchial smooth muscle. So beta 2 agonists that work on that, salbutamol, does it for bronchodilation. Asthma, anaphylaxis.</p>
<p>Adrenaline works on alpha 1 and 2 and also beta 1 and 2. I have heard that the beta actions can outweigh the alpha effects, but still, beta 2 = lungs &amp; beta 1 = heart.</p>
<p>So by administering adrenaline, activating the SNS, it will cause peripheral vasoconstriaction (a1&amp;2), have positive ino &amp; chronotropic effects (b1) and cause bronchodilation (b2).</p>
<p>That is why when you have an MI there is a catecholamine dump, release of adrenaline etc, the patient goes pale and clammy. The paleness comes from peripheral vasoconstriction, because less blood is near the surface.</p>
<p>Then you have anaphylaxis. increased vasodilation, vascular permeability and bronchospasm. The patient will be pink. The blood is near the surface.</p>
<p>Give anaphylaxis patients adrenaline, reverse vasodilation (a1&amp;2), reverse bronchospasm (b2).</p>
<p>Anyway by that logic it should be SNS activation = peripheral vasoconstriction. So heart drop can't be adequately explained by saying it is vasodilation. Like, does the drop in blood pressure only effect the heart? the brain? is what OP is really really feeling like? orthostatic hypotension?</p>
<p>I would say the 'heart flop' is from immediate beta 1 action, increased heart rate and force of contraction. Coz its 'heart flop', not 'feeling faint from having paroxysmal hypotension'.</p>
<p>Anyway, that is just my understanding of it. Also a student,may be wrong. Probably just throwing around a bunch of random science words to look smart.</p></div>		</li>
