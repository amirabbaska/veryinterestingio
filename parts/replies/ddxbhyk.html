			<div class="markdown"><p>Thinking with an internal audio component would seem to be a learned behaviour. Babies can make (simple) logical connections and hold (basic) opinions long before they learn any language complex enough to express those thoughts.</p>
<p>Although I understand why that voice in your head is a natural conclusion of language, it's certainly not necessary. Like... I assume you can look at a red car, and <em>feel</em> it's redness, understand its hue, without the word &quot;red&quot; being shouted in your brain? I can't imagine a narrative being able to process all incoming data. So why is it necessary for all thought to be represented with that narration? </p>
<p>(Apologies if this sounds negative, I'm aiming more for thought provoking than critical).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting... I find when I'm making complex decisions, I tend to list out the pros-and-cons verbally in my head. But If I'm trying to solve a problem, like if there's an obstacle in my way, I don't think &quot;okay now I must move around this obstacle&quot;. I just <strong>do</strong>. Anyone else relate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, I used the red car analogy in a previous discussion. You don't need to think &quot;breathing in, breathing out&quot;  or &quot;putting on my pants&quot; or &quot;using spoon to eat cereal&quot;, so it's just an extension of that really. You are still deliberately eating cereal etc without the need to run a director's commentary about it! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But a lot of things aren't &quot;said&quot; in my narration.  If I want to interact with something/one that will understand my words then I'll think in words.  If it's me just processing incoming data, I don't have narration.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't. And that's kinda shitty by itself sometimes cause you realize once you bring a bunch of thoughts together and put them into words to tell someone that you hadn't ever really put together the different pieces into a clear picture before. Mostly if it's something stressful probably cause your brain doesn't want to think about it that much</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My experience, and it seems like the experience of a lot of others, is that thought is more conceptual and visual and less language focused. So when I think about something it's typically closer to imagining or dreaming than talking, if that makes any sense. </p>
<p>To me, having to 'speak' thoughts sounds oddly slow and linear (not saying it is actually any slower, just trying to give you a flavour of what a different experience of it is). It also sounds kinda schizophrenic, the idea of having a voice in my head talking that I can hear but which is also me. If that's me, who is perceiving it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you do not have an inner monologue? What happens when you read a book? Does your mind speak the words as you read them or does your mind create the scenario like in a dream?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you have any internal voice when you read to yourself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This always shocks everyone, on both sides. I brought this up with my friends, that there's no voice in my head when I read; they assumed you <em>couldn't</em> read without an inner monologue.</p>
<p>It's the same with general thought; I don't have that internal monologue 99% of the time. I feel like it would take extra concentration to have an audio version of my thoughts playing constantly. </p></div>		</li>
