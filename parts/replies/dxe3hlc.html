			<div class="markdown"><p>Nooooooooo, I would not recommend that.  Most people put their phone in a bag of uncooked rice because the water evaporates out of the phone and into the rice rapidly, thus minimizing long term damage.</p>
<p>The problem with oil is that phones have a lot more than just switches and a few components, they’re full of more advanced/delicate parts inside of them like cameras, the screen and digitizer, speakers, radio transmitters, fingerprint sensors, the battery, glues, paint, stickers, plastics and silicone parts that can actually swell and deform or dissolve if exposed to oil.  Mineral oil would destroy some or all of those components.
Also, oil does not evaporate (usually) so there would be no way to get the oil out again.</p>
<p>I should have specified that oils are used to prevent corrosion in bigger, tougher, and simpler devices like switches and terminal blocks, electrical connecting plugs and some electric motors.  and usually they’re just coated in oil not submerged in it.  Transformers are submerged to prevent arcing not corrosion.</p></div>		</li>
