			<div class="markdown"><p>My girlfriend is several years older than me, and we were out celebrating my 21st last night. I was absolutely trashed, throwing up, a real mess, she was alright at the time. When we woke up, I was fine, she definitely was not. I notice this every time we go out drinking together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The throwing up probably explains a lot of that. Every oz of alcohol you threw up your body didn't metabolize. Therefore less strain on your liver. </p>
<p>Your GF on the other hand had to process everything she drank. </p>
<p>Add in the fact that statistically your liver is probably larger and already better able to process poisons and your self admitted stronger reaction to poisons in general means you're usually dealing with less ethanol and more capacity to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If she's 24/25 that would explain it completely. Around that age your ability to shrug off a hangover disappears. At least, in my experience and from observation of many friends crossing that particular threshold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd think you were fine because you threw up a lot of the alcohol that was going to be digested in your stomach out. However if your gf didn't throw up, her body has to process all that over time, and when you go to sleep, your body is much slower. If I drink, I always drink early and stop drinking a few hours before I lay down so I don't have to go to bed sloppy as hell.</p></div>		</li>
