			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an oversimplification, of course, but a synthetic delta-9-THC medication, Marinol, is used for appetite as well as some other indications in the United States (<a href="http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/05n0479/05N-0479-emc0004-04.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/05n0479/05N-0479-emc0004-04.pdf</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with Marinol is that it's pretty sliw acting compared to inhalation methods. It reacts about as quickly as an edible, which makes sense. I think it's awesome that there's a legal option for people who are desperate but I've found it to be difficult to use Marinol as an effective treatment for Crohn's at least.</p></div>		</li>
