			<div class="markdown"><p>Communism is the end goal of socialism, socialism is democratic control of the economy. Socialists argue that the system we have now, capitalism, where those with money have total economic power, is anti-democratic. We advocate for workers to seize control of their workplaces and continue running them democratically. </p>
<p>The problem is that the owners aren't happy with this, and the 1% have the government and its police in their pockets. So any socialist revolution unfortunately means taking control of the government, and that's where shit gets messt.</p></div>		</li>
