			<div class="markdown"><p>Food texture, especially in meat, ruins a lot of things for me. It's crappy, doesn't matter how delicious it is if I get, say, a chewy bit that should not be in the dish, I gag on the spot, and then I'm pretty done. Sometimes picking it out and then searching the meal for other similar looking bits and removing any will satisfy whatever my brain decided needed to be fixed, but not always.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Tomato sauces are delicious, but the instant I crunch down on a piece of onion I am going to spew it out. Onions taste lovely (and onion powder a wonderful invention) but their texture is absolutely repulsive.</p></div>		</li>
