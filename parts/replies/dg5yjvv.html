			<div class="markdown"><p>Forces such as gravity directly affect the medium in which acoustic waves propagate, and a nonlinear acoustic wave (especially a shock) can modulate a medium to the extent that gravity becomes important in the dynamics (Example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richtmyer–Meshkov_instability" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richtmyer–Meshkov_instability</a> in gravity-stratified fluids, and Rayleigh-Taylor instability triggered by shocks). Then there is the astrophysical problem of propagation in self-gravitating media. So, it is possible to find cases where gravity directly affects acoustic waves, even if it is not so important for &quot;sound waves&quot; (if defining them as only audible acoustic waves at low amplitudes near Earth's surface).</p></div>		</li>
