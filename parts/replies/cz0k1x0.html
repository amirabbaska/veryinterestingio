			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a way to make pubes grow really, really long? Since they tend to stop growing at a certain length.  Like, trick it into thinking it was just shaved?  </p>
<p>Edit:  I want monster pubes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every hair on your body has a terminal length -- a length beyond which it just won't grow.  That length is different for different hairs and different for different people.  So, if you've never cut those hairs, then whatever length they are now is probably already at the terminal length and they won't grow any further.</p>
<p>This is also why most people can't grow their head hair down to their ankles -- most people's terminal length isn't that long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, follow-up question: does terminal length change with age, or are children capable of having longer hair relative to their bodies than adults are? </p></div>		</li>
