Doctor's have a legal obligation to maintain patient records, are running archaic computer systems, and have the money to buy their files back. I worked for a medical software company a few years ago and ransomware was rampant. Daily backups became extremely important.</p></div>		</li>

<p>would upgrading their system really be that much more expensive than buying the files?</p>
<p>edit - apparently yes, those ransoms are a lot less than what I thought they would be</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MD Anderson’s transition from their ‘90s medical record software to the industry-standard Epic cost them millions of dollars. It’s not just the hardware and software, it’s the training, reintegration, hiring and firing of staff, loss of revenue by bad insurance coding, and general inefficiency. They were prepared to take a $80 million loss but it quickly went over $110 million. They lost over 50% of their income in one year. </p>
<p>Here’s an <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/md-anderson-blames-ehr-costs-for-56-6-drop-in-income.html" target="_blank">article</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/8rd1sq/_/e0qu6s7/?context=1" target="_blank">Here</a> a medical records trainer goes into brief detail about why such a move can be so costly/such a clusterfuck.</p>
<p>Posted with permission from /u/sfxer001 :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Medical Records trainer here who trains Cerner documentation software to providers.   It is so costly and an involved process to upgrade software and train it.   The downtime, training time, reduction in schedules until docs get used to it, lost revenue as a result.  Older doctors cannot keep up with the new software who didn’t go to med school with computer technology.   Revenues could take months to years to return to normal, before improvement is realized.  </p>
<p>Not to mention if your training and implementation team is small, it can take four years to turnover both inpatient and outpatient services from paper-based documentation to electronic for a large hospital.  </p>
<p>It’s not as simple as upgrading software for a handful of IT end users.  This is software for 10,000 end users, and 200 different workflows between them all, which all have to be troubleshooted and trained in a classroom setting with hands on instruction to folks who don’t know what a right click is because they only have an iPad at home, or a shitty MacBook.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in health care.  Last year I racked up an insane amount of overtime because the idiot who the bosses think is too handsome to fire kept saving over a shared spreadsheet with the copy he kept on his computer, that only contained his portion of the work he had done.  It got to the point that I (a lowly peon) would make backups throughout the day, waiting for the inevitable moment he saved over everyone else's work.</p>
<p>My making back-up copies was treated as an alien science by my superiors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Sysadmin and I recently had to make a visit to my local Urgent Care center. They were running XP on all of their computers. I watched the desk person print a document to paper and immediately scan it to a PDF on a separate machine. Then she put the paper copy in a folder and put it in a filing cabinet.  Next she typed all of my insurance card info into her PC, made a photocopy of my card, and then repeated the print, move, scan.  It's ridiculous.</p>
<p>Triplicate bullshit on an end of life OS.  I think I just gave all of my info to China and Russia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technology is a part of it, but industry fragmentation is the other half of this equation.</p>
<p>If OP went to an integrated, group practice they wouldn't have to fill out redundant paperwork or at least a lot less of it.</p>
<p>As it is, much of the US health care delivery system is thousands upon thousands of independent businesses, whose only connection is that they might share some of the same customers. It's like if you take your car from one mechanic to another, the new one isn't going to have your past maintenance records, either.</p>
<p>There are actually lots of regulations and standards in place to facilitate data sharing between providers, but there's not much business incentive for them to do so.</p>
<p>Things are changing, but very slowly.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And that's part of what <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/meaningful-use-and-macra/meaningful-use-and-macra" target="_blank">Meaningful Use</a> tried to solve, by giving hospitals and healthcare providers incentive for moving to certain levels of electronic medical records.  This is all well and good, in theory, but if you're a not-for-profit hospital or smaller rural healthcare facility you don't exactly have the capital to meet the requirements for it.  We've had dealings with rural clinics who did their payroll by hand with punch cards because they genuinely couldn't afford anything better.  </p>
<p>Things like this are what's nearly forcing a move from independent hospitals to healthcare systems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This right here. As someone who works in IT for a medical practice, it's very frustrating how fragmented the industry is. Even when you spend the thousands of dollars to get your EMR vendor to help you set up an interface with another health system, each system stores data differently, and nobody seems to completely follow the specifications for things like HL7 messages, requiring a lot of data massaging, just to get something like an operative report sent to you electronically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dk_lee_writing couldn’t agree more. Everyone in the US needs an EMPI like yesterday (Enterprise Master Patient Index), so whether you’re walking into a doctors office in Vegas or Chicago it’s your universal number and they already know who the hell you are, your medical background/what you’re alergic to, etc.  They can with your ATM card...isn’t your health more important? </p>
<p>The only problem is imagine Donald Trump starting his first day in office by immediately assigning everyone in the US a number in an attempt to one up Obama’s meaningful use program, without incentives....wouldn’t fly.  The first step is incentivizing providers to participate in a program like that.  Connecting the dots is the next logical step, and getting hospitals/practices on board with such a thing requires incentives. </p></div>		</li>
