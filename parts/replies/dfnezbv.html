			<div class="markdown"><p>20 years ago while driving through farmland I turned and said to my wife. These idiots don't realise they are contributing to Australia's drying out, They are destroying their own future. The more trees they remove the less the moisture moves across the surface from the coast. Fewer trees (and crops) grow and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>Sadly some one stated in 1904 (I think) We could never cut down all of Australia's trees. One hundred odd years later in the most part the job is done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not following your argument.  What does carbon sequestration have to do with deforestation?  Sequestration (in one form or another) is necessary if we want to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere.   Deforestation is about making room for agriculture or urban growth.  and just as a side note the rate of deforestation in the US is flat to negative.  We are growing more trees than we cut down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we already cut most of them down when we were developing, which makes us hypocrites for not wanting other developing nations to cut them down.  It's a conundrum.  We should declare the amazon a global treasure and subsidize those countries a ton to protect it or something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that and most global environmental initiatives is the lack of a central global authority to make it happen.  There strong economic and political incentives for individual nations to undercut the authority of any potential global authority.  </p>
<p>The only thing that will save humanity at this point is an alien invasion to unite everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I wasn't talking specifically about the US.</p>
<p>But you asked what carbon sequestration has to do with deforestationâ€”it's in the post text of the OP's question: &quot;Don't trees pull carbon from the atmosphere?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
