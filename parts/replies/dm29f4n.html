<p>Thank you, I thought I was going crazy. I just keep getting sources and academia explained to me. Though that's not to say I don't appreicate all the responses because I really do. I didn't think I'd get this much feedback at all.</p>
<p>The rest of your reply is the answer I was looking for. I really do think when it comes to popular history, the kind that the average joe would read, you can write what you like and the only thing stopping you is the possible backlash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries. A lot of people see a question and rush to respond with whatever they thought the question was (like &quot;how do we know what's true&quot;). It's frustrating when you're the one asking because people don't like it when you respond with &quot;That's great but I didn't ask that&quot;</p></div>		</li>
