And if some effect, were any of these attempted during meditation to see if there was any cumulative effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think they mean that if you are sitting, relaxing, and blocking one of your senses (audio) with a sound designed to be soothing (like many kinds of music), you are going to be in a similar state to meditating regardless of whether the audio itself is special in any way. Which is why they used pink noise as a control. But maybe I misunderstood. I was not a part of the experiment</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not OP, but I'll try to answer this part.</p>
<p>I think any melodic sound similar to those tagged as binaural are good in inducing a meditative state. So the answer to your question I guess would be this: binaural melodies, nature sounds, wind chimes, etc all work the same way, i.e. binaural melodies don't do anything more than that.</p></div>		</li>
