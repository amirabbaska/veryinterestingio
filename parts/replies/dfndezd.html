			<div class="markdown"><p>To give a hypothetical, imagine that there's an assassination attempt on the president.  In trying to do the investigation, someone says that it might have been done with a railgun.  To decide if that's true, the intelligence community decides to use some supersecret technology that can differentiate between a regular explosion and a railgun explosion.  </p>
<p>Now, the intelligence community might not want other countries to know that they have this technology or how it works.  And so when the results come back &quot;not a railgun,&quot; they will just withhold the results (and any indication of the test being done) to protect the technology from discovery. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Secret Evidence, isn't evidence, it's tyranny.</p>
<p>It was a railgun, you say?
How could you possibly know that?
You just do?
Oh and you know who shot the railgun?
How'd you come by that?
National security? That's not even an answer to that question.
Wait, what do you mean he was Russian? Where did that connection come from? Any dots to connect?</p>
<p>Obviously a hysterical overexaggeration, but the core of it is that the concept of secret evidence is inimical to a free and open society, and can trick the populace into agreeing to lots of heinous shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By being completely open, you might give away people currently in the field who are gathering information. You might give away what techniques you are using to anticipate / deal with a catastrophe (can be dangerous because then that can be accounted for by the next people who plan for one) You might give away the exact capabilities of your armed forces / where they are stationed and where they are not. All of that can lead to future threats. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a very good example of this: the destruction of Korean Air Lines flight 007. For those who don't know, KAL007 was shot down on September 1st, 1983 by a Soviet interceptor aircraft after it was mistaken for an American recon airplane, killing all 269 people on board. </p>
<p>Because of the seriousness of the incident, the US released records of intercepted communications between the Russian pilots and their flight controllers, thus exposing the fact that they had broken the codes used by Russian air defense communications. Had KAL007 not involved a direct Cold War standoff between the US and Russia, for instance if it had accidentally been shot down by some other country, it's very likely that the radio intercepts would have been treated as classified. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also just doesn't help you. By being open you may silence some dissenters, but you'll invite more that just won't see reason. It's like obamas birth certificate, everyone wanted to see it, after he finally showed it, some people believed it, some people wanted more information like college transcripts, others didn't believe it at all. It didn't help Obama in the end to release his birth certificate.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The way I understand it is that disasters or catastrophes are frequently complicated, and there is a lot of stuff going on, emergency services and government people don't always communicate well, or are confused or even just make some big mistakes.</p>
<p>If they can hide stuff like information, reports and pictures that makes the people who made big mistakes, or made bad decisions look bad for a long time, those people don't have to answer why they made bad decisions or mistakes.  It helps people who were trusted to do the right thing, and did the wrong thing (even if they meant well, or made the best decision at the time with the information they had) not have to answer for it.</p>
<p>Other times, there is information that if released could put in danger government agents, or people who are sources of information who the government doesn't want found out (if the disaster is linked to a foreign country, or terrorism, or a war), like spies.</p></div>		</li>
