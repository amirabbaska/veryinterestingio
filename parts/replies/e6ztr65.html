			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, excepts for a couple of things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I assume the fan would be further away from the sail than in the umbrella/blower example, therefore there would be even more lost air and velocity before it hits the sail and hence less forward “push”</p>
</li>
<li>The shape of the umbrella redirects the air so that it ends up with a backward velocity. A sail is typically much flatter than an umbrella so the air would pretty much just stop rather than being redirected backwards. This too would result in less forward “push”</li>
</ol>
<p>Once again, you would move faster if you just pointed the fan backwards and took the sails down</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get the concept, and net result being reduced force backwards due to losses, but the maths doesn't seem right to me - I need a second opinion.
According to above the umbrella experiences more force than is generated</p></div>		</li>
