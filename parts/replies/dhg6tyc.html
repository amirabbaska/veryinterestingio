			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, no. If the Earth's density was the same the whole way through, then it would be. But because the Earth is denser at the center than in the crust, the effect of moving closer to the core outweighs the effect of losing the crust's contribution to gravity.

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a really great point, the different densities didn't even come to mind. Thanks for the response!</p></div>		</li>
