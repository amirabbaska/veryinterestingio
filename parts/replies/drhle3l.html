			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never taken one apart or studied them but the ones I've seen do not have a pump so they must line pressure to do the separation if they are indeed reverse osmosis. I would guess (but honestly don't know) that the separation from those membranes is much less then a membrane that say a drinking water plant would have. The highest &quot;house&quot; pressure you will get is probably around 80 psi whereas a water plant will have pumps that will generate several times that.</p>
<p>Edit: I should clarify... Less separation does not necessarily mean lower quality. It could mean that maybe the reject stream is 50 percent of the total flow where in an industrial unit the reject stream might be 10 percent meaning much less waste. When you're only treating a few gallons per day for household use whether you waste half a gallon or two gallons really isn't that big of a deal. </p></div>		</li>
