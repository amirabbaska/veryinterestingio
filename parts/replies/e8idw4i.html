			<div class="markdown"><p>This works for most cuts and bruises because the touch sense is prioritized by nerve cells over pain transmission, so when you press on the wound the pressure sense overrides the pain and you feel the pressure, and since the pain lets up it feels better. Release and you're back to where you were. </p></div>		</li>
