			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's a shame that the singularity is almost always depicted as some point in space, usually the center of some big sphere, where all of the doomed travelers just sort of get stacked in one big heap. Not only is that picture wrong, it makes people also think of the impossibility of escape as a result of some massive object <em>pulling</em> you closer. That's not really the case.</p>
<p>It's just that spacetime is so curved beyond the horizon that your end is some finite time later in the future. That's why there's &quot;no escape&quot;, because you're just doomed to end. Some other doomed traveler may meet their end sooner than you even if you crossed the horizon holding hands (thus at the same time) and then let go later. Even though your two futures were at different times, you both end at the same singularity. You don't get that picture by thinking of the singularity as a point in space; you instead get the impression that everyone ends up in the same <em>place</em>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would you mind explaining this in a different way?</p>

<p>How can that possibly be the case? Surely the black hole is pulling you towards it when you are outside the event horizon. Does that suddenly stop being the case when you cross that point? That flies in the face of the fact that nothing special is supposed to happen or be observable when you cross the event horizon. The exact same process is affecting you both before and after you cross that point.</p>
<p>I think I get what you are trying to say, but it seems like it is too clever to the point of making things more difficult to understand. With that definition, gravity really doesn't pull on anything. It just warps spacetime to make it seem like it does. Although that is true, we typically describe gravity as pulling objects together.</p></div>		</li>

<p>(Being literal here, not rhetorical)</p>
<p>What is an event horizon, if not a 3d sphere of points of no return?</p>
<p>Where are the doomed travellers, if not merged into the mass at the center of the point of concentrated mass?</p>
<p>Black holes are not everywhere, they are somewhere.  They are not here, so they must be there.  Somewhere.  They have a location and coordinates.  All bet are off, once inside the EH, sure, but if you want your spaceplane to avoid entering one, you go around it... It is avoidable, and you can go around it.  Therefore, it is a point in space, from which an EH results, and to which the travellers end up stacked in a neutron heap or whatever.</p>

<p>An event horizon is an distance at which you cannot escape.   What is being escaped, something other than a pull?   Other than gravity?</p>
<p>I am a skeptic because the understanding many of us, including me, have is built on science that can be measured/calculated/observed.   Larger mass within the BH ~ larger EH sphere ~ more gravitational pull.  </p>
<p>Yes the gravity warps the space so that light loops back toward the EH, but that is because the mass is within, which adds up to make the gravity.  Something is in there, and gravity comes with it, and gravity pulls.</p>
<p>So where have i gone wrong here?  Something does not add up.</p>
<p>Edit: i hate BHs, i will never understand them.  Do you know of any GOOD documentaries about them for someone with a curious but half decent understanding of physics, astronomy, etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but if the black hole physically takes up space, how does not moving through space towards the singularity also count? And is the singularity just something more dense than a neutron star we dont have a model for, that is a physical object but has so much gravity to create the schwartz field radius?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you please explain this a bit more? Do you mean that, for an observer orbiting the black hole taking snapshots of it, each snapshot will make it appear as though it's a disc? Am I understanding you correctly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A topological 2-space isn't the same thing as a Euclidean plane.  It's the outer surface of a physical thing (at least, that's the simplest layman's explanation, the full definition of topology involves set theory and is a little out of scope for this question).  The outside of a 3-dimensional sphere is 2-dimensional, for instance, as is any convex polyhedron.</p>
<p>Saying 'the event horizon is two dimensional' means just that--you can treat the event horizon as an object, and it has a two-dimensional topology.  the event horizon occupies a 3-dimensional space at that instant of time.  Assuming a black hole has a spherical topology, you're going to see it as a disc, just like any other topological sphere (the disc may be warped or stretched, following the normal rules of topology).  If you have two viewpoints to combine stereographically (multiple cameras, your own eyes, etc.) the disc will present with some semblance of  three-dimensionalness, just like, say, an egg in your fridge would.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you man, I appreciate this! I was actually reading in about this stuff on the web just to ensure I understood all these replies it just so happens that what you just wrote clicked for me nicely in combination with the rest of my findings.</p>
<p>I'm a bit rusty on my uni math, but I've studied enough to read through enough stuff on the web to grasp this, I think. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right now, at t = 0, the event horizon is two-dimensional. It's some surface in space. One second later, at t = 1, the event horizon is still two-dimensional. It's some surface in space. The same thing one second later, at t = 2. Then at t = 3, t = 4, and so on.</p>
<p>It's important to make this distinction because the event horizon is precisely some set of <em>events</em>, i.e., points in spacetime. So even though at each moment in time the event horizon is some surface (it's always topologically a sphere), taken as a whole, the event horizon is really three-dimensional because it's more or less of a sequence of surfaces throughout time. (So two dimensions from it being a sphere and one more from it being throughout time.)</p>
<p>When people talk about the event horizon they <em>usually</em> mean the horizon at a given moment in time. What does the horizon look like right <em>now</em> if I took a snapshot of all of space?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you so much for the reply, this and the other responses have helped me grasp this a bit better. I'd like to ask something more if you don't mind, regarding the non-vanilla black holes you've mentioned.</p>
<p>Now in my layman-level exploration of this stuff, I've read about ring singularities and the ergosphere and so on, which since you're mentioning inner horizons, is what is at work here.</p>
<p>Firstly, am I right in understanding that most (all?) black holes, would be of this sort? </p>
<p>Furthermore... If I'm understanding what you say, this back and forth between these disconnected regions from outer to inner horizon so forth, this is what the &quot;time travel&quot; you've mentioned would be, right? Also, you could pop out in a region with a naked singularity, but -- through the event horizon -- isn't the singularity always naked? Or would this process of crossing through these regions of spacetime make it appear as though you're outside the horizons, but still witnessing the singularity?</p>
<p>One last thing. This would all be possible because of the existence of the ergosphere, right? Would it be possible to &quot;navigate&quot; these regions in any way, or would you be at the whim of the black hole completely?</p>
<p>Hope that's not too much, thank you for taking the time, really appreciate this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The <em>interior region</em> refers to the region of spacetime bounded by the event horizon. In Schwarzschild coordinates, this is the region that corresponds to 0 &lt; r &lt; r<em><em>S</em></em>, where r<em><em>S</em></em> = 2GM/c^(2) is the Schwarzschild radius.</p></div>		</li>
