			<div class="markdown"><p>In Japan, at least, people wear masks when <em>they</em> are sick in order to not cough or sneeze on others (or spread aerosols). People don't tend to wear it when they are healthy (at least not the young people I know). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem of course is that most people aren’t using pathogen-grade masks and so most airborne viruses will fly right through.</p>
<p>However, they’re a great way of signalling to the people around you that you knowingly have a communicable disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing i can see though, is when people cough straight at you by mistake or something, it could help improve your chances of not receiving any saliva or phlem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but I don't think you get viruses that way. When you get them through the air it's because they're in sneezed water droplets which could easily be filtered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have a citation? I would think it would slow down any particles in the air and catch a significant percentage. Also, I bet the virus is usually stuck to water molecules while floating around and not free flowing in the air usually. This would help it be caught I bet.</p>
<p>But I have no evidence to back any of that up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's unfortunately bollocks. Most people you see wearing masks, when you ask them why, will say 予防, which means that they are not in fact sick, and are trying to avoid getting something that's going around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not true, especially in public transport, crowded places and during travel, a lot of Japanese wear them preventative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes perfect sense.  I know we're not supposed to give medical advice on this sub, but I feel this is general enough - we're taught the most important thing(s) to do to prevent infection is to:</p>
<p>Frequently wash your hands.</p>
<p>Don't touch your face.</p>
<p>Especially when in contact with someone who may be ill. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like thinking through aspects beyond the disease permeating the mask. I wonder if it also changes others behavior as well. People are less likely to try to interact physically and you might wash your own hands more if you’ve just been nearby a person with a mask. Japanese already don’t shake hands though and could have totally different compliance rates on hand washing. Even a study on masks could have different results than what the States would get.</p></div>		</li>
