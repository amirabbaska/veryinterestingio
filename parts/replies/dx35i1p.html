			<div class="markdown"><p>The second answer is that a lock can have two passwords at once. If my apartment's password is 31415, and your apartment's password is 27182, but they both have a second password of 11235, then my 31415 key can't open your door, your 27182 key can't open my door, but the owner's 11235 key can open both of our doors.</p>
<p>The slightly less simple answer is that it's not actually two different passwords, but rather than each number in the password can be set to accept two different numbers. So if a lock's &quot;password&quot; is 12345 OR 66666, it'll also accept 62366, 16365, 16646, and so on.   But it <em>won't</em> accept, say, 66231, because the numbers aren't in the right order.</p>
<p>As long as each number is in that correct spot of either of the two passwords, it'll work. With a bit of cleverness and a lot of math, this actually lets you design keys and locks where some keys will only open one lock, some will open multiple but not all locks, and some will open all locks. That's how things like janitor keys work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you have two different keys that open the same lock, how much information about the &quot;password&quot; can you get by comparing their &quot;codes&quot; and the fact that they both work on the same lock?</p></div>		</li>
