			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, if it's cost neutral and the labor comes from an organization under the purview of the executive branch (which obviously includes the army) then he can make it happen. the problem with that would be that he, as commander in chief, in directing the army to do so, would have to operate under the budget that congress has given the army to complete its mission and would directly be taking funds from other things the army needs to spend money on. but hypothetically yes, if he was willing to cease all us army operations in order to direct the funds and manpower at building a wall, he could do it that way. </p></div>		</li>
