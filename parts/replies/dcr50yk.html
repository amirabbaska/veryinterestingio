			<div class="markdown"><p>I read an article recently that had the opinion that complete safety encouraged reckless behavior, That playground equipment should allow the children to hurt (not maim or seriously injure) themselves if they play unwisely.</p>
<p>Anecdote: It was January in Montreal (1950) and quite cold,  I was 5 and climbing the tree in the back yard. My mother yelled to me to get down because I would fall and break my arm or something worse. (Words to that effect anyway)</p>
<p>So I went to the park and climbed the monkey bars. I fell. I broke my arm. I learned that falling on ice breaks an arm sometimes, anesthetic stinks, a plaster cast gets warm as the plaster sets, and that a cast gets itchy underneath. And be more careful with monkey bars</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Actions have consequences, both your body and your skills have limits, and the laws of physics do not care what you thought or what you meant, they will smash your ass in line with their function if you fuck up.</p>
<p>This is an important lesson for kids to learn, the need to analyze their situations, risks, and abilities and be careful.</p>
<p>Additionally: the availability of stuff beyond their abilities helps teach them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>overcome fear</li>
<li>work at accomplishing things over time</li>
<li>challenge themselves and thus stay engaged</li>
</ul>
<p>There are few things so magnetic to a child as a thing that is doable, but challenging. Coincidentally enough, there are few things so essential for their growth and development as things that are doable, but challenging.</p>
<p>I've been sad to see a couple of the playgrounds I once enjoyed as a child replaced with &quot;upgrades&quot; that didn't have nearly so much to do. A beautifully-built, complex, multi-level wooden castle with an amazing set of activities was, when destroyed in a flood, replaced with some plastic model buildings--less to explore, less to climb and balance and swing and run and do, less scope for the imagination. And another, a great big metal jungle gym with rope net and climbing things and tunnels and lots of slides that I played on for years without running out of things to do, was replaced with stuff that didn't compare.</p>
<p>It's sad that sometimes the grown-ups designing these things are so invested in keeping children from being hurt that they fail at keeping children from being bored, or at least, fail to provide the same amount of wonder and exploration that some of us were lucky enough to have had as kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would send my kids there in an instant. I'm glad that I live where our summers are filled with a lot of traipsing woods, exploring creeks and catching critters. I will be sad to send my youngest to kindergarten, where he will come home with pages of homework and be expected to learn things that 5 and 6 year olds are proven to not be ready for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My partner works at a school with a similar curriculum. It's a private school in a crunchy town, and every day the kids go outside in any weather, except extreme cold - like 15 f (-10 c) - and that's a state regulation. This includes the babies and toddlers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, I've noticed a bit of a pushback against hyper safe parks here in the UK.</p>
<p>There seems to be more kit that's less single purpose, &quot;sit in this chair and move this way&quot;, and more climbing and rope based stuff. There's a small park at the end of my parent's road that has a kind of climbing area built out of large logs that cut across each other at interesting angles and goes up really quite high. They also have a decent zip line, and a set of vertical logs embedded in the ground that you can climb up and then between that are way taller than me.</p>
<p>As the dad of a 2.5yo I've suddenly developed a passionate interest in play equipment design and I really hope this trend continues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually pretty true, old school playgrounds, wood chip or ground up tire era helped kids develop basic physical and toughen up. Late 90s and the early 00's saw the rise of ultra safe playgrounds and more supervised which has recently been show to he a contributing factor to higher injuries because children who play on them aren't building up the same physical endurance or resilience. </p>
<p>It's sad to see sometimes but it makes sense to me at least, hand in hand with helicopter parents and having cps called by neighbors for letting your kids walk a few blocks to a park by him/herself </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason we are helicoptery is because other parents.  </p>
<p>When my oldest was about 3, I was sitting on a playground bench, nursing her baby sister. Apparently she fell and was crying. I saw the commotion, didn't see my kid, and wandered over. My kid was fine, but I faced an angry group of mothers and nannies. &quot;Where have you BEEN?! Your child was hurt and LOOKING for you!  We were about to call the police!  She was so SCARED and you weren't HERE!&quot;  Not exaggerating, I had at least three women actually yelling me. Raised voices, in my face. One showed me her phone -- she was literally calling the police. I was about 35 feet away.  </p>
<p>I didn't take my kids to that particular park for a year, I was so ashamed. </p>
<p>Now that I have more experience, I brush things off more easily. But there's always a little voice in the back of my head saying &quot;they can take your kids away, you know... all it takes is one call to CPS&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I'm not imagining stuff. I thought I was over estimating how much safer they seem to be. Mainly that I haven't seen a merry go round in a park in forever. I've just recently started paying attention because I take my 2 year old niece to the park most weekends. And every time I think about it I usually conclude that we're raising a generation of adults that will be afraid of getting hurt.<br />
We need to bring back stuff like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayWeWere/comments/50j436/playground_equipment_early_1900s/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link" target="_blank">this</a>...
