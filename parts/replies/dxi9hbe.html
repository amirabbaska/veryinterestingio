			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah . for what seems like a lot more labor since you need 6 different pieces of wood for the sides instead of 4... and angles cut to match for the lid. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Totally agree with this.  Yeah, it might save on wood, but you'd just end up with more scrap to throw away.  It's not like plastic or metal where you can melt down your waste materials and re-use them.  Whether you have a 4&quot; scrap board or a 6&quot; scrap board leftover, it's not big enough to use on the next one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds better than &quot;to save wood&quot; anyone who is a woodworker could tell you that the amount saved is negligible, and the scraps would be almost useless. Now, it might save some weight, alot of carrying involved with a coffin. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that at first, too.  But think about how difficult it would have been to even mill planks in the time before even water-powered mills.  Youre basically splitting puncheons with wedges and/or adzes and then hand shaving and planing them.  Widths would not be standard; a backboard for a coffin would be multiples of these planks edge-joined - every bit of length you save is probably worth the additional cuts and joins versus trying to mill out more planks.</p>
<p>The scraps wouldn't be useful for structural work, but they would still be useful for small boxes, finer wood-working/clocks, etc.</p>
<p>I could be wrong, though.  Just thinking out loud.  Just keep in mind, these guys had to make their lumber by hand, too.  They didn't have a warehouse full of plywood or 18&quot; wide planks.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I shouldn't have used the word &quot;mill&quot; because that implies using a mill, lol.  The appropriate terms are squaring, flattening, and/or dimensioning.</p></div>		</li>
