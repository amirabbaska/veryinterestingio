			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the short answer is no, the location can't pinpoint the cause because of all the variables you've listed. But the onset, severity, frequency, mitigating/correlating factors and coinciding symptoms can help guide us in creating differential diagnosis. These details inform us if a CT scan or lumbar puncture is warranted or if a gram of acetaminophen and 800mg of ibuprofen will suffice.
People coming into the ER are often frustrated that there is no  known underlying diagnosis to their pain, our first concern is to rule out the cause being something life-threatening, brain bleed, aneurysm, meningitis and then we refer you to a neurologist if necessary. Likely you will always be living with a working diagnosis.
Source: i worked as a RN on a neurosurgical unit and met countless patients suffering from undiagnosed headaches, I now work in the ER and see even more as many patients don't get admitted and are just sent home once the life-threatening causes are ruled out and their pain is medically managed.
Edit: removed 'anecdotal' information about my mom's chronic migraines. Although it's sharing information like that with my patients that shows I'm not just a drone. Hope that's good enough mods.</p></div>		</li>
