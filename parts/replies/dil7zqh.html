			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation, though you left out the core part of AI wherein you don't have to make a trapdoor yourself. As you have described it, it is just a conventional classifier. For a heuristic method, you create a system where you show it what kind of marbles you want and it figures out automatically after many tries what kind of trapdoor it would have to make such that you end with the marbles you want. That would be AI.</p></div>		</li>
