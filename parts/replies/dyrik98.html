			<div class="markdown"><p>I was about to rip you on this saying fire is younger that homosapiens. I would have made an ass of myself. Controlled fire is way older than I thought and homosapiens weren't even the only ones using it! We totally could have evolved to prefer cooked food for caloric content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably more like &quot;hey we need to eat way less cooked food than raw food to stay alive&quot;. Cooking helps break down hard to digest fibers n such, allowing your body to absorb more calories and nutrients from the food. This is almost certainly the biggest factor as to why we started cooking food.</p></div>		</li>
