<p>Nothing evolves to a predetermined purpose, and plants do not prefer anything.</p>
<p>If the plants were indeed more succesful because they were spicy and were being eaten by birds instead of other animals, then that trait simply got enforced, leading to the spicy traits to stick around and possibly become stronger.</p>
<p>Or maybe the plants were already spicy and some birds were affected less than others by the spicyness, which led them to have more food, which led to them being more succesful, which led to more spreading of spicy seeds because of more bird poop, etc. etc. etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably good to point that out. It's a useful shorthand for people who understand evolution to talk about it in terms of what a creature &quot;prefers&quot;, though.</p></div>		</li>
