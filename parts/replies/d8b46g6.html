			<div class="markdown"><p>Water can act as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticizer" target="_blank">plasticizer</a>, or an additive that makes a material more easy to deform like a plastic. You are right, they key effect of water is that it makes the polymer domains flow more easily with respect to each other. The way this happens is that water can adsorb on the polymer chains, which in effect helps them to stick to each other less strongly. As a result, the material changes from an amorphous solid to something much more flexible. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if the cellulose fibers are individually hydrophilic? If so, does this mean a hard dry sponge would stay hard if immersed in oil?</p></div>		</li>
