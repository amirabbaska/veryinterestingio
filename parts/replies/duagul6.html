			<div class="markdown"><p>I read once that certain types of gut bacteria can release neurotransmitters into the bloodstream that affect our mood or food cravings -- meaning the health of these organisms can literally affect how our mind works. Sort of makes sense when you consider every organism, even gut bacteria, works for its own self-preservation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Insoluble fiber is generally not fermentable, which is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3705355/" target="_blank">what your gut bacteria prefers</a> . </p>
<p>So a better way to determine what fiber is “best” for GI flora is whether it is fermentable. Mostly soluble fibers are fermentable, although some soluble fibers are not and some insoluble fibers are. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the gut microbiome composition. Diets high in insoluble will select for insoluble fiber degrading microbes. Generally, current literature suggests that dietary sources of complex (or diverse) fiber have the most beneficial effects in terms of microbiome mediate gut health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They feed off of both. My answer was a little narrow but certain microbes have specific &quot;machinery&quot; to degrade a specific subset of fiber types. So it takes several different bacteria to utilize all the types of fibers you are eating. Although if you are a Westerner there is a very likely chance that you don't have very many microbes in your gut that utilize insoluble fiber.</p></div>		</li>
