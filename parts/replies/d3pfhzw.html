			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this, there are also the Foramen Ovale and the fontanelles. Not exactly organs, but mabye still interesting.
The Foramen is an opening between the Atria in the heart, allowing blood to bypass the lungs in an unborn child, and closes after childbirth The fontanelles are spaces between the bones that make up the skull, allowing for some flexibility during childbirth and early development. After about 12 to 18 months the skullbones grow together and close the fontanelles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have not heard of this before. Does it close owing to air rushing into the lungs at first breath or is there another trigger? How does this happen exactly?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moment a infant takes its first breath by crying the hole closes. This can be explained by what the purpose of the hole actually is: when the infant still lives in the mother no air is coming in the lungs so it would be useless to pass the normal amount of blood through there, so a hole between the two chambers of the heart exist so that blood has a shortcut. When the infant starts breathing  this hole becomes dangerous because air does not come from the blood of the mother anymore. So the hole closes when the first breath is drawn so that the infant does not suffocate while having two perfect lungs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much, yes. The pressure in the lungs decreases, and the pressure in the left atria increases vs the right, which shuts the little flaps that then become the septum between the atria. This happens pretty much right at birth. I'm not exactly sure how long it takes, but I'm positive it's pretty quick.</p>
<p>EDIT: I made a mistake, thanks to /u/abelks92 for pointing it out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Urachus (part of the fetal allantoic duct)&gt; Becomes median umbilical ligament</p>
<p>Umbilical arteries&gt; Medial umbilical ligaments</p>
<p>Ductus arteriosis&gt; Ligamentum ateriosum</p>
<p>Process vaginalis&gt; Becomes tunica vaginalis around testes</p>
<p>33/34 vertebrae in fetus&gt; become 24 separate vertebrae in adults and the rest fuse</p>
<p>Kidney development: Goes from pronephros (which is completely destroyed in humans) to mesonephros to metanephros.  And the extent that the mesonephros is obliterated is based on sex.</p>
<p>There's too many other examples to name.  Fetal development is basically a continuous process of formation of structures and controlled destruction of those structures when necessary.</p></div>		</li>
