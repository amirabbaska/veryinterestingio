			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with the question is the word &quot;ignite&quot; is misunderstood. When you ignite a fire, it creates a chain reaction where one atom burning creates heat which makes it likely for another atom to burn. In a star, when two hydrogen atoms fuse to make helium, it releases light which pushes atoms away which makes it harder for other atoms to burn. The only reason our sun can keep burning is because of the intense gravity that pushes the core together and keeps the pressure high enough for fusion.</p>
<p>This process means there must be a minimum mass for fusion to occur, which happens to be about half the mass of the sun. Below that, you can have brown dwarfs, which don't have hydrogen burning either. If you combined all the mass in all the Jovian planets, you still would be way short.</p>
<p>Technology willing, we would have to take some mass from the sun (which will be almost entirely Hydrogen at the surface), and drop it off in Jupiter. The sun would be a lot smaller and redder, but Jupiter would have the mass to start fusion.</p></div>		</li>
