As with any altered state, familiarity with it trains your brain to cope.  It's incredibly useful in combat, which is almost certainly why it evolved in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically by causing it to happen enough in a controlled environment that you get used to it.  I won't go into precisely how, since I'm unsure how much of that process is classified.  (I know that sounds all Internet Tough Guy, but such is life for certain folks who did certain things in the military.)</p>
<p>Edit: A useful example that's similar is how divers train to recognize and cope with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis" target="_blank">nitrogen narcosis</a>.  By causing it to happen in a controlled environment such as in a pressure chamber, divers can be taught to recognize it when it happens and even manage the negative effects to some extent.  Similarly, tachypsychia can be induced and then the individual trained how to manage it and even benefit from it.  It's not that you can exactly consciously make it happen, but you can sort of learn to feel it coming on and learn how to relax into it, so to speak, rather than push it away as we often do.</p>
<p>It's a little hard to describe, really.  I suppose in some ways it's like a drug induced trip.  Words alone can't really explain it until someone's had the experience for themselves.  Only then do the words really make sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And shuffle the tracks so ya dont know how long the silences are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if this is what I experienced as a high school kid during school one day.</p>
<p>I got into a fight, and I got suddenly &quot;pumped&quot;. I went NATO. Swinging punches left and right, but I remember feeling like my arms and fists were moving sooo painfully slowly, and everything felt weak, but my punches were actually in reality knocking the people back and doing damage. It just felt like my arms and time itself was jelly.</p></div>		</li>
