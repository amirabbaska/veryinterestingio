			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not necessarily. Not all genes code for something that a human would consider a &quot;characteristic&quot;. Some don't appear to code for anything at all. But the imbalance that exists for males (having one X and one Y) does mean that the exact alleles (versions of genes) they inherit on their X is really important, because they don't have a second X chromosome to compensate if they get a bad allele on theirs.</p>
<p>This is why men are much more likely to get color blindness and hemophilia. These are both X-linked disorders. Women can compensate using a functioning allele on their other X if they get a bad copy on one, but men can't.</p>
<p>Tl;dr - Not really, but it is especially important which specific versions of genes you inherit from your mother if you're male.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true! I forgot about this one. Yes, children of both sexes inherit their mitochondria solely from their mother. </p>
<p>It is possible to think of the mitochondria as being more of a symbiotic organism coming along for the ride, though. That's why it has its own genome instead of being a part of your genome. This is also why mitochondrial replacement therapy works, for people whose inherited mitochondria are malfunctioning.</p>
<p>For anyone who has seen scare-stories about children being produced with three parents, this is what they're talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it's not a huge difference. That's why inheritance is usually taught in lower-level biology classes as being 50/50 from each parent. It is fairly close to that and it's not worth going into the extraneous details in middle or high school biology classes.</p></div>		</li>
