<p>Given the dramatic changes in the beautiful Great Barrier Reef, it's no wonder that your question has gotten 80 points! I hope you get a chance to dive or snorkel on this amazing feature that has so many phenomenal organisms!  Now to your question:</p>
<p>We are all concerned about the great reefs of the world. I’m sure you heard that this year we had another large bleaching event that affected a quarter to a third of the Great Barrier Reef, as well as smaller amounts of other reefs in the Pacific and other areas of the world.</p>
<p>Reefs are being threatened by multiple stresses:
First up is warming. In El Nino years like the past one, certain areas of the ocean warm substantially. When it gets warm enough the symbionts of coral leave the coral. They are responsible for the color of the coral organism and thus it ‘bleaches’. If the warming is short-lived, the symbionts will return and the coral can recover. But the warming of the world ocean (it has taken up 90% of the heat from excess greenhouse gases in the ocean), combined with El Ninos and other local to regional warming events, stresses corals even more. Successive warming events or warming events superimposed on the warming trend in the ocean make it more difficult for corals to recover and can lead to death of regions of the coral.</p>
<p>Second is pollution. The flow of biological nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus leads to more biological productivity of algae and other photosynthesizers that can harm reefs. Some algae compete with corals for space, others shade the water and reduce sunlight for the corals. Just as in bays and estuaries, they reduce the water quality and make it difficult for corals.</p>
<p>Third is physical disruption. Many shallow reef areas are favorites for tourism and boat traffic.  The constant disruption for anchors tearing off bits of coral, ploughing into the reef etc also stresses the corals as well.</p>
<p>Finally, there is ocean acidification, which results from the excess CO2 that we are putting into the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels. The acidification makes it more difficult for corals to make their chalky skeletal bases.</p>
<p>So we have multiple threats – a multi-stressor situation.</p>
<p>The good news is that researchers – in fact, Dr. Jen Smith here at Scripps Oceanography – have studied over 400 locations on 50 reefs across the Pacific and have found that the reefs that have low pollution and physical disruption are still in fairly good condition compared to those that are being polluted.  That means that if we work toward eliminating the pollution and physical damage our reefs will have more capacity to resist acidification and respond to warming.</p>
<p>The second good news story is that we are finding that some coral species are much more resistant to acidification and warming than others. This gives us hope that if we understand the genetic basis for that resistance that we can understand how to help other reefs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, we need to decrease CO2 emissions so that we stop further warming and acidification.</p>

<p>.
What are your thoughts on the Spratly reclamation project?
To what extent then does scientific research have an impact on actually helping to mitigate environmental degradation?
What are some of the greatest challenges or obstacles faced by researchers in using scientific facts to influence and inform the populace or world leaders of the inconvenient truth so that right decisions can be made for the benefit of the people.
In your assessment, in a nutshell, is science limited by our political will?
I would like to thank you in advance for such an opportunity. Given your influential position and experience, your insights can really help shed light on the inner workings of science and scientific institutions.</p>
