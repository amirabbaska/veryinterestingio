<p>Anecdotally, my experience is the opposite. I seem to be a mosquito magnet, and honestly the best thing I've found for an itch is to run it under <em>hot</em> water. Like hot enough that it kind of hurts. (<em>Please don't scald yourself based on my &quot;advice.&quot;</em>) 10 seconds under temperature like that will fix things up for me for a couple hours.</p></div>		</li>
