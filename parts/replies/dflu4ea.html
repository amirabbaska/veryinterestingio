			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have 0/0 = 1, then you must also have (0+0)/0 = 1 (because 0 + 0 = 0), so you have 0/0 + 0/0 = 1 (by distributing the division by 0 across the sum), so you have 1 + 1 = 1 (since we've said 0/0 = 1), so you have 2 = 1. This is wrong, so you can't have 0/0 = 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is 0/0 = 1? Why would it be 1? </p>
<p>You think it's 1. You might say that it's one because anything divided by itself is the number 1. Right?  <em>Why</em> do you say that? Is that a true thing to say? </p>
<p>Something to realize, numbers are not the way the are because that's the way we say they are. Numbers just are the way they are, what we say about them may be true or false, but we don't get to decide how they behave. </p>
<p>So, is a number divided by itself always 1? That's not a mathematical rule, that's a mathematical shortcut! That's something that people say to help you think. That's not how we define division, that's how we describe division! There's a big difference between defining and describing! If we try to describe number by saying that &quot;anything divided by itself is 1&quot;, then we must be ready to ask the question, is it true?  (or is it just something people say...)</p>
<p>The answer is ... yes and no...</p>
<p>What question does 0\/0 ask?  It asks the question &quot;what number times 0 equals 0?&quot; </p>
<p>You say the answer is 1.  Let's check:</p>
<p>Does 1*0 = 0?  Yes! It does, so you are right!</p>
<p>But someone else says that the answer is 0. Let's check:</p>
<p>Does 0*0 = 0? Yes! So you are both right!</p>
<p>But I might say that I think that the answer is 17. Ridiculous, you say! But let's check:</p>
<p>Does 17*0 = 0?  YES! So I am also right?  YES.</p>
<p>Oh this is getting weird. </p>
<p>Is the answer also negative 44.6? Let's check:</p>
<p>Does -44.6*0 = 0? Yes. Whoah.</p>
<p>Okay, so now we have to ask, what <em>does</em> 0/0 equal?  By my calculations it equals all of the following: 1, 0, 17, and -44.6. Hopefully you can see that <em>any</em> number you choose will work.  So, 0/0 equals EVERY NUMBER EVER. Okay, that's weird.</p>
<p>What can we conclude?</p>
<p>Essentially, we conclude that there is no reason to choose one number over the other. Should it equal 1, should it equal 0, should it equal 17? How do you choose?  But remember, WE don't get to decide how numbers work, we only describe how they work. In the end, having a division that equals all numbers causes various problems (see your other response to see that we get weird things like 1=2). So in the end, we say that it is indeterminate and that the 0/0 is undefined.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say it has NO answer, like it can be contextual.  Some cases an object divided by zero can be assumed to equal infinity, sometimes it's a &quot;da fuq?&quot; In a similar way 0/0 can be seen as 1....I guess it's all assuming they're being taken as limits and shit. I saw in one of my books that they just straight up went tan(x)/0 = infinity...Author was reckless AF </p></div>		</li>
