			<div class="markdown"><p>This point is actually (one of the many reasons) why Tokyo is seen as hip and modern, but Kyoto is seen (and is) traditional and conservative.  during WW2, America bombed the hell out of most of Japan.  Kyoto, and a few other cities were spared carpet bombing runs because generals wanted to see the full after effects of a nuke on a relatively undisturbed city.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki ended up getting picked because of nice weather forecasts where as Kyoto was spared because the mornings planned would be foggy and the days cloudy.</p>
<p>After the war, Japan rebuilt.  Kyoto didn't need to.  </p></div>		</li>
