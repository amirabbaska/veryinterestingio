			<div class="markdown"><p>I can do this too, but I wonder if it can also be involuntary to a degree. I was in a fight or flight situation a couple years back where I had to rapidly fire my handgun, but afterwards I noticed that my ears felt perfectly fine and all the ringing and slight hearing loss that typically accompanies shooting a firearm without hearing protection were absent. I chalked it up to an amazing human body reaction to an adrenaline fueled situation, but this might have a real explanation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a different muscle called the stapedius, which instead of contracting on the eustachian tube, contracts to pull one of the bones from your middle ear, called your stapes away from the oval window to dampen sounds that would otherwise damage your cochlear cells. Fun fact, this muscle and bone pair are the smallest muscle and bone in your body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. Thank you. </p>
<p>Does the stapedius only contract in emergencies or does it operate in a range of situations? I've only ever experienced it or at least noticed it once. </p></div>		</li>
