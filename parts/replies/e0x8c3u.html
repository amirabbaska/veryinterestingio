			<div class="markdown"><p>Bourdain wrote in his New Yorker article that at a good restaurant they might use about a stick of butter per plate.</p>
<p>edit: There are a few comments below that corrected me and I went back to the article to check myself. It is per meal <em>not</em> per plate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he actually said was that if you have a bit of butter with bread, by the time you eat your hors d'oeuvres, appetisers, and main dishes, you will have consumed about a stick of butter. Also mentions that this is for classic french restaurants. Still a ton of butter, but its not per plate</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nice thing about calorie-insane food: You don't really need a whole lot to feel satisfied. The body is like, &quot;Woah! Got what I wanted, thanks!&quot; Also: Maple syrup on my sausages.. mmm... don't even need to eat lunch when I have a breakfast like that. </p>
<p>Bodies like fat and protein. Who knew?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've that's actually an issue with all of the &quot;low fat&quot; foods. They take away the fat so it doesn't taste as good, so they add sugar to make it taste good. The body isn't satiated by sugar, though, so you end up eating more to get the same feeling and end up consuming more calories than were saved by reducing the fat content. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, ordinary butter is always sold in one-pound (454g) packages, which contain four individually-wrapped sticks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter#United_States" target="_blank">There are different shapes of stick in the eastern and western US.</a></p>
<p>You might have seen pictures of, say, butter melting in a pan, and thought, <em>if she was just going to melt it anyway, why did she carefully shape it into a squares?</em> Or maybe you've seen pictures of American breakfast meals and thought <em>Who has time to make those tidy butter rectangles? It's just going to get spread on toast</em> It's not a presentation choice or an affectation â€“ that's just how butter comes from the store.</p></div>		</li>
