<p>Okay so that means time crystals are useless because as stated above &quot;there is no energy in the system to extract.&quot; if they are then why so much hype on time crystals at all? </p>
<p>If I misunderstood it then plz tell me </p>
<p>How will this discovery benefits the normal people what can a normal people do with it ones it becomes viable?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not as useful a question as it might appear to be. Very often, a discovery and the use of that discovery are separated by years. Think about fractals: when the idea was first proposed, people said, &quot;Huh. Neat, but useless.&quot; Then we discovered that they could be used to shrink cell phone antennae and model clouds in 3D graphics (among other things). </p>
<p>Many discoveries require a specific problem to be useful, and that problem may not exist yet, or the discovery may not have been seen by the person with the problem. Some discoveries require other discoveries to be useful together. </p>
<p>For all we know, a material that had a cyclic ground state could be used to invent a timing device with more accuracy than an atomic clock, and that timer could enable us to take the measurements that allow us to discover faster-than-light travel (just spitballing here).</p>
<p>Just because we can't conceive of a use yet doesn't mean we should ignore or not pursue the acquisition of knowledge. We almost always find a use for every discovery, big or little. </p></div>		</li>

It's not always clear what things like these are &quot;good for&quot; when they're first discovered. Maybe they're completely useless. Maybe we can use them to build intergalactic spaceships. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so let's see if I follow.</p>
<p>A time crystal is formed when you remove all energy from matter. It seems to me like you're talking mostly about things on the atomic scale? Like, not removing all the energy from a steak to create a time crystal steak, but removing all energy from an atom of hydrogen to create a hydrogen time crystal.</p>
<p>A time crystal doesn't sit still, though, it still moves. Typically we associate movement with energy, you have to impart energy to make something move, and matter that's moving contains potential energy of some kind. A time crystal, as you've described, seems to be devoid of all energy, even potential energy. If a time crystal is moving without energy, what's responsible for the motion? I understand this isn't a perpetual motion machine (which would probably be better described as a perpetual energy machine), so I'm real curious what other thing can cause motion that isn't energy.</p></div>		</li>
