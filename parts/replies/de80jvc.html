			<div class="markdown"><p>Ma &amp; Da are the first sounds that a baby babbles, so parents often consider these their first words. Guess what's next? Na &amp; Pa. Guess who takes claim for those two? Nana and papa!</p>
<p>To be honest, a child's first word is one which has meaning behind it. Unfortunately my parents told me that my first word was mama too, so I'll never actually know my first real word. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well this is quite an oversimplification - while ma(ma) and the rest do come from baby talk, babies babble all kinds of sounds and not in any canonical order (well, there are harder sounds that are learnt later that require more accuracy like &quot;th&quot;, &quot;dj&quot; and things, which tend to come later.) The vowel sounds are also not always identical.</p>
<p>In fact, babies start cooing earlier where they just make &quot;aaa&quot; &quot;ooo&quot; sounds and the like - so it's a mistake to think that &quot;ma&quot; is canonical in this way - while the word did come from the baby talk, it could have happened (and may have in other language groups) differently.</p></div>		</li>
