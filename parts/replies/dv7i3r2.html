			<div class="markdown"><p>Hard tires aren't really desirable in racing. Tthis year, pirelli softened all the compounds in the range, as well as introducing hypersoft, and then added  superhard to the top of the range (my understanding is that it is about as hard as last years &quot;hard&quot; compound was) just incase any teams want or need the same level of hardness that was available to them last year. </p>
<p>Increasing the hardness further would result in tires that last uselessly long and put the teams using those tires at a grip disadvantage. </p>
<p>If you were a formula team that wanted ultrahard or hyperhard tires though, you could just use street tires, but I'm pretty sure the FIA would frown on your relative inability to stop or turn</p></div>		</li>
