			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. He's not comparing himself to the child (versus a male peer),  &amp; the adult dynamic with a peer of the opposite sex is missing.</p>
<p>OP you are likely in your own head when it comes to adult conversations.  If you're thinking about what you 'assume' the other person is thinking about you, that is a big issue.  The key is just to relax, express genuine interest in your questions, listen, &amp; give genuine, confident answers to theirs.  You will connect with some people &amp; you won't connect with others, that's just the way it is.</p>
<p>The other key is to get to a place in your life that you can be confident about.  It depends upon your age, but...have a decent job, get a decent place, care about your appearance to a healthy degree - all of these things will go a long way towards finding a more confident version of yourself.  </p>
<p>If you're not out of school yet, I would just focus on making sure you present yourself well, and make sure you're thinking optimistically about each day &amp; about the future.  You are what you think about all day long...and if it is negative &amp; pessimistic, that will likely manifest itself outwardly as awkwardness, anxiety, sadness, etc, basically someone other people don't really enjoy being around.</p>
<p>A simple strategy can be to examine your own thoughts &amp; figure out which things you are insecure about...&amp; make a plan to start attacking them one by one until they are no longer sore spots for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer misses the mark by a long shot.  This theory is like saying that people who don't test well are stupid or ignorant.</p>
<p>I am affected by a similar condition that the OP describes but have no self esteem issues.  I am very confident, independent, and proud of who I am.  I have a successful career, accomplished in team athletics throughout my 40 years of life and have held leadership positions in social organisations at all ages.  I have always been very shy with my own peer group.
My personal experience suggests that it has to do with my maturity level being out of sync with those in my age group.  Until my mid 30s I was significantly more serious than my peers.  It was beneficial in school and  career.<br />
Just to give an example, I recently played a pickup game and was very shy with the group.  I knew I was likely the best player, and it proved true, but I was still very shy with the group.
I am also very agnostic to the opinions of others.   This stems from an independent spirit and confidence that I am a better decision maker than my peers.</p>
<p>My son has similar traits and his confidence or self esteem is not lacking.   He displays similar characteristics of having interests and maturity that is out of sync with his peers.</p>
<p>I am not trying to prove my hypothesis.  Rather, I want to debunk the theory that shyness is tied to self-esteem or confidence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are confusing social skills with athletic/business skills. It is possible to be very good in the latter while being lackluster in the first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand, if your so much more mature than everyone how does that explain why you have an easier time socializing with children? You don't touch on that, which was the entire point of OP's question and the above posters response. Your response revolves solely around you and has nothing to do with the question. Self centered much?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was not trying to address the OP.  Just responding to a top response to say that shyness is not a direct result of self esteem issues.  I used myself as an example because I am shy.  I did not address the OP question because I don't have a clue on that subject and also do not even agree that all shy people socialize well with children.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well stupid and ignorant people generally don't do well on tests, if you don't do well on tests I'd argue that you are stupid at test taking. I'm pretty stupid with common sense sometimes so we are all stupid in many ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This couldn't be anymore bullshit and I don't understand why more people are not challenging you on it.  Shyness springs from a whole host of things including ones own innate personological disposition.  Are babies shy because of low self esteem?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. But I would say that description fits a vast a majority. Personally, I've never met anybody that described themselves as shy/awkward/introverted that didn't have a big ol' self esteem problem. It may manifest in different ways or have gotten there by different paths but it all comes back to them thinking they are somehow less than other people in some context. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't include introverted in that list. I am an introvert and I am as far as you can get from having a self esteem issue, being around people is simply draining. Now you've met one! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a shy person with low self esteem, I feel that the shyness is responsible in part for the low self esteem.  Eventually the 2 things begin to feed each other and it becomes a vicious cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nahhh, it's not really bullshit. Of course there could be other reasons, like with everything else. And you might be hella shy, and not insecure or not have low self esteem. Or maybe you're just in denial? I don't know. Lots of kids do stuff when they're kids, that they don't do when they get older. Shit their pants, suck on their mama's tits, sleep 20 hours a day. Just to name a few.</p></div>		</li>
