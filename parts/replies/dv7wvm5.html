			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of three drugs. The first two stop signals from your senses to your brain (so you can't see, hear, or feel anything). The third stops signals from your brain to your muscles (so you can't move).</p>
<p>Because your brain and your body have been effectively disconnected, you can consider yourself unconscious.</p>
<p>Sleep is different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation so far. The only addition I would add is that general anesthesia takes you down to the place needed for surgery in several &quot;planes&quot;, or stages of anesthesia. It starts from simple analgesia and disorientation in the first stage, descending to the third stage, known as surgical anesthesia, where there is no spontaneous movement, but respiration is maintained. Different reflexes are lost as you move through these stages. There are levels below surgical anesthesia, and below this point is when your ability to breathe spontaneously, paralysis, and death would occur if we did not support these functions using our ventilator, medicines, and other tools and measures to control your normal homeostatic state. The amount and type of medications you receive determines how far down these stages you descend and it is our ability to balance you at a lower stage of anesthesia using a balanced technique with those previously described classes of medicines where ideally the previously above mentioned goals of amnesia, analgesia, loss of consciousness, skeletal muscle relaxation, and reduced reflex activity are achieved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motorcycle accident victim here, in trauma when they were cleaning the road debris out, again (4th day I think) I could feel the burning in my foot as they scrubbed, I could sense people moving around me and talking, but I was so zonked I didn't even try to speak, I just wanted them to go away.  I know now I couldn't speak, but the weird part is I was glued to the bed and just wanted to sleep, didn't have the will to protest.</p>
<p>So the next day I told the doctor and he said &quot;You're young, tell the anesthesiologist 'Hey, take me down further'&quot; -- And thankfully they obliged.</p>
<p>So, some people have been saying it blocks the pain, but I say it just knocks you so out of your senses that you don't notice it.</p>
<p>Six one way... half a dozen the other... Just my 2 cents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last year I had to do an endoscopy and they used fentanyl as anesthesia. I remember everything until it was injected. After that, I only remember flashes of me in the car riding home after the exam. Luckily, my mother took a video of me after the procedure. I was totally high, saying nonsense things and laughing without apparent reason. Can you ELI5 why that happens?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You most likely got a benzodiazepine such as midazalam as well as fentanyl. It causes amnesia for a period.
Fentanyl is a short acting opioid. (Same family as heroin, morphine or OxyContin). That’s what would have given you the high. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did not enjoy being on morphine when I snapped my arm in half. I was saying weird things but remembered it and felt like I was out of my body. I was glad not to care about the pain, which was excruciating. </p>
<p>Morphine was not a fun experience. I hated not having control over myself. </p></div>		</li>
