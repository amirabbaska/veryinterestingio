<p>If someone asked, &quot;how many transistors are there in a typical 2017 cpu&quot; (it's about 1 billion), the people in this thread would endlessly say &quot;it's impossible to determine&quot; rather than actually using their knowledge to help inform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transistors are to CPU's, is not as, turns are to generators.</p>
<p>CPU design and computing output is (almost)directly related to transistor count, a 300m transistor CPU will be less powerful than a 1bn transistor cpu, which in turn is less powerful than a 3bn transistor cpu</p>
<p>Turn count has no direct relationship to generator power, you double the turns, and you can (and in the real world DO) still have the same power, you treble the turns, you can still get the same power (and in the real world DO) as you flex other elements.</p>
<p>Its not the answers that suck, its the question.</p>
<p>similar question</p>
<p>&quot;how many cup holders does a typical 200hp car have?&quot; well 200hp covers single seater sports cars - so none, to 7 seaters, with 12.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because depending on the design, voltage, operating speed, turns, etc, it could easily be like 2-10 times a &quot;typical&quot; number? How many horsepower does a typical car have? What percentage of alcohol is a &quot;typical&quot; drink?</p>
<p>The answer &quot;somewhere between 50 and 500&quot; is not useful, compared to telling someone what factors would go into deciding the actual number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disagree. Order of magnitude answers are very helpful in understanding a subject for someone who has no experience and isn't doing design or repair of the item in question.</p>

<p>100 - 200 HP.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>5-15%.</p>

<p>My reaction: &quot;Okay cool, that's kind of like what I've seen in small hobby electric motors/generators. So it's kind of a scaled-up version of that (though probably more complex). I now know it's not something crazy like 1,000,000 turns or 1 turn.&quot;</p>
<p>This isn't a classroom test, you are not signing off on this as a PE, nobody is going to sue you if there's an exception to what you say.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you understand in detail how alternators work in cars, you're most of the way to understanding how DFIGs work in wind turbines.</p></div>		</li>
