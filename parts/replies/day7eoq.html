			<div class="markdown"><p>One piece of info missing from mredding's <em>excellent</em> review is that the extra CO2 can be identified as human-produced from burning fossil fuels by the ratio of <del>C14-C15</del> C^(12)-C^14 (thanks u/thepaperskyline) isotopes in the carbon.</p>
<p>Carbon in fossil fuels has the isotope ratio from when the fuel (coal, oil, etc) was formed millions of years ago, which differs from the present ratio. The isotope ratio in atmospheric carbon over the past 250 years <strong>exactly</strong> tracks the changes made by adding the older carbon to the air.</p>
<p>It's not the authoritative source I was looking for but <a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/outreach/isotopes/" target="_blank">NOAA has this</a></p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=87" target="_blank">here's an even better one</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>C12 and c14 lol c13 is like 0.07% or some shit it doesnt even matter. In petrology and environmental studies we look at c14 vs 12. Lots of fractionation happens at biological levels for efficiency reasons. Drunk af atm sorry. So drunk i mixed them up. You're right im sorry it is indeed 12 and 13 sorry. This shit is my fucking life yet when i drink i forget evrrything i need to get my shit together :(</p></div>		</li>

<p>From a quick googling: Carbon-15 is a thing, but it has a half-life of 2.5 seconds. </p>
<p>So by the time you read this comment it won't be much of one anymore! /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We burn enough coal, oil and natural gas each year to produce almost twice the CO2 showing up in the atmosphere. That's not even including our effects on land use and burning down forests. Is there really an argument that the CO2 might not be from us?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I piggyback with a mini ELI5 question? And to be clear, this is a genuine &quot;I believe what you're saying but I don't understand something&quot; question; I'm 100% in the climate-change-is-real camp.</p>
<p>You mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That doesn't sound like much, but if we go some 0.7C hotter, we'll match the age of the dinosaurs when the whole planet was a tropical jungle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've read this before but it's never made sense to me. How could such a small change in temperature have such a drastic worldwide effect?</p>
<p>For instance, I'm looking out the window at downtown San Francisco right now and it's about 56 degrees F out now. San Francisco obviously isn't going to become a jungle if the temperature hits 57 or even 60 degrees, so how does the situation you described work?</p>
<p>Again, I want to stress that this is a legit question and not a challenge of any type. I <em>know</em> you're right, I just want to understand <em>why</em> you're right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really ELI5:</p>
<p>Average temperatures going up by 0.7^(o)C doesn't mean that every place on Earth will get warmer by the same amount, or that changes will be limited to just temperature. Higher temperatures means more ice melting, so higher ocean levels and completely different ocean currents. It will also mean more water evaporating/available, so more overall rainfall, but potential drought in a few places that depend on current weather patterns. Different rainfall and different climate (from changing currents) means a completely different set of plants is capable of growing, which changes the herbivores, and then the carnivores. The whole biome shifts.</p>
<p>As an example: London is just as far north as parts of Canada. Canada has polar bears, while London gets drizzle. Why? Because there's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_Current" target="_blank">huge current of warm water</a> that keeps England warm. Now, imagine a huge influx of cold water from Arctic ice melting shifts that river of warm water away from Europe, and toward North America. Suddenly England becomes a frozen wasteland, Canada becomes green forests, and the US becomes a jungle.</p>
<p>Small changes mean a lot when spread over a large amount of space. The casino only has a 1% edge in blackjack, but we all know that the house always wins.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I fully accept climate change but this is completely wrong. </p>
<p>The Gulf Stream is basically a wind driven phenomenon and will not stop or reverse while the wind still blows and the Earth still turns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Average temperature vs. current temperature is a very very big difference when talking about the scale of the earth. Coupled with the fact that weather is more &quot;severe&quot; once these changes come about, bigger temperature swings with colder winters in appropriate climates, it ends up being a much bigger deal.</p>
<p>Something along the lines of how you would be pretty comfortable if it was 80 degrees for 12 hours a day and 70 degrees for the other 12 hours, but if the temperature was 120 degrees for 12 hours of the day and 32 degrees for the other 12 hours... that is still an jump in the average of 1 degree but there is a very noticeable difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the problem is more with the &quot;when the whole planet was tropical jungle&quot; comment.  Tropical jungles are pretty hot.  I don't think we'd have enough hot areas to account for the vast swaths of cooler sub-tropical terrain, so the whole averaging thing still doesn't really make sense in this manner.</p>
<p>I, too, would like to see how this is explained, along with how they are able to accurately model the global temperature from millions to hundreds of million years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't fully understand the science, either, so take this with a grain of salt, BUT...  </p>
<p>The &quot;.7C hotter&quot; is taken as a global average temperature, whereas what you describe is a localized current temperature. Any change in temperature can cause minor changes in things like ocean salinity, rate of CO2 absorption, rate of methane release, etc. that, on a local scale, are relatively insignificant, but on a global scale they compound the issue, enhancing the effects on the overall <em>climate.</em></p></div>		</li>
