<p>Eastern cultures see constant eye contact as.. confidence. But of the aggressive and &quot;I'm challenging you&quot; kind. Like how you can tell the difference between a nice handshake and a threatening handshake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was told the  reason i was getting mad dogged by an Indian man was cuz he wanted to bone.</p>
<p>I took it as a challenge and gave him my best nickolson/ Manson &quot;I'll fucking destroy you stare&quot; </p>
<p>He smirked and sat back down in his cubicle it was after my shift that boss told me beware he thinks i want it now. </p>
<p>But i digress , long prolonged eye contact is pretty aggressive in the US as well </p>
<p>Edit:sat,
And my boss was former military word stationed in Pakistan- India</p>
<p>And there was other occasions that 1 guy made me uncomfortable,  but yea racist not borderline sexual harassment /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a martial arts teacher explain it like this: when you're training with someone you bow and break eye contact because you trust them. They're not going to try attacking you just because you look away for a moment and if you <em>don't</em> trust them then what the hell are you doing training with them? Conversely, if you're bowing to an enemy you don't look away.</p>
<p>That's specifically martial arts, and i can't vouch for it being completely accurate, but i imagine it's something like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't.</p>
<p>Apparently, Japanese culture is not big on eye contact in general.</p>
<p>It's seen as impudent or disrespectful.</p>
<p>Which is actually more in keeping with how eye contact works for other animals, anyway.</p>
<p>The whole &quot;look at me when I'm talking to you,&quot; thing that we do in the US is actually pretty anomalous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats kinda like when you put a birthday (or other) card into the envelope, you should always put it in with the &quot;front&quot; of the card to the back of the envelope and the spine or fold of the card at the opening.  So when you pull it out you see the front, not the back, and it's the correct orientation for opening.</p></div>		</li>
