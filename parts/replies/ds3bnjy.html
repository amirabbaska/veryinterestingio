			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister developed this in her 40s.  She cant eat anything that grows hair/fur... beef, venison, etc.  without becoming extremely ill.  The Dr. told her that a lone star tick bite she received at an unknown time,  passed on a type of sugar that caused this and she could possibly get better over time, but there are no guarantees.  She hasnt eaten red meat in years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She gained weight... probably 50-60 lbs over the course of a few years.  My theory, is in not being able to eat as she used to, she started eating ALOT of the things that she could enjoy.  More sugar and breads. She used to be fairly active and all of that changed aroudn the time she developed the meat allergy.  She is making efforts to lose the weight but with natural aging, (she is in her 50s now), its been difficult for her.  Overall she is fairly upbeat about it, but its taken its toll.</p></div>		</li>
