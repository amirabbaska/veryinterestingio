<p>The flip side of them helping the victims of the tsunami is that they are also reported to have committed fraud that allowed them to receive funds from the government that were due to be used to help victims of the earthquake. They also took advantage of some of the victims by selling them high interest loans for them to rebuild homes, and re-locate, etc.</p></div>		</li>
