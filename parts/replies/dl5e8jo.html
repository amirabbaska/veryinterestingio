			<div class="markdown"><p>To get a little more specific, most makeup artists take photos with an iPad nowadays for continuity (or their assistant makeup artist does it for them). Speaking specifically about tattoos, they used to have to do them free-hand or with some kind of stencil-type thing. Not real sure how it looked back then, just what I've heard. </p>
<p>But today they can use cut out tattoos that, to me, most resemble a cutout like a really fancy expensive sticker tattoo that you use a washcloth to put on. (I have no idea of the application process) Then they put some kind of makeup overtop of it to seal it. Obviously this is not my job! But I happen to know that this clearly makes it much faster and more reliable that it's done consistently. They use the photos to make sure they put it in the right spot and orientation every day they need it. </p>

<p>Fun Fact: this may or may not be common knowledge, but if an actor has real tattoos on their body that may be seen on camera, one of three things must happen. They must obtain a release from the original tattoo artist, they must wear a costume in the scene that covers it, or they must airbrush makeup over it on the day. It's up to the director and various departments to decide which is the best option. But it's a huge pain in the arse. </p>
<p>If they're supposed to be in a beach scene and they have a giant back tatt without a release, they won't want to put a long sleeve shirt on them and it's a pain to cover with makeup because it's time consuming. And unless the artist is great, it can look like pure doo doo. Maybe even if they're great. </p>
<p>I think it all got really serious when the producers of The Hangover 2 I think it was, got sued by the artist for using Mike Tyson's face tattoo on Ed Helms. </p>
<p>TL;DR: iPads, and stick-on tattoos for consistency, and don't get tattoos if you're an actor. If you do, get a release. </p>
<p>Edit: Some folks have questions about needing permission. I think this is what made studios so nervous about tattoo permission in general. First link I found. There are probably better articles.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude. You're not kidding... I've seen it. It's a gigantic nightmare. If you audition for a part where it's seen, get ready to have a big weird peach colored patch of makeup over the area. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But still I think it'd be a pain to cover the back one, brightly colored Japanese style. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fucking ridiculous. If you have ink on your own body the art should be entirely yours. I thought it was a given that the tattoo artist no longer owns their artwork, and that it's already been paid for to not be their's anymore. I would hate to think a part of my body theoretically belongs to someone else. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You pay for the application of the tattoo and the right to wear a copy of the artwork on your body.</p>
<p>Reproducing the tattoo in any form that is then sold is a different story. </p>
<p>Compare that to buying a print of a painting, taking a picture of that painting, and then selling the picture of the painting. You're basically just selling copies of someone else's painting. Buying one copy yourself doesn't give you the right to do that.</p>
<p>There's little legal difference between selling a picture of your tattoo or selling a moving picture of your tattoo, which is the same as selling any other copy of a piece of art.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, and after dating a cosmotologist for a year now.. I can tell you people who do nails/hair/makeup for a living see things different than you or I would. She can go off memory from weeks ago and recreate a look she saw in a movie almost spot on. It's very nest to watch the process </p></div>		</li>
