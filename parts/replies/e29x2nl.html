			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a short three page review article with 4 sections.</p>
<p>Introduction and removal of DNA damage- what chemical change occurs when the cells are exposed to UV and the pathways involved in removing it (NER Nucleotide excision repair). </p>
<p>The acute effects- erythema (inflammatory response)-  what cytokines are produced and pathways for inflammation. There is mention of a link to CPS induction and repair for melanin production but I would look to see if any more research has been done mechanistically on that. </p>
<p>The transient effects- suppression of immune function- more information of cytokines and local/systemic immune responses. These transiently interfer with the induction of cell mediated immune responses. It has been observed that people that are hypersensitive to UV exposure have impaired cellular immunity. </p>
<p>Chronic effects- mutation induction and skin cancer- brief discussion on evidence of sunlight causing cancers. Conclusion that reduction of persistent CPDs protects against sun cancer (study on UV hypersensitive patients). </p>
<p>This is an old paper and research will have moved on but it was one of the papers that lead me to an understanding of UV damage and the cascade of events that can lead to apoptosis or mutagenesis. </p>
<p>There are other papers from the same era that indicate it takes a few days for your body to process the damage caused by being in the sun, taking a short break in the shade or a day off before more sun bathing doesn't really help. </p>
<p>The best thing to do is use sun screen (30 or 50) and avoid being out in strong sun whenever possible. </p></div>		</li>
