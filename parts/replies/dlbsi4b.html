			<div class="markdown"><p>Think about the following questions - read past the questions for a spoiler: </p>
<ol>
<li><em>How do leap years progress from the year 2000 until the year 2028?</em></li>
<li><em>If year 2000 starts on a Tuesday, and it is a leap year, when is the next leap year which starts on a Tuesday?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>We know that if we discounted leap years, there's only 7 possible calendars, and leap years occur once every 4 years. Aren't the non-leap-year calendars occurring 3 times more often than leap-year-calendars, then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plainly put, since there's 3 non-leap years in a 4-year period, it takes 7 + 3*7 years for the year's calendar to &quot;wrap around&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
