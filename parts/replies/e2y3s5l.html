			<div class="markdown"><p>my ELI5 version:</p>
<p>The stains you see is the iron in the pan combining with oxygen to form a sort of rust (iron oxide) because it's more stable.</p>
<p>Oxygen would rather combine with aluminum because it's more stable than iron oxide.</p>
<p>The vinegar helps the oxygen leave the iron in the pan and travel to the aluminum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, the rust prefers to live in the aluminum instead of the iron. So, the rust moves when you show it a better home. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's a reduction-oxidation reaction that takes place  under acidic conditions. Essentially, electrons are given up by aluminum and returned to the Iron ion (which is in the  iron rust). You can also do this with baking soda (sodium carbonate) solution and aluminum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>while this black layer is kind of similar to rust, its a different oxide. unlike rust, it only forms a thin layer, and is often applied on purpose to prevent rust from forming.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it called black oxide? I remember learning about that in my Manufacturing Processes course; when steel is heated up to extremely high temperatures, it forms a protective (but ugly) black oxide on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So just to clarify because I can be dense, the oxygen leaves the iron, binding with the aluminum, which is still in the vinegar  solution.  So after rinsing off the vinegar, there is no more aluminum (or stain) on the pan.  In other words, you are not coating the pan with aluminum as the top response suggests.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though I initially described it as a displacement reaction, I did so in the hopes of making it easier to understand. But I guess I was wrong, because I just looked at it in the face of it. I have rectified my answer to include a somewhat deeper concept that more accurately, or rather more correctly describes it, but still of course within reasonable understanding. I apologize.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As mentioned in the mission statement, ELI5 is not meant for literal 5-year-olds. Your explanation should be appropriate for laypeople. That is, people who are not professionals in that area. For example, a question about rocket science should be understandable by people who are not rocket scientists.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually excellent. Especially your follow on  &quot;cleaning&quot; analogy given the first synopsis.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Studied Nuclear Engineering, Nuclear Physics in college....you would have  been (are) a great instructor.</p>
