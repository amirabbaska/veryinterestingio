			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a coincidence.  60 was chosen <em>because</em> it has such nice divisibility properties; it's not like they chose 60 at random and then coincidentally realized how useful that number is.  Divisibility is an important property to relearn if you need to.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the same reason that we use 360 degrees when describing a complete rotation around an axis. 360 is divisible by even more numbers.</p>
<p>You also buy eggs by the dozen and there are 12 inches to a foot for the same reason. Merchants and tradesmen throughout much of the world often worked in base 12 rather than base 10. You'll see echos of base 12 elsewhere as well. A cord of wood is 4 feet by 4 feet by 8 feet which is 1/3, 1/3, 2/3 of a twelve foot measurement. We very easily could have settled on base 12 as our primary numbering system. Obviously base 10 is a more natural fit with the number of digits you have on your hands and Arabic maths were far more advanced than anything else around at the time so it was pretty natural to adopt them broadly. You'll notice that in English we don't say one-teen and two-teen. We say eleven and twelve as if we haven't yet passed the mental barrier into the next set of digits.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To clarify, eleven and twelve are from Germanic words that mean &quot;one left&quot; and &quot;two left&quot; (after you've reached 'ten').</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also ancient Babylonians would count to 60 on their two hands. Consider the four fingers in your left hand (excluding thumb), three sections on each finger, so 12 finger sections total.</p>
<p>Use your left thumb to keep track of what section you're on, use your right hand to count to five. Now you can count to five twelve times....  12 x 5 = 60. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't really a coincidence. 60 was used <em>because</em> it is convenient to subdivide evenly. Some ancient numbering systems were even based on 12 or 60 out of convenience.</p>
<p>Protip: you can count to 12 on one hand, and with a second hand you can count to 144. Count the segments of your fingers, not the finger itself. Each finger had three segments, four fingers and a thumb to keep track. Track twelves on the other hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer, but leaves out two important insights. The first is that our system of time comes from the Sumerians, who happened to use 60 for all kinds of numbers - not just time. Had a different culture been first, we may well use base 20, base 12, or base 10 to count time.</p>
<p>The second is more philosophical and touches on what seconds, minutes, and hours are. They are arbitrary <em>divisions</em> of time, and thus divisibility is a highly desired trait for divisions of time. In fact, seconds and minutes are also used as divisions of longitudinal angle.</p>
<p>So there is nothing fundamentally specific to time about them.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To spell it out, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minute" target="_blank">that's where the word 'second' comes from:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Historically, the word &quot;minute&quot; comes from the Latin pars minuta prima, meaning &quot;first small part&quot;. This division of the hour can be further refined with a &quot;second small part&quot; (Latin: pars minuta secunda), and this is where the word &quot;second&quot; comes from. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it really is.</p>
<p>You know how much fractions fucking suck.  You learned first hand how irritating they are when you were in the third grade.</p>
<p>Now imagine it's <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/experts-time-division-days-hours-minutes/" target="_blank">a very, very long time ago</a> (1,000+ BCE).  You're not using a mathematics notation that supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positional_notation" target="_blank">positional notation</a>.  You don't have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_mark" target="_blank">a decimal point</a> because without positional notation it doesn't even make sense.  You're not using Arabic numerals.  Your math notation really only does a good job of representing whole number values.  Hell, you don't even have a <em>zero</em>.  You have a different character for different amounts, and you basically just pile them all together to make a number.  Without a decimal point, if you want to describe a non-integer rational number you <em>must</em> use fractions.  Imagine you're using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_numerals" target="_blank">Egyptian numerals</a>.  Imagine you're using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals" target="_blank">Roman numerals</a>.  Imagine you're using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_numerals" target="_blank">Greek numerals</a>.  Or Japanese.  Or Chinese.</p>
<p>Now imagine you want to make a standard for something that you know people will divide up.  And fractions are a real pain in the ass, and need to be avoided because the uneducated masses have a hard enough time understanding the freaking whole number.  But you know they'll want to take halves, thirds, and quarters.  So you pick 12 or 24.  You need more divisibility?  You choose 60, because it's divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Need more?  360.  More?  5040.  This is why the ancients seem to be so nuts about the number 12 and often seemed to ignore the number 10.  10 fucking sucks because you typically get nothing but fractions.  Base 10 isn't even an attractive base until you get positional notation, decimal points, and decimal fractions.  And, at that point, the base is completely arbitrary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that IS the reason.</p>
<p>It's like &quot;why do we use base 10&quot;, obvious because we have 10 fingers.  The reason we chose 10 is because it makes things work out nicely and easy to count an explain.  We didn't chose base 10 and then say &quot;hey, we also have 10 fingers, what a coincidence!&quot;.</p>
<p>Same thing with time.  We chose 60 <em>because</em> it is divisible.  There is no other reason.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Actually, it is. That's exactly the reason! Counting time is a human invention, and humans invented a base 12 system because it's easily divisible and workable.</p></div>		</li>
