			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm definitely not claiming to be eloquent, but I see your point. But the (un)conscious word selections when talking is what truly baffles me. Rarely do I visualize or anticipate what word will come next when having a casual conversation, even with a specific end-point in mind.

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to get super freaky, look up an area of linguistics called “collocation”. Basically, every language has words which tend to be “magnetically” drawn to other specific words. Our brains know instinctively which words should be paired with others and do this automatically. </p>
<p>One example is with coffee. The word ‘strong’ likely has a 99% chance of collocation when describing its taste despite the fact that synonyms like ‘powerful’ would make semantic sense too. Conversely a computer is always ‘powerful’, yet never ‘strong’.  Other instances might not be so cut and dried, but there might still be greater odds of seeing two specific words paired together. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for mentioning this - I've been really aware of what I've been calling &quot;word pairings&quot; in speech and writing for the last few months but I didn't realise it was a recognized phenomenon. I have a few candidates of my own:</p>
<ul>
<li>Happy medium</li>
<li>Impending doom</li>
<li>Blissfully ignorant</li>
<li>Slowly crept</li>
</ul>
<p>It tends to be an adjective with a noun or adverb with verb. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think that’s very mysterious. There are pretty clear answers to why this phenomenon exists in my mind. Mimicry is a major one. We speak like each other. I’m sure many instances of collocation vary regionally. Functionality also plays a major role. We have limited synonyms to use in any given place, and in speech we are limited further by the size of the vocabulary we actually use, which is significantly smaller than the vocabulary we understand. So collocations are just another pragmatic shortcut. Nothing spooky going on there. </p>
<p>There are strange phenomena in linguistics though, like phonaesthetics and the bouba/kiki effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had this exact question a few months ago, and the more I thought about it the more fatalistic I became. It made me wonder if I really have any control over myself or if everything I do is just an output of a complex system running inside me. As I thought about it, more I began to think about the irony of only being able to spectate my own inner dialogue, that was questioning its own reality. Amidst my confusion... I think I forgot to try to derive where my thoughts come from. Now I’m scared of myself again! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. I teach, so I have to pick my words carefully, especially when explaining something or giving direction. It's exhausting compared to a normal conversation because of the mental gymnastics!</p></div>		</li>
