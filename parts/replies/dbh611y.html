			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be part of it.  But a banana is going to have a tiny bit of tritium and carbon 14, for example, as other sources of radioactivity.  Just about everything is a little radioactive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Every second, a few thousand atoms decay in your body. Mainly potassium atoms, but various other elements contribute as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body contains potassium too, so it's constantly emitting positrons. I'd have to re-check my math but if I remember correctly something like every 10 minutes or so a K-40 decay emits a positron in your body.</p>
<p>Edit: decided to re-do the math:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potassium in average body: 0.4%</li>
<li>Assume a 80kg average person: .32 kg of Potassium in the body</li>
<li>K-40 abundance in natural Potassium: .012%</li>
<li>Amount of K-40 in human body: .0384 grams</li>
<li>Number of atoms of K-40 in human body: .0384 grams / 40 grams/mole = .00096 moles = 5.8e20 atoms</li>
<li>K-40 half-life of 1.251 billion years translates to a decay rate of 1.76e-17 per second</li>
<li>Number of K-40 decays in the human body per second: 10200</li>
<li>Fraction of K-40 decays that result in positron emission: .001%</li>
<li>Number of K-40 decays in the human body that result in positron emission, per second: 0.102</li>
<li>Average time between K-40 positron emission decays in the human body: 10 seconds</li>
</ul>
<p>So I didn't remember correctly, it was seconds not minutes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wondering here, say that the stars align and a LOT of the decay would emit a positron...</p>
<p>Would there be enough to do some real damage? Like a spontaneous combustion?</p>
<p>If not how much would be needed?</p>
<p>A silly question, but I had to ask.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, this is fantastic and how I wish I had learned about half-life. Why was K-40 never used in some sort of problem in class? </p>
<p>Also, how do you calculate decays/second from half-life and atom number?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard a story on KNPR where a team at CERN was able to suspend antimatter in a vacuum for 12 minutes using lasers. It is a very delicate substance(or lack of substance) as if it touches matter it simply goes away in a burst of light.<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/19/506134622/scientists-blast-antimatter-atoms-with-a-laser-for-the-first-time" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/12/19/506134622/scientists-blast-antimatter-atoms-with-a-laser-for-the-first-time</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No more delicate than normal matter, actually.  It's just that when they come into contact, they annihilate.  You could just as easily say that the normal matter is delicate, but there just happens to be a lot more of it in the surroundings.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible for an entire planet to form made of antimatter which would be just like any other planet, as antimatter versions of atoms like anti-hydrogen, are supposed to have the same characteristics as normal atoms like hydrogen.  You could combine anti-hydrogen with anti-oxygen and get anti-water, and it would look and act just like water made of normal matter, which implies you could have anti-life, and even anti-matter humans.  At least that is the theory, but it has been recently backed up by certain observations of anti-hydrogen.  </p>
<p>Obviously, a planet made of anti-matter is not expected to be likely since anti-matter appears to be much more scarce than normal matter and even if that much anti-matter got together, it would probably eventually dissipate due to inevitable contact with bits of normal matter as it traveled through space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anti-matter just occurs, the same way regular matter does.  </p>
<p>An anti-proton is a particle that has the mass of a proton, but the opposite charge.  An anti-electron has the same mass and size of an electron, but has a positive charge instead.  </p>
<p>The reason it's rare is that for some mystery reason that no one knows yet there is more regular matter in the universe (at least within the cosmic horizon) and the charges on regular matter and anti-matter negate each other and both forms of matter annihilate.  </p></div>		</li>
