			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add a point to this, it is possible for bacteria to develop resistance to disinfectants if the concentration starts off low and is gradually increased. One of my lecturers research projects was based on this and he eventually ended up with a strain that could not only survive in pure disinfectant but could metabolise and grow in it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>can you explain, at about the chem101 / 201 level, how alcohol &quot;blows it up&quot; ? Alcohol isn't really an acid or a base (i.e. I'm guessing it's not the same as dumping HCl on a cell ), so by what mechanism does alcohol actually &quot;blow up&quot; a cell ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cell membrane works as a cohesive unit because it is hydrophobic. This allows the lipids that make it up to coalesce and create a wall of sorts. But lipids are alcohol-soluble. It literally dissolves the one thing keeping all the cell's internals internal. It's be like peeling the rubber from a water balloon, the water inside isn't going to stay inside when you do that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>cell membranes are made of phospolipids, which have a polar and nonpolar group.  There are two layers of these molecules.  The polar groups either face the inside of the cell or the outside.  The nonpolar groups face eachother, this is the low energy state and its stable in aqueous solutions.  The lipids, nonpolar, will have solutbility in alcohol.  So a huge amount of alcohol will pretty much tear apart any cell membranes it encounters.</p></div>		</li>
