<p>How did they know where the canister would be?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I dont know all about it, but I believe it is true.  They knew the location of the satellite and knew the satellite would release a film canister at a certain time.  Given this, you can roughly calculate where the canister would come down.  The pilots would look for the parachute and fly over it to catch it.  The film bucket was designed to survive re-entry.  The satellite would just have to eject it with enough force to make it re-enter, so 17000mph not required.</p></div>		</li>
