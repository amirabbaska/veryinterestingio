			<p>It really does feel that way doesn't it? All I hear from my parents and people their age is, &quot;you're not working hard enough&quot; or &quot;When I was your age...&quot; etc. Yeah, cheers Mum &amp; Dad, I guess things were much easier... WHEN UNI WAS FREE FOR YOU!!! or the fact that you got a job straight from high school where these days to get the same job you need to get a PhD (exaggeration) or some shit. Seriously, they now got college/uni courses for Logistics, <strong>fucking Logistics</strong>! I did that shit in the military and the only hard thing about logistics is the potential shear quantity of work that can get dumped on one person. You don't need to do fucking TAFE to work in a fucking warehouse FFS.  What's worse is when you approach a place and be like, &quot;hey mate! I've got 3 years of experience dealing with this kind of shit in the military and what you do is piss in comparison. Oh what's this? You want to pay me bare fucking minimum wage? The same as that fucking kid who couldn't tell his arsehole from his mouth? FUCK YOU CUNT!&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>So the alternative is to make a new business. But you can't, because mega corporations have all the lawyers and patents to blow up any idea you have. <br><br>Democratic Capitalism = Civil War (almost literally). The first time Democracy battled with Capitalism, the civil war, you could say democracy won. There has been a second war however. A quiet war. And while we were not paying attention, Capitalism took control. And they're stronger, and they're smarter from the first battle. They have manipulated democracy into stripping away your rights, and freedoms. Your head was in your iPhone. Our parents were not modern enough to adapt to the new paradigm. Capitalism saw its opportunity, those defending human rights were too old to keep up, and the kids were distracted. They saw a moment of chance, and took it.<br><br>That's not a conspiracy. The number of billionaires doubled during the financial crises.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Seriously, they now got college/uni courses for Logistics, fucking Logistics!<br><br>I have a feeling you don't realize what side of the window people who major in logistics work on... Or how much the cushier jobs at a warehouse pay.</p>		</li>
