			<div class="markdown"><p>In contrast to the rainforests of the Gulf side, the Pacific side of Mexico tends to have tropical deciduous forest, as the trees drop their leaves in an intense winter dry season. This dry season is what allows cacti to thrive there alongside trees. The vegetation manages to stay lush through the dry season in the winding river valleys that exit the mountains—here you can see people cultivating coconut palms despite the temporary desert weather.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's quite common, even in some parts of Oslo. Of course, it requires relative proximity to your workplace, and with public transport and snow clearing being comparatively good, it's getting less common in modern times.</p>
<p>As a kid I'd ski down the mountains to my local Telemark school for as long as the weather permitted it. As an adult I just walk instead, since metropolitan snow conditions are inconsistent near traffic.</p></div>		</li>
