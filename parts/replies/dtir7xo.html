			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but that's only part of it. Scatttering is also an important effect.</p>
<p>Our atmosphere scatters light, and it scatters the short wavelengths (blue) stronger than the long ones (red). This is why the sky is deepest blue when you look straight up, and also why the sky is red around sunrise/sunset. </p>
<p>The light that is refracted around the earth to the moon travels through a lot of atmosphere, so the blue part is scattered away and only the red part makes it through and ends up hitting the moon.</p></div>		</li>
