			<div class="markdown"><p>Extremely heavy nuclei are all unstable. However we know from studying lighter nuclei, that nuclei have shell structure just like atoms do. And near certain numbers of nucleons, you see enhanced nuclear stability, when shell are completely filled. There could be a region of extremely heavy nuclei where the next highest proton and neutron shells are totally filled. Around this point, you might find nuclei which are more stable than others in the same mass range.</p>
<p>The best estimate right now is around Z = 114, N = <del>126</del> 184. We have no experimental evidence that the island exists, but we have theories which predicts that it does.</p>
<p>Nuclei inside the island will not really be stable, just a little less unstable than others around them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's like electron shells, is there a &quot;step down&quot; from Z=114, N=126 where we see this stability being demonstrated in a smaller nucleus?  Basically taking away that outer shell and being more stable with the next shell inwards?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't know yet, because we haven't observed Z = 114, N = <del>126</del> 184.</p>
<p>However for lighter shell closures, we see <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Nuclear/imgnuc/lastneutron.GIF" target="_blank">similar behavior</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you for the great article with a gift for the turn of phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This battle between attractive and repelling forces would seem to suggest that the life expectancy of an atom is inversely proportional to its obesity.</p>
