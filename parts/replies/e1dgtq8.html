He said “it can be considered”, meaning in some cases people would regard it as part of Denmark.
So this means, some other people would also regard it as a country. Just because you’re Dutch and with an opinion, doesn’t mean you’re the true, low and behold solver of this decades long issue.</p>
<p>Just because an astronaut told me he suspects there maybe aliens about in NASA , doesn’t mean he’s right. Sure he’s going to have more hands on knowledge and credence than say, a random African man born, raised and lived in Nigeria about this. The same way you have your Dutch opinion, doesn’t mean I’m going to trust it just because you know better than a random rice farmer in China.</p>
