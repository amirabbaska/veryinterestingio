			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that one has to have synesthesia to experience this. It's more of an association for most people, I think. </p>
<p>In my case, I associate low notes are deep, earthy, and thus warm, while high notes are high and thin, and thus cold. I definitely don't have synesthesia, it's just an association. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a natural association. Most people would probably think of a roaring fire when they think of heat, and likewise imagine whistling wind when they think of cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different degrees of synethesia.  Many people experience disassociative sensations and don't think of it as synesthesia.  But pitch doesn't confer temperature.  If a sound feels cold, you brain is linking the two for whatever reason.</p>
<p>I don't experience what you describe and I'm music oriented.  If you ask someone with synesthesia why the number 5 reminds them of green they'll produce a response similar to yours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forget that when describing sound equipment, terminology like this is exactly used. Headphones could have a &quot;warm&quot; sound to them, because they accentuate deeper sounds, or they have a &quot;cold&quot; sound to them, because they accentuate higher sounds. This isn't necessarily synesthesia, this is just terminology that's used by a lot of people. </p>
<p>P.S. imo describing sound equipment with abstract terms like &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;warm&quot; is obnoxious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are music oriented then you must use some adjectives to describe sounds which are stolen from other walks of life. Rich. Soft. Deep. Harsh. Tinny. Raw.</p>
<p>&quot;Warm&quot; and &quot;cold&quot; are just more of those, sounds totally normal to me. They are less to do with temperature and more to do with how you might describe a person as warm or cold in their demeanour.</p>
<p>A cello <em>does</em> sound 'warm' in comparison to a xylophone. </p>
<p>Definitely nothing to do with synaesthesia. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive got that, a fun version where light becomes tactile sensation. I like Orange-Green lights feel warm, Orange-Indigo lights have a not unpleasant pressure, and blue-White lights feel kinda sharp.We have to use compact florescent lights in my apartment, because normal bulbs make me itchy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this because i totally get this question and was wondering it myself. I have mild amounts of this with letters and numbers, giving them possible emotions they express and descriptive words.
Example: h's are always blue, they are just a blue letter to me. Purple has a quirky and weird personality. Q's are purple. 1's are yellow but sometimes just plain old black. 2's are red or blue, usually red. 3 is green or purple.
Long story short, in algebra, if i was really tired and i had to write down many equations a day i would often write down the letter h instead of the number 5 accidentally because to me they are related. </p></div>		</li>
