			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, so far, we haven't found any population III stars (the first ones) still in existence yet. Since they would have no heavy elements in their atmospheres. All of the extremely old population II stars we find all have some heavy elements in their atmospheres.</p>
<p>An existing hypothesis in astronomy is that the first stars to be born were EXTREMELY massive (several 100 solar masses), because they had no heavy elements. The processes behind it are a bit complicated to explain. The basic idea is that when a cloud contracts to form a star, part of the gravitational energy radiates away, a process that is made less efficient by the heavy elements, causing clouds to form clumps that form smaller stars. The first stars that formed didn't have heavy elements, meaning the stars wouldn't clump, or clump less, forming more massive stars.</p>
<p>The more massive a star is, the shorter it's lifetime, is the basic rule of thumb. So the current running idea is that those first stars formed and went supernova so fast that they contaminated their surroundings with heavy elements, which would facilitate the formation of smaller stars, and is the reason we don't see any metal-less stars.</p>
<p>To be fair though, the idea and the physics are sound, but a big problem with finding these metal-less stars is that in order to find any, we need to look for really old ones. Which means we're looking for really small ones. Which means we can't look very far to find them, because the smaller a star, the less luminous, the harder to spot at large distances. So it's also entirely possible that we can't find any, because they're simply too far away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well a star with a very low mass (10% the size of the sun known as a m type star) will live for 1000's of billions of years. Considering the universe is 13 billion years old, some old stars are going to be here for a while longer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. The universe was around 25% helium from the beginning. The rest is mostly correct, but it would be better to say:
Helium goes to Carbon and Oxygen, C and O (and more Helium) go to Neon, Calcium, Silicon, etc, etc... up to Iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're hundred percent right. Originally the universe was 23% helium, and about 2% other elements. I was simplifying a little bit. The pathways weren't really the important part of the question. Nucleosynthesis in stars is much more complicated than can be explained in a single sentence so I really brushed over it more than I should have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say, as I was taught the only reason the early universe didn't make more metals was because of the 5 and 8 nucleon instabilities. But it wouldn't have had any problems making helium!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Not only lots it's probably about 50% of the more massive elements. However not all elements can't be produced in an s-process. Anything above Bismuth 209 won't be produced in the s-process. </p>
<p>But you definitely need to consider this when do the statistical estimates and models.  </p></div>		</li>
