<p>In the absence of transaction cost, as an example, if the price of gold in dollars varies from the price of gold in Euros converted into dollars. And that’s a cash machine until the gap is closed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you really choose to control both interest rates and exchange rates/money supply? I just read the wikipedia article on the impossible trifecta and I'm not sure I really understand how it would work without creating a disequilibrium betweem money supply and demand. Thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a lot of countries the government sets the interest rate banks are allowed to trade on. Monterey policies is a combination of interest rates plus currency volume and reserve rate and others.</p>
<p>I’m too tired to think very clearly right now for the effect direction, but say a government prints money to be used as governmental expenditure, but then increase the reserve rates of banks, then you have an instance where you’re influencing the interest rates while increasing currency volume, however this is a short term thing, because due to currency volume increasing, exchange rate is now down, but your interest rate is still up, this results in your country’s interest being higher than global interest rates, and so you’ll have foreign investors purchasing your currency and investing it in your country, thereby increasing the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Or something like that, it could be the exact reverse, I’m too tired to think it through properly, but you get the idea</p></div>		</li>
