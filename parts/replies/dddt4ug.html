			<div class="markdown"><p>They weren't random audience members that had just been given a torch to hold yet they weren't fully choreographed dancers.</p>
<p>The effect was achieved by a combination of choreography and technology, as stated below the light effects were controlled by RFID location technology so that if a torch was in 'area x', no matter the ID of that lamp or the person holding it, if it was in the correct area it could be made to light up. By using this method you don't have to have literally thousands of people hit their mark perfectly to get the right lighting effects, as this is pretty difficult to do with any fidelity.</p>
<p>However the audience of torch-wielders were trained on when to do specific actions, i.e. Wave their hands back and forth, raise them up and down etc. These sort of actions can be trained very easily to a group on mass (like thousands of people in this example) and adds a very dynamical feel to the whole performance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are completely right that they were choreographed dancers and not an &quot;audience&quot;. However even with them being &quot;dancers&quot; it'd still be easier to control the lights based on location. </p></div>		</li>
