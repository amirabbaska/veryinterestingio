			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to piggyback on your great response, <a href="http://www.academia.edu/28370953/Mental_disorders_evolved_to_prevent_suicide_-_a_theoretical_evolutionary_enquiry" target="_blank">one of the most interesting hypotheses</a> put forward in the past ten years is that we have it backwards: Depression doesn't cause suicidal thoughts. <a href="https://theviewfromhellyes.wordpress.com/2016/06/07/patch-7-822-an-experimental-design-puzzle/" target="_blank">Suicidal thoughts cause depression.</a></p>
<p>The idea being that </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“many mental illnesses (such as depression and anxiety) are evolved defenses against the special risk that human cognition presents: the ability to conceptualize ending all of one’s problems by ending one’s brain.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This answers a few questions we don't have solid answers to, such as why do anti-depressants “cause” suicide, why the rate of suicide has remained “extremely flat” in the past eighty years (despite overwhelming progress in treating mental illnesses) and it could also give an evolutionary explanation for something “too common not to exist for a reason.”</p>
<p>Obviously with the built-in caveats that evo-psych is a tricky field to take seriously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, too - the the areas of feeling things (thought, feeling, bodies) are equal parts of the system in which we feel things, and the system can be &quot;driven&quot; by any of these three areas. In fact, I'd ELI5 to someone that if they limit how they're working on their feelings to only one area,  they're way less likely to make a dent in their goals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I can hear some serious shedding every day of my life, I'd be thrilled, and beauty would flow like an intensely churning waterfall through my life. </p>
<p>If I have to hear throat scraping, marble gargling scream-o every day of my life, it'd be like having the world's worst neighbors doing their washing in the middle of that waterfall every day. Just ruins it for me.</p></div>		</li>
