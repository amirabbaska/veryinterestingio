			<div class="markdown"><p>Comcast and Time Warner were required to sell off parts of their service areas to competitors before they were allowed to merge.</p>
<p>If a company acts like &quot;a puppet&quot;, that is violating antitrust laws and is considered non-competitive behavior, both of which are actually taken more seriously than the merger stuff at this point. Things like price fixing (agreeing with a competitor to set prices at a certain level so both can charge more without being undercut by the competition), dividing territories or markets (agreeing to split up areas or customer segments so each can &quot;own&quot; their own group of customers without being undercut on price by the competitor) and other types of collusion are taken pretty seriously and they result in fines and other regulatory punishments. I think in some cases the business executives could be held personally liable (like they pay some fines out of their own pocket, not the company's accounts).  </p>
<p>The non-competitive stuff is serious enough that some companies in heavily-regulated industries will forbid their employees from even allowing customers to come up in a casual conversation with a friend or acquaintance who works for a competitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened very recently in the U.K. With two of our mobile phone network giants. I think o2 tried to buy three or something similar. The government stepped in and said &quot;nope&quot;
I think that gave one company like a 60% share of the markets business and thus it was blocked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This wasn't about preventing a monopoly, they would have been nowhere near 60% - more like 30%, and well under half never mind a monopoly.</p>
<p>It was pretty BS - the combined O2-Three would have still been (2015 numbers) 30.9%, compared to EE's 32.9%. T-Mobile was allowed to combine with Orange in 2010 to create EE... T-Mobile and Orange had almost exactly the same 30.9% combined market share.</p>
<p>Three has by far the best tariffs, but because it's 1/3 the size of EE, and 1/2 the size of Vodafone and O2, the network coverage isn't great. Then again, I don't know if we'd have lost the good tariffs in the merger, but as a customer I was happy with the risk.</p>
<p>It seems weird that you can allow the first merger of 20+10% of the market, but not the second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy hearing about those mergers too.  I have close family in insurance, if you think American insurance is fucked up now you have no clue how close they've gotten to basically become a single company multiple times.  Then they act surprised because the government is all over them and taking forever to make a ruling if one company can buy out or just merge with another super company.    Internet/cable companies do the same shit, I just know more from the insurance side, plus the insurance side is way scummier since their entire purpose is to help people but they will go to no end to corner the market.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Their entire purpose is to make money - insurance companies don't give a shit about helping anyone, it's just an unfortunate byproduct of charging the premium that they're legally obliged to pay out some of their income.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also gives them significantly better bargaining power when setting rates.</p>
<p>Its similar to how single payer works in a lot of countries-if youre the only game in town,people either try to do businesd with you or go bankrupt</p></div>		</li>
