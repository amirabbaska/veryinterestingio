			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher elevations, or more specifically peaks with a higher difference in elevation than their surrounding valleys, undergo a much higher amount of precipitation, either rain or snow. These processes erode very quickly in large amounts. Flat surfaces have less runoff, which causes less erosion from gravity on the flowing water. So flatter valleys in turn have less precipitation and less gravity-driven processes so they have less erosion in general. I hope that made sense and was easy to follow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have been saying, mountains have &quot;roots&quot;. The crust of earth (which is what mountains are made of) is less dense than the mantle material it sits on top of. As a result, the crust floats on top. The crust is thicker where mountains are, and much like a glacier floating in water, there is even more of the mountain below the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>A higher mountain has a larger root, which protrudes further into the mantle. The mantle is hotter as you go deeper, so eventually the root of the mountain will begin to melt. As the bottom of the root melts and is absorbed into the mantle, the mountain sinks because there is less of the less-dense crust material of the root to support the weight of the mountain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes erosion can lead to an increase in mountain range height. Erosion largely affects valley floors, working to widen and deepen them, removing a lot of mass from mountain ranges. The less massive maintains roughly the same peaks, but the loss of mass causes them to rebound to keep isostasy, making maximum elevation rise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The trick is that water is dense, though not as dense as rock, and can act to support the base. </p>
<p>The pressure exerted on the submerged part of the mountain by the rock above it is partially supported by the pressure from the water adjacent to it. If you drained the Pacific Ocean, Mauna Kea would likely crumble. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you measure them from the ocean floor in order to really compare the two you should measure Everest hight from  the ocean floor, it's not like Everest doesn't have a rock structure far below the land. Really what is the base of any mountain? When does a mountain stop being a mountain starts being ground? Is it when the land becomes level? Is it sea level? Ta not like there is a straight disconnect from the rising of mountain and the rest of the land, and it's not like any land is really level without human interaction. It's a matter of perspective. </p>
<p>So the solution is to use a different way, and that to measure altitude (elevation), as we go up in the air the air loses pressure at a predictively rate which we can measure and we can make any level the arbitrary 0, like seal level (at high tide or at low tide) and truly compare apples to apples. That's why you see mountains measured from sea level (which changes too!) and not from some ground level. (There are of course other methods to determine this.)</p>
<p>So Everest is the tallest mountain when you truly compare hight and by hight I mean altitude/elevation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>On earth, it works out that Everest is probably pretty close to this limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would you happen to have a source for this claim? I agree that the crustal strength can set an upper limit for the maximum height of a mountain, but I'm not sure why would assume that Mount Everest has to be close to this limit. After all, many other processes limit the actual size of mountains that you see. For example, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v460/n7257/abs/nature08263.html" target="_blank">this paper</a> specifically identifies glacial erosion as the key factor limiting the height of most mountain ranges on Earth. In effect you have a &quot;glacial buzzsaw&quot; that prevents mountains for growing too much beyond a certain height, kind of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLfM1FB58yA" target="_blank">as shown in this clip</a>. More importantly, as the paper emphasizes in the abstract:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>differences in the height of mountain ranges mainly reflect variations in local climate rather than tectonic forces</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sentence above gives a qualitatively different answer to OP's question, at least here on Earth. While the surface gravity and the compressive strength of the rock can set a theoretical upper limit for the height of mountains, in practice you can be quite far from this limit. That may be the case on Earth, where it could instead by glacial erosion that puts the upper limit in the height of the mountains that might form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a good first approximation as an absolute maximum upper limit.  But in the real world there are factors that usually chop it down sooner than that.  Erosion is one of them already mentioned (assuming the planet has a suitable atmosphere), but one that hasn't been mentioned is the effect of heat.</p>
<p>As you thicken up the lithosphere it means more of it will be at a higher temperature due to both in-situ radiogenic generation and due to heat flowing from deeper in the planet that is now insulated by the thicker lithosphere (~25C/km depth is typical away from plate boundaries, but it can be 50-70C/km in some mountain ranges).  This means rocks get pretty hot once you go several km down.  The increasing temperature substantially weakens the shear strength of silicate rocks once you've reached a few hundred C, especially if water is present.  300-400C is usually the temperature where the properties start changing.  Basically, &quot;P&quot; in the equation isn't going to be constant because of that temperature relationship and the typical geothermal gradients in mountain ranges.</p>
<p>The effect is kind of like turning the deep interior of the mountain range into softer jello while the upper part remains relatively cold, brittle, and strong cake.  The mountain range can stretch and flow laterally under its own weight and it will simultaneously flatten out due to the weakened zone in its deep interior.  The process is usually referred to as &quot;gravity spreading&quot;.  This process means a simple application of the &quot;cold, brittle&quot; shear strength of rock will overestimate the maximum height achievable on terrestrial planets with a decent geothermal gradient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  A &quot;dead&quot; planet may not have as many erosion factors like glaciacion, precipitation, or even weather in general, or even an atmosphere.  Your generalization is more about a hunk of planetary rock in space without looking at other factors like erosion or plate tectonics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's likely true. It might be the case that the larger the base of the mountain chain, the taller it can be. A small based mountain chain, because each peak must have a deep root to offset its height, means a smaller height. If two very large continents collided, and the base were larger than that of the Tibetan plateau, then theoretically, the peaks could be higher than Mt. Everest.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that of the mountain chains found in hot spots, such as the Hawaiian isles. Mauna Loa is ca. 14K ft. above sea level, but in fact it extends much deeper, to the plain from which it arises. Therefore, hot spot mountains ought to be  taken into account, too.</p>
<p>Mauna Kea, which is higher by about 110' than Mauna Loa rises about 33K feet from the sear floor. making it thus the tallest mountain on the planet from base to peak. This is 4K feet higher than Mt. Everest.</p>
<p>And we have yet to consider Mons Olympus on Mars.....  which HAS no oceans. Yet it has a very huge mass, and the lower gravity of Mars.  22 kms. in height, which compared to earth's tallest mountains at 11K m. is more than twice the height.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good points. In fact, the height of the paleo Adirondaks, and other old mountain ranges are estimated to exceed the height of Himalayas by quite a bit.</p>
<p>I would bet that the &quot;highest possible mountain&quot; is not a specific value for any given planet, but rather highly circumstantial.</p>
