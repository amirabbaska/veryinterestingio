			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought I read somewhere that when the brain gets the mixed signals it basically goes into emergency evac mode to clear you of poisons. So as a result, when you get really bad motion sickness you donâ€™t just vomit, but you get horrible diarrhea too. </p>
<p>It happened to me last time I was on a boat in choppy water and it got so bad I shit my pants. Weird thing is that I never got seasick in like 30 years, then some switch was flipped and now I get it easily. </p></div>		</li>

<p>it's not the moving itself that causes motion sickness it's the acceleration. That's what moves the stuff around in your ears. So it's more your eyes saying &quot;I am not moving&quot; vs your ears saying &quot;you are falling over!&quot; that's the problem here.</p></div>		</li>
