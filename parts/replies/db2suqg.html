			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, it's the first time i heard a black hole described in this perspective. I more or less get it, but could you clarify this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Space flows instead of time.</li>
<li>Singularity is a point in the future.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please? </p>

<p>Reading it several times, it is still hard to describe without contradicting myself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are on a boat stuck in a whirlpool.  The medium in which you reside is flowing towards the center faster than your vessel is physically capable of moving.  You cannot fight it.  So no matter which direction you try to move, you are still headed inexorably inwards. </p>
<p>The metaphor isn't perfect, since with a sufficiently powerful engine you could escape (not an option with a black hole), but still. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i see vr as  great tool for visualizing spatial warping from gravitation effects. you could simulate what any kind of black hole would look like in a place that is relative to humans and allow us to observe the effects with out being torn apart by it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know im super late lol but i like to think of it as standing at the north pole. Because of the shape of the earth no matter what direction you go its unavoidably south. I thought you might like that analogy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you fall in together with the clock nearby, you wouldn't see anything unusual, and you also notice nothing special at the event horizon (at least if no quantum effects become important there). Observers outside would stop seeing the clock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say I'm in a primitive 2016 era space craft that flies towards a black hole.  When I pass the event horizon, I'm going to be crushed to death by the gravity quite quickly, no?  I wouldn't hover in time for all eternity or anything in reality, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's true for a sufficiently massive black hole, for smaller ones you'd be torn apart long before you reached the event horizon in the first place. </p></div>		</li>
