			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, the accent from Tangier sounds exactly like the accent in &quot;Down East&quot; North Carolina. The area is largely small islands, kind of at the base of the Outer Banks, and people theorize that since the only way to get to the mainland was by boat for so long, that the accent is almost perfectly preserved from the part of England most of the area was settled from.</p>
<p>Edit: The accent, or &quot;brogue&quot; as my family always called it, is called &quot;Hoi Toider&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I feel like a conversation between someone with this accent and someone with a mountain accent would sound like two entirely different languages</p></div>		</li>
