<p>An impact to the lower jaw when it's not braced can slam your teeth together hard enough to shatter them, it's a common way people break teeth.</p>
<p>A broken tooth could easily lead to infection, and tooth infection was one of the top 5 leading causes of death up until the time we came up with antibiotics. Makes a lot of sense to have a strong instinctual reaction that could help prevent that kind of trauma. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only that, but impact that rams your jaw backwards into your skull (known as 'the button' in boxing) can knock you unconscious more easily than blows to most other parts of the head, so clenching your teeth tightens those muscles up and makes it harder to move the jaw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is absolutely right. It is preventing that incapacitating blow, but it isn't just ramming the jaw backwards that can do it but jarring it as well (I.e a hook to the jaw)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it might be to create better leverage through the body. if you've tried benching without bridging through the hips, your max weight is way way less. you have to synchronize muscle groups, or at least tense them, to put the force down better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot of muscles connect into back and shoulders from the neck. Large important muscles cross two joints so you need to stabilize one joint to create movement at the other. Your jaw muscles (as well as all the other muscles in the front of your neck) prevent your head from whipping back and losing force when using your upper traps. </p></div>		</li>
