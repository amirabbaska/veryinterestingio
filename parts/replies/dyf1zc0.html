			<div class="markdown"><p>While we’re talking about Norse mythology I think it’s important noting two (technically three) things. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are two races of gods Æsir and Vanir (irrelevant but worth noting) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Norse mythology, as learned through the Prose Edda, is based on this one guy trying to find gods but the gods catching on and making him hallucinate meeting three beings that answer all his questions about the gods. It’s heavily implied that the three gods were making the shit up as they went and at the end of the story there’s an epilogue where the gods name people and places with the made up names to make their story believable. Thus making normal people and normal places become magical and legendary.</p>
</li>
<li>The Vikings knew this and were completely fine with it </li>
</ol>
<p>Ninja edit: I would like to also add that I’m not an expert and just really like Norse stuff  before people who have actually studied Norse mythology show up and start tearing into me</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is the fake part canon? or is the part where they tell the lies canon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s more of the Viking people didn’t have gods per se. They believed in all the creation stories with giants and dwarves and elves, but when it came to gods they were just normal people who did legendary things. They essentially worshiped another civilization that you could join when you achieve death in battle.</p>
<p>And I do believe that as time went on the part where everything was BSed kinda got lost, thus creating the mythology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Daemon basically are spirits, this is why if you look up Buer you will find he doesn't match what you would think of when it comes to demons. </p>
<p>The titans are greater abstractions, with even greater abstractions being the primordials. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently there was (very little but still there) evidence of jotunn worship. I've never heard of Titan worship. But the jotunn represented strength and survival outside of civilization, and even the gods seemed to appreciate that (such as with Odin having a son, Thor, with one).</p></div>		</li>
