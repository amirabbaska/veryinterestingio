			<p>Actually, I asked them all these things. Interesting differences: <br><br><em> My father made $860 in a record week of bartending. In the 1980s. I'll let you use your own inflation adjustment, but it ain't small no matter how you cut it.<br></em> The phone wasn't too bad...unless you made long distance calls. Living cross-country from your parents, it was quite easy to spend more in a month than I do on a smartphone plan (under $50.)<br><em> Cars were more expensive. A tiny econobox with automatic and air conditioning was ~50% more expensive than its' modern equivalent - and it depreciated much faster. Also, the current Fiesta is something like half again the size and twice as powerful. Unless you were driving a hoopty (which only worked if you had the skills of Smokey Yunick,) transportation cost.<br></em> Airfare was, paradoxically, sometimes <em>less</em> expensive. Oh, wait. Oil cost darn near nothing.<br><em> The price of housing had not yet been inflated like Dutch tulips. <br></em> Meat was cheaper. </p>		</li>

			<p>So your father made more money than you and was able to afford Luxury's as a result.<br><br>What your father did has no bearing on your lifestyle.<br><br>Perhaps you should consider finding a better paying job like your father did or changing your own lifestyle to reflect the means you have to live in.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah! The job market is so good they should just find a better paying job. Why doesn't <a href="http://www.reddit.com/user/jrshaul" target="_blank">/u/jrshaul</a> just do that. This just shows how lazy people these days are.<br><br>/s</p>		</li>

			<p>Blame everything but yourself.<br><br>Just reinforces my original point.<br><br>Nobody is saying it is easy. Millenials seem to think it should be</p>		</li>

			<p>I didn't say that it should be easy. I was just replying to the statement:<br><br>&gt;Perhaps you should consider finding a better paying job...<br><br>You made it sounds like it's easy.<br><br>Laziness might be part of it on an individual level, but most people are just having a hard time finding a job.<br><br>Sorry if I sounded rude in the last post.</p>		</li>

			<p>People who are not lazy have a far easier time finding a job. If it is difficult to find a job you are doing it wrong.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sorry for the late reply.<br><br>&gt;People who are not lazy have a far easier time finding a job.<br><br>That is true, I don't think anybody is debating that.<br><br>&gt;If it is difficult to find a job you are doing it wrong.<br><br>There are many causes of unemployment. Sure, some people are lazy, but many people are unemployed because they got laid off. Some people could not afford college, so that are stuck with low paying jobs.<br><br>Edit: Formatting</p>		</li>
