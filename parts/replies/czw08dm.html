			<div class="markdown"><p>So in order to make gravitational waves you need to shake something really massive really fast. In the case of two inspiraling black holes, the amplitude is related to how hard they are accelerating in their orbit, and the frequency is related to the period of the orbit.</p>
<p>This is why inspiraling binaries have a gravitational wave 'chirp' - as they come closer in their orbit the frequency increases as they orbit faster and faster, and the amplitude increases as well. </p>
<p>If a wave passes through you, it will strain you a bit, effectively squeezing and stretching you. The amount of the squeeze is related to the amplitude, the frequency of the wave is just the frequency of the squeezing. It's this tiny wavey squeezing that LIGO was designed to measure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In order to make waves, or waves we can detect?</p>
<p>I guess I don't understand why the waves would only exist past a certain threshold. If I drop a pebble in the ocean it makes a very small wave, but a wave nonetheless.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but you can drop a pebble in the ocean in New York and never be able to identify it from England. However an Earthquake in Hawaii can cause a tsunami in Japan.</p>
<p>Gravity dissipates over long distances, and space is truly huge. Therefore in order to detect gravity waves we require gargantuan gravitational events.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the press conference they said that Ligo was measuring fluctuations at 10^-17 meters for this event. This event was a pair black holes, one being ~26 solar masses and the other ~32 solar masses.  Smaller masses would be even harder to detect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The events that produce gravitational waves are destructive for other reasons.</p>
<p>Had this event occurred within 50 light years, the gravitational waves might have been capable of causing a small seismic disturbance on Earth. But if this event happened 50 light years away, Earth would be completely obliterated by the energy released.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>biologist here, not physicist, but deeply curious about this subject.</p>
<p>Q: by &quot;shake&quot; do you mean &quot;spin&quot; ?</p>
<p>dont all bodies (capable of gravitational influence) rotate/spin and thus cause additional 'torque' on gravitational force? Is this taken into account accurately?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spin isn't necessarily enough, no. The spinning body would need to be asymmetric somehow. A spinning neutron star with a mountain ~1 cm high, for example, should emit gravitational radiation, and there are groups in LIGO looking for this too. The gravitational radiation is produced by shaking as well though. Even wiggling your fingers will produce (very tiny) gravitational waves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The frequency is determined by the frequency of the moving masses (there's a factor of 2 due to symmetry).  The amplitude - the strength of the wave - comes from the masses, speeds, and Newton's constant G.  Mathematically, it's the rate of change of the quadrupole moment.  We can tell that radiation must be a quadrupole moment because changing monopole moment isn't allowed due to conservation of mass/energy, dipole moment can't change because of conservation of momentum.  So, we're left with higher order, and through GR we can find that it is in fact the quadrupole.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but a little different from electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>A gravitational wave distorts space in such a way that a circle perpendicular to the direction the wave travels gets distorted into an oval -- first compressed horizontally and elongated vertically, and then compressed vertically and elongated horizontally, and back and forth between those two situations.</p></div>		</li>
