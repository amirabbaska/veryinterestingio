			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the field become weaker as it got closer to center. If a smaller object exerts less gravity, I'd suspect that it would decrease the closer you are to the center. Less mass to the center, more on the other side, right? Of course, if you're accelerating, and that acceleration slows, you're still accelerating, not slowing down. Okay, think I got it. Maximum speed at the center, albeit with the minimum to zero acceleration. In a friction-less environment, you'd pop out the other side, just barely, then go right back in.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spherical shell above the ball exerts zero gravity -- tugs from various location on the shell cancel out.<br />
Assuming constant density, mass of the sphere beneath the ball is density * 4/3 pi r^3 where r is the ball's distance from center.</p>
<p>And gravity g is GM/r^2. Substituting above expression for mass:<br />
g = GM/r^2 = G(density * 4/3 pi r^3 )/r^2 =<br />
<strong>G <em> density </em> r</strong> .</p>
<p>Gravity scales with r, the ball's distance from center. So of course at the center gravity is zero.</p></div>		</li>
