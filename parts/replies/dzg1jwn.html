			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the answer. It’s not technology. It’s about expectations and what we have been conditioned to think of as ‘realistic’. Consider the stories of audiences jumping out of the way of the very first moving footage of a train approaching the camera. Today, we would never think of that footage as ‘realistic’ but audiences in the distant past had a very different set of expectations and conditioning. This is the same phenomenon, I believe, that can be observed as video games improve. We can be absolutely be blown over by graphics (for me it was footage of Gran Turismo 2, those cars looked reeeeeaaaaaal) in one generation only to be unimpressed by the same thing a few years later. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gran Turismo 2 is well aged imo, plus the menu sounds are just so nostalgic, and dope.. If I could go back in time.. I'd work out more, and play GT2 on the side, and invent the selfie stick. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn that game was hard as a 10 year old. Days spent grinding the same track again and again to beat that time trial with repetitively only being 0.02sec over. Had to get the next licence</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although EA sports games look god awful and nobody else seems to notice. I’m fine with low poly, low detail models when the camera is zoomed out (it’s all about perspective), but come on, at least try to make the players look good when we can see them well. I’d be embarrassed to be a part of that studio if I were releasing content like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off the topic, but I feel like people often forget that the Hobbit and LotR have different tones and thematic weight because they were supposed to have been written by Bilbo and Frodo, respectively. Bilbo was telling an exaggerated, bombastic tale of his personal journey where he considered himself the hero. Frodo was trying to accurately portray the events of his journey.</p></div>		</li>
