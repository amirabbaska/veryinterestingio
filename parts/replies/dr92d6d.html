			<div class="markdown"><p>Also Quebec is on the Eastern side of North America so it's more influenced by the North American continental air mass than Paris which is closer to the Atlantic and prevailing Westerly winds, getting a more maritime air mass. Land stores heat less well than the Ocean so continental areas get colder during winter months and often hotter during the summer where the ocean then has a cooling effect. Basically the oceans moderate the air temperate above them through the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Gulf Stream has an impact, but it's small.  The paper cited in the original answer says that &quot;[ocean currents] contribute at most 2 degrees C out of the total contrast of 15 degrees C&quot; between Europe and Eastern North America in winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While your answer is correct, I think many people will misunderstand it to mean that the gulf stream isn't a big source of heat for western Europe, and that's definitely not the case. According to the paper you quote, <strong>western Europe would be 3-6°C colder in winter without the gulf stream</strong> (and up to 20°C colder in Norway!). But the gulf stream also cases eastern North America to heat up. That's why it isn't responsible for the <em>difference</em> between the two coasts (except for regions north of 60°N).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The temperature change is quite zonally uniform. In the North Atlantic sector
removing the global OHT cools much of Western Europe (the British Isles, Scandinavia,
France and Germany) by an average of 3 °C and by over 6 °C in parts of Russia
between the Black Sea and the Arctic. However, eastern North America also cools by
about 3 °C. The zonal-mean cooling north of 35 ± N is 4.5 °C. The temperature
change in western Europe is due to cooler air advecting in with the mean winds, while
the change over Russia is more likely caused by a change in circulation around the
Icelandic Low (see section 3(c)). The cooling in eastern North America is probably
caused by a weakening of the pattern, seen in the observations in Fig. 3(b), of transient-
eddy heat-flux divergence over the Gulf Stream region and convergence over eastern
North America. This occurs because the winter ocean heat loss in the Gulf Stream region
reduces when the OHT is removed. Thus the OHT warms northern hemisphere winters
by a few °C in an essentially zonally uniform way while the temperature contrasts
across the basins must be explained by other processes.</p>
<p>Figure 10 shows the change in surface air temperature for the case with OHT minus
the case without OHT as simulated by the GISS model. The pattern of temperature
change is similar to that in the CCM3 model: OHT causes a warming of a few °C that
is quite zonally uniform. The remarkable exceptions are that, in the GISS model, where
sea-ice cover is allowed to vary, removal of OHT causes an expansion of winter sea ice
near Kamchatka and in the Norwegian and Barents Seas that, in turn, causes dramatic
cooling (as much as 20 °C) of the air temperature immediately above and to the east.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the Gulf Stream effect is so much a myth, as it is not the whole story. Any modeler will tell you that results of one model simulation don't debunk anything. Model bias is no joke.</p>
<p>Edit: I am a modeler, should have mentioned that! Not brigading I promise :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not just one, though.</p>
<p>Kaspi &amp; Schneider (2011, <a href="http://www.weizmann.ac.il/eserpages/kaspi/publications/Kaspi-Schneider-2011a.pdf" target="_blank">PDF here</a>) also did GCM modeling to show that the ocean heat sink effect is really important.</p></div>		</li>
