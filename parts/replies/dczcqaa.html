			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it's exactly that. But I usually don't like to just say that because I found out a lot of people just repeat this sentence as they learnt it in school without really understanding it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm with you there. I think people do that a lot more than they would like to think, myself included. There is a big difference between saying the right words and having the ability to actually apply the knowledge in reality. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i once asked a (very bright) eighth grader &quot;so, if every action has an equal and opposite reaction, how does anything actually move?&quot;. it totally stumped him. he had a decent grasp of physics, but that particular phrase was just something he learnt without ever understanding it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were floating in space and threw something, say a wrench, your body experiences the same force in the opposite direction. You would start moving in the opposite direction. Same thing occurs with rocket engines, they are ejecting hot gas in a very specific direction to go in the other direction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have much education in physics but I like to think of it in terms of center of gravity. You and the wrench are acting as one body of mass, and if you throw the wrench, there's nothing outside of that body to move it in either direction. If the wrench moved left and you stayed in the same place, the center of gravity would have shifted left - but there's no force acting on the you+wrench mass to move it left. So it only makes sense that you would move right, maintaining the center of gravity.</p>
<p>Maybe &quot;center of mass&quot; would be a better term in this context. Anyway thinking of it that way helps me conceptually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is another way of looking at the problem.  The center of mass of a system doesn't move (unless you have some outside force affecting it).</p>
<p>So let's take a stationary rocket in a vacuum.  It expels gas violently in one direction.  The gas has mass and all moves far away from the rocket.  In order for the center of mass to stay in the same spot, the rocket must move in the opposite direction to offset the change in the mass distribution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think an interesting way to look at recoil/thrusters in space is to think of center of mass. It's true that in space a closed system has no mass to &quot;push off&quot; of.  So the center of mass has no opposite force to move. However, the thrusters jet a mass of hot gas behind this system. This would displace the center of mass of the whole system behind the thrusters relative to the ship, so the ship must move forward to conserve the same center of mass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really really like this way of looking at it. The only problem is that a lot of people don't know the concept of center of mass. But it works well when your interlocutor understand closed systems and Cg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, this means that the center of mass for the system as a whole is still right on the launchpad. Right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun thought, but no. Before the ship escapes orbit into &quot;empty&quot; space the thrusters had something to &quot;push against&quot; (atmosphere and the earth). So in this case the system is not closed and momentum is transferred to the earth and atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the rocket exhaust be pushing...the rocket? Specifically the engine bell as gas tries to expand in all directions due to combustion but cannot save for the direction of the exhaust?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's essentially another way of saying the same thing; both are pushing against each other. Because the rocket exhaust is made of small particles, these particles gain a lot of velocity out of the interaction, while the heavy rocket gains relatively little.</p></div>		</li>
