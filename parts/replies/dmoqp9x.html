<p>To be a viable energy source, fusion reactors on earth will have to operate at energy densities that are orders of magnitude higher than the sun, and at significantly higher temperatures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You're confusing energy density and power density.<br />
Energy density is a measure of how much energy is in the system.<br />
Power density is a measure of how quickly 'new' energy is being created.<br />
The Sun has very high energy densities (a back of the envelope calculation suggests 10^15 J/m^3 which is roughly 1 megaton equivalent) but it has very low power densities (it makes very little 'new' energy in a given period of time).<br />
For a fusion power system you'd want lower energy density, but higher power density (i.e. you want less stuff, but you want it to be 'burning' much faster).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely correct. I was thinking in terms of energy production, aka power density. I'll clarify in my comment above. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I hate it when people call building a fusion reactor as capturing &quot;A piece of the sun.&quot;</p>

<p>In case you haven't watched the video - the subject of the video isn't a metaphor - they're being literal, and did the math on what would happen were someone to <em>actually</em> bring parts of the sun to Earth. The video doesn't discuss man-made fusion reactors at all.</p></div>		</li>
