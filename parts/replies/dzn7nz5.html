<p>I didn't think that sounded quite right, plus it's spelled &quot;sarsaparilla&quot;, so I looked it up on etymonline.com and sarsaparilla comes from, well, sarsaparilla root, not sassafras. (from Spanish <em>zarzaparilla</em>):</p>

<p>I've had sarsaparilla before, it's like a &quot;sharper&quot;-tasting root beer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually sarsaparilla is different from sassafras. It’s safrole that’s carcinogenic and most root beers are made with artificial safrole flavor. Barq’s is one of the few that’s made with sarsaparilla root. </p></div>		</li>
