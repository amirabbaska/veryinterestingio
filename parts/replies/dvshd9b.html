			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question. I personally don't know very much about cross-cultural comparisons in attitudes toward animals--though I would like to know more. (It is hard, because I only speak English... so my ability to research is limited.) I do think we need to be cautious about making universal statements about how people ought to think about and treat animals because there is huge diversity in worldviews, and begin by asking questions and trying to understand where people are coming from. That said, I would like to see agreement on one universal value: that it is wrong to cause suffering to other living creatures. We could add the qualifier &quot;unnecessary&quot; before &quot;suffering,&quot; but that waters things down so much that the principle loses its bite.</p></div>		</li>
