			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love an answer to this, because it's so true.  Have a temperature of 38.0c and your normally hot shower feels cold, but crank your house from 20c to 22c and there's not much of a difference!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess it's because the good temperature isolation (English is not my first language so I'm not sure of the correct word for it) of the air, you won't be able to tell much the difference between 30 and 35 air around you, but 30 or 35 in water it's way more noticeable because water conducts temperature better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because there are vast differences in heat capacity, density and thermal conductivity of water and air.</p>
<p>You can experience the same differences just by touching different objects. If you touch a metal table, it will feel colder than a wood table, even though they are both at room temperature.</p>
<p>The difference in heat capacity means the water molecules absorb more energy when they go from a lower temperature to the temperature of your body. The difference in density means there are more water molecules in direct contact with you. The difference in thermal conductivity means the energy absorbed from your body will spread faster in a bath than in a room full of air.</p></div>		</li>
