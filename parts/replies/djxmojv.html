			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you've oversimplified the observations in the documentary but I did respond to a broader set of skills.  I equated the coywolves watching (tracking) of peoples patterns to remain unseen to tracking prey. They seemed two sides of the same coin to me but phrasing it as you did I can see how you see it as unrelated.</p>
<p>Either way it's a pretty damn interesting documentary.</p></div>		</li>
