			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't usually post on here but I do work in the industry. Another huge reason is the Temperpedic brand. Once other companies saw how much people were willing to spend on a mattress they raised their prices up significantly.</p>
<p>As far as advice when buying a mattress I can not stress this enough: Buy what feels comfortable to you. I don't care if it has gel foam or a bag of rice in it the ONLY thing that matters. That being said this truly is the one place as far as furniture goes you should be willing to spend a few extra bucks as it can literally change your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying other companies said, &quot;Some people are buying those expensive memory-foam mattresses instead of ours. You know what we should do to get more customers to buy our mattresses instead of theirs? Raise our prices!&quot;</p>
<p>edit: This is just a joke. I don't need a hundred explanations for the real reason they did it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Raising prices can be a way to convince consumers you're selling a luxury good. I believe that's basically how Grey Goose vodka works, for example. (Meanwhile I can buy literally the same thing at Costco without the brand name for much cheaper.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have an iComfort as well.  One of the best purchases I have ever made.  Also has a 25 year warranty!  I bought the plush, and every night I go to bed I sleep like a baby.  There hasn't been a single day where I haven't fallen into that bed feeling good.  If I feel exhausted I always just walk up to my bed and slam into it, like it were a big marshmallow; then slowly sink into it just like it was a big marshmallow.</p>
<p>I am a big guy, 6'4&quot;, 300lbs, and it is also a quiet bed.  I have a solid bed frame and lowpro split box springs and I can literally jump into bed with making a peep.</p>
<p>I used to work at a store that sold mattresses and I still up sell that bed; and I wasn't even in sales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also had back-pain for years, last December we finally decided that we should buy a new bed, that our budget was roughly $2000 (15 000kr) and that we should thoroughly test out all kinds of beds so we knew for sure what we really wanted.</p>
<p>After a few days testing different beds over a few weeks we decided that we definitely should break our budget and bought a Carpe Diem - Korn√∂ (180x210cm) for $5500 (40 000kr) instead.</p>
<p>It's the best thing either of us has ever bought and we haven't regretted it for a second.</p>
<p>My back-pain disappeared within a few days and has been gone except for when spending more than a week somewhere else. I can move around without her noticing a thing and we sleep like babies ever since. :)</p>
<p>Pro-tip: Find a hotel that has the bed you're interested in, stay for a few nights and try it out. (we did) If the durability works for a hotel it should work for you. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of the best beds I've slept in were just yellow foam with a cover. They were in cabins and the likes so it was just a few night every time, but it makes me wonder if I should look into it when I wear out my current $1500 mattress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could also be that if those beds were in cabins for cottages or camping, that you had spend all day running around outside and being active so your body was effectively exhausted and tired so you went to sleep very quickly and easily.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've bought my last 3 mattresses on craigslist, sealy &amp; beautyrests california kings, for about 200$, just a couple years old. If there's pictures, they state how old the mattress is &amp; it's a non smoking home, I see no problem buying used. There is actually a market. always a lot on sale on craigslist, and it's something more people should take advantage of, get a fantastic bed for 80-90% off the retail price because someone is moving across the country, or just wanted an even more luxurious bed. </p>
<p>got a spotless microfiber sectional with chaise &amp; recliner on craigslist a few months ago, too. 150$ for something retailing for 800$-1000$</p>
<p>Got a 27 inch flatscreen hdtv ( tube tv ), 20$ for my stepdaughters room.</p>
<p>cherry wood &amp; bamboo dining table with 4 chairs from Pier1 imports, 75$ on craigslist.</p>
<p>Buy used, it's good for the environment, it's good for your wallet.</p>
<p>*<em>edit: for the people saying how disgusting a used mattress is, that's why I look at pictures, &amp; call and ask if there are any stains and if a mattress cover was used, you can also look for ads in upscale neighborhoods, well off people take better care of their stuff, so less worrying about bed bugs and such, most people are also </em>not&quot;scumbags who would knowingly sell you a bedbug infested mattress, but generally buying only from people who seem honest and don't live in a slum will protect you from bad purchases, I use common sense, and have not had a single craigslist purchase I've regretted in the last decade**</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was so happy to find that place. There's a lot of crap out there claiming to have &quot;reviews&quot; of various mattresses that are really marketing tools. We spent <em>weeks</em> researching the damn things after coming within an inch of making a really regrettable Sleep Number purchase, and that site helped quite a bit with clearing the fog. Ended up going with talalay latex and we're very happy with it (and spent $1k less than we would have on that Sleep Number).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Got a lot of research done here and &quot;sleeplikethedead&quot; which is another website that aggregates reviews to try to compare mattresses.</p>
<p>After a lot of stressing, advice form &quot;Pheonix&quot;, and research I bought my memory foam mattress online for about $1400 (mattress, foundation, and shipping all included plus 2 pillows). The equivalent set from a big box retailer would have been roughly $5000. </p>
<p>I quite literally sleep on a bed of money and comfort. </p></div>		</li>
