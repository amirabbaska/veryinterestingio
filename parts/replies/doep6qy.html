			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add a point, in case anyone thinks that the boronation is in any way dangerous to the safe operation of the reactor:</p>
<p>The boronated water tanks will inject into the vessel and the boron will abosorb neutrons, preventing the reaction from maintaining criticality and thus will shut down the reactor by “poisoning” the reaction. During this process, the boron will be circulated into many of the plant's cooling systems. Reactors rely heavily on a very tightly controlled water chemistry, and adding tons of chemical “poison” will upset the balance and make it difficult to run the reactor. Although every component would function and would be undamaged by the boron, it would be expensive to clean up the entire reactor to a point where you got out all the boron and could maintain chemistry to run it again. We are talking draining and processing millions of gallons of contaminated water several times in order to get all the boron out, and you would still have to deal with any residuals left in the bottom of your pipes or which has chemically bonded or precipitated out on the interior surfaces. With energy price for competing fuels (natural gas) so low, restarting a BWR after a boron injection would be an exercise in beancounting – eventually it would cost more than you could ever expect to make off of the electricity for the plant's remaining lifespan. Note also that this only applies to Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs). A Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) uses boronated water as a normal part of controlling criticality during operation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been spurious SLC injections before. It's not a death sentence for the plant on its own. You can flush it out, it's not as hard to get out as GE first thought it was. </p>
<p>The real issue is if you had a scram failure. In scram failure scenarios you have to take very rapid action to start SLC, disable all emergency core cooling systems, terminate all feedwater injection, shut down the reactor recirculation/coolant pumps, and lower level as low as allowable on natural circulation to cause power to drop. Then you inject as little water as possible and try to prevent core or containment damage. </p>
<p>Scram failure severity depends on the event. If the steam lines spuriously isolate and the reactor fails to scram, you'll violate the ASME upset code limit and the reactor pressure safety limit (possibly the MCPR safety limit as well), and once you violate any safety limit you cannot restart the reactor without NRC permission. </p>
<p>But if it's something like a low power turbine trip with scram failure, you may not have violated any safety limit. Boron injections and shuts the core down. Now you just have to deal with license violations, not safety limit violations. Still not good, but much less challenging to get out of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rapid uncontrolled cold water injection into a critical reactor can cause power spikes which damage the core. So you want everything disabled, and only used if absolutely necessary, as the eccs is typically off or on at full flow. </p>
<p>You also want to reduce cooling as much as possible. As long as the core is either submerged or has at least 10% power worth of steam flow it is safely cooled provided you maintain natural circulation as low as possible. If power stays high, you can either have core damaging power oscillations, or you will discharge steam into containment and damage it. So you want to reduce cooling to cause power to drop to buy time for boron to inject. </p>
<p>The fact that light water reactors have their power drop as they heat up is a safety feature. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understood, a turbine trip with no SCRAM results in a higher initial pressure (TCV's/TSV's close in about 0.1 seconds vs the MSIV's closing in 3-5 seconds).  </p>
<p>Also we lower level in an ATWS to trip the recirculation pumps instead of tripping them ourselves to prevent a L8 trip of our Main Turbine.  </p>
<p>You're doing God's work, by the way.  Thanks for taking your time to do this for our industry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's different from plant to plant. In general, MSIV closure is the peak pressure event, and generator load reject without bypass is the peak reactivity event, but they aren't that far off from each other, and are flipped in some plants based on size of the steam lines, relief valve response, etc.</p>
<p>The actual BWR Owners Group Emergency Planning Guidelines has you run back recirculation flow to minimum, and if power is still above 5%, then trip the pumps one at a time. Some plants like the one I'm at decided that it was a waste to spend time lowering flow, when you can just lower level and let the ARI system trip the pumps for you at reduced water levels. The BWROG is going to provide more flexibility for either option in the next revision of the EPGs. </p>
<p>I know for my plant, our digital feedwater responds so fast that we no longer take a level 8 on a dual RR pump trip. It's pretty silly. When I first saw it in the simulator I said something was wrong with the sim, until we analyzed all the data and realized.....no that's how it works now.</p></div>		</li>
