<p>That's assuming the object isn't also baked in a neutron flux. The flux intensity matters. As does the neutron energy level. (Raytheon sends certain boards off to reactors for baking. What they do with them after getting it back, I have no idea.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some really great stories from the Cold War about Soviet reverse-engineering. They did great with big complex mechanical devices â€” they were able to dissect a B-29, figure out the key materials and tolerances and functions, then come up with their own version that they could adapt to their own manufacturing methods and constraints (the Tupolev Tu-4). </p>
<p>But other things were <em>really</em> hard. Information technology was just not easy to deal with. Complex circuits don't require just knowing <em>what</em> was made (which you can get by just getting your hands on one), it requires having the know-how to operate the foundries in which they were made. And that was very tightly-held information, nothing that could be just smuggled out. So the Soviets would smuggle out computer chips, and could <em>use</em> those chips, but didn't have the ability to make their own. That was something you couldn't really &quot;steal.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
