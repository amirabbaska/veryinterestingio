			<div class="markdown"><p>Umami, the &quot;savory&quot; taste, is a little more specific. It is present in beef and parmesan cheese but also in seaweed (nori) and mushrooms.<br />
It was &quot;discovered&quot; by Japanese scientists so their word is used which doesn't match exactly with the English language concept of &quot;savory&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Savory food is anything that is not sweet. So it can be salty, spicy, fatty etc just never sweet. Savory pancakes could be pancakes with bacon and butter but no syrup.</p>
<p>Umami is a sub-type of savory food that occurs when food contains a lot of glutamate. So mushrooms, anchovies, cheese, tomatoes, soy; seems random but all these foods have a distinctive savory flavour to them. Dried and fermented foods are generally highest in umami. (think about how dried mushrooms or tomatoes taste compared to fresh)</p>
<p>Foods can belong to more than one category so cheese is umami and fatty. Soy is umami and salty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's like trying to describe what sour is. </p>
<p>Have you ever had a bad pizza?  Usually that's three things.  The sauce is sweet (instead of umami), the cheese is bland (lacks the umami from mixing in some parmesan), and the cheese is undercooked and hasn't undergone the maillard reaction.  </p>
<p>Have you ever tried to make a stir fry and it just sucks?  Usually that's because it doesn't have fish sauce in it (the umami ingredient).  A lot of western people don't know bout fish sauce.</p>
<p>It's worth looking up both umami and the maillard reaction if you are interested in this sort of thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah my mom has made stir fly a bunch of times, but I don't think she ever put fish sauce in it. She put chicken bullion in it or something though, that would kinda be what umami tastes like I think?</p></div>		</li>
