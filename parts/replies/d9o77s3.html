			<div class="markdown"><p>As I was once told by a commenter on this sub and downvotes - this isn't a sub people come to looking for answers. It's entertainment value. </p>
<p>Someone posted a question that is seen very very often and I knew that so I let them know that it's common courtesy to search for your question first, then I took the time to search it and give them about 3-4 links to previous answers to the question. Gave them a lot of info about their particular question. It had already been answered a lot before so I didn't have anything to add but thought they would like that someone went and provided all that info for them.</p>
<p>Nope. Got downvoted and people told me not to be snarky and that people come here for entertainment, not answers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happened to verification of employment with mods on /r/explainlikeimfive? I know on other subs like /r/IAmA sometimes if you have a position that you don't want to risk getting terminated from, for instance a company that has made you sign an non-disclosure agreement, you can at least privately message a mod on /r/IAmA with your proof of employment, and then a mod can chime in at the start of the AMA session to state &quot;employment is verified privately&quot; or something to that effect so that answers in turn are more trusted by the Reddit community.<br />
Maybe /r/explainlikeimfive could use that?<br />
/u/bossgalaga and /u/santi871 what do you think?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The original idea was great. The problem is that someone has to know something really well to be able to explain it to people in such a basic way. Like a lot of subs the content just got more and more diluted as it grew. This is barley /r/explainlikeimfive anymore. It's just a more popular /r/answers. </p></div>		</li>
