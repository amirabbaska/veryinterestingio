			<div class="markdown"><p>Another example is Ativan (or lorazepam). It is often used as an anti anxiety drug but is also used to stop seizures. Propranolol can be used to treat tremors and provide a calming effect but it's initial use was to treat high blood pressure. Lamictal is another anti anxiety drug that is an anticonvulsant. </p>
<p>These are just some that I have come across. When my doctor began prescribing these to me, I would look them up and think &quot;what?? I don't have seizures!&quot;, But did some more research and found that most medication has multiple purposes, probably a result of the throughput method. Thanks science. </p>
<p>Edit: changed antibiotic to anti anxiety. Thanks, guys. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think research on this is mixed, but some of my friends swear by tonic water for their restless leg syndrome. Personally when I have a thankfully rare episode, I just take an extra 0.5mg klonopin but I don’t know if that’s helping the RLS itself, or just helping me get to sleep and not worrying so much about it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason gin and tonic was created was military servicemen, to get them to take their quinidine while stationed in places with malaria. It was easier to get them to drink the gin and tonic, than to get to drink just the tonic water.  </p>
<p>I have no source on this, but I have read it on reddit before.</p></div>		</li>
