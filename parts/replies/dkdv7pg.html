<p>Predatory invertebrates (such as spiders and the praying mantis) are almost always hungry.  They never know when their next meal will show up.  Early in the season, when the chances of finding mates is pretty high, they are very very likely to just eat a courting male.  Food is always scarce, males not so much.</p>
<p>Later in the breeding season they are much more likely to mate, rather than eat, a courting male.  However, during mating they absolutely will eat the male.  This benefits both, genetically speaking.  The male has provided his sperm to the female, making it likely that his genes will pass down IF THE FEMALE SURVIVES TO LAY THE EGGS.  That's a pretty big if, in the insect kingdom, and thus it benefits his genes (not him individually, but his genes) to then make sure his mate is well fed so she's more likely to survive...because if she dies, so do his genes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is NOT true, at least not for all species.  Experiments using well-fed female praying mantises find that males are more likely to survive mating than not.  Using food deprived females, however, made it very unlikely the males would survive.  </p>
<p>Even once decapitated males do continue with the physical motions of mating however.  With the female busy eating she's less likely to disengage from mating, and thus it's more likely his sperm will fertilize her eggs...so it would not surprise me if there was some correlation between chance of cannibalism and successful fertilization. </p></div>		</li>
