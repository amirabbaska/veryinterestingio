			<div class="markdown"><p>Has any research(reliable links?) been done to prove that there is actually something called sleep deprivation and that a full night sleep(I require 9:30 hrs a night) consistently is the only way to not die earlier/have the best performance etc. I just get lost in the internet between those people that get by with low sleep: the military, people like Gordon Ramsey, Elon Musk, and other workaholic businessmen. I don't mind giving up sleep to achieve my goal, but I also don't want it to be a false economy in both performance and health.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'll find more peer reviewed papers on this topic when I get home. For some reason the one thing that basically regenerates, and detoxifies our bodies is deemed useless in modern day society.  People brag about how little sleep they get while their health continously deteriorates, they consistently feel miserable, and anxious. Now some people yes can operate off little sleep, but that's where genetics comes into play. Again, I'll have to provide actual papers on this, don't want to go on a tangent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive found it strange that we engrain the earliest schedules for kids in school - i think its generating bad habits and standards that are just killing our brains.  Had to wake up so early for school and it made me so miserable... kids dont get to sleep as early as whats required.  I work in a middle school and they put up a big board asking what everyone was doing for vacation and 90% of the answers on it include sleep right now.... thats disgusting to me that the number one thing they wanna do with their non obligated time is to get some rest. we promote cutting into our sleep from as early as possible to groom kids into the schedule. In the winter its especially bad, with daylight savings forcing most kids to wake up well before the sun rises. were just making people miserable because of arbitrary bullshit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep deprivation has it's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_deprivation" target="_blank">own wiki page</a></p>
<p>You say yourself that you need 9.5 hrs a night to sleep. If you get slightly less than this you <em>might</em> adapt to it, like &lt;1.5hrs less, if not then you will become sleep deprived and see a lot of stuff in that wiki article. </p>
<p>As far as people who get by on low sleep there are a few possibilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>They are genetically lucky.</li>
<li>They are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthymic_temperament" target="_blank">hyperthymic</a> (generally positive and upbeat people) or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania" target="_blank">hypomanic</a> (ELI5: feeling significantly better than normal for no reason) and have less need for sleep than average. You're looking at less than 6 hours there. In this case the sleep they feel like they need and are able to get might not be enough, especially in hypomania.</li>
<li>They can get by on 5 hours sleep but run on adrenaline, cortisol and other stress hormones which compensate, to an extent. Fumes, basically. This is the case for a lot of the military where the schedule is imposed on them.</li>
<li>They are cheating (*ahem* GHB, stimulants etc...)</li>
</ul>
<p>Gordon Ramsey in particular has some pretty tall claims. 3 hours of sleep a night and losing 22lbs in one day. I call bullshit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And then some. </p>
<p>It's not even necessarily the individual themselves making such claims. They have PR people who make stuff up about them and there are journos who cut out the middle man and make stuff up out of the blue.</p>
<p>A variant on it is Celeb X in an interview says &quot;Gee, I'm only getting three hours sleep per night this week&quot; and pretty soon it's entered the record as &quot;X only sleeps three hours a night&quot;.</p>
<p>(Would love to link to the story about St Steve where the Apple PR people told him &quot;You can't say that, <em>we</em> made that up about you&quot; but unfortunately the cult of St Steve is so strong it's hard to find anything other than wide-mouthed admiration.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Losing 22 lbs in a day would be 77,000 calories.</p>
<p>Even running 10 miles an hour on a treadmill for 24 hours (with absolutely no breaks) with a 5% incline would only lead to 40,000 lost.</p>
<p>Butterfly stroke swimming for 24 hours straight would be 24,000 lost.</p>
<p>There's absolutely no way he was LITERALLY physically active for 24 hours straight, and even if by some miracle he was, he's still significantly short of his goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personal anecdote. In college, there was a point where I want getting any sleep for days at a time. It got so bad I started hallucinating. I turned in assignments that were little more than gibberish, but in my head they made sense. That's what not sleeping does to you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Familiar, I am living these days now. I take a lot of time to do assignments. In addition, I really get pissed off doing them or studying course material trying to see why does it take me so long to understand almost every single notion of the chapter. Sucks. Never had hallucinations though, probably because I didn't go more than 3 hours a night sleep for 4 days. Do you think you are much better now that you are sleeping normal hours or would you think gaining like 6 extra hours could get you more work done, if that makes sense?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piercing pain and sharp twinges are rarely heart related generally it's muscle spasm. Heart pain is more a crushing debilitating pain - hard to miss:(</p>
<p>Try to find a balance though overwork will kill you. We all forget how heavy our heads are and the forced bad posture of leaning over consoles makes the neck and upper chest take the strain all day. Not good.</p></div>		</li>
