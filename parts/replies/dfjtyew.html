			<div class="markdown"><p>When you use HTTPS, the ISP only know that you're connecting to example.com, they doesn't know you're connecting to example.com/depraved-porn. If you use HTTP, the ISP can see literally everything, they can even inject their own code to display ads or further modify the page according their need. HTTPS Everywhere, which is available on Firefox &amp; Chrome, will try to always use HTTPS when possible (not all sites support it). Of course, if you're connecting to depraved-porn.com, anyone can guess what are you doing anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>True but at least with HTTPS they can't see can't see my interest in &quot;Asian girls with big asses&quot; and then try to sell me a wok or rice cooker in the banner ads.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There it is. That's the rub. Welcome to the new internet, where advertisers can directly buy ad space from ISP's and no longer need google or facebook. Meaning, your entire internet experience can now be tracked and even controlled, just like using google or facebook.</p>
<p>Remember AOL? We all now will have something similar to the old AOL as our only internet access.</p>
<p>edit: use an ad-blocker, you say? Sure... and hope the ISP doesn't modify their ToS to include giving them the power to restrict what content you're allowed to view based on first viewing the ad. Want to continue to that page you typed in? No problem - just disable your ad blocker, and watch this 3-minute ad.</p></div>		</li>
