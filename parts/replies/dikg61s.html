			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe so and that is usually what your going for but I think both coaches have the option to change their nets so they are or should be aware of the condition of both nets. Professional coaches (and for that matter high level gamblers) usually know an insane amount of info regarding a game, stuff like ambient temperature of the room, type and age of wood used on the court, distance and time the other team has traveled, relationship or stress issues players may be dealing with, type of fans the game will host and lots of other small details that could affect the game and might somehow give them an advantage. </p></div>		</li>
