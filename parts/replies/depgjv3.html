<p>I wish this were the case. I worked for a large retail giant that would not provide WC, in any circumstance. They even had a form in the break room they specifically stated, &quot;This company does not participate in worker's comp programs.&quot; I'm fairly sure they would just fire you if you were to hurt yourself on the job.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not like a cop who gets in trouble for a conduct violation and costs the city money is sitting in his mansion cackling madly and twirling his mustache. At <em>best</em> he has to go through extra training and has a permanently damaged reputation that may prevent him from being promoted in the future. It's very possible he'll get suspended or even fired.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible but not likely. Most likely they're just transferred to another department. They should be getting jail time and hefty fines not paid for by the city for misconduct. Accidental injuries should be paid by the city. Cops that get in trouble for misconduct like that should have the equivalent of dishonorable discharge from the military. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The problem is that politicians do not want to appear soft on crime. If they cut money from the police budget and then crime goes up, that's dynamite ammunition for their opponent in the next election (even if the two things are unrelated). </p>
<p>So when the police screw up and there is a costly lawsuit, the government will usually make cuts somewhere else to cover the shortfall and leave the police budget intact, effectively insulating them from the consequences.</p></div>		</li>
