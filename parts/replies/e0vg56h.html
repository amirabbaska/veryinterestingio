			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why you gotta find out what works for you. I do intermittent fasting as a diet and just eat two meals between, say, 4pm and 8pm or something like that (I stray and eat breakfast sometimes, or only eat one big meal sometimes, so I’m not 100% on it). It’s 2:32pm and I’m not even slightly hungry right now. Some people wake up in the morning and can’t fathom not eating breakfast, so maybe spread out meals works for them. Idk which method is “100% scientifically the best diet,” but if it helps you lose weight and fits your schedule, go for it. Weight loss/health is a personal journey. Having something that you personally don’t stray from and can consistently maintain is important, because you could have a perfect diet but then gorge on cheeseburgers once a week and mess it all up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but on the other end you might see someone eat a 1200 calorie lunch because they were &quot;good&quot; and skipped breakfast, resulting in weight gain over time (and then claim that they &quot;don't even eat that much&quot;)</p>
<p>i have been adhering to intermittent fasting for about 16 months and i will say that i fell victim to this the first several weeks, i basically binge ate once it was &quot;ok&quot; to eat during the day, and it completely offset the skipped meal. i was able to realize i was doing this and stop it and meet my weight loss goals but it is something someone starting off on this path might fall victim to and discourage them from continuing</p>
<p>as a side note of my personal experience, i have been up and down on the scale a lot over my life (hoping to stay down this time). in the past (early/mid 20s) i dropped 60-70 lbs in a relatively short period (2-3 months) without fasting and then more recently i lost about 100 lbs in a 4-5 month period with fasting, and i honestly can't say there was a big difference with shedding the weight to me. i do feel like with fasting now that i am just trying to maintain weight it does seem easier, my hunger cravings are far more under control and basically skipping consuming calories during a large chunk of my awake time makes it much easier to keep my calories in check any given day. i am now almost 7 months at my goal weight (actually have dropped a few pounds below it) where as the last time, 7 months after my lowest weight point i had probably put ~20 lbs back on. it is hard to do a side by side comparison though as my lifestyle was vastly different 10 years ago: i was partying and drinking a lot back then and didn't really care about what i was putting in my body, where as now i spend most of my free time chasing a toddler and am actively trying to keep myself from turning into a lardo again</p></div>		</li>
