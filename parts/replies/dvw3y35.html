			<div class="markdown"><p>Most modern airliners don’t use a turboprop engine with a propeller. They’ll use a turbofan engine with a fan section. The turbine is at the back of the engine that turns the propellor or fan. A big difference between a turbofan and turboprop is that the fan section and the bypass air are shrouded by the engine cowling while a turboprop basically has the core and then the outside air being pushed by the propeller with no shroud. Each have different advantages.</p>
<p>Both commercial aircraft and military fighters use turbofan engines, but one is a high bypass turbofan and the other is a low or medium bypass turbofan.</p></div>		</li>
