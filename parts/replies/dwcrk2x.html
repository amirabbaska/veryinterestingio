<p>To clarify, common chords are built using notes found in the early part of the root's overtone spectrum. So a C chord contains C E G and sometimes Bflat. C's overtone spectrum goes C C G C E G Bflat. </p>
<p>Bonus fact: this is also why minor chords tend to have a little more grit to them. C minor would be C Eflat G. That Eflat doesn't love the naturally occurring E and the ratio between C and E flat isn't as clean as C and E.</p>
<p>Bonus fact 2: somehow, church bells have a modified overtone series where that E would show up as an E flat, giving the overtone spectrum a minor color. This is thought to be why church bells have such a plaintive sound. Culturally the west associates minor with sadness.</p></div>		</li>

TLDR; Music is very deeply ingrained in our brains and we don’t understand how or why. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago I designed an experiment for a Professor of Acoustic phonetics that played carefully shaped tritone chords which had had the fundamental note removed.  The resultant bitones were then played to people in pairs, and folk were asked if the tone had gone up or down.</p>
<p>You can read a report on the experiment <a href="http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~bob/JEP/schneider.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> </p>
<p>In conversation with one of the authors I found that they thought the effect was an action of a specific area of the auditory cortex, mediated by a mutation in the ASPM gene.  In almost all populations there were about 50/50 of each result.  Except in Japan, where nearly all Japanese folk fell into one group.</p>
<p>So basically, how we perceive complex tones is, well, well complex.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The basis behind overtone series is that it is just integer multiples of the fundamental. The ratios only get &quot;silly&quot; because you're looking at the wrong ratios. The ratios of overtones to the <em>fundamental</em> go 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, and so on, which creates the main sequence. For example, starting at C1, you get:
C1</p>
<p>C2 (1 octave)</p>
<p>G2 (1 octave + 1 fifth)</p>
<p>C3 (2 octaves)</p>
<p>E3 (2 octaves + major third)</p>
<p>G3 (2 octaves + fifth)</p>
<p>Bb3 (2 octaves + minor 7th)</p>
<p>C4 (3 octaves)</p>
<p>D4 (3 octaves + major 2nd)</p>
<p>E4 (3 octaves + major 3rd)</p>
<p>F#4 (3 octaves + tritone)</p>
<p>G4 (3 octaves + fifth)</p>
<p>After that they get quite close together. Note that, for example, the 4th overtone (E3) and the 8th overtone (E4) are an octave apart, since they are 4x and 8x the fundamental respectively, and thus one is 2x the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right about the overtones. I couldn't remember how they were found.</p>
<p>But once you account for.octave displacement, the ratio between say, Db and C are quite out there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the ratio between any two random frequencies can be anything you want. In practice, if you're talking about two notes on a particular instrument, it'll depend on your tuning system. The most common tuning system (for pianos at least) is the equitempered one, where the ratio of a Db to the C below it should be 2^(1/12), and to the C an octave below it'll be 2^(13/12), and so on. But usually ratios are only brought up in the context of overtones, since most tuning systems will not yield a 3/2 ratio for two notes that should be a &quot;perfect&quot; fifth apart.</p></div>		</li>
