			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that really the case though? Wouldn’t destroying the sound to equalling to what you say no sound mean having to broadcast that sound out from the headphones?</p>
<p>I’m also curious the answer to this question because it would seem that noise cancellation is adding more sound waves, albeit inverse waves - but wouldn’t that still manifest itself as additive “sound” or rather more pressure reaching the ear drum? Thanks!</p>
<p>Though I guess I kind of understand it (-1) + (1) = 0 but localized for the sound within the headphone cup. Still what vexes me is sound in the form of air movement so still adding sound waves should still equal more total pressure? Just trying to explain why I don’t quite get this, apologies for braindump.</p></div>		</li>
