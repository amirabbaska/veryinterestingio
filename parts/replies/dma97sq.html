			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note that some people like the taste of bitter foods. When my daughter was a toddler she would find the raw cocoa powder, dunk her little sausage fingers in and then lick it all off. We also had to hide our whole espresso beans because she'd eat them like candy. We started buying her decaf coffee which she drank black until she tried it with sugar and then she never went back. I imagine ancient people who grew up eating barely processed foods like cocoa and coffee beans would've enjoyed them just as much as we do until someone figured out how to make them taste even better.</p></div>		</li>

<ol>
<li>I like it</li>
<li>Less sugar and more healthy per gram</li>
<li>My wife hates the taste so she doesn't steal my chocolate. She asked me why I would ruin chocolate by having it so bitter, and I point out that THAT IS WHAT CHOCOLATE TASTES LIKE.</li>

<p>Good point. In most of China, for example, bitterness is an appreciated flavor that you aim for while cooking.</p></div>		</li>

By the time I moved back up north, everyone stocks unsweetened tea now.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Semi related - <a href="https://youtu.be/zEN4hcZutO0" target="_blank">this is a pretty neat video of a guy taking chocolate bars around to cocoa growers who had never tried chocolate before</a>. These guys have been harvesting and selling cocoa for most of their lives but never really knew what the end product was like. </p>
<p>Edit: Seeing all the replies about how much people enjoyed this video really made my day! Glad you all enjoyed it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Like what madman came up with the baking process for cheesecake? Mix this stuff, stick it in the fridge, bake it, bake it some more but with the door open, fridge it again, then put some stuff on top of it after it cools down enough. Oh and don't forget grinding up cookies to make the crust. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will do that - also I cannot recommend the book 1491 enough, about how Europe got it all wrong about the agricultural geniuses that were the native Americans (both continents)- though it's a huge book. Couple chapters detail the &quot;ethnoforestry&quot; of the Amazonians, how the number of fruit and nut trees near trails wouldn't occur in that distribution unless cultivated, and more insane shit about those peoples. The forest was/is literally a food source, vs. the Euro way of clearing and planting crops. The chapter on how maize was cultivated and hybridized by ancient peoples is also cool; there's a part in the book that also excerpts Ponce de Leon's travel writings in FL, where he passed mile after mile of crops planted by tribes. Great, great book, one of the best nonfiction books I've ever read. You'll never pop corn the same again</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the Yemeni are often credited as the first to drink coffee their are multiple sources speculating that tribes in Ethiopia, where the coffee beans originated, allready drank coffee. In that particular region of Ethiopia they are mostly goat herders so we foremost have to thank the goats for the awsome brew. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah i would expect it to be discovered very early anyways. To know what plants you can eat you must first eat them. Finding most psychoactive plants like ayahuasca and coffee probably started by making plant soups. They then noticed effects, and removed more and more ingredients to find out what caused the effect. I guess tobacco was probably discovered when they would find materials to start a fire </p></div>		</li>
