			<div class="markdown"><p>Shoot. I didn't clarify that part. Yes I actually meant decreasing constantly. Just how /u/functor7 interpreted &quot;keep slowing to match the distance&quot; correctly.</p>
<p>With that being said, your answer is just as entertaining to read and a really unexpected number. I though it would be a 100 hours at first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>why are people struggling to answer this.</p>
<p>If your speed (as a rate of distance travelled per hour) is constantly decreasing to match your distance, then;</p>
<p>1) Not only will you NEVER get there (think asymptote)</p>
<p>but more specifically;</p>
<p>2) You'll ALWAYS be AN HOUR AWAY</p>
<p>This is to answer your question in theory. Of course this is not practical. Your car won't slow down to 0.01 mph when you are 0.01 miles away for instance</p></div>		</li>

<p>Operating under the assumption that you will stop decreasing speed and start going at at a constant speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically it just takes an infinite amount of time which isn't <em>really</em> never, but never is certainly a simpler way to put it. The predicament reminds me a lot of Zeno's paradox.</p></div>		</li>
