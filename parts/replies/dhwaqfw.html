<p>I spent a large part of my childhood doing manual labour, working long days, sweating and hating the experience. I tasted a beer back then and hated it. Now when I taste beer, I still hate it, so I don't drink it.</p>
<p>I feel a lot of people are determined to like it for the general effects, so they acquire a taste through prolonged exposure. I think the same thing happens with coffee... Which I also hate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it is the same for most &quot;refined&quot; or &quot;acquired&quot; tastes. Things like strong cheese and chillies are the same. </p>
<p>You have to learn to like it. With beer I think it is both the alcohol and the social influence. I didn't start drinking beer until the work culture strongly encouraged it. The social aspect of sitting down at the end of the week and having a beer made me preserve until I started to enjoy it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved my first beer, first coffee and first cigarette. I do that for the taste so I always choose the better brands. I love bitter taste. And hot things like chillis. I always did. I never like the sweet taste too much. It's not disgusting to me, but no. I prefer dry wine. I would never order a sweet one. Oh, I forgot whisky. It's funny most women don't like those tastes. And some men, but I find it weird. I mean how can one put sugar in his coffee? Ew... Unless it's brewed like in Turkey, then maybe it's justified once in a while. Oh, and those low IBU beers. I don't get them. The higher IBU the better.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is exactly the cultural narrative that we have all been indoctrinated into believing, when there is no evidence for this that stands up to any real scrutiny.<br />
If we all didn't need to buy new cars, TVs, and non-durable clothing all the time, we could have community gardens instead of parking lots, role models that are actually healthy for people, and a sustainable model for a growing urban population.<br />
We spend countless hours laboring in jobs we know aren't good for us individually, our environment, or us as a collective. All for someone else's stock portfolio. We are too tired to do anything about our decaying educational system, blatantly corrupt government, or financial system that has gotten totally out of control.<br />
The best we get is a night of drinking and violence to express our tension, followed by a hangover and the fallout of our poorly made decisions.<br />
But I love beer too, esp wheat beers, it's not the fault of the substance. It's the fault of unchallenged lawmakers passing legislation that serves only their in-group. Consolidating wealth, and providing a narrative that being rich is a character virtue, twisting the meaning of education to be reduced to job-skills, and maintaining secrecy in the name of public safety, when in fact the ones that need to be feared are those that provide the comfortable existence in exchange for your vitality.....<br />
But whatever, it's fine.</p></div>		</li>
