			<div class="markdown"><p>Coincidentally, we deal with this a lot on earth as well in astronomy. Super high resolution spectrometers like echelle spectrometers get low throughput so they require exposure times on the order of tens of minutes. This is limited by cosmic rays. Anything over about 30 minutes and the exposure becomes dominated by incident cosmic rays to the point of being difficult to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one reason that computers use things like parity and ECC to protect data they are storing or processing. These are codes that are calculated from the data we care about. They are stored alongside the data in case anything bad happens to the data (i.e. it gets changed by a cosmic ray). Depending on how sophisticated the code, we can detect and maybe even correct the corruption. </p></div>		</li>

I'm just curious, because not all cells in the human body can regenerate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the damage, but human vision is both analogue and massively parallel.</p>
<p>Each cell damaged or destroyed would reduce the resolution of that area of the eye slightly, but there's 120 million ish more to carry on. Compare that to 2 million pixels on a 1080p video, or 30 million pixels on a high end DSLR camera. The analogue nature of vision means that &quot;no signal&quot; from a cell is just a less clear picture, whereas a digital system will have an obviously dark/light dot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most imaging systems (Even inexpensive ones) have adaptive pixel failure mitigation that recognizes the failure and then maps it to an average of the 4 or 8 neighbors all behind the scenes.  Its not uncommon at all for even a new a DSLR or HD camera to have several dead pixels but they are pretty well invisible unless you know exactly where to look.  (I am not sure how to explain the footage in this discussion other than perhaps for scientific purposes those features were specifically deactivated on whatever cameras they used)</p>
<p>This isnt different at all from the way our eyes do it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The portion bearing the bulk of the damage on a photoreceptor is a compartment called the outer segment (responsible for phototransduction). Outer segments are constantly renewed; complete renewal occurs once every two weeks in humans. So the photoreceptor cells themselves are not dying from photo oxidative stress. Just a compartment of the cell itself.</p>
<p>In humans, photoreceptor cells cannot regenerate. Once lost, they're gone forever. However, there is a degree of redundancy: you can lose over 80% of your photoreceptors and still have normal vision. That is why retinal degeneration is often caught very late as symptoms won't show until the disease has progressed quite far. Certain species of fish like the zebrafish are capable of regenerating photoreceptor cells. This is why they are a common animal model used to study retinal regeneration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, they say nerves can't regenerate, but some experiments have shown that they will heal if you manage to hold them together. The problem is the body generally doesn't try to bring damaged nerve endings back together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand, if you look at the list of Apollo astronauts, outside of accidental death, nearly all of them made it to at least 70, and a number lived to mid-80s or older.  Some of that may be due to the fact that they were selecting physically superior people to begin with, but it suggests that radiation didnâ€™t have a huge impact.</p></div>		</li>
