			<div class="markdown"><p>My horrible nausea started while on my first trip to New Orleans for my sister’s 21st bday (I’m 9 years older than her).  I still can’t watch shows set in NOLA without an instant wave of nausea.  Funny how that happens.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I went through chemo, they didn't really care what I ate (diet restrictions aside), as long as I tried to eat something. I didn't really have nausea, except for one short time, but my appetite did go away almost completely.</p>
<p>The hospital I was at, UCLA, lets you order your choice of food from the kitchen (again, subject to diet restrictions from your doctor), or have your own brought in. The nurses will microwave stuff for you if you have canned soup or things like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive heard its really helpful to pick a specific thing and always eat it/drink it/wear it every visit.  Specifically so you associate that thing or things with the shitty feelings and can avoid just that one thing or recondition yourself afterwards.  Much easier to do that on purpose than to just casually do whatever and then 6 months after chemo you pull out an old tshirt you havent worn in months and suddenly feel sick because your brain somehow associated that shirt to the chemo</p></div>		</li>
