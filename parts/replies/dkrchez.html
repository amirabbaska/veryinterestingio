<p>you just create an experimental set-up where by measuring properties of the system, you can reverse engineer the quantum state it is in.</p>

<p>This is called quantum state tomography. It is not possible to create a single set of measurements to re-create a given quantum state (see <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holevo%27s_theorem" target="_blank">Holevo bound</a>). This is the foundation for all quantum based encryption / security. In a quantum computer you don't want to do state tomography as the number of needed measurements scales with the size of the Hilbert space, that is, exponentially in the number of quits.</p></div>		</li>
