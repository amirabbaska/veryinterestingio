			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't understand why they can't use cutting edge processors and have state of the art speeds and just shield them; why use hardened chips instead of a hardened enclosure? I'm sure there would be the trade off of increased weight, but you would also need less power for processing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shielding works for low energy particles, like electrons. Neutrons and other high energy particles will blast right through just about any shielding you could use. Worse than that, the neutron strike will also cause the shielding to become a radiator. This secondary radiation may even be worse than the original radiation, because it could be a shotgun blast effect, instead of a single strike.</p>
<p>So now you have a heavier payload that is even more susceptible to radiation strikes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>how are things physically (or logically?) &quot;rad hardened&quot; other than running multiple processes to aid in error-correction, etc? What kinds of things are actually done to the systems to make them less susceptible to radiation interference?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shielding, multiple levels of redundancy. Also, as far as integrated circuitry is concerned, older technology nodes are less susceptible to radiation due to larger transistor sizes/gate thicknesses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Physically, 2 main ways I know of radiation hardening by process are Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) and building an insulator guard band around each device on your die. SOI isn't as expensive, because some manufacturers are doing it anyways to shrink their process (AMD), but it isn't a perfect solution. Guard Bands are really expensive, because the guard band is wasted space.</p>
<p>Logically, extensive use of error-correction (CRC, Hamming, etc) and TMR is used. TMR is very simple to visualize and implement, and adding complexity onto a system you're shooting into space on a rocket pulling 20Gs isn't a risk many people are willing to take.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would like to add that another limitation is the communications channel. This is limited by the power available, the size of the antennas, the frequency used, and the error correction coding. </p>
<p>Increasing the frequency used makes the antenna seem larger, so those are related. But higher frequencies don't make it through the atmosphere very well and would require orbiting satellites to receive the signals, so those antennas would be limited, whereas our current ground-based antennas are huge. So really, a frequency increase is not realistic. You also cannot make the antenna too big (i.e. the beam width too small) because it then becomes more difficult to point the beam at Earth.</p>
<p>Error correction coding has improved considerably since the 70s, however the Voyagers were reconfigurable and used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction#Deep-space_telecommunications" target="_blank">fairly sophisticated codes</a>. At most they would get an increase of 3 dB or a doubling of data rate before hitting the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannonâ€“Hartley_theorem" target="_blank">Shannon limit</a> of how much data a certain bandwidth can pass.</p>
<p><a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/" target="_blank">The current data rate is 160 <strong>bps</strong></a>. Between the power, antenna size and error correction, I doubt you could get more than 3 orders of magnitude improvement, so about 160 kbps. While this is a lot in comparison, and there is a lot of time to send the data, it would still be easily swamped by the amount of data the sensors are capable of now.</p></div>		</li>
