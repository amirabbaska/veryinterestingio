			<div class="markdown"><p>i live on long island and theres an indian reservation about 15mins from me, they sell tobacco products well below the state legal minimums which is illegal, they also sell marijuana and alcohol as well. i have a friend who is a lawyer and he told me this is legal as long as they only sell to other native americans. obviously they break this law but as long as theyre on their own land its difficult for the government to do much about it. there are alot of gray areas when it comes to this subject</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you that in Canada a lot of criminal investigations end on tribal lands. </p>
<p>A place that I used to work at had a lot of cars broken into at one time and the police were called. It resulted in a police chase all the way to some First Nations land and once the individuals went in the police just turned around and called it a day. It definitely pissed me off because after that there was zero follow up or investigation. It felt like the thieves just got a get out of jail free card. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of debate as to the nature and extent to which this sovereignty, as mandated by the federal government, is afforded, and it often changes between states and tribes as various disputes arise. Sometimes, concerns about protecting children are brought up. Does the state have the right to intervene when child abuse is occurring, for example? It's a pretty interesting topic to dig into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's some degree of autonomy, but the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which falls under the Dept. of the Interior, handles a ton of things like law enforcement, administration of tribal courts, implementation of land and water claim settlements, housing improvement, disaster relief, replacement and repair of schools, and repair and maintenance of roads and bridges. I think it really depends on the specific tribe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My father was a local politician and a bit of a history buff, and the way he explained it to me as a child is that the federal government signed treaties with various native nations back in the 19th century, which the nations later used as proof that they were sovereign states.  After all, the federal government wouldn't sign a treaty with a state, or a company, or a non-profit organization.... treaties are between sovereign states.</p>
<p>Of course, he may have just been dumbing it down for a 12 year old.</p></div>		</li>
