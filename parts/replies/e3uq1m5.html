			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my thought. I cant remember whi h drug it is at this moment, but I work at a clinic with outpatient surgery so we do sedation and one of the ones they give often causes metallic taste and ringing in ears. The nurse anaesthetist often warns patients before giving it because it's so frequent. We also often give lidocaine shots for localized numbing if the patient is awake and that often can cause weird tastes or ringing in ears</p></div>		</li>
