			<div class="markdown"><p>I average around 1 min now on a 3x3 (I own up to 10x10 and a bunch of the weird cubes - .e.g., minx), and I feel like I'll never get faster than that. I use the CFOP method (I think).  Not sure what OLL and PLL are, but, after I get the first two layers, I get a cross of the final layer (usually yellow), then I get the corners in their right places, then I get all the last layer colors facing me, then I there's either 3 or 4 &quot;adjacent&quot; cubes that need to be moved around (i think the algorithm is r2 ufb r2 fbu r2 or something -- I know I'm missing cw vs ccw here).  </p>
<p>Are there just a more optimized algorithms for the final layer?  Like one for every scenario?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're doing the last layer in four steps:</p>
<p>Orient edges (get yellow facing up on all the edge pieces)</p>
<p>Permute corners (put the corners in the right place)</p>
<p>Orient corners (get yellow facing up on all the corners)</p>
<p>Permits edges (your algorithm is called &quot;waterfall&quot; because it looks like a waterfall when you do it with the right side facing forward)</p>
<p>OLL and PLL simply does the same thing in 2 steps:</p>
<p>1) orient last layer (get yellow facing up on the entire top in one step)</p>
<p>2) permute last layer (put all the edge pieces and corner pieces in the right spot)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are more optimized algos for once you get the cross at the top layer. Thats the OLL and PLL. </p>
<p>There's like 50 iirc OLLs. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
But likewise I mainly use standard method to solve the top layer which is why I can only get about 40 seconds.
I do know a few OLLs and PLLs but not the full set. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Learn 4 Look Last Layer (4LLL). Only ~12 algs and you probably already know some of them. Full OLL and PLL isn't necessary at all until much later. Collin Burns got to sub-10 with just 4LLL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I honestly stagnated at that point too. The only reason I continued to progress, is that I just have a cube on my desk, and whenever I'm waiting for something, I just scramble and solve.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much how I work too. I got to around 22 seconds average, with a pb of about 15 seconds, but at that point I didn't really want to put in the time to learn the full OLL's so I just left it as it was. Now I just have a few cubes around and if I happen to be next to one when I'm waiting for something I'll give it a couple of solves. It's pretty relaxing when you don't do like 20 solves at a time haha</p></div>		</li>
