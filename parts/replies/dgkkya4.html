<p>The Académie française is an official body that attempts to regulate the French language, but none of its rulings are binding. While the government tends to abide by the Academy's recommendations (because that's all they are) it's entirely ineffective at actually preventing the natural evolution of the language.</p>
<p>This is because the vast majority of people who speak and write French don't actually care what forty old men shut away in a smoke-filled room think. The Académie française can plead as much as they like with people to say &quot;la fin de la semaine&quot;, but they're powerless in the face of the 65 million people who will continue to say &quot;le weekend&quot;. Sooner or later the Academy has to capitulate.</p>
<p>And of course, the Académie française didn't invent the French language: French came about by entirely natural processes when Latin met some Celtic and Germanic languages.</p></div>		</li>
