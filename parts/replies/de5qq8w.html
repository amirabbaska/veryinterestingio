			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick question: what about anti-social people? My ex <em>never</em> wanted to be around other people. He was not shy. In fact, he was a type A and very charismatic. So how come every time I wanted to socialize with our shared friend group, he just wanted to stay home? He wasn't depressed. He liked our friends, but he's more comfortable being by himself. We were always in separate rooms doing our own thing, and I get it. When I'm home after work, I want to just relax and browse reddit. So I totally get that, but on a Saturday getting together for poker was a PITA for him..he stopped going after two games. And we played <em>once a month</em> so it wasn't like I was taking his Saturdays.</p>
<p>Sorry, that wasn't such a quick question after all. But do you have any insight to that? I'm curious after reading that Wikipedia and your post. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just like in all organisms in the evolutionary chain, there are mutations that occur.</p>
<p>Antisocial tendencies are complicated because they likely have a partial cause rooted in genetic mutation, but also environmental factors like the way they were brought up.</p>
<p>Human children are taught by their parents how to interact in societal structures, and the familial unit at a small scale replicates a larger scale social structure.  Dis-functional familial units can hamstring the ability for children to learn how to properly interact with larger scale structures which can cause issues later in life, as they just haven't properly been exposed to or developed the conditioning that others have received that is the type of &quot;positive reinforcement&quot; like neurotransmitter release on human contact or in the company of others.</p>
<p>I'm not a professional, I've done some research and have some background in developmental psychology.  So anyone with more insight should correct me if necessary.</p>
<p>So the ELI5 version is.  Your ex probably wasn't put in social situations as a kid and didn't have opportunities to practice social skills and develop positive reinforcement conditioning for those situations.  The snowball effect of feeling uncomfortable socially just builds over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He still probably isn't 100% anti-social, after all he wanted to be in a relationship, and that had value to him. A relationship is huge social interaction, I imagine if he wasn't in one he'd end up doing more classic social things naturally, if he could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the person asking the question missed this. For someone who isn't big on social interaction being in a relationship can lead to not wanting much <em>other</em> social contact, because of the attention you would get from your SO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's most interesting to me is how humans seem to have an instinct to stay together but also an instinct to spread apart. Humans have colonized the continents, even though traveling across them was often very dangerous. I can only assume that in many cases we were fleeing each other out of a sense of imminent danger. Other times, a sense of opportunity. And other times, maybe just sometimes, the desire to get the fuck away from these social animals that are so valuable to our survival.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting isn't it? Literally everything we need is right here on Earth and yet look at all the talk on colonizing Mars and Venus. There's no real reason to leave earth other than we just want to. Space and other planets are the most hostile environments to life and yet we want to go anyway.</p></div>		</li>
