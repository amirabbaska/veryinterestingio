			<p>That's pretty cool, but I also imagine that's a situation where the original concrete was well documented and its exact characteristics known. </p>		</li>

			<p>The new dam was roller compacted concrete (RCC) which is a low strength concrete used more like ballast than like traditional structural concrete.  I think the strength spec was only ~1500 psi, so the quality of the old concrete (which was around 3000 psi) didn't matter too much. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well the properties may not have been that important. Dams are not under a lot of stress typically, think of an earth dam. It works not because the soil is so strong, but because the mass of the soil is so large. A concrete dam doesn't have to be the strongest concrete. </p>		</li>

			<p>As I understand it, in the US, this sort of thing is considered to fall under the domain of the Army Core of Engineers. They maintain records on all sorts of stuff like this.  It is actually illegal to construct a dam on a body of water, even if it is on property you own, without first contacting them and getting their approval.</p>		</li>
