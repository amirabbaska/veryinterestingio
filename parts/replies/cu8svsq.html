			<div class="markdown"><p>Saccades are literally the coolest things ever. Other fun saccade facts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>when your eye is moving unconsciously, like when you are moving a book, it is moving about as fast as any part of the human body is ever able to move, at a peak speed of 900 degrees/second</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saccades help make up for a blind spot which every person has in their field of vision, allowing us to easily interpolate what is there from it's context. This wiki page has a great demonstration: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_spot_(vision</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While your eye is moving your brain stops processing some of the less fine details of an image, and leaves them at whatever they were just before so you don't get motion blur. Try looking into a mirror and looking at one eye's reflection and then the other's -- they won't appear to move at all, because this is happening.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many saccades occur without you consciously focusing on something, like reflexes. However, they can even occur at remembered points -- so your mind will unconsciously move your eyes to look at something which isn't there.</p>
</li>
<li>During a saccade your mind only updates a few details of an image at once. You don't see a whole new scene -- instead, only a few details change each time. Your mind can remember the pattern of past eye movements you've made in saccades like it was in working memory to synthesize a scene together.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Re the last point: During a saccade the central vision is blanked, so whatever your mind is updating comes from peripheral vision and is of necessarily low acuity. The peripheral visual acuity drops the faster the image slips on the retina. Perhaps you meant that <em>as soon as</em> the image becomes stable on the retina following the start of the saccade, the part (the detail) of the overall picture is updated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its actually more complex than this. We think our eyes move almost instantly from one thing to another. Thats a deception produced by our brain. Try looking at the seconds hand of a clock or something similar. Look at it, look at something else, look back. You will notice that when you look back, the first tick appears to take longer than the following ticks.</p>
<p>To look at the clock, your eyes take time to move, locate the subject and focus. During that time, your vision is pretty useless. If you saw all that going on you would find it much harder to focus on something like an escaping prey animal or a threat. So your brain waits until its got a good picture of the subject and then back dates the image. It tricks you into thinking you've been seeing that image all along, and thats why the first tick seems to take longer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This always trips me up when looking at digital clocks.  I have to stare at the colon to make sure it's actually blinking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man, I just made myself dizzy. Focus on something close and to your right and then quickly focus on something far and to the left. After repeating this a couple of times I started noticing the blurry mess that my mind blanks out during the transition. Gave me vertigo for a sec.</p></div>		</li>
