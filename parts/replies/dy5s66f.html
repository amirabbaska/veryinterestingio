			<div class="markdown"><p>The Guinness Book of Records (if anyone has one from the 1980s, go check) says the rarest cancer in humans is &quot;cancer of the epithelial cells lining the glomerulus of the kidney&quot;, that in fact no cancer had ever been observed affecting these cells. That might have changed in recent years.</p>
<p>Yes, my memory is right. It's called Podocytoma, it was predicted decades ago but so far (up until I suppose the 1980s-90s?) no case had been observed.</p>

<p>epithelial cells lining the glomerulus of the kidney</p>

<p>The cells line the glomerulus, they are the cells within the little spherical structure that filter urine from blood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overall it is clear that the podocyte is a unique cell type, which cannot be classified into a clear phenotypic category. Functionally, it has a distinct role and has achieved this by evolutionary adaptation to cues from its microenvironment. This has resulted in a cell that requires dynamic homeostasis of many local elements to maintain its integrity and function, and an understanding of how disruptions to these signals occur gives us insight into how to prevent disruption and ultimate cell death.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not an expert, but is seems these are quite unique cells, that have a very robust ability to maintain their health and equilibrium, if something goes wrong they detect this and can deliberately commit suicide (apoptosis) and/or will detach from glomerular basement membrane, and leave the body, end up shed into urine. So there seems to be internal cellular mechanisms that avoids the development of cancer and a physical process of detachment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Med student here, podocytes basically allow for fluid and proteins to enter and leave the lumen of the glomerulus for filtering. Proteins and large particles generally shouldn't go through the podocytes, and with a potential cancer caused there, there should be even less fluid there.</p>
<p>Not quite useful to get a cancer here, but if you have diabetes insipidus (not mellitus which is sugar levels elevated and depending on the production of insulin), a benign podocyte tumor can potentially help to lower the amount of watery urine produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Podocytes require some pretty exacting genetic production. They’re epithelial cells, so they have to be able to do all the things epithelial cells can go: divide, protect, absorb and secrete substances, respond to stimuli. They’re also in s chemically active environment, lots if nitrogen atoms around and that can goof with a cells cytoplasmic biochemistry and alter DNA nucleotides if left unregulated. So podocytes have lots of protective enzymes that will directly or indirectly protect DNA from mutations. They also create these crazy awesome cytoplasmic extensions that look like barbs extending from the rachis of a feather. These extensions interweave themselves to help create the barrier that separates blood in the glomerulus from the filtrate found in the capsular space. These extensions are created and maintained and if the genes that make them are altered then the extensions won’t form properly and blood will flow ever more freely into your urine. So there’s 4-5 things that all need to go right in a podocyte for it to continue functioning. If any one thing is mutated, that cell will immediately cause problems and be aggressively replaced. And that’s probably why podocytomas haven’t been seen yet. The conditions for the cancer to be successful are so crazily precise that no cell has ever hit the ‘jackpot’ of mutations in exactly the right way to get a cancer to form. Sadly, that is not true of most other cells in the body. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actual hairs and nails themselves cant get cancer since, like OP said, they're made mainly of dead cells/protein fibers. But there are cutaneous appendageal carcinomas that can develop in the regenerative tissue that makes them.</p>
<p>Subungual melanoma is cancer of the nail beds. Trichilemmal carcinoma is cancer of the hair follicles. There's a whole group of skin appendage cancers called cutaneous adnexal tumours. They're rare, but they exist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since hair falls out during chemotherapy because they are rapidly dividing cells, why wouldn't they be more prone to getting cancer in the first place? </p></div>		</li>

Even if a hair somehow could get cancer, not much would happen as it's disconnected from the circulatory system and wouldn't have any nutrients and thus couldn't grow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry! I could have been clearer about this. Hair and nails themselves are not vascularized, because they are not alive.  The hair follicles and nail beds, which produce these, do. </p>
<p>So, while hair and nails get longer, it's due to activity at the base, rather than something in the hair and nails  themselves. </p></div>		</li>
