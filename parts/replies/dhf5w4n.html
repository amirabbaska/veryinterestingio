			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I agree. My mom always slouched and I guess I picked it up, I have major back problems now at 30 and pain every day. I've been trying really hard to have better posture, but good posture is a <em>practice</em>.  Not only does it take more effort, but for me it is so easy to forget (especially if I'm anxious or concentrating on something else) but it's also damn hard to remember, especially if you already have a habit of bad posture. </p></div>		</li>
