<p>It's under civil engineering here, and is popular enough to be included in the name of that department.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be higher up. A 100' column of water at the top of the mountain is not the same as a 100' dive into the ocean. This has to do with the 'weight' of the air sitting on top of the water. There is much less air at the top of the mountain so there would be less overall pressure at the bottom of that column. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, air is a fluid with a weight component just as much as water, it just takes a greater elevation change to feel it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I had an aquarium thst was triangle shaped with the point facing up, I would feel the same pressure (at the bottom) as if I was in a triangle with the point facing down? In other words, triangles facing different directions in terms of their points. Would the pressure be different? In one case, you literally have all the water above you, and the other some of the water is spread out along the base. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The pressure is the same no matter where you are at the bottom of your triangular point-facing-up aquarium. The amount of water directly above you is not important, all that matters is how deep you are below the water surface.</p></div>		</li>
