			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the stuff on Ancestry.com is now user-submitted, not from Mormon sources.</p>
<p>I trust almost NONE of it, unless it has digital scanned copies of primary source records attached.  Sadly those are uncommon.  Yet people see the Ancestry TV commercials, go online, find the unsourced records that other people have uploaded, take them as Gospel truth, and add them to their own family trees.  It's a ghastly system of self-perpetuating mass error.  The commercialization and mass availability of these records is a double-edged sword.  People can discover so much more about their families much more easily than in the past, but false information propagates much more readily as well.</p>
<p><strong>edit -</strong>  I hasten to add, Ancestry has a vast collection of scanned primary source records like the US Census collection and military records, but that's not what I'm talking about.  I'm referring to user submitted &quot;trees&quot; and such.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Smart move. If I'm looking at someone's tree and see a source listed as &quot;User Submitted Family Tree&quot; I immediately discount their information. </p>
<p>The only thing more maddening is the acceptance level of user submitted alternate information, usually name. I swear there are thousands of grandmas sitting at home on their AOL dial up putting any name they can think of into ancestry.com</p></div>		</li>

<p>Part of that process involves meticulously documenting who has proxy baptisms done for them so that nobody gets doubled up on.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why would &quot;doubling up&quot; matter? Is it strictly to reduce duplication of effort? I'm imagining a duplicate baptism nullifying the previous baptism so that a third one must be performed - kind of like accidentally hitting a garage door opener twice and sending the door back down when you really want it up. </p>
<p>IIRC Mormons are somewhat unique in that they believe in baptismal after death. The practice is not without controversy as there have been incidences of Mormon baptismal happening on people not of that faith. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There has been plenty of controversy around it. One of the biggest ones regarded baptizing holocaust victims, which they no longer do.</p>
<p>They obviously do proxy baptisms for mostly people who are not LDS, as LDS people would have been baptized during their life. I think if the person died within the last 110 years (?) they have to get permission from their closest living relative. </p>
<p>At the end of the day though they believe that the baptism is simply an opportunity for the person, who is now living in the spirit world pre-resurrection. They can choose to accept it or not, but they feel like it is their responsibility to extend that invitation to everyone, thus the focus on missionary work around the world. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This doesn't always happen and reports of such proxies happening without family permission or even against family wishes are part of said controversy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is to stop duplication. It can take a long time to get enough information to get someone baptized. If it all has been recorded that it had been done them you can focus all time on people that still need it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Doubling up&quot; isn't necessarily bad. They just don't want to do that because it would only be wasting time. If they want to baptize everyone that's a lot of people. </p></div>		</li>
