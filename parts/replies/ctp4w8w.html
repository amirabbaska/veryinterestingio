			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't use too many different denominations. I suspect it'd be possible to come up with a small set of mutually-exclusive hole patterns; don't just rely on the number of holes, but the shape made by them.</p>
<p>The real problem, I think, is that the holes would be more prone to damage.</p>

<p>Imagine o o o o o - o for a 5, o o o o - o o for a 10, etc. (The o's are holes, the - isn't.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with that being he has to modify the bills once he gets them, so he has to know what they are before he customizes them. Either someone has to tell him what they are before he puts the holes in, or he has to otherwise figure it out on his own. </p></div>		</li>
