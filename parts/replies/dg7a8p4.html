			<div class="markdown"><p>The unstated principle here is speeds should be weighted by time -- the runner spent three times as long running slow, so 6 km/h gets weighted three times as much:</p>
<p>(3*(6 km/h) + 1*(18 km/h))/(3 + 1) = 9 km/h.</p>
<p>Or equivalently, we should take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_mean" target="_blank">harmonic mean</a> of the velocities rather than arithmetic mean.</p>
<p>A priori it's not clear why one mean is more appropriate than the other for the generic situation as stated. If someone on the sidelines is watching the runner pass by every so often (think of many runners in a marathon) it's the arithmetic mean that's more perceptible and relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about weighting, it's the definition of the term. Speed is the ratio of distance to time. Instantaneous speed is defined as the derivative of distance with respect to time, and average speed is defined as just total distance divided by total time. Since that's your definition, that's how you calculate it. The problem is when someone wants to calculate average speed between two pieces of travel using a formula for the mean, which is a different object that is not average speed.</p>
<p>Edit: Okay folks, let's do an example. You're driving a distance of 100 miles. It takes you 4 hours. What is your average speed? 100 miles divided by 4 hours = 25 mph. This is always the answer. It doesn't matter if you go 80 mph per hour for 1 hour, then stop for 2 hours then 20 mph for 1 hour, or if you go 25 mph for 4 hours, or if you sit still for 3 hours and 50 minutes and then go 600 mph for the last 10 minutes. If you think calculating average velocity works by some sort of (A + B + C + ... )/N type average, you'll get different average speeds, and you'd be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its been a long (long) time since I messed with calculus, so forgive me if this is dumb or wrong.</p>
<p>But as I recall when you take an integral or derivative of a measure like velocity, you end up with something different.  The derivative of velocity is not going to be another velocity, it will be something different-- acceleration.</p>
<p>How then can you say that the instantaneous speed is the derivative of velocity (distance / time)?  Or am I missing something here?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you run around a track twice, the first time slowly, the second time much faster so that <strong>the average</strong> for the two laps is twice the speed of the first lap. People are getting infinite speed for the second lap. Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The average <em>what</em>?? The question poorly defined. The average velocity <em>per lap</em> will work out to 18kmh for the second, but the average velocity <em>for the entire run</em> would require T(one lap) = T(two laps) but d(one lap) = 1/2 d(two laps) which would require the second lap to have 0 time.</p>
<p>The wording needs to be very specific to achieve this answer. And your solution is correct of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My thought process went like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Runs a lap in 1 minute.</p>
<p>The 2nd lap must make the average speed twice as fast, so the 2nd lap must make the average time be 30 seconds (.5minutes)</p>
<p>(1+x)/2=.5</p>
<p>x=0</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means you either didn't run the lap or the only way to travel any distance in no time is if you have &quot;infinite speed&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I finally found the thing I was searching for.
I was struggling because I did the problem using two methods and got both 0 and 3 as my answer.</p>
<p>It depends on whether you are trying to find the average velocity per lap, or the total average velocity. </p>
<p>My first attempt which gave me 3 = v2, was giving me the average speed per lap, which is not what the question was asking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>You can't average velocities in this way. You can only do this if the time is equal for the two velocities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I understand what you're saying, I have to disagree, and that's also not what the question is asking. The issue is the question is poorly worded to imply something different than the &quot;correct&quot; answer.</p>
<p>Say I run a mile x times, and I track my average speed for each mile.</p>
<p>If I took a simple average of all those numbers, I would get a useful and meaningful answer: the average speed at which I ran a mile over x data points.</p>
<p>It would <em>not</em> be my time-averaged speed covering x miles. For instance if I ran 2 miles, where one took me 5 hours and the other took 10 minutes, then nearly all my time was spent moving very slowly, bringing my time-averaged speed way way down to 0.39 mph (2 miles in 5 hours and 10 minutes). If you instead do the math taking a simple average, you find the average speed of the two runs is 3.1 mph (one mile at 6 mph, the other at 0.2 mph). If I let x = 100 with one 5-hour lap and 99 10-minute laps, then the time-averaged speed is 4.6 mph (100 miles in 21.5 hours) while the simple average is 9.9 mph. The latter figure (9.9 mph) is actually a <strong>much better</strong> measure of my average speed when running one mile. For instance, if you were trying to predict the speed at which I would run another mile (assuming the same distribution), you would be 100x more likely to be near the correct answer using the simple average.</p>
<p>These are both valid ways of taking an average, but they represent different things.</p>
<p>EDIT: I wrote this at 4 am, and I failed at basic math (nobody caught it yet, so I'm just admitting guilt preemptively). A 10 minute mile is 6 mph, not 10 mph, which I had right in the set of 2 trials but mixed my numbers up in the set of 100 trials. Numbers should be:</p>
<p>2 trials: 0.39 mph vs 3.1 mph</p>
<p>100 trials: 4.6 mph vs 5.95 mph</p>
<p>This still shows the same thing, where the simple average gives the best estimate of the expected time of a single trial, whereas the time-averaged values are badly skewed. Running 1 mile 100 times is not the same as running 100 miles 1 time, and they should not be treated the same (which is what happens when you take the time-averaged speed). They are 100 separate trials, and they should be treated as such.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. The delta over which the average is taken must be specified. For the original question, the given solution (18 km/h for the second lap) is correct if measuring the average (km/h)/lap (or speed/lap).</p>
<p>(6 (km/h)/lap <em> 1 lap) + (18 (km/h)/lap </em> 1 lap) = 24 (km/h)/lap * 2 laps = 12 (km/h)</p>
<p>However, measuring the average velocity with respect to time would require an instantaneous second lap, as mentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your definition of &quot;average speed&quot; leads to very strange results. </p>
<p>For instance, you calculated that running one lap in 5 hours and then another 99 laps in 10 minutes could give you an average speed of 9.9 mph. Yet if you were racing against someone who ran every single lap in 12 minutes, you would lose despite having almost twice their &quot;average speed&quot;. </p>
<p>If &quot;average speed&quot; means anything useful, surely the winner of a race should be the one with the highest average speed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He clarifies in another reply. The key is that he is describing finding the &quot;expected value&quot; for a lap. He is talking about multiple, distinct laps, not a bunch of laps that are combined, as in a race.</p>
<p>Of course a race is going to use the original definition of speed (distance / time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would argue the very strange results arise when your method of averaging skews more toward a single outlying event rather than toward the most common result in the distribution, and I struggle to think of applications where the total time-averaged speed over multiple trials is actually more useful than finding the expected value of a set of trials.</p>
<p>The time-averaged method would imply that adding up (for example) 421 100-meter sprints is the equivalent of running 26.2 miles, and therefore an average human running 12 second sprints has an average speed over 26.2 miles of 19.5 mph (a world record finishing time of 80 some minutes). <strong>That</strong> is a very strange result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there serious uses for simple averages in a similar fashion to the scenario you presented?</p>
<p>I agree that &quot;If you were trying to predict the speed at which I would run another mile&quot; that the simple average is a closer estimate, but it seems entirely coincidental.</p>
<p>If that question were asked I would hope the analyst would try to normalize the data rather than use the simple average, but I'm wondering if there are rules to dictate when using a simple average like in your case are appropriate, perhaps certain distributions of data.  I work in data analysis and we're always trying to be mindful of how to calculate averages at different levels of a given hierarchy.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Well, it's not coincidental at all. If your data points are &quot;average speed for one mile&quot; and you want &quot;expected value of average speed for one mile&quot;, then the simple average is really the only way to look at it.</p>
<p>The correct answer as worded in the video should be infinity, since the question explicitly asks that the total average speed over both laps is twice the speed of the first lap. If the question had instead been, how to make the average lap speed twice that of the first lap, then the simple average would probably be more appropriate.</p>
<p>For example, a quick and dirty thing I did was to sample random speeds from a known distribution N(10,2). I then had someone run 10k laps each lap with a random speed. If you take the time based average, you will underestimate the mean speed per lap (a known value) because slow laps affect the mean more than fast laps. <strong>However</strong>, the simple average does not represent the average speed that this runner ran 10k miles. You can see the difference here in this very elaborate plot <a href="http://imgur.com/uqA5IRn" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/uqA5IRn</a>.</p>
<p>It should also be apparent that taking the simple average of a bunch of samples from a distribution will obviously give you back the mean of the distribution...</p>
<p>Anyway, pretend you didn't know the actual distribution beforehand, so you've got N(mu, sigma) instead of N(10,2). And then you observe as this runner runs 10k laps at different speeds each lap. If someone asks you, what can I expect for the speed of the next lap, they're asking for your estimate of mu, which is <em>not</em> the average speed over 10k laps.</p></div>		</li>
