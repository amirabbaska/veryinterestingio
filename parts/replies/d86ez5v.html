<p>Note Keynesian Liberalism (well it not really called this, but instead Keynesian Economics) nightmare scenario is the Great Depression of the 30s and to a lesser extent the slow recovery after the Great Recession staring 2008.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the way I see it.  Capitalism relies on growth and over-production. Any production not consumed (savings) creates a surplus that must, somehow, eventually be eliminated. The current string of deficits is using government borrowing to enable demand for that over-production. Rather than take their lumps and suffer the recession to correct things, governments borrows and spends. There will be a reckoning.</p></div>		</li>
