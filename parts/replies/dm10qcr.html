			<div class="markdown"><p>If you filled in a blank sudoku board with all 9 of one number (take 1 for example, although that choice is arbitrary), and as long as they didn't break any rules (e.g. No two 1's on the same row or set of 3x3) is their any way you could set them up that would make it unsolvable if you could choose the position of the other 72 numbers afterwards? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The values don't matter. Once you have a solution, you can swap all of one number with all of another number. There are 9! ways to do that. If you want to maintain a 3 in the middle, there are 8! ways to arrange the other numbers.</p></div>		</li>
