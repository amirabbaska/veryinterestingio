			<div class="markdown"><p>The same way most other things that kill you do- by touching you very, very hard in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Don't think of it as just wind- think of it as a drastic increase in pressure in a very short amount of time. Ever stepped outdoors and felt the wind suddenly slap you in the face? This is the same effect, but powerful enough to blast through your entire body.</p>
<p>Many things can go wrong in your body when it's hit by a blast wave. Your eardrums will burst. Your lungs will be ripped and torn. Your chest and abdomen, forced into itself by the pressure, will displace inwards and send shocks through your internal organs.</p>
