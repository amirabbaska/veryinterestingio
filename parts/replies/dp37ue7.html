			<div class="markdown"><p>Pickling is a form of fermentation, which adds probiotics to a food. Probiotics support the good bacteria you need to digest food. Additionally, fruits and vegetables (including cucumbers) contain antioxidants, which protect against free radicals in your body that can damage cells (e.g. heart disease, cancer). Cooking fruits and vegetables often breaks down the antioxidants, but pickling preserves them. </p>

<p>Chocolate can actually be fairly healthy/nutritious depending on its sugar content. Dark chocolate contains fiber, iron, magnesium, copper, and manganese as well as a huge amount of antioxidants (raw cocoa beans have one of the highest scores of any tested foods). There are studies that show positive impacts from dark chocolate on heart, skin, and brain function as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We don't usually think of salt as a &quot;nutrient.&quot; But that's only because our average modern diets have way more than we need. It serves all kinds of legitimate purposes and you will crave it if you don't have enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that there are two types of pickling: fermenting and quick pickling. </p>
<p>The first involved preserving the vegetable in a salty brine, creating an environment for lactic acid bacteria to grow, preserving and processing the food and providing probiotic benefits. The bacterial activity causes the liquid to become acidic, which protects the pickles from growth of harmful bacteria. The liquid surrounding these pickles often looks really cloudy, that's a sign of bacterial activity IIRC.</p>
<p>The second type of pickling is more likely what you'll see at a grocery store or even many restaurants. The acidity needed to prevent harmful bacteria from growing is provided by an acid that is added at the start, rather than acid produced by bacterial growth. Usually this acid is some kind of vinegar, along with some salt, sugar, and spices. Often the vegetables are either partially cooked or quickly plunged in boiling vinegar and water- this helps infuse the flavor of the brine with the vegetables more quickly and also kills off bacteria (both harmful and beneficial). Quick pickles can sit in this brine for up to a few weeks, or can be put right onto a dish in 10 or 15 minutes. Since the vegetables aren't fully cooked, you'll still be getting a lot of nutrients that are preserved with them I'd imagine, but you will not be getting an probiotic benefit from quick pickles.</p>
<p>When I first became interested in probiotic and fermented foods and spent a long time trying to understand the difference between these two types of pickles. If you really wanted probiotic benefits with quick pickles, vinegar that is unfiltered and unpasteurized will still have bacteria in it, so using live and active vinegar in your pickles could provide that benefit. However then you would have to start the pickles without heating the liquid too high (too much heat kills the bacteria), which means it will be more difficult to dissolve the sugar and salt, take longer for the flavors to mingle and the texture of the veggies to change, and you'd run the risk of bad bacterial growth if you keep the pickles for too long. Fermenting pickles is fun though, give it a try!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On your second point, there was a study done about cravings vs lack of nutrients where scientists took a group of people and when they craved chocolate, gave half actual chocolate, half all the chemical nutrients that make up chocolate.</p>
<p>The group that received just the individual nutrients still had cravings for chocolate while those that had real chocolate did not, suggesting that cravings for food are more emotional than your body knowing what nutrients it's lacking. </p></div>		</li>
