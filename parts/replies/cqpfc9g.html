			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct! I have taught a lot of CPR courses and this is one of the main questions nowadays: why do we teach compression-only CPR?</p>
<ol>
<li>as u/Scrub_Lyfe has pointed out we have enough oxygen in our bodies to last the brain for around 10 minutes (+/- ofc)</li>
<li>A cardiac arrest is a shocking situation for anyone not specifically trained on how to react. Having to do only CPR (100 beats/min) is much easier than alternating between CPR and mouth-to-mouth breathing. For anyone interested, you should do CPR 30beats -&gt; 2x mouth-to-mouth -&gt; CPR 30 beats etc.
It's just additional stress that has little benefit, hence why we only teach compression-only CPR for bystanders.</li>
