			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure! Most organisms contain circadian clocks. This allows them to keep approximately 24-hour time even in the absence of any environmental time cues. Ordinarily circadian clocks are synchronized to environmental time cues, such as light/dark or temperature cycles.</p>
<p>Circadian clocks time everything from gene expression to hormone release to when to feel tired and go to sleep. They are also why it takes several days to transition to a new time zone (jet-lag) or to a new schedule.</p>
<p>Generally it is advantageous for an organism to have a circadian clock that can be synchronized to the day length because it allows the organism to anticipate changes in the environment (e.g., it can predict when energy will be available). This advantage in terms of evolutionary fitness has been demonstrated in both <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/95/15/8660.short" target="_blank">cyanobacteria</a> and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/3/686.short" target="_blank">mice</a>.</p>
<p>The mechanism that generates the clock differs between species. In mammals the clock involves complex feedback loops between genes and their translated proteins. In cyanobacteria, it's a simple chemical feedback loop between three proteins and ATP that can be generated in a test tube with no cells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just read your explantion from a couple years back, absolutely beautiful. Could I PM you whenever I have a random biology question that im curious about? I can never seem to find direct answers to a lot of my questions, especially not ones as thorough and understandable as yours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If brains were evolved to create movement. Could it then be possible that the waking state evolved from the process of movement. In-turn the sleeping state would then be the natural state of the organism? So then sleep might have come first?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's really a sensible way to think about it. Animals without brains move around and have more &quot;active&quot; phases with respect to metabolism, etc. Whether you choose to define these phases as &quot;wake&quot; and &quot;sleep&quot; is totally arbitrary and just comes down to how far you are willing to stretch the definitions. </p>
<p>The best way to think about sleep is as a collection of biological processes that happen to occur at the same time of day. These didn't necessarily all evolve together, and different organisms have coupled together different processes in service of improving performance at other times of day.</p></div>		</li>
