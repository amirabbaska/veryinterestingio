			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, eating less beef is a very positive choice you can make for the environment! One <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513009701" target="_blank">study</a> in particular answered your exact question: they found that the most effective thing you can do for your diet is to eliminate meat (35% reduction in emissions from food). But switching from intensive meats like beef to less intensive meats (like poultry) results in an 18% reduction.</p>
<p>Other studies have found similar results. A recent <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/08/if-everyone-ate-beans-instead-of-beef/535536/" target="_blank">paper</a> found that substituting beans for beef could achieve large enough reductions to cover about half of the US climate goal for 2020.</p>
<p>On average there is a benefit from moving from a vegetarian diet to a vegan diet. How you actually do this as an individual could change the results, but our findings suggest that switching from an omnivorous diet to a vegan diet saves about 900kg of Co2e each year, whereas switching to a vegetarian diet saves about 800kg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am wondering about transportation versus vegan diet...</p>
<p>For example if I want to switch to a vegan diet and no longer use dairy (and I live in &quot;the dairy state&quot; so you can assume there is very little transportation of dairy products), I would buy avocado or coconut products instead of butter and milk. Is the shipping of coconuts and avocados from tropical climates to the northern U.S. still better than using cow-based dairy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like all good questions, the answer is that it depends. I have read about this a lot, and my understanding is that vegan still comes out ahead. When dairy is produced, you have to grow and transport all the food to feed the cow, produce extra water for the cow, and then the cow releases methane. Once the milk is produced, you have to pasteurize it, refrigerate it and transport it all before it spoils. For a coconut or avocado, you still have to input the resources to grow it, but it is significantly less than feeding a cow, and many products like coconut milk do not need to be refrigerated and are less prone to spoiling. </p>
<p>Transportation is relatively small compared to the overall impact of raising an animal. This is why it can be more efficient (from an energy standpoint) to buy something from an industrial scale farm in South America than from a small local farm that is much less efficient. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a paper a colleague is known for:</p>
<p>‘We find that although food is transported long distances in general (1640 km delivery and 6760 km life-cycle supply chain on average) the GHG emissions associated with food are dominated by the production phase, contributing 83% of the average U.S. household’s 8.1 t CO2e/yr footprint for food consumption. Transportation as a whole represents only 11% of life-cycle GHG emissions, and final delivery from producer to retail contributes only 4%. Different food groups exhibit a large range in GHG-intensity; on average, red meat is around 150% more GHG-intensive than chicken or fish. Thus, we suggest that dietary shift can be a more effective means of lowering an average household’s food-related climate footprint than “buying local.”’</p>

<p>First, is this true, and is it worthwhile to cut out beef alone?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I actually heard about cattle being the leading cause of GHG for the first time on Leonardo DiCaprio's Before the Flood. Like you, I started cutting out beef from my diet when I learned that. I always felt like I wasn't making much of a change by reducing beef in my diet, but I continued it because I'm a fan of Gandhi's &quot;Be the change you want to see in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason I'm responding to you is because, as a healthcare professional, I wanted to point out the fact that there are very real health benefits to cutting red meat from your diet, which, to answer your question, does make it worthwhile.</p>
<p>First of all, there is a proven link between <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4698595/" target="_blank">red meat and colon cancer</a>. </p>
<p>There is also an associated between <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/new-study-links-l-carnitine-in-red-meat-to-heart-disease-201304176083" target="_blank">red meat and heart disease</a>.</p>
<p>So, if only for your own personal health, it's a great idea to cut back on red meat!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, I find that a lot of nutrition documentaries, especially those on Netflix, tend to be based on flimsy science or cherry-picked articles.</p>
<p>See reddit discussions on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/6po28i/debunking_what_the_health_the_documentary_that/" target="_blank">What the Health</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/5d6evj/food_choices_documentary_on_netflix_legit/" target="_blank">Food Choices</a>.</p>
<p>I stopped watching What the Health about a quarter of the way through because it was unbearable. I'll give Food Choices a look, though.</p>
<p>I actually read a great article by Nat Geo on <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/foodfeatures/evolution-of-diet/" target="_blank">The Evolution of Diet</a> and it had an interesting brief discussion on the role of meat in our evolution.</p>
<p>I'm probably never going to eliminate meat from my diet, and I find that to be an unrealistic goal to ask of the general public. But being more aware of the different types of meat and their effects on both health and the environment could help us in moderating the proportions in which we eat different types of meat (ideally, a low proportion of red meat and a high proportion of white meat, like fish and chicken), while increasing the proportion of non-meat foods we eat.</p></div>		</li>
