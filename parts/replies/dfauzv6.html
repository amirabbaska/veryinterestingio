<p>right... it forces them. I don't see how a force can exist without there being a force involved..?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>right... so there's just no known reason for it..? there's nothing physical to actually cause it to occur?</p>
<p>EDIT: even in just a high school physics sense.. teacher says if I push on the wall then the wall pushes back. That push-back is largely the exclusion principle. It's <em>exerting a force</em> somehow here...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say Pauli exclusion principle as a way to say that overlap isn't allowed, but the principle is an observation that it doesn't happen, not a quantum mechanistic description of why it is prevented, correct? How is the exclusion effected without saying  it just is, or &quot;magic&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

Pauli exclusion is not such a process (no mediator), but the general idea of interaction probability still applies.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why? What is the source of the Coriolis force?  Of centripetal force? You say &quot;the motion of particles is entirely dictated by one of these four &quot;force&quot; things I see on this list right here&quot;.  And yet, in that list, gravity, for example, isn't even a force and EM and weak are actually the same thing and nowhere on that list does it actually say anything backing your statement that &quot;this is all of physics&quot;.</p>
<p>In physics you start with some equation that, more or less, describes the energy of a system of constituents, what is interacting with what and what mathematical form those interactions are (these are your &quot;forces&quot;), as well as the base properties of the components themselves (not your &quot;forces&quot;, but still just as important).  One then takes this equation and puts it through the appropriate machinery of physics (be it classical theory, quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, whatever) and gets out a new equation , a &quot;solution&quot; that dictates the behavior of the system (this is also not your &quot;forces&quot; and really the key thing).</p>
<p>What you seem to think is the be-all and end-all of physics, is the interaction terms.  Pauli exclusion is not, natively, an interaction term, but rather it's a mathematical constraint in the machinery of QM and QFT, but not in classical physics (or classical field theory) on what final solutions are allowed.</p>
<p>All of these are part of physics equally.  You've emotionally decided that only coupling terms in the energy equation are &quot;real&quot;.  Your reasoning is your own, but it's not defensible.  The non-coupling terms and the solution apparatus are just as &quot;real&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The force of whatever is confining you. If you're in a massive centrifuge, you definitely feel the centrifugal force, when in essence it's just the centrifuge pushing you.</p>
<p>OP is asking about a perceived to be real force as well, as he is referring to the Lennard-Jones potential. It's a force that can keep a neutron star from collapsing on its own. I don't see any emotion but rather a serious question that I used to wrestle with myself when I was an undergraduate, and a ton of disappointing answers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not that solutions describing multiple fermions occupying the same state are prohibited by a dynamical principle, it's that these states <em>don't exist</em>, even formally. An operator which anti-commutes with itself squares to zero. Interactions and forces determine how a given state of a system evolves into another over time. There is no force necessary to keep a system from occupying a state which does exist, even mathematically.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You mentioned the Lennard-Jones intermolecular potential, and there's also effective nucleon-nucleon potentials which have very hard &quot;cores&quot; attributed to Pauli exclusion of the underlying constituent particles.</p>

<p>Ok, so the Pauli exclusion principle results a specific potential. But isn't the gradient of a potential a force? Wouldn't that imply that the Pauli exclusion principle has to be somehow connected to a force?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What I find strange is that the first sentence seems independent of the distance, while the second does not (it sounds like &quot;you can't put two identical fermions into the same quantum state too close of one another&quot;). Do you have a good explanation for that? It may be just me not having a very good idea of what a quantum state is... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the quantum state is a spatial wave function which depends on position. It's not a discrete quantum number like spin, so in order to quantify &quot;being in the same state&quot; for spatial wavefunctions, it's given by their overlap in space.</p>
<p>The wavefunctions for identical fermions tend not to want to overlap much (assuming their spin state is symmetric).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Okay, but this response is confusing, as it relies on the agency of fermions, presumably as a metaphoric crutch.  What the reddit laity is trying to understand is <em>why</em> the fermions don't 'want' to overlap.</p>
<p>Remember, in our mental model of the universe, we've been told that solid matter is actually an illusion, and that what creates it is a set of fundamental forces that either attract or repel such that objects are formed out of almost-indivisible 'particles', which are in turn composed of sub-particles that sort of act like they take up space but actually have no dimension.</p>
<p>Now we're asking about the force that keeps the sub-particles from being arbitrarily near or at the same place at the same time, and being told that no force <em>keeps</em> them from doing so, but that they just <em>don't</em>.</p>
<p>So, we believe you, of course, but why not?</p></div>		</li>
