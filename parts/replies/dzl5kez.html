			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm; I dive. The falloff in low-frequency wavelengths is stupid fast as objects get more and more distant. The light absorption varies with the total distance from surface (or other light source) to the object to the eyes.</p>

This is a relatively shallow depth suitable for basic recreational diving (&lt;20m). Scan the coral, from the foreground to the background. You can see how ridiculously fast you lose reds and yellows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you see that red fish there in the distance?
No.
How about that violet one?
Yes.</p>
<p>Could this be the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, what a simple way to put it. I was making it too complicated in my head. Interestingly there are some fish that glow blue on their underbellies as to be less detectable by predators below by blending into the blue background above. </p></div>		</li>
