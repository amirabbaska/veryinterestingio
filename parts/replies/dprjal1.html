			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget noethers  theorem that states that symmetries in a system lead to an invariant (conserved) quantity. Pretty much the underpinning concept of a large amount of QM (particularly quantum numbers)  as well as classical mech in a single theorem. Space-time translation invariance of a system implies energy-momentum conservation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MIT prof. Sussman wrote a book about rederiving most physics from the PoLA, called Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics. I never read it (plan to) but I wonder how good it is in the eyes of physics grad. (Im only a compuer guy so far).</p></div>		</li>
