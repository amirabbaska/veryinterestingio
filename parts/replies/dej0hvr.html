			<div class="markdown"><p>This ^. I worked with explosive, literally thousands of hours. I talked to the university to see if I could get my hours transferred so I would only have to do 1 year instead of 4 to get my blasting ticket and they said &quot;sure, just get your Unit CO to sign this&quot;</p>
<p>Guess who would never sign off on that experience in a million years...</p>
<p>And you wanna know why? Because &quot;it might encourage people to quit&quot;</p>
<p>They refuse to give you transferable skills so that you're either forced to stay in, or throw all your experience in the trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not true in all branches or units. Air Force is having issues keeping aircraft maintainers and cyber fields manned because a lot of them come in, get experience and the GI Bill, and hop out into a more lucrative civilian market for those jobs. Not enough incentive to stay in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the military invests money to train people.  So it only makes financial sense that they try to retain them. If you spend hundreds of thousands to train a pilot over 3 years where he doesn't work just studies and  trains a d you feed and house him are you really going to make it easy for him to leave? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>God this all sounds like such a shit deal.</p>
<p>I always thought the military seemed like a decent option for those who wanted another option and could handle the training and such.</p>
<p>But damn. This really sounds like a crap deal for everything you give vs what you get in return.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all depends. It depends on your units, on your job, and also on your attitude.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the military is damn near the only way for someone in a lower socioeconomic bracket to rise up. I think it's bullshit that that is one of the only avenues Americans have for upward mobility, but I certainly believe it's one way to do it.</p>
<p>Assuming, of course, you decide to go into a military field that has carry-over skills. For instance, there's a lot of lucrative opportunities for people in the IT fields (network, sys admin, cyber security, database, etc), not so many for the infantry (security guard).</p>
<p>Like most things, it's nuanced; it's not really a shit deal but it's not the best thing ever either. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is, and it isn't.  I'll be honest... a great deal of these problems are solved by internal motivation.  Some (such as PTSD, mental issues, etc) require professional help, but that's entirely in reach while you're in service.  You have to set things in motion <em>while you're in</em> if you expect to get help <em>while you're out</em>.    </p>
<p>I went in the Air Force specifically to expand my skillset with computers, networks, etc.  But everyone leaves at some point, whether you do 6 years or 20.  We <em>all</em> leave.  Not everyone makes detailed plans for that, though.  I sought out college (paid for while you're on active duty), completed several certs (can get some or all of these paid for, too), and studied hard after work to continue diversifying my skills.  The VA has also been amazing.  They've gone to great lengths to help me with job placement, paying for my dual Masters, etc.  I transferred my 9/11 MGI Bill to my son before retiring.  When he's old enough for college, he won't need to worry about incurring massive debt.    </p>
<p>Where am I going with all of this?  Its important to teach our kids/younger neighbors/Airmen about planning for the future.  IT jobs are highly lucrative, but not everyone can (or wants) to do that as a trade in the military.  You joined as Security Forces?  Your options will be very limited if you sit on your butt during active duty.  Most SF can't just walk out the gate after 6 years and get a leg up on entering a civilian police force.  Again, need recognized certifications and such.  You need to <em>plan ahead</em>.  Same with infantry, or personnel, or whatever.  </p>
<p>Sorry, feel like I'm rambling.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All the pamphlets, speakers, and propaganda the military guys shoved down our throats in high school made it seem like we would be able to get a job easy by letting us use the experience to find a job. Unless I remember wrong or missinterepreted it, I think it was false advertising. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In this case, you sidestep the CO.  Talk to his 1SG (or CSM if he's BN+ CDR) and go to the command team at the higher echelon.  You would not accept toxic leadership like this on behalf of one of your joes, so why would you accept it for yourself?</p>
<p>This is also an IG issue.  Either of these are great ways to force the hand of a self-serving captain</p>
<p>Or you could even get the BN Operations SGM or OIC to sign off, since they have better visibility of your responsibilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tried looking at non-corporate job? Smaller shops or startups?</p>
<p>At my place we hire all kinds of people for the job and we specifically don't care about certificates because they mean jack shit for competences and we just need people who know their way around Linux, Windows, networks and programming. So we have people without degrees, a lawyer turned Django programmer, a composer, a theologian and various weirdos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for TAP's policy office. We're trying to fix this, but it's something of a slog to convince commanders that they should let service members on the cusp of leaving the military take even more time off to get certs or take courses. It was and is an utter slog to coordinate with state governments to transfer things like nursing or EMS training, too. IT, with its bazillion certs and different industries, is even harder, and I know we also lack most of the technical savvy to know what certs will actually be relevant when new changes hit TAP in 16 months or so.</p></div>		</li>
