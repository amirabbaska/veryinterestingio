			<div class="markdown"><p>Other methods like arc welding? I would guess horrendously so. The surface prep and clean environment you need to maintain would be prohibitive for large structures. For small things, it might be more feasible, but you wouldn't want to do this for the exhaust on your car or to make a folding chair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know of any application for doing actual welding with cold welding because it is unpredictable and the joints aren't very strong.  The closest thing to it might be friction welding: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG3t0Q7UuCU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG3t0Q7UuCU</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good video, but the two welds they show are horribly out of control for what friction welding is capable of. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest and most feasible application is in nano welding. The pressures required are much less for wires and such on the order of less than 10 nm and the welds are actually incredibly accurate and stable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've heard that this effect happens when the same metal comes into contact. Would it also happen with alloys that have the same metal in high concentrations but with different compositions overall, such as different types of steel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can.  To avoid this we use dissimilar metals or silver plated parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to hazard that it would work if the two metals could be an alloy if combined, but also that the bond woudn't be as strong as the same materials since there is a clear change in metals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  The bolts that attach an aircraft engine to the pylon are usually coated with a Nickel anti-seize paste to defeat this effect.  Because the bolts are very close tolerance, and because they are under a great deal of pressure from weight and thrust loads they can &quot;gall&quot; very easily if you skip this step.</p></div>		</li>
