			<div class="markdown"><p>Just be humble, work hard and always ask questions on how things are done and learn as much as possible. Also find a good mentor who is completely willing to teach you the trade the right way. Also have thick skin cause most Union guys like to play jokes and poke at you. I've been a Union Ironworker for 5 years and love every minute of it. Good luck man and enjoy the trade.</p></div>		</li>
