			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah kinda. House had a blood clot in his leg that was undetected for 3 days causing the tissue not receiving blood to die(become ischemic). Having a cut deep enough would kinda be the same although if it was that deep/bad to cause tissue death you might have surgery to go in to repair the vessels/ control bleeding before the damage got that bad. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last I checked, the cause of crips was still unknown but had more to do with nerve damage than blood vessel damage.  However, nerves also re-grow, and they like to follow blood vessels, so it's possible.  You can poke around on pubmed and search &quot;complex regional pain syndrome AND angiogenesis&quot; to see.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just read up on this, and it describes my leg pain after a ruptured disc flattened my sciatica a year ago. My toenails grow at half the speed and most of my lower leg doesn't sweat. My muscles are constantly twitching which sometimes feels like someone is squeezing my calf or ankle. Always fun to wake up to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really good answer, but your definitions are just a little bit off. Angiogenesis is the formation of new vessels sprouting from pre-existing ones, regardless of size. Vasculogenesis is the formation of brand new blood vessels <em>not</em> from pre-existing ones. For instance, when there is a wound as in the original question, the capillaries formed sprout from the surrounding vessels and infiltrate the tissue, this is angiogenesis. In contrast, during embryonic development endothelial vessels will form from blood islands on the outside of the developing organism, this is vasculogenesis. </p></div>		</li>
