My local treatment plant puts it into the creek cleaner that the water from upstream. You could drink it if you needed to with no ill effect.</p>
<p>Edit: also the xylem layers in a plant's structure help filter water from the ground to keep bacteria out of the organism. Since they evolved in the bacteria filled ground, you know they'd develop a way to keep it out.</p></div>		</li>
