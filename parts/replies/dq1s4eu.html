			<div class="markdown"><p>I eat carb heavy meals right before sleep for years and never had a problem. Helps that I am athletic and not overweight though. Please note that I said just &quot;carb heavy meals&quot; and <em>not</em> binging, binging is really bad for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't eat while you're asleep, so if you were awake you'd just eat more before you got too hungry, instead of fasting for 8+ hours while your body is demanding more food. If you eat 1000 calories worth of sugar, say, 4 cups of orange juice in one go, your blood sugar levels will spike and plummet whether you're awake or not. Incidentally you'd probably end up being more hungry for having consumed all of those calories than you would have been had you just not eaten anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would happen any time you eat. I'm not sure how much sleeping would affect that, but I believe there is evidence advising against eating right before sleep. Don't quote me on that though, it might be a myth.</p></div>		</li>
