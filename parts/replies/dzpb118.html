<p>The theory that I heard that made sense to me is that this process of getting the wrong answer can actually make finding the right answer harder because of stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>You try to remember some trivial bit of information (this phenomenon usually doesn't happen with really important information)</li>
<li>You come up with some wrong answers, which is normal since it's not important information</li>
<li>You start to really try and think about what the right answer is, and get a little stressed/frustrated by being unable to remember it</li>
<li>Your brain interprets stress as a sign that it should prioritize important functions, and de-prioritize unimportant stuff. Unfortunately remembering the name of that actor from that movie you saw last year is part of this unimportant stuff. So in essence your brain is actively blocking the information you're trying to recall</li>
<li>Eventually you give up, stop thinking about, and also stop worrying about it. Your brain stops de-prioritizing unimportant stuff, and the information pops up because it's not being blocked anymore</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't know if that's 100% scientifically accurate, but it certainly seems like it describes what's going on in my brain in these situations. And so even if it's not correct, it's a useful way to think about it.f</p>
<p>Basically, we didn't evolve to deal with the little stresses and anxieties of modern life and our brain isn't really wired correctly to make these little social interactions work smoothly all the time. Or to put it another way, getting worried about stuff that doesn't matter is counterproductive.</p></div>		</li>
