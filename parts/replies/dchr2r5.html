			<div class="markdown"><p>Cultures that don't use some form of infant directed speech are rare though; it is much more common amongst the languages of the world to use some form of baby talk.</p>
<p>Human language acquisition is pretty robust, but even though sprogs don't need infant directed speech to learn to talk, there is a bunch of evidence that it is helpful, nonetheless.</p>
<p>Typically, infant directed speech </p>
<ul>
<li>uses exaggerated prosody, which babies are more likely to tune into (this surprisingly doesn't impair children's acquisition of tonal languages, which is cool)</li>
<li>employs over-the-top visual articulation, helping kids mentally map sounds to the speech gestures that produce them</li>
<li>uses vowels that sound much more dissimilar from one another than in adult-directed speech (e.g., the vowels in <em>bit</em> and <em>bet</em> are much less confusable in infant directed speech)</li>
<li>uses consonants that are also produced in ways that emphasise their differences (such as the contrast between /b/ and /p/)</li>
<li>helps children develop pragmatic social speech skills; really young babies can develop speech turn-taking skills even before their first word</li>
<li>uses a slower speaking rate that helps children segment words out of the sound soup they're listening to (try picking out individual words when you listen to a foreign language for the first time, and see how hard this is)</li>
<li>slowly and surely saps the last remaining vestiges of sanity from parents, reminding them at every utterance that they are prisoners of their tiny demanding tyrant(s), and that dignity is a privilege, not a right</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Half of these points actually seem like simple proper clear articulation, maybe motherese goes a bit further than that. Still, it often seems like most people just don't take the effort of actually speaking clearly and they get away with it because other people will just fill in the gaps based on context. </p>
<p>I'm quite guilty of this as well by the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also study language acquisition in university and child development, everything you said is true, however, it does benefit the baby to use IDS. The slow, exaggerated, high pitched voice helps the baby distinguish between words. The children who dont receive IDS in those other cultures mentioned, often take longer to learn the language which can slow down their learning in all different areas. Children do eventually catch up to other children their age though. An infants hearing is not fully developed when born and hears higher pitched human voices the best and can only see clearly about 12 inches from their faces (to see human faces talking to them the best). So IDS is beneficial to use to help babies progress at an appropriate pace. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is considerably more contentious than you're making it out to be.</p>
<p>There is limited and conflicting evidence on whether IDS shows actual benefits. The vast majority of the proposed benefits are largely hypothetical, and many stem from outdated beliefs about the challenges of language acquisition.</p>
<p>The notion that perhaps it helps to segment words, for instance, mostly comes from a longstanding assumption that segmenting words is hard, so we must provide infants with some sort of boundary marker. But it turns out there needn't be one - infants are pretty capable of learning word boundaries from the statistics of the sounds they hear alone (&quot;statistical learning&quot; is the term to look up if anyone is interested).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An infants hearing is not fully developed when born and hears higher pitched human voices the best</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unlike the eye, an infant's ear is functionally mature just after birth. As soon as the fluid drains from the middle ear, they're pretty much good to go.</p>
<p>Infants typically attend more to higher-pitched sounds (though arguably so do adults), and auditory processing continues to develop as they acquire auditory experience, but it isn't because their ear isn't fully developed and they can't hear lower-pitched sounds well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hearing part you are correct, i used the wrong words. We were taught in class that hearing is developed but that they hear human voice better than anything else. Its developed just different than what it should be. That was my mistake.</p>
<p>And also i know all about statistical learning, we learned about that in class as well. . And yes children will learn language regardless of IDS and very well, but IDS helps them acquire it faster thus they develop other things faster such as thought, memory, sense of self, ect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did learn about the correlations in class but I cant remember them enough to confidently discusss and no longer have the textbook. But there definitely are studies on it  that you may be able to find. I did a quick google search and couldn't find any articles that were free regarding it unfortunately </p>
<p>Edit: Overall, no matter the circumstances children are amazing at acquiring language and all will catch up to appropriate language standards. But the early, faster learning that IDS provides the children benefits them in other learning areas as they are able to focus on other things once they learn to communicate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Copy pasting the same question I asked a little higher in case you don't get to see it:</p>
<p>Dude trying to learn a new language here.
I wonder if based on what you studied, if you have tips on how adults can learn languages like babies do?
My mother tongue is Vietnamese and French (Vietnamese at home and French at school) and I learned English in my teens in a very immersive way. I was chatting on the internet a lot and consistently surrounded myself with English media (music, TV, Radio, Films, friends, etc.)
Now, I am trying to learn German and besides going to classes, trying to conversate in German as much as possible, and doing at least a little every day (so far, I am doing Duolingo to memorize and learn vocabulary). The problem is that my level isn't high enough for me to actually be able to understand what I hear (like on TV, music, films, etc). Even when speaking with Germans, I am guessing, more than I actually understand. The more vocabulary that I learn and remember, the more I can guess but I am wondering what else I can do.
Some say that just continuously listening to German, even if I don't understand, helps. Kind of like infants during a mother's pregnancy, we can learn just by listening continuously. Is that true? I feel that if I don't understand a language, I tend to just tune out like noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it came to adults learning second language it was all based on theories rather than fact and everyone learns differently but i can share a few overall points i got from the course. Best way to do it is to immerse yourself in it just as you've been doing, but adults are much different than children and cannot learn the same way. Their first language interferes with learning subsequent languages. Formal education for second languages doesnt work very well, such as audiolingual learning or grammar translation... thats why students who take language classes in school throughout there childhood rarely learn the language. What you've been doing seems best. I dont think just listening will be that beneficial but im sure it will help understand word segments and pronounciation. Avoid translating though! Obviously its ok to translate some vocab when your stuck, but overall translating actually hinders your learning. Such as mentioned before how your first language interferes.
This is mostly theory though. For example, they say formal teaching isnt beneficial however i found that my Spanish classes helped a lot with pronunciation and reading. when i went to Colombia, if i didnt understand what someone was saying i asked them to write it down for me and then when they repeated it, i was better able to hear the pronunciation and segregation of words as they said it. The big thing our professor kept going back to was MOTIVATION. Your own personality has a lot to do with it, and some people are better at learning languages than others. </p>
<p>I know this probably wasnt very helpful. But i believe everything youre doing is really good. Try to get into more conversations and try your best. I liked to listen in on other peoples conversations but as soon as someone directed a question at me, i froze and had no idea what to say despite knowing what they were talking about to each other. Some people believe watching shows with subtitles helps but that would result in the translating issues. Dont lose your motivation though,  that is the most important thing. Force yourself to NEED to comminicate!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is half true. &quot;Motherese&quot; exaggerates pitch modulation in speech. It also puts different kinds of emphasis on vowel vs consonant sounds. These things seem to help the child pick up speech quicker. Children in control groups did not obtain speech as efficiently as children in the Motherese groups </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My good friend didn't speak to her child in &quot;motherese&quot; and just spoke to her in normal tones and she never had any issues growing up. The first poster in this thread said that it does not necessarily benefit the children, but even if it did saying &quot;what kind of parents&quot; tends to make it sound like those parents are terrible parents. Which just isn't true. Hopefully that's not the intent of your comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are maybe some subcultures where this isn't common. I'm told that I began speaking very early and my parents/grandparents felt that it was because they didn't do the whole baby talk thing. I've seen them around other children now and can confirm that they do not baby talk. I have no idea why. It's not a conscious decision as far as I know, it's just how they do things. </p></div>		</li>
