			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also &quot;mutsi&quot; and &quot;faija&quot; in slang. Interestingly, the words that are closest to &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;pop&quot; in Finnish are &quot;mummi&quot; and &quot;pappa&quot;, which are &quot;grandmother&quot; and &quot;grandfather&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but 'mutsi' and 'faija' are just loaned words for 'mor' and 'far'. Funny how 'stadin slangi' morphs swedish and russian.</p>
<p>Edit: mummu being mormor</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a strong history of multigenerational childrearing in Finnish culture, where it would be common for grandparents to have roughly equal or greater exposure to babies than the parents? Maybe the grandparents named themselves first in that case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just browsing the thread to see a finnish reaction. My wife is half Finnish and her mother claims her first word was äiti. I do not believe that for one bit...surprinsingly my daughter uses the German mama instead. But there may be a mummi here and there as well. So far</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, like any other mothers we'd like our kid's first word to be äiti. It hardly ever is. My youngest says 'äijä' now, and I think he's trying to say 'äiti'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is just about how you define a word. If it has to be Finnish, then it probably was &quot;äiti&quot; or more accurately &quot;äi-i&quot; because t is hard to pronounce</p></div>		</li>
