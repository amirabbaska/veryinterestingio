			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. That makes sense. Thank you for educating me. I bought $2 mega liter soda bc it’s cheap, but throw most away bc the fizz dies before I can drink it. Maybe I should consider a fountain system at home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel obligated to mention that three of the big factors of the CO2 loss will be surface area, and the aggression of pouring, and temperature difference.</p>
<p>If you have 2 containers, 1 styrofoam and one smooth steel, the one with styrofoam will typically foam much more because there are more locations for the CO2 to form bubbles.</p>
<p>For the pouring aggession it is almost the same as the first, but you are forcing the soda together at the pour site, and creating differing pressures (from my laymans understanding which i hope someone will clarify/correct) and those pressure differences help the CO2 to form bubbles. So pouring down the side of a glass, or drinking in a way that prevents bubbles from getting pushed into the fluid (a la drinking from a sideways bottle as opposed to an upside down one) will help to preserve the CO2.</p>
<p>Lastly for temperature </p>
<p>EDIT- I was wrong about the temperature in this situation as cold =/= less dissolved gasses, i am an idiot. I made a case for ice which is not backed up by my statement now, so is likely wrong also.</p>
<p>Its not ELI5 though, and it is probably barely coherent (im in a lot of pain and am at work so meh) but j felt like i should say something at least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, gasses dissolved in a liquid will dissipate more quickly from a warm liquid than a cold one. So, keep your drink cold = carbonation lasts longer</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lastly for temperature you have to understand that dissolved things are really easy to get into hot fluids, but are really difficult to get into cold fluids. So if you have a chilled drink, it will lose its CO2 much faster because it really wants to vent off that CO2.</p>

<p>that is for solid→liquid <a href="https://www.chem.fsu.edu/chemlab/chm1046course/solubility.html" target="_blank">the opposite is true for gasses</a></p>
<p>This comes up in fish tanks when the water gets too warm it is impossible to dissolve enough oxygen to keep fish alive it makes sense if you think about the gasses 'boiling' away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to your reasoning, the presumed melted ice within the drink would also lead to a sense of lowered carbonation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is only really worth it for people who prefer seltzer water (because all the available syrups are either generic flavours that are cheap anyways, like grape or root beer, or off-brand garbage), and even then the aforementioned CO2 canister costs definitely take away from the actual &quot;worth it&quot; quality.</p></div>		</li>
