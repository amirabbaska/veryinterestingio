			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that if you get enough U-235 (or Pu-239, which was used in the Nagasaki bomb) together, a nuclear chain reaction will start. The trick is that while this chain reaction will release a huge amount of radiation, it's not rapid enough to trigger a bomb-level nuclear explosion, especially since the energy generated will disperse the material (a little explosion), stopping the reaction before it gets too big. For a bomb to work, explosives have to be used to compress the material with great force and precision, which isn't going to happen by accident, at least not in a WWII-era bomb.</p>
<p>However, even though they couldn't cause nuclear explosions, accidental chain reactions were absolutely a huge danger. In fact, two Manhattan Project scientists, Henry Daghlian and Louis Slotin, died from radiation exposure after accidentally triggering chain reactions.</p>
<p>So to answer your question, the nature of early nuclear bombs meant that accidental nuclear explosions were not a threat. However, irradiation from accidental nuclear chain reactions well below the explosive level was absolutely a huge danger that was not properly appreciated at first, leading to two deaths.</p>
<p>EDIT: I guess I should note that I'm only talking about fissile material handling here. Once you actually put the bombs together, especially Little Boy, there was a significant threat of accidental detonation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That said, there have been a few nuclear weapons <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_nuclear_incident_terminology" target="_blank">involved in accidents</a> (air crashes and the like) which have not detonated.</p>
<p>As you say, to get a nuclear bomb to go off requires a precision explosion. But even with the main explosive charge loaded it is fairly safe until the actual primer is armed, which in the case of nukes often only happens as the bomb is dropped. Little Boy (which wiped out Hiroshima) was not armed until they were in the air, precisely in case they crashed on take-off.</p>
<p>Conventional bombs are made safe in a similar manner - the main high explosive charge in normal bombs is actually extremely stable and quite hard to detonate. It can only be made to go off through a chain reaction started by the detonator (a highly sensitive, low energy compound), which triggers a booster compound, which in turn detonates the main bomb. This is how controlled explosions work - the principle is that you can use a small charge to blow apart and ruin the detonation mechanism without actually detonating the main bomb.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And they both even died from the same 6.2kg ball of plutonium. A bomb core used for experiments - subsequently nicknamed the demon core.</p>
<p>I guess the name is quite fitting when the cause of the first death was a scientist dropping a brick of tungsten carbide onto it. And the second was caused by a scientist holding a beryllium sphere open with a screwdriver and the screwdriver falling out. It would be quite scary if something so simple and harmless sounding (especially where no visible effects would be immediately seen) could suddenly lead to your death in less than a month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Richard Feynman actually tells kind of an interesting story about this in a talk he gave titled &quot;Los Alamos from Below&quot;. The Army had built the facility to purify U-235 at Oak Ridge and their thinking at the time was that since there would never be a whole bomb's worth of uranium present in the plant at any one time that the whole thing was &quot;naturally safe&quot; and they didn't have to worry about it exploding.  Of course the problem with this is that uranium mixed with water is much more likely to produce a runaway reaction which while it wouldn't be an atomic bomb could be pretty nasty.</p>
<p>When one of the scientists from the Los Alamos end of the project pointed this out it caused a big stir.  Richard Feynman (at 27 years old or something) was sent to Oak Ridge to sort things out and explain the problems with handling large quantities of enriched uranium. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY-u1qyRM5w" target="_blank">The talk is available online and is much funnier than I'm probably making it out to be.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but it requires &quot;enough&quot; fissile material to achieve an accidental result.  E.g. the &quot;tickling the dragon&quot; accidents described by /u/a2soup.</p>
<p>MOST current nuclear weapons deployed by any of the nuclear powers do not use &quot;critical mass&quot; detonation (a la Little Boy) but use a substantially sub-critical mass with explosive compression to achieve critical <em>density</em> (a la Fat Man or newer designs) which must have &quot;sufficient symmetry&quot; to detonate properly.  </p>
<p>The usual &quot;accidental&quot; detonation of explosion in the latter case &quot;merely&quot; spews the fissile material around without a nuclear fission detonation - messy, radiologically within a local radius, but not nuclear or E=mc^(2) level of energy release over 10s of miles, so &quot;mostly harmless&quot;.</p>
<p>Isolating U-235 is not particularly dangerous.  It's expensive.  It's risky because often it involves <strong>chemically nasty</strong> materials (like HF and UF6 which are both supremely corrosive and thus <em>chemically</em> dangerous) but radiologically it's not such a big deal as long as you take reasonable precautions to avoid accidental critical mass events and normal heavy metal protections (i.e. treat it like you are working with mercury or lead).   Standard chemical engineering knowledge is all that is required for this.  Pu-239 is actually easier because it's primarily a chemical refining process rather than atomic mass refining.</p>
<p>There are other factors that make it easier to have &quot;dud&quot; bombs than working bombs unless you make special efforts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is something that's hard to explain to people that think terrorists are building nukes in garages. My cousin is very paranoid about ISIS getting nukes and blowing up America, and I can't seem to convince him that building an actual nuclear weapon is a painstakingly precise and extremely expensive process that you can't just jury-rig in your basement.</p></div>		</li>

This is true in even the simplest form of bomb making that yield significant damage, at least in the U.S. if you manage to buy any combination of materials that would enable you to make a bomb, you're going to be on a list already, let alone materials to make a nuclear weapon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish more people knew that this is not correct. The early atomic bombs were, in fact, quite dangerous, not because uranium or plutonium would spontaneously fission, but because the high explosives surrounding them could be set off by things like fire or shrapnel. Because the electronic systems were comparatively simple, a fire which melted the circuit boards could close some circuits and lead to a detonation. Even scarier is that a stray bullet or shrapnel hitting one of the high explosive lenses could lead to an explosion. That wouldn't fully detonate the nuclear core -- you need a simultaneous explosion of all the lenses to create the implosive force -- but it would lead to some fission, and to some release of radioactivity. There are tons and tons of examples of this in the book Command and Control by Eric Schlosser, which is certainly worth a read if you are under the mistaken impression that nuclear weapons are somehow passively safe because of how difficult fission bombs were to invent in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
