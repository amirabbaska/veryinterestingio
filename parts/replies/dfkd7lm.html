			<div class="markdown"><p>Since you mention Casey Neistat, I'm wondering if you know why he's so popular? </p>
<p>I watch his gear review videos and I like them. Don't really watch any of his other videos. But all of his videos (not just gear reviews) gets 2 million+ views. Which seems really high for that type of channel. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion: His &quot;do it yourself&quot;/&quot;selfmade man&quot;/&quot;american dream&quot; personality and content. A lot of his videos are inspirational, his life is quite interesting and he himself is a very talented and interesting personality. He shares a lot about his life and does it in a unique way - people like that kind of personal entertainment that makes them strife to be better people I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't any, as far as I know. There's a very recent discussion on that topic, since Germany actually asked a Streamer for the first time ever to get a license a few days ago (Google pietsmiet, if you want to know more). The outcome of that discussion is totally open, but it might lead to hard times for the streamers. Back to topic, you won't have to pay any fee to twitch or anyone else right now. If you're big enough and stream regularly a few times a week, you can ask for a partnership with Twitch. One Subscription is around 5$ and the streamer gets to keep roughly 50% of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP is from Germany, streamers with over 500 viewers will soon require an expensive licence, as if they were a tv or radio channel.</p>
<p>I don't really care, but it reflects badly on us.</p></div>		</li>
