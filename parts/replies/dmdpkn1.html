<p>Which is why poorly insulated microwave ovens interfere with WiFi signal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... the only difference between my microwave cooking me and my WiFi router cooking me, is the wattage (energy) being put out by the WiFi router? How much energy does a router put out in EM Waves? (I know microwaves range from 600-1500 Watts).</p></div>		</li>

<p>IIRC it's an industrial standard so that it doesn't interfere with AM, FM or mobile and became a standard because it was easier or a safer bet than higher frequencies regarding range and <del>since</del> some other properties</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As the other people who have commented on this have said: you can call them microwaves, yes. But microwaves are a type of radio wave, so I was being more general in my explanation because I figured it also applies, for example, if you're driving in a car while listening to the radio, or watching tv or something. The term &quot;microwave&quot; simply specifies how long (er, short, in this case) the electromagnetic wave is.</p>
<p>TL;DR - both are correct</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yea, my understanding was that the sets were switched and radio waves were a subset of microwaves, so that's where my error was.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As microwaves are often described as waves with frequencies in the ball park between 1GHz (wave length 300mm) and 100GHz (wave length 3mm) – common denominator in all definitions seems to be 3-30GHz <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microwave" target="_blank">according to Wikipedia</a> –, WiFi (~2.4GHz for b,g,n and ~5GHz for a,n,ac) could be described as microwaves, yes.</p>
<p>Doesn't really make a difference for this explanation, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you mean 1GHz and 100GHz? Because 1MHz is a 300m wavelength, and is MF (Medium Frequency) and 100MHz is 3m wavelength, and VHF.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty weird that you say wavelengths and then give the frequencies with the actual wavelength in parenthesis.</p>
<p>Edit: I don't know if I should thank you for swapping them given that it was relatively a small annoyance, but hey, thanks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I said, about AM and FM:</p>
<p>So AM and FM are kinds of modulation, which means changing the wave to encode information. AM refers to amplitude modulation and FM refers to frequency modulation (although sometimes it can also refer to PM, phase modulation). Essentially, to transmit information via radio waves, we have the wave in which the information is encoded and the information that is being encoded. These are the carrier wave and signal respectively. <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9a9573281588d1e23c16089b601ecea2-c" target="_blank">Here's</a> a picture so you can see what the different types of modulation look like, compared to the signal and the unmodulated carrier wave.</p>
<p>So since Doppler shift causes a change in frequency, it wouldn't have much of an effect in terms of how the information is encoded in an AM signal. A change in frequency (Hz) does not change the amplitude, so the information is still there. However, since FM encodes information by changing the frequency, Doppler shift interferes with that by contributing to that change in frequency from the original freq. of the carrier wave. Once again, though, it only really matters if you're moving at very high velocities relative to the source of the signal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. Any movement changes the channel between transmitter and receiver. For this reason, fading channels are used to describe this scenario, not AWGN <a href="https://wsl.stanford.edu/~andrea/Wireless/SampleChapters.pdf" target="_blank">see chapter 3 (PDF)</a>. </p>
<p>In specific if you look at page 61, you will see the capacity of a fading channel (with receiver side channel state information) is actually less than B log (1 + SNR), the capacity as defined by the Shannon-Hartley theorem. </p></div>		</li>
