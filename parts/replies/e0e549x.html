			<div class="markdown"><p>As u/HadHerses said, it could also be too much laundry detergent. Try cutting down on how much you use in each wash. Use too much and it won't all come out in the rinse, leaving your clothes a bit stiff, scratchy, dull, and dingy looking. Especially if you have hard water. One thing that will help that is to add a cup of vinegar to the rinse cycle instead of any fabric softener. And run the rinse cycle twice, to help get rid of any more excess detergent and to get rid of the vinegar smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Machine-drying definitely wears out fabrics faster, although it may be more the friction of tumbling (and heat, etc.). I spent a few years living abroad in a country where air drying was the norm, and the clothes I took with me lasted nearly the entire time, and what I brought back home quickly disintegrated once I started reusing the dryer. I’d happily start line-drying again if I had a good outdoor space to do it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get a clothes horse and dry inside. I've lived in appartements all my adult life, never had a dryer. In winter it's a bit annoying because it can increase humidity, but in the summer it's perfect as you'd have the windows open anyway! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People claim that using a dryer makes your clothes wear out faster but I’ve never seen evidence of that. I have been the same approximate size my entire adult life and I have some 20+ year old clothes that I put in the dryer every single time I wear and wash them. Tshirts, pants, coats - you name it. </p>
<p>If you care for your clothes effectively them drying on a line doesn’t matter at all. Unless you enjoy stiff, uncomfortable clothing. Wash in cool or cold water unless you’re sanitizing something or treating a stain that needs warm/hot water. Dry on low, store properly, avoid bleach. I’ve used line drying in the past and all I got out of it was stiff, uncomfortable clothes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We almost never use the dryer (primarily due to the cost of electricity), however I've never been bothered by any roughness to my clothes. I definitely notice some items like towels and face washers get very stiff, but not so much for clothing. However we are also on rain water, which means our water is very soft (lacks dissolved minerals/ions). According to the above response hard water helps stabilise larger domains, so that might be why it's not a problem for us.</p>

<p>Solid advice. Also, remove blood with COLD water. Hot water will help make the blood stain. I would also try cold water for dirt. Just the other day I got mud on my very white jumper sleeves while handling a cheeky puppy with muddy paws. I just massaged the muddy sleeves in a small bucket of cold water and the dirt came straight out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I come from a country where we almost exclusively air dry clothes on racks and such. I believe basically everyone uses fabric softener, yet the clothes are nowhere near how soft the stuff dried in the drier is. I've been living abroad for a few years and one thing I know I want to have in my futre house is a dryer, even if I decide to settle in my country of origin where they're really not a usual thing to have. Where I'm living atm the water is actually very hard but even though I completely stopped using any fabric softener my clothes come out of the dryer still 10x softer than I'm used to.</p>
<p>edit: one autocorrected word. </p>
<p>Btw, this comment is so terribly written I can hardly understand it myself ;D one should not be discussing domestic appliances od reddit when walking home from a party half-drunk.</p></div>		</li>
