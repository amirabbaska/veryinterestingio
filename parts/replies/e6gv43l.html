Everyone seems to expect the US and Europe to be 'parallel', but actually Canada's southern most town, Kingsville (42°6′N), is further south than the southern most mainland French village, Lamanére (42°21′40″N), and only fractionally further north than Rome (41°54′N).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I assume that an average would not show extreme climate areas in a good way. For example some parts of central Russia can have -40 in winter and +40 in summer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Areas that are located very far from large bodies of water (like central Russia) generally see large swings in temperature over the seasons. The oceans act as a heat reservoir and help moderate the hot summer or cold winters, evening out seasonal temperature shifts.</p>
<p>This is similar to why deserts experience big temperature swings between day and night. No moisture in the air means that there is nothing to hold onto heat that was accumulating during the daytime.</p></div>		</li>
