<p>I just want to upvote and emphasize the role of humidity, which I didn't mention in my answer upthread.  In particular, the limit on water vapor abundance increases <em>exponentially</em> with temperature, and evaporating water absorbs a large amount of latent heat.  This means when you heat and cool cold air, most of the energy just goes into changing the temperature (sensible heat), humidity is a negligible factor.   But when you heat and cool <em>hot</em> air, more of your energy goes into driving evaporation and condensation (latent heat), so changes in actual temperature will be proportionately smaller.</p></div>		</li>
