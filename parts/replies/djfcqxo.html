			<div class="markdown"><p>This is crazy to me, because I worked for one of the biggest background screening companies in the US, and we were expressly forbidden from conveying anyone's personal opinion of the candidate to the client. We were allowed to tell the client whether you resigned / were terminated / were laid off, and that is IT. It doesn't matter if your previous employer said you came in and threatened everyone in the office with a gun. Our response is, &quot;So they resigned, or were terminated?&quot; And their answer is what we give the client. (Though hopefully the criminal department catches that gun incident). If you list someone as a reference, and that person refuses to answer our questions because you destroyed their business and their life singlehandedly, I submit, &quot;Reference declined to complete questionnaire.&quot; We were also required to reject references that were personal acquaintances or coworkers. If that person didn't work with you as a superior, we wouldn't even ask the questionnaire  (for the vast majority of clients).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask you something since this was what you use to do. I was once fired several years ago. I was in the right(so much so that I was able to state the facts and even get unemployment), but that didn't stop them anyways. I've got a science degree from a good state university, and several years experience. For whatever reason(I know the market is shit right now, etc) I feel like me having been fired is a HUGE black eye on me. Does that actually keep me from getting hired at a lot of companies? Any tips?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While doing a background check, I would often have to reach out to the candidate, and many of them would ask me questions like this. I always told them the same thing, which is unfortunately the truth: that is ultimately dependent upon the company and your recruiter, and they're all different. I come into work,  I sit down at a cube, and I work my way through a list of names. I know literally nothing about your hiring process at any point before or after I complete my task of verifying your information or checking your name in a criminal database. I know the name of the client company, and almost nothing else about them, so I can't speak to their standards or the temperment of their HR Reps. I have no idea whether or not you'll get hired after your report is completed. </p>
<p>It's also important to know that performing background checks is relatively low-skill work. I was hired at my first background screening company when I was 20 years old. I had only ever worked retail, and I was working overnight in a gas station when I applied. I graduated high school late, after I finished summer school my senior year, and I never went to college. I am intelligent and competent and hard-working, which I was lucky enough to prove in an interview, but you wouldn't know it from my job history. The point I'm making is that, while some of us may have personal advice on this kind of thing, there's no reason to assume that we do. I know that the person who has a direct hand in whether or not you're offered a job seems like they should be able to answer that kind of question, but alas, I am but a humble cube drone, and if you have a degree you are probably vastly more qualified to answer questions about hiring dynamics than your background screener(s). I wish i could be more help! That does sound really difficult, and I wish you the best of luck in finding something great!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best job I ever had was working for a government contractor. Woke up super early, was done by 2PM. Pay was great, you could travel etc. </p>
<p>Well after about 3 months I had to meet 1 on 1 with a security lady who would determine if I was allowed my clearance. I was very nervous. Yes, I smoked weed twice in college but I did have outstanding debt because I was a shithead when I turned 21 and ran up credit cards as well as let my school loan default. </p>
<p>Well, anticipating this meeting I took my loan out of default and had been paid up on it for 3 months, also paid off in full a negative on my credit report that cost close to $5000.
I was as professional as possible. I didn't have a lot of answers she wanted regarding my credit report but I told her, &quot;I was young, bad with money...I really love this job&quot;. I thought I sold myself well enough. About 2 weeks later my boss called me in telling me they were letting me go since I could not obtain the proper clearance. They said I could appeal. I appealed. I called that place everyday for a month until the security office told me, &quot;since you haven't been employed with us in a month...you no longer have a sponsor for the appeal.&quot;  </p>
<p>I could either re-apply all over again or find another job looking for the same clearance. </p>
<p>Was a huge blow to my confidence. I spent 8 years in the Marines (prior to the govt job)(no I did not receive my clearance with them surprisingly). My superiors (at the govt job) were already discussing me running the database over an entire building and potentially going to Texas for 6 months that would pay a crap ton. I was pumped. Sucks....</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fuck those PIs are brutal. Why did they allow the student to finish their PhD if that's how they're going to talk about them?? Those students are going to put that professor's name on every job application in their future... It's like you're talking shit about your own ability to teach a grad student how to do chemistry.</p>
<p>Also being an average PhD is <em>not</em> the worst thing in the world</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aside from being pompous, small minded people who are only known for a very small subset of knowledge a handful of people care about, PIs are incentivized to speak ill of their students: they have created their own competition. In a very small field, they have enabled an individual to practice and perhaps excel at exactly what they are doing. Moreover, PIs benefit when students/post-docs have no where to go. They can hold onto them longer, with shit pay, awful hours, and no benefits. &quot;It's an educational experience&quot; is the biggest load of shit. Those who can't do teach. Those who this individual was performing background checks on at a Pharma - they were actually doing. PIs resent it like crazy, for a host of reasons.</p></div>		</li>
