			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't not sequencing the whole DNA be counter productive? These tests are sold at cost to the company because when you send your test in, you are agreeing to have your genetic data sold for profit to other companies(usually pharmaceuticals.) If they don't sequence all the data, then isn't the data far less useful for companies planing to design genetically targeted drugs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, the cost of sequencing the whole genome (well) is still hovering around $1000 - more than a typical consumer would likely be willing to pay.
By well, I refer to coverage - how many times the sequencer picks up a given location. The greater the coverage, the more reliable the result. There are low-coverage whole genome tests available for cheap to consumers, but the accuracy of those actually ends up being about the same as genotyping that I mentioned earlier.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How do DNA/Ancestry tests control for migrations and immigration (&quot;diaspora&quot;)? Wouldn't this phenomenon affect the % breakdowns in the report?<br />
E.g., the Arab diaspora from/to totally different continents. There are people of Lebanese &quot;ancestry&quot; who long ago settled in Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, etc. Couldn't their test results erroneously report that they are Spanish or Portuguese or Tupi? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can that be more correct in Europe, given the mixing of populations that Europe has undergone? (frequently invading neighbours, empires growing and shrinking...)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is more data about Europe, giving a clearer picture. Most other continents have had lots of mixing too, with only a few isolated islands or regions with long-term 'closed' genepools.</p>
<p>Where there has been mixing, you just need more sample points. Some markers might be shared between french and german populations, for example, so these aren't enough by themselves. But by looking at other many markers which are are more common in one or the other you can get a very accurate prediction. Those living near the border where there was recent mixing might just come out as 30% french, 70% german or something.</p></div>		</li>
