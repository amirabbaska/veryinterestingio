			<div class="markdown"><p>If it mold primary depends on how you store it. If you put it in a plastic bag that contain the moisture it take longer to get stale but you can/will get mold. If you store it out in the air or some other way that lets the water evaporate you get stale bred and no mold. </p>
<p>The reson is that the fungus need water to grow. And it is the speed of evaporation compared to speed of fungus and bacteria grow that determine if food just get dry or get spoiled.</p>
<p>You can see the same thing in older post when people said that McDonalds hamburger was full of preservatives and did not mold. The explanation was not preservatives but that they are small and have low water content. If you make your own the same size without any preservatives the result is the same but they mold in a plastic bag <a href="https://aht.seriouseats.com/2010/11/the-burger-lab-revisiting-the-myth-of-the-12-year-old-burger-testing-results.html" target="_blank">https://aht.seriouseats.com/2010/11/the-burger-lab-revisiting-the-myth-of-the-12-year-old-burger-testing-results.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way I have found to store bread that usually won't require you to buy something specifically for it is to tightly wrap the loaf in one (or two, depending on how big it is) clean dish towels. They prevent it from drying out too quickly, and so it goes stale more slowly than if you just left it on the counter, while also not letting moisture that does escape from the bread condense, which is what causes the mold.</p></div>		</li>
