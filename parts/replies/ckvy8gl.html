<p>According to my math and WolframAlpha, if Jupiter were to remain motionless in its orbit at a distance of 1.90557822 Ã— 10^-5 Parsecs (its closest approach to Earth), the parallax would be a whopping 75.7 degrees... so about a fifth of a full circle. That would definitely be noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>human stereoacuity tops out at ~5 arcsec, so we wouldn't be able to see star depth using the earth's orbit. but using, say, neptune's orbit, you could multiply the parallax by 30 (neptune is at 30AU), so you would be able to see some stars in stereo (proxima centauri would then have an easily-detectable disparity of 23 arcsec).</p>
<p>you wouldn't want to station your cameras <em>at</em> neptune, though; then you'd have to wait 82.5 years to get your two pictures, since Neptune's orbit is 165 years long...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Put it this way: &quot;one tenth&quot; is 10^(-1), but it's not &quot;one 10^(-1)th&quot;, it's one 10th.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, the effect can be enhanced with computer modeling and extrapolation.  This web page has hundreds of 3D images of nebulae and stellar clusters that produce this effect quite dramatically using real photos and astronomical measurements:  <a href="http://astroanarchy.zenfolio.com/f359296072" target="_blank">http://astroanarchy.zenfolio.com/f359296072</a></p></div>		</li>
