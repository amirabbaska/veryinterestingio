			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. I understand primary and secondary sources the question I had was specifically about popular history books. The kind of books you'd find in any book shop which is exactly what I was reading. I had just realised while reading the book that the only way I can trust this is fact is by doing just that; <em>trusting.</em> There were no sources cited I could look into. Which then led to me wondering for these kind of books what is the vetting process? If I wrote a history book about my village which only has 500 people in it, the kind of place that has nothing written about it, who's gonna stop me?</p>
<p>Pretty much I'm more wondering about the process of how these popular history books get published and the vetting process they go through. Do you have to be someone with decades of experience and a few degress under your belt? Could an amateur historian with no formal education write a book and get away with it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely no one is stopping you from writing a book of your village, or a made up village even, and claiming it as fact. Now there could be public backlash if it became gigantically popular and turned out to be fake... but most popular history never gets big enough or lies quite enough to get that sort of attention. </p>
<p>There's typically no vetting process. Academic books tend to be published by presses associated directly with universities. There are of course publishing companies that are respected as academic, but for the most part you're going to be seeing most properly cited academic works coming from &quot;University of ____ Press&quot; </p>
<p>Obviously companies aren't going to want to just publish anything, if you wrote 500 pages on why Julius Caesar was secretly a piece of spaghetti I doubt it would be published in popular history (Though it might make a great piece of fiction!) because it's not going to be scrutinized like an academic work would. If you were an historian with a PhD and wrote a book it would be checked over by multiple historians in the same field before it even hit the presses, after that it would be open to every historian in the world to review, and debate, with their responses also having to go through some stringent processes with other historians checking it over to make sure it passes strict (for lack of a better term at 2 am) laws. That's not to say you can't have an opinion that goes against the norm, as many people think, but you have to ensure that your opinion is based on fact and follows historical method. </p>
<p>Popular history doesn't go through any of these checks. Some popular history is written by actual historians, mostly &quot;Retired&quot; ones, because it would be a career killer to publish something and have it quickly be torn apart as poorly researched. That's another reason the review process can be good (not saying it doesn't have a lot of problems) it's better to have three people catch you out and say &quot;you missed a big piece of evidence here..&quot; than 30,000. </p>
<p>But the majority of popular historians are not actual historians. Some have some connecting academic background -- archaeologists tend to write a lot of popular history about antiquity, in my experience -- some have some undergrad or basic experience in history but not enough to warrant the kind of expertise they are trying to act like they have, and others just are playing pretend. </p>
<p>Now that's not to say that no one could possibly match the work of an historian without the proper background, training, experience, etc. but it's pretty rare that someone would get all of that training on their own for the fun of it. </p>
<p>Edit: </p>
<p>When looking at a book and you want to make sure it's trustworthy</p>
<p>1) Look at the author: Google them. Don't trust the about the author bit in the book unless it's to figure out which university they're associated with if they have a common name. Look at their background, does it match with the field they're writing about? What other works have they written on? Is it really wide reaching with no obvious connection between them? (Someone writing a book on the Scottish War of Independence and The Ottoman Empire, for example) is it reasonable that they have an expertise in both of these fields? </p>
<p>2) Year. When was it written? What biases could still be based from this era. I HATE dismissing works because they're &quot;too old&quot; but you have to be aware of their age when interpreting them. </p>
<p>3) Publisher. University pressings tend to be of higher academic quality, but others are still respected. But at the same time if you look at the publisher's other work and it's all crap... </p>
<p>4) Are there footnotes/endnotes in each chapter? If not, it's not academic. That doesn't mean it's useless, but you should ask why they didn't bother to show their work. If they did the research they should know where to find these facts. Why aren't they there? </p>
<p>I'll add to this maybe as I go on.. </p></div>		</li>

<p>2) Year</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leads me to a question that's been bugging me for a long time.</p>
<p>Why are we still writing new books evey year about WW1 and WW2 when almost all the people who could give a direct account of the story are dead or so far from the event that there could be reason to doubt them?</p>
<p>Shouldn't all the best accounts of the World Wars already be written a long time ago? I understand that new memoirs or documents might be found, but I'm talking about the eyewitness accounts... They are getting fewer and more unreliable as the years pass. Yet I keep seeing new books written on the topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Citations make a big difference here. There have been several instances when I was doing research that I would have one source that was a mainstream book on history, and another one that was an academic book. Citations are a great way to tell the difference. In academic books, authors frequently cite their sources. In my experience, this is usually done with chapter end notes, but sometimes using footnotes. I assume that this varies based on discipline. The mainstream books usually do not have citations like this. They tend to be more narrative oriented, and will usually have some sort of bibliography or a &quot;for further reading&quot; list. </p>
<p>This is not to say that just because something is academic, that it can't be popular. The thing is though, most serious academic works are pretty narrowly focused, which prevent them from appealing to most people who aren't already somewhat familiar with the material. </p>
<p>In addition to these, there are books that are primary sources, whereas the previously mentioned works were secondary. Primary sources will not contain citations (unless it's a collection of primary sources) since they are first hand accounts. Some of these can be quite popular, such as Theodore Roosevelt's The Rough Riders (highly recommend it. TR was a fascinating guy). </p>
<p>These days, there is nothing stopping anyone from printing whatever they want. If you have the money, you can self publish. If you don't have the money, you can always try crowdfunding. The thing is, if your book is full of lies, you've basically sunk your reputation. No one will take you seriously anymore. Why take the time to write and edit a book if you're setting it up to fail? </p>
<p>To illustrate, I'll tell you about a guy I went to high school with. &quot;David&quot; was never a great student. His mother had married a billionaire after she divorced his dad, and the sudden influx of wealth changed all of them. During high school, he spent most of his time getting drunk or stoned. Somehow he graduated (doubt it hurt that 2 buildings on campus had their new last name on them). He ended up going to college at a somewhat religious university and at some point, joined their seminary. Not sure how, but he got himself kicked out. So what? It's not like he needs the money. He already learned all the important stuff anyway. What's a stupid degree mean?  So he uses his vast fortune to self publish several books about god and angels and other such stuff. He sent me a copy of one. Not sure why, we haven't talked more than twice in 15 years. I tried to read it, but by the third page I wanted to vomit. It's like he thought his mission was to write a new bible or something. He tried using the kind of flowery language you see in older biblical translations like KJB. It was evident why no publishers wanted to put his &quot;work&quot; into print. He managed to get it listed on Amazon, which pretty much anyone can do, and convinced the two bookstores in town to stock a few copies in the &quot;local authors&quot; section. </p>
<p>A few months ago, a story started making the rounds on Facebook. Turns out he'd gotten himself arrested for impersonating a police officer. He'd outfitted a white Tahoe with police lights and was driving around his neighborhood pulling people over. Nothing ended up coming of it, cause billions of dollars, but the incident basically convinced the few remaining people who took him seriously to completely dismiss him, and his work. We're all pretty sure at this point that there is some kind of mental illness involved. </p>
<p>The point is, if you are a writer, or really any kind of public figure, your reputation matters. &quot;David&quot; could get medicated, go back to school, and get legitimate credentials and knowledge, but he'll still likely be seen as that crazy guy who tried to write Bible 2.0 and got arrested for pretending to be a cop. </p>
<p>If you want to write a fictional history of your village, call it something like a mythical history, or fictional history, or just a fictional history of a real place. If you don't try to pass it off as fact, then at worst you'll be lambasted for poor writing or concept, but you won't be regarded as a fraud. Then, later, if you decide to do serious work, you won't have a bad rep holding you back</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd say Stephen Ambrose often wrote for the average history buff, but he did his best to use as much original source material when possible.</p>
<p>There is overlap between &quot;academic historian&quot; and &quot;popular historian&quot;.  As mentioned, take note of the breadth and depth of the sources used by the author, and follow up on some of those, as they make good reading as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ambrose is a controversial figure, but he definitely represents that overlap well. Ambrose wanted to share his knowledge with a wider evidence without it feeling like work, so he skipped some steps, but that doesn't mean that his work was bad or anything. </p>
<p>There are some &quot;popular histories&quot; that I do enjoy, and many of them I'd credit with getting me interested in the subjects I now actual research as a historian. Yes, sometimes I do go through them and go &quot;well that's wrong, but I see where they were getting that impression&quot; and occasionally I'll go &quot;Well damn, that's a great point actually.&quot; </p>
<p>They're great launching pads and I definitely encourage people to read them, just take some things with a grain of salt and follow up on some of the bigger claims by having a look at the actual evidence yourself :) </p></div>		</li>
