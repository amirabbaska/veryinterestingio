			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on:</p>
<p>In my mind, pure Hip Hop has different qualities and is separate from pop rap, trap, and gangsta rap. But all of these aforementioned sub-genres have hip hop influences.</p>
<p>The best way I can accurately depict sub-genres is by naming artists so (please chip in if you think I made a mistake or disagree):</p>
<p><em>Pop rap</em> would be Drake, Nicki Minaj, (some) Kanye, Big Sean, Macklemore, etc. Probably not a huge geographical influence here, however they do incorporate a decent amount of hip hop characteristics. </p>
<p><em>Gangsta rap</em> would be 50, snoop, Method Man, Xzibit, Dre, Young Buck, YG etc. Strong California influence. </p>
<p><em>Trap</em> has gained popularity more recently. Examples would be Young Thug, Future, Migos, Desiigner, Gucci Mane, etc. Strong southern influence, primarily Atlanta. </p>
<p>Popular <em>Hip Hop</em> artists people listen to today would be Kendrick, Cole, early Jay Z / Kanye, Wale, Danny Brown, Chance. </p>
<p>Some <em>non-rapping Hip Hop</em> artists would be: Anderson Paak, Frank Ocean, The-Dream, Partynextdoor, etc. They would all be considered RnB artists as well but are heavily influenced by hip hop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hip-hop has different subgenres and branches, but pop rap, trap and gangsta rap are still very much hip-hop. I'm not sure what I'd say is pure hip-hop but dudes like Kanye, Kendrick and Wu Tang may go in there, but mostly everyone these days takes some elements from some sort of subgenre. And yes, you can have non-rapping vocals on hip-hop music. Hip-hop soul is a subgenre as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rap has rhyming, assonance, and other common poetry devices, so its really more like regular poetry than slam. The metre of the poem is fit to a rythym like a drum beat. Imagine if you took a sonnet and replaced iambic pentameter with a snare drumline. Thats kind of like what rap is. People dont always recognize this because rapping is really its own form of poetry. Rappers often use weird rhyme structures or just rhyme certain syllables (assonance).
Rap is mainly similar to slam poetry in that they are both experimental forms of poetry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dont honestly have a good answer because I don't know a lot about slam. Rap is usually spoken word lyricism that follows a rhythm (flow), with matching/near matching syllables in each bar. I don't know if slam poetry follows that format. </p></div>		</li>
