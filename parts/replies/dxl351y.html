			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve noticed that I’ll sometimes get chills and shiver after I’ve been exposed to cold weather, but are currently in a warm place (like being outside on a chilly night and feeling just a little cold but start feeling really cold and shivering after I’ve arrived at home and buried myself underneath the blankets). Is this because of a delay in the thermoregulatory mechanisms in getting my body back to temp, something to do with the spinal column, or both? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely is that the thermo receptors of the skin are not feeling the warmth yet because they are still deep in your skin. </p>
<p>And because if your core body temp is still slighlty below normal this lowers blood flow to your skin and keeps your periphery a little cooler than it normally would be.</p>
<p>Once your core body temp returns to normal it'll increase blood flow to your skin and the thermo receptors there will get more heat and you won't feel cold anymore. </p></div>		</li>
