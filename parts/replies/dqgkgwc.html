			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I'm nearly 50 and I get testosterone pellets (injections and creams aren't practical for me). I find that I don't get tired as easily when my T levels are higher, which is helpful considering my hobby (endurance Motorcycling). And my wife likes it a lot better when my T levels are higher as well. ;) Not sure about emotional changes, but I don't get angry or anything, but I do spend more time doing things and less time sitting in front of the TV. </p></div>		</li>
