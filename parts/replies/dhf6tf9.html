<p>This is where I'm standing right now. Will I ever be able to completely correct my posture to the point where I don't have to think about it anymore? It seems that I'm stuck right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, the biggest issue is time. Think about how much time you spent doing those things that caused poor posture in the first place. Your muscles get used to it and don't want to snap back the way they should be. So long as you're doing exercises/stretches to actually fix the imbalance issue, with enough time your muscles shouldn't reflexively pull out of proper posture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as someone who started the same journey several years ago, yes. It was physically uncomfortable in the beginning, but I pushed on and constantly thought about my posture until it became second nature. I now just put my shoulders back and down where they belong without actively thinking about it.</p>
<p>I secretly take a lot of pride in my posture. It's one of those things that feels way to pretentious to brag about, but I know the work I put into building the habit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the same way. I'm 6'3&quot; and my shoulders curve forward. I'm 25 years old and for about a year now I have actively thought about standing and sitting with correct posture. It feels good but odd to stand or sit right. But I hate that even after a year or so I have to remind myself throughout the day. I start wondering if I'll ever do it naturally. I started exercising a few months ago and the process is now easier at least. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. I've worked with dozens of folks to help get them more upright but it just &quot;feels wrong&quot;. The same goes for breathing using the abdominals and diaphragm. It's &quot;just wrong&quot;. Our bodies get used to doing things a certain way and that gets burned into us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Personally, I like &quot;squeeze a pencil with your shoulder blades and put it in your back pocket&quot; along with breathing deeply first into the belly before the ribs. Often the pelvis is rotated forward or backward on folks (and the shoulders may not be pulled forward) so there isn't a one-size-fits-all! Good luck either way, and remember there's a search function in reddit for way more info than I have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because your body is very adaptive. If you have had a bad posture for lets say 10 years, it wont mean that your body will be in pain for 10 years. Your body will adapt, certaib muscles that you never use will become inactive, other muscles will have to pick up the slack. This over time will create an imbalance. For example sitting in a chair a lot will shorten and tighten the hamstrings, this is an adaption.</p>
<p>Most people recommend doing deadlifts, but in my own gym I have yet to see a lifter properly activating their hamstrings and glutes during the deadlift. They mostly use their quads and lowerback during the first portion of thr movement... It puts a lot of stress on the lower back, the lowerback has to pick up the slack because they dont know how to activate their gluted and hams. This will most likely result in lowerback pain or injury for inexperienced lifters.</p></div>		</li>
