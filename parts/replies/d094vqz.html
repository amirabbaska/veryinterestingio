			<div class="markdown"><p>While it makes little difference for a five year old, what you are describing is more akin to (SQL) injection attack.</p>
<p>There are two major vulnerabilities that are used in various different attacks against web sites: Remote code execution and session hijacking.</p>
<p>As /u/SheHadToAsk described, remote code execution tricks the server into <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" target="_blank">executing specific computer commands</a> written by the attacker. Usually these commands are used to open further vulnerabilities on the server that the attacker then uses to gain direct access to it. Often these vulnerabilities are part of the custom applications running on the server, but every now and then these issues are found in widely used software that affects hundreds of thousands of systems. This is why the <a href="http://heartbleed.com/" target="_blank"><del>heartbleed bug</del></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug\)" target="_blank">shellshock</a> was such a big deal few years back. </p>
<p>However Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is not used for remote code execution. Instead XSS is usually used for session hijacking. In this case the attacker finds a way to embed their own (usually JavaScript) code on the web site. This could be done by using a vulnerability in the <em>Reddit comment formatting</em> for example. Once the script is injected on the web site the other users visiting the site will load <strong>and execute</strong> the script using their identity. For most users on Reddit the worst that could happen is forcing the users to upvote random posts as an example - however if the users had admin/moderator privileges on the site, the injected scripts could be used to do a lot more.</p>
<p>Edit: Noted the relevance of the hearbleed bug in remote code execution.</p>
<p>Edit2: Yikes. Sorry, got my bugs mixed. Shellshock instead of Heartbleed was the remote code execution vulnerability that was around a while back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is Code Injection - not XSS. Edit; /u/ doublehyphen points out that, technically - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hou0lU8WMgo" target="_blank">which is the best way to be correct</a> - XSS is a type of code injection. I meant to clarify XSS from more typically understood SQL injection - which is when you get a program to evaluate and run code in a place where it expects a data input. So, instead of submitting a password to a login page, you submit &quot;SELECT username, password FROM USERS WHERE userid = *&quot; and submit that, which, theoretically, would return the list of all usernames and passwords. Which would be bad. </p>
<p>XSS is when you get unauthorized scripts to run on a particular site. It is indeed a common method for breaking into websites. For instance, when a user is logged onto a webpage in a secure session, and javascript will pop a button labeled &quot;click me for free money&quot; onto the page with a script attached to it, and then the user will click the button. Since that button has been injected onto the page in a secure session, the script will run as if it is part of the page. This can be problematic, to say the least. For instance, &quot;transfer X amount of money to this account.&quot; Given that this request (putatively) will validate against an expected input, the system will execute it as if it is a valid request made by the user. </p>
<p>CSRF - or cross site request forgery - is when you get a website to trust you based on the site's trust of the user's browser, which has been authenticated. For instance, if during a session a secure token is placed in your browser's unprotected memory (e.g., session-store instead of an HTTP-only cookie) then javascript is run that simply takes the content of that token and attaches it to its requests, making it appear as if those requests are authenticated. A request like &quot;change my password to FOOBAR.&quot; Given that (putatively) all that is necessary to have the database run instructions from an API request is for that request to be authenticated with the content of the secure token, this might work.</p>
<p>Clever engineering can greatly reduce the effectiveness of the above, but an incompetent user can overcome even the most ingenious of engineering. And so this is why you should really let your parents know that all those toolbars they have installed are very, very dangerous - they are primary vectors for both XSS and CSRF. And even if the toolbars are not themselves malicious (a distinct possibility) the engineering of those toolbars may be so shitty that they are easier to hack than the rest of the browser, lowering the bar to entry for script kiddies. </p>
<p>ProTip: if your parents computer really has a ton of toolbars installed - just make sure they don't have eBanking. Seriously. Just easier to make sure that they themselves don't have access to their online bank accounts than risk them getting hacked. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you clarify a little bit on XSS please? Why the &quot;Cross-site&quot;? So the script that is doing the bad thing comes from a different site than does the website the user is actually on?</p>
<p>So in your example, where does the &quot;click for free money&quot; button come from? Not the iBank site, for sure!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That script could come from anywhere. For instance, you click on a link in a video you are watching on a pirate site telling you that your shockwave or flash is out of date, and it installs a browser utility when you impatiently click through a bunch of &quot;OK&quot; boxes to get to the latest episode of Vikings. </p>
<p>Then, that browser utility notices next time you are on citibank.com and attaches a script to the &quot;OK&quot; button on your check balance page, which initiates a transfer. </p>
<p>It is called &quot;Cross-site&quot; because you are executing scripts from <em>another author / site</em>. </p>
<p>That is just one possible vector. It could also come from a shitty email attachment, a piece of infected software - all sorts of places. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that is a good point actually. However, I think typically when people think of code injection they are thinking more like SQL injection, i.e., getting code to evaluate in places that expect data inputs. </p>
<p>XSS doesn't really work that way from what I understand - it is about running a script itself in an unauthorized environment. I suppose you are &quot;injecting&quot; the code into the browser - but to me that seems like a pretty big conceptual difference from the type of hack that is used SQL injection. </p>
<p>Either way I will clarify the above post. </p>

<p>Or installed it one way or another, yes. Your computer - <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2015/02/19/technology/security/lenovo-superfish/" target="_blank">usually</a> - doesn't ship with this stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's very interesting stuff.</p>
<p>We've had various clients use white-hat hacking companies to do various forms of testing on their sites.</p>
<p>Best ones we've seen are;</p>
<p>USB give-a-way: Pose as company just outside the main building and give out free sticks. Something like 60% of users went in and plugged them into their machines. Which is very bad, especially with the usbs that can kill your machine. Could be worse if the company didn't stop usbs from being run properly.</p>
<p>Email: this was another good one, they bought a domain called &quot;xxx-it.com&quot; where the xxx is the company's name. They sent an email to all their users and told them they were moving their email host and needed people to insert there username + passwords into a owa looking site. 85% hit rate on this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing that was really clever was using a mix of cyrillic and english letters when registering a lookalike domain.  The Russian A is a completely different character from the western A from the computer's perspective even if they look the same. Thus Аmazon.com and Amazon.com could resolve to different servers while both looking exactly the same in browser. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot more that goes into a pentest for a company. That will merely be a small note in the report.</p>
<p>There are multiple stages to a solid test and the testers will test success rates for multiple vectors, fishing, pretending to be a vendor, to get a foothold on the network. From this position they will then see how they can laterally move within the network. </p>
<p>You think it's obvious but it isn't. You'd think not clicking links in your email would be obvious too. It isn't, there's story after story of high value targets, including CEOs clicking links they shouldn't. The worst part is they were one of the few people who knew about the test going on. </p>
<p>There is a lot of value to someone coming in, documenting the problem, and putting numbers next to it indicating probability of success. It illustrates where your weakest spots are and where you need to focus for greatest improvement. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just plugging in the USB stick. They have to be able to stop any USB from being plugged into the servers or machines. What if one of their users decides to turn malicious? - So now they have software which only allows certain hardware to be plugged in and ran. </p></div>		</li>
