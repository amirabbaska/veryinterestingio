			<p>While it makes little difference for a five year old, what you are describing is more akin to (SQL) injection attack.<br><br>There are two major vulnerabilities that are used in various different attacks against web sites: Remote code execution and session hijacking.<br><br>As /u/SheHadToAsk described, remote code execution tricks the server into <a href="https://xkcd.com/327/" target="_blank">executing specific computer commands</a> written by the attacker. Usually these commands are used to open further vulnerabilities on the server that the attacker then uses to gain direct access to it. Often these vulnerabilities are part of the custom applications running on the server, but every now and then these issues are found in widely used software that affects hundreds of thousands of systems. This is why the <a href="http://heartbleed.com/" target="_blank"><del>heartbleed bug</del></a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug\)" target="_blank">shellshock</a> was such a big deal few years back. <br><br>However Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is not used for remote code execution. Instead XSS is usually used for session hijacking. In this case the attacker finds a way to embed their own (usually JavaScript) code on the web site. This could be done by using a vulnerability in the <em>Reddit comment formatting</em> for example. Once the script is injected on the web site the other users visiting the site will load <strong>and execute</strong> the script using their identity. For most users on Reddit the worst that could happen is forcing the users to upvote random posts as an example - however if the users had admin/moderator privileges on the site, the injected scripts could be used to do a lot more.<br><br>Edit: Noted the relevance of the hearbleed bug in remote code execution.<br><br>Edit2: Yikes. Sorry, got my bugs mixed. Shellshock instead of Heartbleed was the remote code execution vulnerability that was around a while back.</p>		</li>

			<p>A minor clarification: your post can be read to imply that heartbleed was a remote code execution vulnerability, it was not. Heartbleed &quot;only&quot; made it possible to read sensitive data from the memory of the attacked computer.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for pointing that out! Completely mixed my bugs. Shellshock was the one I was thinking of.</p>		</li>

			<p>While most remote exploits are incredibly technical and hard to explain, Heartbleed turned out to be dead simple. There's an <a href="https://xkcd.com/1354/" target="_blank">XKCD comic</a> that explains it beautifully.</p>		</li>

			<p>There used to be a self-retweeting XSS on twitter (tweetdeck) once.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;When you hear of big hacks targeting some corporation or government entity it is most often done through social engineering. That basically means you talk your way in. In practice it could mean that you get someone at the company to use a usb stick with your malicious code on it or something as simple as calling and pretending you're the CEO asking for the password<br><br>Don't forget spearphishing. My company, a midsize aerospace/telecom manufacturer, got hit with a spear phishing attack a few years ago. An email that appeared to be from the IEEE was sent to several specific people in our engineering department. The email contained an attached PDF containing the map and schedule for a trade show(and also a virus). We didn't catch the virus for several months(our IT department didn't catch it at all, the FBI actually contacted us to let us know they suspected it) and by then our drawings were stolen.   <br><br>New York Times got hacked by the Chinese Government in a similar fashion. <br></p>		</li>
