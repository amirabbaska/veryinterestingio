			<div class="markdown"><p>The facts /u/Sylwong described absolutely suggest that genetics are not the primary determining factor for height throughout most of human history. You can see this most vividly in China, where grampa grew up under the warlord era and is 5' or less and their grandkids grew up after Deng and are 6' or higher. </p>
<p>Ceteris paribus, sure, genetics are the primary factor. The environment is everything you're holding constant with that ceteris paribus, however. The United States and studies based in it and western Europe are outliers where essentially unlimited fetal and neonatal nutrition can be assumed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People really don't like those studies I've found, it goes against their preconceived notions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point this person is making is that all this twins went to screened families through an adoption agency. They donâ€™t represent a random environment or even a random slice of America. All these families were decently well off, wanted children, and we can assume they provided adequate nutrition along with clothing and shelter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah... also when everyone's on ad-lib diet, they're going to eat differently because of genetics, which doesn't mean the effects aren't because of the diet.</p></div>		</li>
