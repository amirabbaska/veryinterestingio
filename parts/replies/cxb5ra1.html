			<div class="markdown"><p>Physician here, this is the correct answer.</p>
<p>Dr. Oz does however give out advice from time to time, but it's always mixed in with enough common sense to where you would need to prove all other suggestions failed before you could call him a fraud. Essentially mixing 3 parts modern medicine with 1 part questionable snake oil salesman.</p>
<p>If you want to lose weight I would hypothetically say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you're getting enough high fiber foods in your diet and minimizing high fat, high salt foods</li>
<li>Make sure you get plenty of exercise, at least 30-60 minutes daily</li>
<li>Reduce your stress level and get plenty of sleep </li>
<li>Try this tameral bark tinture, it's shown in at least 1 study to help participants lose 10 lbs per month</li>
</ul>
<p>You didn't lose weight just by buying that fake product at the supermarket? That's just because you didn't complete all 4 steps.</p>
<p>Edit: woke up to 52 messages in my inbox. So let me clarify a few things: the above is a hypothetical argument to be made showing the non-sequitur logical fallacy (where the conclusion of &quot;take this&quot; doesn't follow from the common sense premises). Second, there is no such product as &quot;tameral bark tincture&quot; (it's even spelled incorrectly), I don't recommend trying to invent it or purchase it if does exist.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit2: fallacious fallacy</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's actually a telegraph from Dr. Oz indicating that he <em>knows</em> it's bullshit. He consistently and carefully shields himself with this second-hand talk, with such consistency that it could not be a coincidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the ire he gains is less for being the salesman himself, it's more for giving the snake-oil sales teams uncontested air on his nationally broadcast program.</p>
<p>I'd compare him to Jerry Springer, but I don't think Springer ever tried to hide the fact that his guests were lunatics and he actually provided counter-examples when people made claims on his show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had some friends doing the HCG diet. It sounded like snake oil to me, so I started looking into it, looking for something to support my skepticism. </p>
<p>I watched the Dr. Oz segment, and I could tell he didn't believe in HCG. In my mind, he debunked it. But now that I'm reading the comments here, I wonder if a lot of people watched that same segment and thought he was promoting it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honest question, how often do you use medicine to help people loose weight in your profession?(mainly out of curiosity here)</p>
<p>As a 24 year old guy who since 2 weeks for the first time bothered to loose weight I honestly don't see why you would need to do more than &quot;eat less, move more.&quot;</p>
<p>Lost 8 pounds in 2 weeks simply by doing just that. In another 2 weeks I'll be back where I'm supposed to be(want to loose another 5 or so)</p>
<p>I mean I don't use the healthy way to loose weight here probably but it gets me there in a damn hurry.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You get people like Stephan Hawking, who without a doubt is a brilliant theoretical physicists, who is discussing about stuff like AI. Or you have Neil degrasse tyson, an astrophysicist, lecturing about environmentalism.</p>
<p>Not that there's anything wrong with taking an interest in areas outside your primary field of study of course, just you can't expect everyone to be right about everything just because they know a lot about some things </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, as soon as I posted this, I realized that there are reasonable variations.  For example, Noam Chomsky is a linguist.  But he's also a political writer, even though his PhD was not in political scientist.  Yet in his case, he's brilliant at that subject, too.  Even if you disagree with his summations (many do), no one can fault him for his citing of facts - and when presented, he usually makes pretty damning cases for stuff.</p>
<p>Critics of Chomsky, eg George Will, have said things like, &quot;He's just a linguist&quot; to refute Noam's claims of X.</p>
<p>tl;dr - I just argued against my own case sorta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sock here, this is the correct answer.</p>
<p>Being familiar with both feet and dryer lint I can say with certainty that eating dryer lint can help cure your itchy feet.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you're thoroughly washing your feet on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Change your socks daily as well as after any exercise.</li>
<li>Use medicated powders, lotions or sprays to coat the itchy are.</li>
<li>Eat dryer lint, it's shown in at least 1 study to help participants stop having itchy feet.</li>
