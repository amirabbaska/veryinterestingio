			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great response. Also, in clinical practice, what kind of strong opioid you prescribe really depends on patient-specific factors.</p>
<p>Patient has renal failure? Rather go for hydromorphone.</p>
<p>Patient has hepatic impairment? Oxymorphone and tramadol are contraindicated, better try Oxycodone with careful monitoring and dose reduction.</p>
<p>Patient needs very fast acting analgetics for sharp pain spikes? Fentanyl sublingually or intranasally works best most of the time.</p>
<p>Patient can't swallow, but has outpatient care? Fentanyl or buprenorphine TTS (transdermal application system) is great to use.</p>
<p>Cost a concern? Just give morphine and laxative of your choice.</p>
<p>Cost no concern? Prescribe Targin (oxycodone / naloxone), because it's usually tolerated best in our clinical experience.</p>
<p>Patient has a strong neuropathic component to the pain? Use tapentadol (or add coanalgetics like pregabaline, gabapentine, amitriptyline...)</p>
<p>Edit: Also it's great to have some alternatives in case a patient develops high tolerance to one strong opioid before needing to switch to much harder to adjust and monitor stuff like methadone or added ketamine. Already needs 4000 mg of morphine equivalent in fentanyl (known for fast development of tolerance compared to other strong opioids)? Try hydromorphone (or others) and usually you can cut that dose significantly.</p></div>		</li>
