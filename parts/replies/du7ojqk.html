			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought (based on what a friend told me) that maybe they make like significantly better rice or something, but if it's really that simple I doubt I will invest in one since I do not cook rice that often. Thank you for your input.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While cooking rice is simple, it’s also tricky for a lot of people to get right/consistent. I am an experienced home cook and find the rice cooker to be really helpful in getting consistent results across different rice varieties (basmati, jasmine, sushi, medium grain etc.) I am picky about rice (can’t stand when it’s mushy), so the consistency aspect of the rice cooker is the biggest appeal for me. </p>
<p>It is also nice to have for those nights where you’re cooking several recipes simultaneously, because you can set it and forget it. </p>
<p>I’d recommend trying to make rice a few times on the stove and only getting a rice cooker if you’re not pleased w the results. </p>
<p>One other consideration-if you like brown rice best, I actually like the oven method or pressure cooker method the best.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The biggest advantage to a rice cooker, is that it tuns itself off when the rice is done cooking.  It does this because as the water boils and gets absorbed by the rice, the maximum temperature can get higher than the boiling point.  when the cooker senses this, it knows the rice is done and turns off.  You don't need to set a timer, or worry about the heat level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What cooker does this? As far as i know, the cheaper brand have an automatic timer that sets itself to &quot;keep warm&quot; after the timer it's done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't that simple.</p>
<p>Rice cooker rice is perfect everytime, and it's perfectly steamed. Boiling it creates soggy, softish rice even if you take it off the stove at the right time.</p>
<p>Get a rice cooker. They're cheap.</p>
<p>The nicer ones even have a try for you to steam things at the same time.</p></div>		</li>
