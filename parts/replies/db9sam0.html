			<div class="markdown"><p>The Journal of Neuroscience is free to all members of the Society for Neuroscience, who support its publication, and COMPLETELY open access after 6 months. This is necessary because the subscriptions subsidize the enormous editorial effort it takes to process almost 5000 manuscript submissions a year, which go through quality control, editorial handling, peer review, copyediting, typesetting, and then archiving and curating. From the outside, this seems like it should be super-easy and cheap, but instead it takes paid effort from a number of full time employees, and a large group of working scientists who get an honorarium for their many, many hours of labor. Fully open access journals are much more expensive to publish in than the Journal of Neuroscience, because none of those costs are subsidized by subscriptions. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I wasn't aware of that, I appreciate it, thanks.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Conferences often get over 1000 submissions (and submitting to a conference is typically free).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Why not giving some LaTeX/Word/etc. templates to the authors and stating that they are responsible for the formatting?</p>
<p>I agree that peer review is a time-consuming but reviewers typically work for free.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Not necessarily, e.g. it is free to publish in the Journal of Machine Learning Research (which is one of the top venues for machine learning)</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure if &quot;subsidized&quot; is the right term when <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/31605/452" target="_blank">publishers such as Elsevier make profit margins over 40%</a>. But maybe your journal is different. Do you publish your journal's budget?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to be rude at all here, but I am going to guess you are not a working scientist (or at least you might be in a very different field). Most neuroscience or similar types of conferences cost several hundred dollars to present at. (Often the fee to submit a presentation is pretty small, but in order to present you have to register to attend in general, and often in order to register you must join the professional society sponsoring the conference. Attendance + membership can be a few hundred dollars each, often times... though typically significantly less for students.)</p>
<p>Reviewers typically work for free but editors (often) don't. Someone has to coordinate and adjudicate between all those peer reviews... it isn't just a free-for-all. And we aren't just talking about LaTeX or Word-template level stuff... major journals are published professionally, like books or magazines, using actual publishing software that requires training to use.</p>
<p>It sounds like you might be in computer science, which does tend to do things a bit differently than the biological/social sciences. Not saying one is better than the other, but there are a lot of things that probably make peer review a bit trickier in bio/social science than computer science. For example, peer review... if you have a new algorithm to show off, you might just be able to make your code and input data available and then anyone can replicate your result. Whereas with biology, it might take thousands of dollars for someone to replicate your result and prove that you're doing everything correctly and telling the truth, so instead we invest some effort on the editorial side to try to get experts to look at what you said (and the figures you provided) to try to sniff out anything incorrect or fishy. That doesn't come cheap.</p>
<p>Also, FWIW -- no idea what the journal budget is, but FYI Society for Neuroscience is a non-profit organization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question that comes up frequently and so I thought I would try to correct some common misconceptions; however, it would be great if our guest could provide her far greater experience.</p>
<p>Simply put, it costs money to make a journal. You need to pay people to prepare a manuscript for proper journal formatting. You need to pay for technical support. In the old days you had to actually print the journal, which is slowly going away but you can access special issues and things like that still in print. You need to host papers for access in a database which is not free to maintain. This stuff is not free and the US federal government, for example, does not typically provide funding support for those things. So journals have different ways of making money. One is to charge for pages or total content or some other metric like that. That comes directly from the authors and can be hundreds or thousands of dollars. One is to sell subscriptions. Some journals freely provide access to their articles and some journals provide no page charge. However, at the end of the day, it's not free and can never be free; if you go to some kind of public access system then the taxpayers are still paying for that system. </p>
<p>I agree that there are definitely lots of concerns in academia about the publication funding model and I think there are a lot of valid criticisms. For example, that academic reviewers do not get paid for their labor. However, someone else reviews their papers and so it's not quite an equivalent argument about labor costs though I still understand the point. </p>
<p>Anyway, I contend that the claim that universities &quot;waste&quot; money on journal subscriptions is not as simple as the authors/reviewers not receiving that money and the taxpayers funding that. Taxpayers fund the research but in a very real sense they do not fund the publications and hosting aspect of that at all. That's not a claim about the taxpayers actively doing something against that system, that's simply how the system is set up now. Data hosting for public access is another criticism that comes up here a lot and as someone who does development work for my collaboration's cyber-infrastructure efforts, it costs time and people and therefore money to do those things, and while organizations like the National Science Foundation are improving their levels of funding to those kinds of efforts, it's no where near an ideal amount to have the free access to everything people should.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People preparing manuscripts are often a bunch of <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/81625/452#comment202390_81625" target="_blank">underpaid subcontractors</a> (India is a common  location). Besides, many authors are fine doing the formatting, as it is commonly done for conferences (e.g., some LaTeX template is given, and the authors just  follow it).</p>
<blockquote>

<p>That is really cheap nowadays. I'm not saying it is free, but it should represent less than 1% of the journal subscription fees.</p>
<hr />
<p>It is no wonder why <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/q/31605/452" target="_blank">publishers have huge profit margins</a>, e.g.  Elsevier's reported margins are 37%, but financial analysts estimate them at 40â€“50% for the STM publishing division before tax. (Nature says that it will not disclose information on margins.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Conferences proceedings aren't the same as journals. And even with templates, journals will often still need to do some leg of the formatting work to get the manuscript from reasonably conforming to its actual style guide.</p>

<p>A conversation on stackexchange without sources isn't a source.</p>
<p>These are businesses and of course they are going to try to gain profits. Like I said, a true public access system does not exist. So I understand why it's easy to put the blame on these costs on publishers, which keep in mind the editor in chief likely has little to no say in, at the moment there isn't a viable alternative. I fully believe we should be going to that model. If the government funds research, it should fund the whole record of that research. But then perhaps some concern should be directed at the government to fulfill that mandate, not at private companies. </p>
<p>As a related aside: plenty of programming languages also cost a decent amount in terms of getting individual, department, or university site licenses. The companies that make those are private, and just like paying for any other tool that goes into a lab, I believe that money should be available to pay for those research tools. The companies are free to offer the languages at whatever cost they want in order to be competitive, just like some company making a piece of equipment is free to do the same. You can get angry that the company is making a ton of profit off of that but if the tool is not offered elsewhere then it's very idealistic to say it should be given for free because of the impact on the research process. And there are plenty of cases where government entities/labs do in fact offer their tools for free, in which case one doesn't need to pay for an equivalent.</p></div>		</li>
