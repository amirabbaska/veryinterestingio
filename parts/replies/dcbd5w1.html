<p>A big example of this is how credit ratings agencies (S&amp;P, Moody's, etc) knowingly rated financial instruments</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think negligent is the word rather than knowingly.  Rating agencies and investment banks used <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/04/in_defense_of_copula" target="_blank">gaussian copula models</a> without thinking through the risks they were ignoring.  From the article I linked to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can have the most complicated and complete model in the world to explain asset correlation, but if you calibrate it assuming housing prices won't fall on a national level, the model cannot hedge you against that happening. (...) Rating agencies should have known better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You really can't prosecute someone for misunderstanding a financial model.  None of the spreadsheet weenies ever thought that mortgages across the country were systematically inflated and at risk of collective default.  I use similar math on a daily basis (although not for banking or finance), and often don't think through the theoretical underpinnings or weaknesses of the models that I'm using.  It's often brilliant mathematicians that come up with these models (in an academic paper), and practitioners that apply them (in the real world).  There can be quite a disconnect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Math is really, really, hard.  It wasn't intentional.  If any of the rating agencies understood the risks they were ignoring, none of this would've happened.  No one expected that rating agencies were the final backstop against the waves of fraud, greed, and irrational exuberance that underpinned this crisis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everybody was buying expensive real estate they couldn't afford (average Joe's irrational exuberance)</li>
<li>Local banks and mortgage brokers were lying through their teeth on mortgage applications (fraud), so Joe could buy more home than he can afford.</li>
<li>Banks were packaging up garbage mortgages into bonds and selling them on the open market (greed).</li>
<li>Rating agencies underestimated the risks of the bonds (bad math)</li>
<li>Companies and investors (including your 401K) purchased bonds in order to get a stable returns, since real estate never goes down (right!?).</li>

<p>We kind of already do, as much as we can, anyway.</p>
<p>The problem is there's 3 kinds of misuse:</p>
<p>intentional (illegal already)</p>
<p>unintentional &quot;oops&quot;</p>
<p>unintentional, but unreasonably stupid (also illegal)</p>
<p>Drawing a firm line between 2 and 3 is really, really hard. It's impossible to build models that don't have some level of assumptions in them.</p>
<p>It's not really fair to send some guy to jail because he did his best and thought there was a 1% chance to fuck up, but it was really 5%. Plus not many people are going to do that job and basically sign up to be a scapegoat. (and sending them to jail isn't going to send a message, because they didn't do it intentionally, it's just a hard job)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep... about what I'd expect from trying to add facts to this discussion.  Come back when you google what LIBOR is (hint, it isn't a company and belongs to the Bank of England, which is a government entity).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also from that report, AG Holder clarifying the statement you cited: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let me make something real clear right away. I made a statement in a Senate hearing that I think has been misconstrued. I said it was difficult at times to bring cases against large financial institutions because of the potential consequences that they would have on the financial system. Now there are a number of factors that we have to take into
consideration as we decide who weâ€™re going to prosecute. Innocent
people can be impacted by a prosecution brought of a financial
institution or any corporation. But let me be very, very, very clear. Banks are not too big to jail. If we find a bank or a financial institution that has done something wrong, if we can prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, those cases will be brought.</p>
