<p>but never bio-degrade</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It depends on the plastic, but yeah, most do not. There are organisms that can eat some plastics, and we could probably genetically engineer more (I think this has already been done, actually), but one of the things that makes plastic so useful is that it doesn't biodegrade. The big problem in my opinion is that we use materials that are made to last an incredibly long time in disposable objects. We should have systems set up for recycling plastics that don't bio degrade, or that naturally degrade to unsafe forms. We should have biodegradable plastics for disposable applications like packaging and food wrappers.</p>
<p>We already have the technology to do this, but economics drives the current solution. We'd need regulations and/or taxes to shift the economic balance. We'd pay a few cents more for things like plastic plates and plastic-wrapped food, but we'd have clean oceans and less-toxic landfills.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is 100% spot on.   PLA plastic is good enough for replacing a wide range of disposable plastics( ever seen compostable plastic forks and  cups?) But it's like 1c more expensive so it doesn't get used.  We need tax incentives!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PLA has a hard time biodegrading at ambient temperatures though, because it relies on hydrolysis happening first. It biodegrades well in industrial composting facilities, but very slow in soil or home composting and not at all in the sea. PLA also lacks properties like impact strength and temperature resistance. PHA is very interesting though, because it biodegrades in almost all environments. It is not very stable polymer though, which makes it tough to process in conventional plastic machinery (low thermal degradation temperature). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most estimates ignore the massive, hard to grasp, variability of bacteria and fungi. There is already at least one fungus that can digest some plastic. Once a bacterium evolves that can do it, it’ll turn up in a plasmid and then conquer every part of the planet where there is plastic to be ‘eaten’. Given the ubiquitous nature of plastic these days, this is liable to happen in a few decades or at most a couple of hundred years; the likelihood that nothing will evolve to take advantage of this unimaginably large food resource is preposterous- it will not require pure chemical degradation over thousands of years to rid us of environmental plastic at least not without biological chemistry).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a lot of plastic in the world doesn't mean that plastic-digesting ability will show up in bacteria faster. It just means that once that mutation does occur, it will likely be very beneficial.</p>
<p>Look at the Carboniferous period - it's a span of about 60 <strong>million</strong> years where trees (and other plants) died and just built up on the forest floor because no microbes had evolved yet with the ability to digest their tough lignin and cellulose compounds.</p>
<p>The whole reason we have coal deposits to mine is because there was millions of years of plant material being buried and squashed into coal since it took so very, very long for lignin- and cellulose-digesting mutations to pop up in bacteria. Mutations appear at random, no matter how much untapped potential food sources are around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see your point but it would speed the dissemination of a beneficial mutation by making it super-beneficial, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>The time to event for the actual mutation may not be affected, but the time to ecological saturation by the mutant variant likely is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is already an enzyme produced by some sort of bacteria that I believe was found in a landfill in Asia (I want to say Japan but I'm not 100% sure) that can consume plastic. I remember hearing about it because scientists looked at the folding structure and figured out a more efficient version that could do the same job.</p></div>		</li>
