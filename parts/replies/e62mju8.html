			<div class="markdown"><p>Nucleation (crystals initially forming) require molecules to meet and collide. That is far more likely to happen at higher supersaturations (i.e. when there are a lot more of them).</p>
<p>When there is low supersaturation, molecules are likely to meet crystals that have already formed, not other molecules. Hence, growth is favoured over nucleation.</p>
<p>That is a grossly simplified explanation, but it should be digestible to most people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interesting question, to me, is why this is a grossly simplified explanation. It seems naively, from the intuitive picture, that this is how it ought to work, and I'm curious what the complications are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nucleation isn't fully understood, but perhaps you can think about this gross simplification: it can be easier for a single molecule to incorporate into an existing crystal than for a collection of molecules to come together and assume the correct configuration to start a new crystal.  The latter becomes much more likely when there are a lot of molecules around (higher concentration).</p>
<p>Both nucleation rate and growth rate increase with increasing supersaturation, but the growth rate has an approximately linear dependence on supersaturation while nucleation rate has an steeper dependence (closer to exponential).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, if the saturation is low, the need to form crystals (i'm not 100% certain, but i think this has partly to do with energy levels in the solution. Don't quote me on this.) is lower.<br />
So, if the solution is very saturated, you will get many nucleation sites, all forming crystals at the same time. After a while, they will reach eachother, and you'll get more of a thick layer of salt at the bottom.  </p>
<p>If the saturation is lower, you might only get few, or even a single nucleation site. It's easier for the atoms to arrange themselves in an existing grid, than it is to randomly bump into another atom in the exact correct way to make the initial bond.   </p>
<p>Further, due to how osmosis works, you are going to have a constant stream of atoms moving towards the crystal, since the area just around the crystal will have fewer chlorine and sodium atoms in it, because they are arranging into the crystal.  </p>
<p>Finally, it's more likely that the crystal forms at the bottom since you will have more rough surfaces there to &quot;catch&quot; atoms. To say nothing of the fact that a long, plastic cylinder likely has a small static charge to begin with.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your answer! I tested your statement at the end of your comment.
I did this by boiling salt water till it evaporated. When all the water was gone only a very thin layer of salt remained. This proves your statement about slow evaporating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm slightly confused. You just stated that low supersaturation favors growth then said that that's why the slow evaporation resulted in many small crystals cause fewer of them were able to grow larger. This sounds like a contradiction to me. It could also be that I'm missing something. Do you mind clarifying?</p></div>		</li>
