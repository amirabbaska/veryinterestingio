<p>If <strong>the Fed sells a lot of bonds</strong>, the supply of bonds will increase, and the price of them will drop. This means that in order for <strong>the Federal government to issue new bonds</strong>, they have to have a higher return.</p>

<p>Can you clarify whether these two phrases are referring to the same bonds, or different bonds?  I believe the federal government is a separate entity, which issues separate bonds from the ones the Fed sells.  However, you left that ambiguous in your comment and I want to be sure I know what you meant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's really responsive to OP's question, which in my mind is pretty clearly targeted at the production of physical coins/bills.</p>
<p>But even if OP really is asking about the money supply, I'm not sure this is an adequate answer. Yes, inflation is related to the rate at which the money supply increases, and yes, the Fed attempts to control inflation by mucking about with interest rates and OMOs. But money isn't really <em>created</em> that way. It's created as a secondary effect of OMOs as they propagate throughout the economy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the usual creation of 'money' occurs specifically when the Fed buys securities and credits a dealer's reserve account, but this magic expansion of reserves doesn't necessarily lead to creation of <em>money</em> as it's conventionally understood absent a suitable transmission mechanism (stimulating reserve-constrained lending and endogenous credit expansion), hence the metaphor of 'pushing on a string'</p></div>		</li>
