			<div class="markdown"><p>More like sponsoring. It's called &quot;staking&quot; and its how most pros pay their entry into major tourneys. They'll &quot;sponsor&quot; or &quot;stake&quot; a percentage of the entry fee (or fees since they're usually grouped over a few tournaments unless it's a really big one) and the person who bought the stake gets a set percentage if they win.  I've done it a few times for a friend of mine. I've bought 5% and stuff,  not a major investment but I'm net positive now because he won his first tour ring while I was in. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The term here is called chopping.  It's not unusual for players to negotiate the winnings available to lower their swing, the randomness, of the tournament outcome.</p>
<p>For example, Adam, Betty and Charles are the final three players in a 30 person tourney.  That's great, right?  A, B and C are going to be in the money at the end the night.  What happens is that they might agree to split a portion or all of the prize pool, normally roughly based on their chip counts. Ok, let's say top prize is $1000, second is $500 and third is $300.  And let's say Adam has the most chips, 10000. Betty has 5000 and Charles has 4000.  They agree for a full chop.  Therefore Adam gets about half of the total sum winnings available, uh, around $850.  Betty takes $425 and Charles gets $325.  (Please excuse, on mobile, can't exact math).</p>
<p>Why would they do this?</p>
<p>It's to lower the swing of outcomes.  All players benefit when they have a more predictable outcome.  Adam should probably win but he's better off with a slightly smaller but more consistent take home.  Same with Betty and even Charles.</p>
<p>Why not just &quot;go for it!&quot;? It's poker, let's gamble!</p>
<p>Well, if you can lower the swing of outcomes, you'll have a more consistent return.  Better to have some money all of the time than lots of money a little of the time and little money most of the time.  There's some fancy math behind but it has to do with managing your bankroll.</p>
<p>TL DR:. Chopping for better EV. (Inside joke, poker peeps will get it)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I chopped the big monthly in Tunica last year where I got first place. I had 40% of the chips in play with 4 players left, and I could've played it out for $22k, but I took $16k (over a grand more than second place money) because that's a hell of a lot better than a couple of bad beats and I'm out with $7k.</p></div>		</li>
