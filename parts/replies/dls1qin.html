			<div class="markdown"><p>Never pop a blister. It may be tempting, but, always leave it alone. Popping a blister is just opening it up to infection, scaring, and increased healing time. Leave blisters alone!!! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that if the blister is in a position that it will pop NO MATTER WHAT (on the bottom of your foot, or a part of your hand that's getting more wear than usual), you should try to pop it as cleanly as possible, because it runs the risk of being ruptured/torn off unintentionally, which will leave a giant open sore with very little protection over it, making your risk higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. Lancing a blister slows healing and leaves you wide open to infection, increasing the likelihood of scarring.</p>
<p>That said, I have done it in the past as a field-expedient just to get home-- sometimes if you're on a long hike, you have to pop them to get your boots back on. You just deal with the downsides once you're back to the car.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation would be a good example of what OP is asking about. If your clotting cascade runs rampant, then you can use up all of your clotting factors and not be able to respond to a secondary trauma that is in need of hemostasis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm almost 100% sure DIC is caused by exposure to tissue factor which is not usually seen in circulation and excess thrombin. </p>
<p>Plus if you used up all of your clotting factors you wouldn't clot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I worded it weirdly. I said that using up all of the clotting factors in DIC  (primary trauma) makes a patient unable to respond to a secondary trauma that would need those platelets/clotting factors. I'm specifically referring to the thrombocytopenia associated with DIC and how it affects a patient's ability to respond to hemorrhage. As for the primary cause of DIC I think there's a million ways that it can happen  (sepsis, trauma, immune hyperactivation, etc etc), but yeah pretty much all of those expose the circulation to tissue factor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This i not strictly true. </p>
<p>During inflammation or an immune response only a small number of immune cells actually go to the site of infection. However, they can self replicate (which takes about 12 hours) so 1 becomes 2 (after 12 hours), 2 then become 4... 4 become 8 etc. So in a week this can get to 20,000 immune cells which can deal with infection. This is why the adaptive immune system isn't always in use, as the innate immune system could have destroyed the infection before the adaptive immune response has time to build it's army of cells.</p>
<p>Also the two infections might not be the same bacteria. There are thought to be 100 million diffferent bacteria cells the immune system can detect, all of which are different. </p></div>		</li>
