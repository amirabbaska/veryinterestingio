			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for that explanation! I always find it unrealistic that they don’t show the bleeding when they pull out the IVs. Shouldn’t be that hard to show a little bit of blood. And damn, it must hurt so bad to pull an IV out. </p>
<p>But yeah, now my biggest fear is to be in a coma while an apocalypse starts. Who’s gonna deflate my throat balloon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn. But I can live with pain down there, but I guess I can’t live with severe trauma to my throat. With all that breathing and stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never had an IV in myself, but most of my patients say taking the tape/dressing off is more painful because hair pulling, and for removal of the actual IV they report just a feeling of discomfort rather than pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I routinely need of medication, pull8ng an IV out wouldn't be impossible but they are taped in quite well plus it would bleed a bit,.. as for a catheter I can't say...  what I see in movies seems far fetched although I did once witness a fella yank out his IV and try to take off... so it isn't entirely out of the question. That being said,  He bled like a stuck pig and was promptly  returned to his bed by security .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Catheters are more uncomfortable than painful if put in/ pulled out correctly. Something's being shoved up your penis. It doesn't feel great.</p>
<p>By uncomfortable I mean you grip the bed and moan, but you ain't feeling pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so let's say I'm cathed and tubed and I wake up in an empty hospital. I could live with a tube in my urinary tract for a few minutes, but how would I get the breathing tube out of me? Is there a deflate button?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can yank the tube out, but it'll hurt like hell and feel like you swallowed glass for a few days. My MIL did this several times while heavily sedated with pneumonia. They don't just pull it out, it would have to be deflated and then pulled out in such a way it doesn't damage your throat or lungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way. There's a one way valve with a thinner flexible tube leading to the cuff alongside the intubation tube. You could just cut that off, or ideally find a syringe and deflate it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My late grandfather had a horrible fear of hospitals and unfortunately kept being hospitalized in his old age.  I heard stories of when he was younger they would have to strap him to the hospital bed and even then he would try to escape with the whole bed on his back. His chart was tagged with &quot;RUNNER&quot; and they put a red sock on him to they'd know. Anyway near the time of his passing he would more than once, remove his IV and Catheter as describe in the OP.  He would end up having tobe hospitalized longer because of the trauma he caused. </p></div>		</li>
