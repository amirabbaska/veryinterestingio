			<div class="markdown"><p>Do drugs like Xanax or being high (marijuana) recreate this sort of benefit? I ask because anxiety is something I deal with and those two methods are pretty much the only way I can &quot;zone out&quot;. However, I do wonder if the brain receives the same benefit from the drug based approach (I doubt it but still want to know).</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Marijuana is legal where I live and does not seem to increase my anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in CO where MJ is legal, and it doesn't help my anxiety, but ymmv.  </p>
<p>I take Citalopram (Celexa) for clinical anxiety, and it isn't the same as meditation.  Anxiety is like the feeling of going up a rollercoaster, except you never reach the top.  Medicating clinical anxiety returns you to a more &quot;normal&quot; state, but your brain is still actively working.  Meditation is the act of wholly thinking about a simple concept (the classic ones are focusing on your breathing or contemplating a rock), or simply blanking your mind.  There are a lot of different methods. </p>
<p>I am not an expert of meditation, by any means, but it is something I practice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also live in Colorado, and I have to say, you know, i smoke weed recreationally, and i love it, but it doesn't really do much for me medically (pain relief, anxiety, etc), and I'm getting <strong>really</strong> tired of people trying to jam it down my throat as some magic cure-all. </p>
<p>Bipolar? HAVE YOU TRIED SMOKING WEED?!</p>
<p>Joints hurt? HAVE YOU TRIED SMOKING WEED?!</p>
<p>Anxious? HAVE YOU TRIED SMOKING WEED?!</p>
<p>And so on, for what seems like every possible complaint i could ever have. Goddamn, calm down. It's marijuana, not magic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you or any other ppl replying, tried high CBD strain? I live in non legal state, so I can't get my hands on high cbds but thats the one thing I really really REALLY wanna try before putting up the weed stuff altogether. Regular strains just cause hellish nightmareish paranoia for me. I wanna see if high cbds can help with anxiety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meditation and spacing out are actually quite opposite activities.</p>
<p>Spacing out occurs when the person is functioning on &quot;standby&quot; and allows the mind to wander. Conversely, meditation typically involves some form of mindful awareness within the present moment (whether of breathing, feelings of relaxation, or something else). </p>
<p>Just a clarification I thought was important to make. :)</p>
<p>Edit: clarified first sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>meditation doesn't need a focal point. it's just easier to clear your mind of all but thinking of breathing. much harder to clear your mind of all thoughts. a focal point helps.</p>
<p>though I am not sure if you are talking about a different meditation practice than I am</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah they're definitely opposites. In meditation you want to be aware of things while zoning out you aren't aware of anything and just get lost in your thoughts. Meditation requires focus. It's sort of like exercise for your brain while zoning out is like letting your brain take a nap.</p>
<p>From the article itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress.</p>
