			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, a prion is an improperly-folded protein that the body can't beak down.<br />
Protein mis-folds happen all the time, but the body has a lot of very effective methods of weeding these out. In order for a prion disease to happen, the mis-folded protein needs to survive being broken down, and also has to be a particular kind of protein that's actually harmful. A lot of them are inert.<br />
If one of these bad prions gets into your brain, it's toxic to the surrounding nervous tissue and kills it, which causes the body to clear away the dead cells. But it can't actually remove the bad protein, so it just floats around aimlessly leaving holes in your brain.<br />
It's different from a virus or bacteria, in that it has no autonomy. It's not alive. It's literally just a fucked up protein. It can't direct itself in any way, so it just sort of floats around bumping into stuff and being a problem.<br />
It's possible you even have a dangerous prion floating around somewhere else in your body that hasn't, and possibly never will, migrate to your brain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going off of an undergrad biopsych class from several years ago so forgive me if this is a stupid question, my understanding is that proteins are generally too large to pass the blood brain barrier, is there something different about prions that let's them get through?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any misfolded proteins =/= a prion. Prions are one specific type of protein that is naturally found on/in neurons that has misfolded. All cells have proteins as part of their structure, so this protein is already across the barrier.</p>
<p>You're correct most proteins don't pass through the blood brain barrier. Although rare instances can happen, hence the small likelihood of ingested prions &quot;infecting&quot; a person. More commonly the proteins randomly mutate to be misfolded, so no barrier-crossing required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chemical mechanics of prions are complicated, too much to really get into in a Reddit comment. Also I'm not exactly an expert.<br />
You're probably better off reading some scientific articles about them if you want to know more in-depth. They're definitely interesting, in addition to being terrifying.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a protein that is not &quot;folded properly&quot;, making it resistant to breakdown by enzymes. They multiply, in ways scientists are still trying to figure out, and build up in masses around nerve cells. These prevent normal cell processes, causing cells to die.</p></div>		</li>
