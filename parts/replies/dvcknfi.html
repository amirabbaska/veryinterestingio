<p>Same kinda deal with dark energy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dark energy is whatever is doing the work to accelerate the expansion of spacetime. Why
We knew that the universe is expanding, bit it seems like the RATE at which it's expanding was itself increasing. What's causing this acceleration? There has to be some energy that we can't see. But it's got nothing to do with the gravity or the warping of space time.</p>
<p>There was some talk that the observations which demonstrated an accelerating exclamation couldn't be replicated with better equipment, and may have even been an error on a single study. But I feel I would have read much more about that since then if it were credible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we know the accelerating expansion of the universe is real?  From what I remember it was based on red-shifting of stars/galaxies.  The farther away the star/galaxy, the more red-shift we see.</p>
<p>The conclusion was &quot;hmm, things very far away are picking up speed for some reason.  Some force must be causing that.&quot;</p>
<p>But couldn't there be a simpler explanation that doesn't require some mysterious force?</p>
<p>Like, what if photons/light just naturally lose energy over extreme distances?  Objects far away from us would appear redder because the photons lost some energy traveling here, and we can't test for it because the distances required to notice this energy loss are too great.</p>
<p>I know that idea may go against some scientific principles that we accept as fact, but &quot;we were wrong, photons lose a tiny bit of energy over massive distances&quot; seems like such a simpler explanation than, &quot;there is a force that accounts for 70% of the universe's mass, and for some reason it causes the universe itself to expand faster and faster.  Oh, and it's invisible and completely undetectable&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that it's completely invisible and undetectable, it's that you have a pitch black room and are asking what color the furniture is. We know it's there, we just don't have the methods to detect it yet.</p>
<p>Also, we know it's there because it is detectable. We are literally detecting it by saying 'look, the universe is expanding faster and something is making that happen. Something should be there'. When we could observe the gravitational effect of a planet but didn't have the ability to actually see it, we didn't go 'this is impossible, it's undetectable!' We just spent time figuring out additional ways to observe it until we had more data than the initial 'it should be there'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think dark energy is very simple. There's an acceleration being observed. You can't have any kind of acceleration without some kind of unbalanced force. We don't know what it is, but we know this one observation. That's a much simpler explanation than the observation somehow only APPEARING as an acceleration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always wondered if this acceleration is just the effects of the big bang. Like we are still in the accelerating phase of the explosion. Eventually (maybe billions of years from now) that acceleration will begin to slow then stop all together. Am I way off base in thinking this way? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big bang wasn't an explosion.  It was an expansion of space itself.  So your theory is the question here.  Why is it still expanding?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of funny you say that, because that observation is how we arrived at the idea of the Big Bang in the first place.</p>
<p>The mystery is why things are <em>accelerating</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered <em>what if it isn't extra gravity?</em> Say I'm living in a  civilization of intelligent subatomic particles. Everything around me behaves in a certain way so I accept that as a law. As our civilization advances we gain the ability to look very far away from our home. In general, the &quot;universe&quot; as we see it acts the same way. Yet over extremely long distances and larger sizes things just don't quite seem to add up. We can't see it directly or make any sense of it because it goes against all of our predictions, but it turns out what we see is the influence of <em>gravity</em>. Our science has no way to account for such a strange and large scale force though so they attribute it to hidden particles and other things that help solve the problem. What of it isn't dark matter, but another level of completely different physics way too different from what we accept based on observation to be realized? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an alternative explanation that has been worked on.</p>
<p>Modifying the theories we have about gravity can lead to results similar to dark matter. These theories are usually referenced as MOND:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_Newtonian_dynamics</a></p>
<p>They do fairly well on galactic scales, but so far they do significantly worse than various Dark Matter candidates on cosmological scales. This is still an active field of research, but dark matter is preferred by most scientists compared to MOND. But the issue hasn't been truly settled, we can't rule out that modified theories of natural laws are the main culprit, while dark matter is not (or only partially responsible). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the problem is the scale of the additional effects of gravity.</p>
<p>A limited understanding of how gravity works would more likely give small discrepancies we can't explain or very different results to something we think we know how to predict.</p>
<p>In this case, there's so much more gravitational effects displayed that it's hard to explain away like that. The only explanation seems to be there is much more out there that we just can't detect.</p>
<p>The results are still predictable and visible by our understanding of gravity, the cause isn't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, that we dont know how much we dont see. And by what Ive seen, its probably a lot more than we can see (or measure).</p>
<p>Personally I tend to believe that we see such a minuscule part of this universe/time, that any laws we manage to form during our existence could just be some useless explanation for a temporal phenomena occuring on the edge of the &quot;real&quot; thing, that in some way shapes the physical world we interact with but we will probably never manage to even come closer to determine the existence of this(or these) forces.   </p></div>		</li>
