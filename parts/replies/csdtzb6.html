			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Yes, it does. The source of the gravitational field is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress%E2%80%93energy_tensor" target="_blank">stress-energy tensor</a>, which - as the name suggests - is related to energy. Photons carry energy equivalent to E=ћω , so they generate a gravitational field</p>
<p>2) I'm not sure what you are asking here. Are you asking if there is a gravitational field in an empty universe or if there are points in space without gravitational field?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your response. </p>
<p>For question two I was wondering the former. Is there a gravitational field in an empty universe?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking there <em>is</em> a gravitational field, but its value everywhere would be zero without any energy in the universe.</p>
<p><em>edit</em>: but see /u/OnyxIonVortex's comment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Mass and energy warp spacetime and the photon has energy, so yes. There is even a theoretical type of black hole called a &quot;kugelblitz&quot; that is formed by concentrating light enough to cause an event horizon to form.
2) There is no place in the Universe with zero gravity. If the Universe contained two photons and they were at opposite ends of the Universe (assuming a flat topology), they would still be interacting gravitationally. An inverse square law gets really small but never goes to zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last statement is not quite right. Any two parts of the universe that are in casual contact with each other do gravitationally influence each other. However, two photons in regions of the universe with space-like separation do not interact via any means.</p></div>		</li>
