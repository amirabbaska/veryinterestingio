			<div class="markdown"><p>Came looking for this, so relieved I found it. </p>
<p>There's a <em>huge</em> difference between infant-directed speech (higher tones, simplified word forms, slower pace with greater space between words, etc.) and &quot;baby talk&quot;.</p>
<p>My twins were preemie so we had a speech and language pathologist (SLP) help with early speech development work. The model we were given was to use infant-directed speech, but not to model incoherent speech. </p>
<p>For example, we'd say &quot;Would you like the cup?&quot;, and she might respond with &quot;bup!&quot;. Many parents' natural tendency would be to say &quot;yes, 'bup'! Would you like the bup?&quot;, but the SLP explained that there's solid research that responding with &quot;yes, a <strong>c</strong>up!&quot; (accentuating the 'c' sound) was more effective.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I'd say it seems to have worked well, since despite some developmental issues at play, they speak significantly more clearly than their school peers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on: There is also literature suggesting that children's overall communication skills (beyond, but including, articulation) benefit the most from echoing the utterance and then replacing it with the emphasized standard speech.  The CCC-SLP that works with my center suggests this approach.  The comparison between sounds is beneficial for contrast similarly to benefit of those pipe phones children use to hear themselves talk--echoing helps clarify the sounds they make.  Additionally, echoing helps children develop serve and return interactions (helpful in developing executive function skills and future empathy skills) and can help gain their attention for the corrected speech (try echoing with an infant or toddler and you'll often get a reaction seeming to say, &quot;Whoa! They just made the same sound I did!  I wonder what sound they'll make next?&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ugh, my cousin totally failed at speaking words to her son. If he called milk guk, then that's what she used as well, or worse, because she  knew the meaning of his baby-talk she never corrected him and poor guy just thought he was saying things right.  As a result he was very late in speaking and now has a speech therapist that comes in. </p>
<p>Please, correct your kids. Do it in boopy schmoopy tones, but say the correct words :/</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once worked with a 3-year-old child who only said the word, &quot;Mama,&quot; for everything--because it got great results.  The mother would always figure out what she needed based on context and saying, &quot;Mama,&quot; was enough for every circumstance.  After three weeks, the child finally said the two-word phrase, &quot;shoe please,&quot; to request help with her shoe.  The mother was actually offended by this and discontinued working with my center.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a post of sense, in a sea of anecdotal quips. Most people are lumping nonsense with 'baby talk' and yea, that garbage is harmful carried to an extreme. But slightly exaggerated speech when a child is young is proven to help with language acquisition because of the simple sentence structure and tonal elements. </p>
<p>Mothers that use the babies words for stuff, don't help them learn the real words that the child should be using- this is bad. These are likely the &quot;stunted&quot; speech kids that everyone is going on about that makes them think all baby talk is bad- when that isn't true. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, it speeds acquisition, but it doesn't seem to make a long-term difference; by teen years, you can't tell the difference.</p>
<p>So the major value seems to that early acquisition reduces anxiety and improves other skill acquisition.</p></div>		</li>
