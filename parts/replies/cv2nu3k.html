			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. Depending on the company I can be anywhere between an XS and an L, and sometimes the L is even a little tight. I'm 5'0 and about a hundred pounds. Think about that. If I'm wearing an L, what the hell are all the other women (which is pretty much almost all of them since I'm tiny) wearing?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah I know these shirts you're talking about.  I have some brands that are like that.  There's practically no size difference between the S, M, and L.  The XL is barely bigger than the L.</p></div>		</li>
