			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, brown noise is louder at lower pitches and fainter at higher pitches, while white noise is the same loudness at all frequencies.</p>
<p>There are more precise technical ways to describe these things, but in the spirit of ELI5 check out the blue graphs on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise#Brown.28ian.29_noise" target="_blank">this wikipedia page</a> , which do a far better job of explaining this than a text comment ever could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the &quot;brown note&quot; isn't it? </p>
<p>My wife and I did have a chuckle over &quot;brown noise&quot; just now. We were finishing up some chores and she belted out a few seconds of brown noise. </p>
<p>I did not find it relaxing. The little dance she did afterwards was simply payback for all of mine, and I don't blame her. </p></div>		</li>
