			<div class="markdown"><p>In the Navy nuclear field, we had a simple question to show the various ways that radiation can penetrate the body.</p>
<p>You have a alpha cookie, a beta cookie, and a gamma cookie. </p>
<p>You have to eat one, put one in your shirt pocket, and hold one in your hand. Which one goes where?</p>
<p>You hold the alpha cookie in your hand, since the large (relatively) alpha particles can't penetrate the dead skin on your hand. (Its very bad news if you get them internally, because its a LOT of energy if it can hit live tissue)</p>
<p>You put the beta cookie in your pocket, because its blocked by your clothes.</p>
<p>And eat the gamma cookie, because it doesn't matter where it is, because gammas are gonna go right through anything short of lead. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a classic question. I first heard it posed as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have an alpha source, a beta source, a gamma source, and a neutron source. A crazed gunman orders you to throw one away, put one in your pocket, hold one, and eat one. What do you do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer (quoted to the best of my memory):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Throw the neutron source away, because fuck neutrons. Put the beta source in your pocket. Hold the alpha source. Eat the gamma source.</p>

<p>Both of these body systems have a much higher cell turnover rate, which is why they seem to be at least partially &quot;preferentially&quot; affected by radiation. It is more apparent when the progenitor cells have had their DNA damaged because the new cells required to keep the body going fail. Contrast this to something like muscle, where there is a much lower cell turnover rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A very basic run down. Look up radiobiology for more (and better) explanation. </p>
<p>There are three main levels of radiation damage that lead to death in the short term. </p>
<p>LOW DOSE: 4 Gy - 8 Gy.  Kills bone marrow,  leads to death in about 30 days from lack of red cells and immune cells. </p>
<p>MEDIUM DOSE: &gt; 10 Gy. Sterilises intestinal cells so they cannot reproduce. Death in 1 - 2 weeks. </p>
<p>HIGH DOSE: &gt; 40Gy. Irrevocable brain damage. Confusion and death in days.</p>
<p>These are doses in Gy. Any type of radiation can deliver this dose, but photons and neutrons are the most common offenders.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> to add a little clarity -</p>
<p>The doses I quoted are approximate and not the same for everyone. The lethal dose is often termed LD50/30 being the Lethal Dose for 50% of the population in 30 days, that's usually set at around 4Gy.</p>
<p>The dose is assumed to be a whole body dose, delivered instantly, or over a short time period (several minutes). If the irradiation time gets very long (days or more) then the LD50/30 drops.</p>
<p>As dose is measured as received then distance etc don't matter. It is the end effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome" target="_blank">Acute radiation syndrome</a>.</p>
<p>It's caused by the ionization damage as the top comment described, but in this case, we're talking about a lot of damage at once. Cells that absorb a very high dose can't become cancerous because they just die^1.</p>
<p>The issue is having lots of dead tissue around your body at once. Nearly all of the functions of your organs are impaired to some extent. The immune system can't fight infections easily, blood forming organs can't redevelop your blood fast enough, and your intestinal villi can't absorb enough nutrients to let the rest of your body repair itself. Meanwhile, the human flora starts &quot;eating&quot; the abundant dead tissue while taking advantage of your lack of defenses: infections develop everywhere.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, antibiotics play a central role in treatment.</p>
<p>^1 This doesn't exclude the possibility of developing a cancer after ARS because not all cells are killed this way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Everybody all the time recieves radiation which comes from almost everything including the sun, the cosmos, and things we eat like bananas. RADIATION IS RARELY DANGEROUS.   The two times it is are acute and chronic radiation exposure.  Chronic means you receive a &quot;low dose&quot; (which is actually extremely high relative to the standards on dose have set in place by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and other government organizations DOE, etc.) over a long time. Essentially, your cells can't recover from the ionizing radiation because you continue to be exposed over and over.  Acute radiation exposure means you get a huge dose over a short time. For example a nuclear bomb would release massive amount of radiation (energy) which would kill people near the bomb due to the extreme dose recieved. Here you cells are so damaged by the ionizing radiation that they cannot repair themselves.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biomedical Engineer working with low-dose radiation (LDR) brachytherapy devices here.</p>
<p>Came to backup this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;low dose&quot; (which is actually extremely high relative to the standards on dose have set in place by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and other government organizations DOE, etc.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LDR level has been set by the ICRP to be at 20 rads, 20,000 mrads, or 0.2 Gy, 200 mGy.  </p>
<p>NRC <strong>annual</strong> dose limit is defined as the more limiting of--</p>
<p>(i) The total effective dose equivalent being equal to 5 rems (0.05 Sv or 0.05 Gy); or</p>
<p>(ii) The sum of the deep-dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent to any individual organ or tissue other than the lens of the eye being equal to 50 rems (0.5 Sv or 0.5 Gy).</p>
<p>In turn, contrast <em>this</em> to a 0.1 mGy dose received from a chest x-ray (<strong>2000 times</strong> less dose than LDR level)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're missing stochastic effects, which basically say that any dose, no matter how low (even a single particle) has the potential to cause a mutation which could develop into a fatal cancer. This is what the linear no threshold model is based upon. Essentially the risk of an effect is proportional to the total dose but is always non zero for a positive dose. This is the reason that in addition to dose limits we also are legally required to keep doses as low as reasonable practicable/achievable. </p></div>		</li>
