			<p>Yep. An easy (if unpleasant) experiment you can try is to dry your tongue out by keeping your mouth open for a few minutes, then when your tongue is completely dry, put some dry salt crystals on it. It won't taste salty at all. Then when you put your tongue back on your mouth and wet it with saliva, it suddenly tastes salty.<br><br>This is because you can taste Na+, but you can't taste ...NaClNaClNaCl...</p>		</li>

			<p>I like the way you tried to write out the crystalline structure. A for effort. </p>		</li>
