			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, it's important that your money-laundering operation is a plausibly cash business where it's hard to later prove or disprove how many clients you had.</p>
<p>So, a retail store, especially one selling expensive goods, isn't great because a) most people will pay with cards and b) if I claim to have sold 100 widgets I must have bought 100 widgets (or parts thereof) which can be fairly easily checked up on.</p>
<p>Whereas a car cleaning service is great because most people pay cash, and the only real supplies needed are water, buckets and sponges, so it's very easy for me to put extra money through, write out a load of receipts for car washes that didn't happen, and no one can prove my business <em>isn't</em> turning over £1,000 a day without physically surveilling my store and counting my customers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I believe I saw this method on some crime show my ex was watching. </p>
<p>Back in the 90's I already thought arcades would be good for money laundering because yoi aren't actually selling anything so you have no inventory that needed tracked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, but to me it seems flawed as all the transactions are traceable, and it's not hard for them to look at who is buying all the private shows.</p>
<p>Arcades I can definitely see working. Or, like in the current season of Fargo, parking lots.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes this is actually what gets lots of people into trouble.</p>
<p>In an auditing class in college we learned about all the red flags of money laundering.</p>
<p>Also learned about how lots of people or business get caught.</p>
<p>So for example the IRS knows how much the average car wash/bar in an area makes. If your bar/car wash is making 600% more than the average red flags go off and you may get audited.</p>
<p>Also lets say your a carwash saying you wash 150 cars per day. Well there are lots of ways to check that out. If you only have one stall and it takes 10 min per car you can do 6 car washes per hour...or 144 assuming you are 100% full 24 hours a day (not likely)</p>
<p>Also the average car wash uses X number of gallons of water...if your shop is not using 150 * X something fishy is going on.</p>
<p>Or you own a bar and claim you do $5k per day...now a normal bar doing 5k per day should be using X bottles of alcohol, if your bar only goes through 1/4 of the bottles again its a red flag.</p>
<p>Bars have gotten busted for this, laundromats have gotten busted because auditors realized their water/electricity usage didn't match their receipts.</p>
<p>So you can launder money and &quot;top off&quot; a business but you cannot get greedy and you have to pay close attention to your accounting so you have realistic expenses to match your fake earnings .</p>
<p>so any service industry, that is paid in cash and has no &quot;inventory&quot; is great. Massage parlors , strip clubs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, instead of doing it small bits at a time through a car wash, you start creating &quot;Modern Art&quot;. Show up at a couple of low key galleries. &quot;Sell&quot; a few of your pieces for ridiculous sums to an &quot;Anonymous Buyer&quot;.</p>
<p>Proceed to do this until your money is laundered. Also, by this point you should have a name for yourself in the modern art &quot;community&quot; as someone who has sold hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars in &quot;Art&quot;. Continue whatever excentric, nonesense thing you've been doing to create your pieces, and sell them to actual customers and make legitimate money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another common tactic is to buy a cheap, fucked up old house and then use your ill gotten gains to pay tradesmen in cash (extremely common where I am) to renovate it and sell it for a huge profit. The tradesmen are cooking their books, so you just pay them in cash. In a short while, you have a magnificent house and a legitimate way to bank your 'cash'. Everyone wins. Except the taxation department. </p>
<p>Another way is poker machines. For 'small' amounts of money. Say you just sold 5 or 10 grands worth of drugs this week. You go to a club and stick that money in the pokies. You play a bit and probably lose some. Then you just hit collect because you 'won'. You get rid of the dodgy money and you walk out with a cheque for (say) $4500. You lost 500 bucks but now you have a clean 4500. You can deposit that in a bank with no questions asked. Easy money. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you please further explain the house fixing one? So even if you pay the tradesmen in cash and they are cooking their books, aren't you still getting a product (like a renovated bathroom or new counters) that you have to explain? How do you cover for that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also read that you can do something similar at the track by placing bets on every possible outcome of the race. That way, you're guaranteed to win and since there's no record of the losing bets, you only have a record of the winning bet in the form of the payout receipt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bookies is another option depending on where you are..</p>
<p>As long as your willing to take a ~35% hit you can launder money without owning a business. Just keep betting on races or anything and you can get clean money back. The bookies will not report you since they're making money off you and you don't have to pay taxes; the odds they use will generally mean you get to about 65% of what you bet long term. I know this because I worked in one and we had a customer who was almost certainly laundering money and nobody cared.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hell, owning a business, you will take at least that much of a hit. You still have to hire staff, pay rent, and make it seem like you have a business model, and at the end of it all, pay taxes on it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that does not explain anything about art. Getting an anonymous buyer to purchase your work for thousands will not make your obscure (and likely poorly-executed) art favorable to the critics and the art community. No one is that stupid. If it were that easy, everyone would do it. </p></div>		</li>
