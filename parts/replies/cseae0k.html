			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a big topic in the 'adult beverage industry' right now as the the FDA <strong>is</strong> coming out with new rules that WILL require <em>some</em> restaurants to list nutritional facts for beer. IMO, It's actually something that could really impact what chains serve and mess up some of the trend towards serving local. More info from the Brewers' Association, which is the craft beer trade group:
[FDA MENU LABELING. BE READY OR LOSE SALES.] (<a href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/staff-voices/fda-menu-labeling-be-ready-or-lose-sales/" target="_blank">https://www.brewersassociation.org/staff-voices/fda-menu-labeling-be-ready-or-lose-sales/</a>)
TL:DR Please just read the bullet points in the article. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like you can kind of put together a hodge-podge of nutrition data to come up with a good estimate for your craft brew.</p>
<p>But that's actually kind of scary if that's how nutrition labels work. I thought they were actually tested for their components and nutrition, e.g., throwing it into a calorimeter, putting it through a spectrometer, etc. </p>
<p>But this sounds pretty haphazard, even if they do require you to back up your data somewhat. Does that mean nutrition facts for all foods could be pretty inaccurate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-food-manufacturers/" target="_blank">According to Scientific American</a>, yeah they're probably inaccurate. Though that post is from 2006. </p>
<p>However, if I had to guess, I would assume there's probably a decided-upon margin of error that's pretty acceptable to them, so if you're big on counting calories it probably doesn't make much of a difference. Since measurements of metabolism or calories burned from activities are also not that accurate, I would think it evens out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Will this increase the beer's cost exponentially? I ask because this is the argument the GMO labeling opponents use.</p>
<p>This is actually the argument the Snack Food Association used before being forced to add nutritional labeling as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it difficult to determine the nutritional facts? Or is it as simple as adding up known values for the grains/hops/yeast/additions, then calculating the facts? I'm wondering because a brewery might be discouraged from releasing limited runs of new beers if it means going through a tedious nutrition facts discovery process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not much of a discovery process. They'd send one bottle over to a lab and the lab would put it through a few tests and send the nutritional/calorie info back in a few hours.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One offs most likely will will not have specific information but might have generalized info based on the known ingredients.</p></div>		</li>
