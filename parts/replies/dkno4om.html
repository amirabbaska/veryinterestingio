			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if you were running after prey, or running from a predator.  Keeping your head at the exact same level makes your vision much better and more accurate for running.  It's super cool to watch actually.  Cats try to do this too but cannot do it as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of motion blur. Imagine motion blur lasted a full second for us. While walking and moving, there is so much blur we can't see anything. Chickens eyes have a lot of blur like that, so keeping the eyes stable mean they can see. When they move their head forward, they snap it and then takes a bit to re-stabilize and see again. </p></div>		</li>
