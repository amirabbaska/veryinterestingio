			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed. Probably light pollution plays a role there. Auroras are rarely seen at such low latitudes, and when they do, it looks like a diffused arc of red light appearing in the northern horizon. The most recent <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0021916951900074" target="_blank">photo</a> I could find of auroras in Greece was in 1950 (found <a href="http://sci-hub.tw/https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02122871" target="_blank">this article</a> reporting other events seen in Greece).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I am far from an expert in auroras but I do have a PhD in physics. I research on topics related to space plasmas, mostly theoretically and numerically. This answer is basically a summary from the book <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=Poxcz5AbrpcC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=auroras+ether&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=g7T46pnRWr&amp;sig=VT1bwASHbZf5Zb2t-xXjJO95woI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjW2rfZhPPcAhXhhOAKHXRNBMoQ6AEwEnoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=auroras%20ether&amp;f=false" target="_blank">Aurora: The Northern Lights in Mythology, History and Science</a> that I happen to have a copy. Edited my answer to point to this reference. </p></div>		</li>
