			<div class="markdown"><p>Tesla owner here. While this explanation is great at being simple, unfortunately it's grossly incorrect. The battery doesn't take more &quot;effort&quot; or have more resistance as it's full. Actually when it's charging near max and going slower, there are less resistive losses due to heat, less energy wasted on cooling fans, and less effort put in by the charger.</p>
<p>Here is the correct explanation:</p>
<p>Think of a battery as a bucket. I can fill the bucket with a firehose, but only very briefly before it starts splashing out. Once I turn off the firehose, the bucket might be ~%60 full. So I switch to a slower garden hose on full blast. Now I can get the bucket to 95% before water starts splashing out. To get that last bit up to 100% I'll use a trickle from a faucet. Water splashing out of the bucket (overcharging) is very bad for the battery so the charging system deliberately slows down to avoid this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A great explanation, but it isn't quite the accurate, even for ELI5 purposes. Some battery types CAN be charged at a constant rate until they reach full capacity. Nickel Cadmium and Nickel metal hydride cells are often charged until they start to heat up. The charger senses the temperature rise and shuts charging off. They can also use a voltage detection method to deliver full charging current right up to the end. </p>
<p>Lithium cells are more prone to be damaged if overcharged even a little. So we intentionally slow the charge down by using a fast charge (constant current) in the beginning and switching to a slower charge (constant voltage) which tapers off towards the end. The difference between the cell's open circuit voltage and the constant voltage supply gets smaller as charging progresses. The smaller difference means less current flows. </p>
<p>TLDR: It is all about not over charging. It isn't the cell's resistance which rises. It is the deliberately limited charging voltage. The batteries internal resistance goes down as it is charged, not up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the story of the spring makes even less sense. It implies that the springs energy is linearly related to how far its pushed back, but it's not. The Coyote is adding the same amount of energy constantly. The last few inches take a lot more energy to charge, but they will also give that back. A 50% 'charged' spring is not 50% between its fully charged length and its decharged length, its way closer to its charged length.</p>
<p>I hate to say it, but people here very often take the symptoms of a problem, not the actual cause, and then make up some analogy which has similar symptoms and present that as an explanation. And people love it. Welcome to ELI5 I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the energy of the spring is proportional to the distance squared, so pushing the spring in half way charges it 25%. The spring analogy would be a great analogy if the question was &quot;why does it take so more than twice as much energy to charge to 100% than it does to charge to 25%&quot;. Instead they responded to a question about why energy isn't proportional to charging time for certain types of batteries with an irrelevant story about how energy isn't proportional to distance in springs. </p>

<p>Yes, the problem is that none of the people upvoting know the answer to the question, so they just upvote whatever answer they like best. It's just another symptom of our post-truth society where facts no longer matter because people just believe whatever feels good to them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm. Now that you mention it. They probably did that on purpose (obviously), so that when they do break the physics, it looks even more surprising. </p>
<p>Just like the nice and uplifting moments in The Last of Us are on purpose. You need them, so that when the scary or sad stuff comes, it hits 10 times harder. You need the positive, before the negatives can work  properly and vice versa. That's exactly why many action, horror movies don't work today. There's no compensation in those movies. It's all out and bland as fuck, with many exceptions of course </p></div>		</li>
