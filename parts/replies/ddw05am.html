<p>You know the toddler game where they put shapes in holes? A PC doesn't have the same holes or shapes as a PS2. In order to get the PS2 shapes into PC holes you have to build a new desk with new holes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The difficulty is when the PC doesn't support all the same instructions as the PS2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But aren't PCs supposed to be vastly superior? Shouldn't it be able to do all of the instructions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The PS2 is particularly difficult to emulate because of the weirdness of the Emotion Engine hardware.</p>
<p>A modern PC has a single chip that processes instructions, does math, draws graphics and accesses memory. (Sometimes the graphics part is split out.)</p>
<p>The PS2 has:</p>
<ul>
<li>A chip for processing, which uses a different set of instructions compared to a PC processor</li>
<li>Two separate chips specifically for the math used in 3D video games</li>
<li>A chip for 2D graphics and movie files/DVDs</li>
<li>A chip for accessing memory</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are separate units but operate with very precise synchronization and timing. That timing is very hard to accurately emulate.</p></div>		</li>
