Without all this metal any planets formed would be low metal with weak fields incapable of protecting life or preserving water against the solar wind. Think Mars.</p>
<p>It takes for this to happen. Any civilization evolving early in the universe would have poorer access to metals. We may be the forerunners. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>May I ask, what form would metals take when in a nebulae? It's a very hard thing to conceptualize, metals floating about. Also, would they be in a pure atomic form or compounds, oxides etc?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First, it's worth pointing out that 'metals', in an astrophysical context, basically means anything heavier than helium. Any element made inside a star is a metal, so that includes oxygen and nitrogen for instance. </p>
<p>The simple answer to your question is that metals usually end up as microscopic solid grains which we call dust. They might be anything from a few molecules to a few microns in diameter. It depends on the local environment how much chemistry is possible (I.e. whether it's cold enough for molecules to form), but for instance astronomers look for the emissions from carbon monoxide (CO) to map out molecular clouds in galaxies. </p>
<p>There's all sorts of stuff swirling around out there. Google image searching some images of galactic dust shows just how much there is out there. </p></div>		</li>
