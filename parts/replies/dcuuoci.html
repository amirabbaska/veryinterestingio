			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all waterfalls form because of a contrast in the erodibility of rocks, some form because of a rapid drop in base level (this can be an actual drop in base level, like the level of a lake going down, but an increase in the rate at which rocks are uplift will have the same effect). Waterfalls are extreme examples of 'knickpoints' or 'knickzones', basically either discrete points or zones above and below which there is a significant change in the rivers slope and representing different forms of the river when it graded to the original base level (upstream of the knickpoint) and the new base level (downstream of the knickpoint). Waterfalls not produced by a contrast in rock strength are often associated with 'hanging valleys'. These are basically valleys perched high up in landscape with a small river with a waterfall at their base. These typically form when the big main river starts incising rapidly and the little streams can't keep up and get left behind with a waterfall separating them. These are quite common in New Zealand, amongst other places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding was that <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1216/h/h.html" target="_blank">hanging valleys</a> form where tributary glaciers had met trunk alpine glaciers, where the trunk glaciers had carved down further. Melt it all away, and the tributary is left high and dry (so to speak), with a waterfall trickling down. I don't doubt that differences in stream size would react to base level fall at different rates (quite a cool phenomenon, actually), it's just not the mechanism that comes to mind in the case of most hanging valleys.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is another way, my brain tends to default to tectonic geomorphology, but the mechanism I described is proposed for the origin of hanging valleys in some places <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~kwhipple/papers/Crosby_Whipple_2006_Geomorphology.pdf" target="_blank">(e.g. Crosby &amp; Whipple, 2006)</a>.</p>
<p>The influence of drainage area on the retreat rate of a knickpoint is well established. If we consider rivers in the context of the stream power law where incision is equal to K<em>A^m </em>S ^n , where K is the erosional efficiency (related to the type of rock, climate, etc), A is drainage area, S is slope, then we can define the wave speed (i.e. the rate at which a change in propagated along the river network, treating it as a kinematic wave) is K <em> A^m </em> S^n-1 , meaning that the rate at which a knickpoint sweeping back will be a function of the erosional efficiency, drainage area, and slope (if n does not equal 1). The implication is that knickpoints generally retreat slower in harder rocks and at smaller drainage areas (relationships with slope get odd depending on the value of n).</p></div>		</li>
