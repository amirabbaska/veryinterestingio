<p>Most of the people who answered here did not mention that simple and important fact. We have all follicles.</p>
<p>And sometimes, hair on the body is still quite there :
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/rWqAxzq.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/rWqAxzq.jpg</a> + <a href="http://i.imgur.com/nFJBmqk.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/nFJBmqk.jpg</a></p>
<p>And one of the most forgotten explanation to all that is SEX ! (sexual selection). And that's probably why we can have long hair as Lions and men have beards too.</p>
<p>There are many hypothesis quoted above, but very often the explanation is a mix of different ones. There is very often not &quot;ONE explanation&quot; to this kind of phenomenon but several.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because hair is outside for the view of others, don't neglect sex as an explanation.</p></div>		</li>
