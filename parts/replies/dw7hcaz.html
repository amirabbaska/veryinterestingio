<p>That's interesting. Why's that? ELI5 anyone?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>MRI scanners send radio frequency waves into the body and measure how the atoms in the body react to that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the reaction of solid metal (or other good conductors of electricity) can be &quot;absorb all of it and heat up&quot;. The metal can act like an antenna if the conditions are &quot;right&quot; (or wrong for the patient).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the MRI is just a hugely powerful magnet that makes the atoms in your body vibrate intensely as they react to the strong magnetic field, causing <em>them</em> to produce radio waves, which the MRI then scans/sees and produces an image. It's called Magnetic Resonance Imagery for this reason.</p>
<p>The reason metals heat up us due to electrical induction. Like a cooktop. The metal is a conductor, and conductors produce an electrical current when exposed to a magnetic field, and the internal resistance of the metal produces heat as a bi-product of the electrical current.</p></div>		</li>
