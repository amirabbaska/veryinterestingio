			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a pastry cook, but it depends on what you're looking for.  Different people like different properties.  </p>
<p>Some people prefer &quot;single origin&quot; chocolate.  This means all the chocolate is from a single plantation.  Large companies mix between different countries to keep cost low.  Some may consider single origin a single country as well.  The benefits of single origin is that you're more likely to have a flavor imparted from that region similar to Wine.  </p>
<p>There are bean-to-bar operations which vary in the process of how they make the chocolate.  Some have old 1800 / early 1900 machinery to grind and process.  This can produce what many consider low quality chocolate because it can be gritty.  </p>
<hr />
<p>I have multiple 70% bars and they all vary in taste.  It's also why some people can stand 99% bars: One company may make it taste like chalk while the other may have flavor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, at that point it's mostly down to brand and personal preference.</p>
<p>Larger brands tend to produce inferior chocolate in part because they cut corners when producing their chocolate liquor. Smaller brands tend to be more about the process, especially if they're single-origin, so they don't cut (as many) corners. As always there are exceptions to this rule (avoid Mast Brothers at all costs, they're basically a marketing department that occasionally makes shitty, unpleasant chocolate).</p>
<p>For personal preference, you really have to try and see. A lot of darker chocolates like to advertise their &quot;berry&quot; and &quot;stonefruit&quot; flavors, but I find chocolates like that too acidic and unpleasant. I prefer stuff with more &quot;deep cocoa&quot; and &quot;caramel&quot; notes. Sometimes the wrapper will have these tasting notes listed, sometimes it's on the website, sometimes you just have to try and see.</p>
<p>That said, there is one thing that I personally feel is an indicator of better chocolate: If it's labelled &quot;couverture&quot; it's usually a higher-quality chocolate. Couverture chocolate uses a higher percentage of cocoa butter, which results in a smoother, more supple final product that I love.</p>
<p>If you want to get started with fancier chocolate (and you're in the US) then you're in luck! We're in kind of a boom period right now, lots of little single-origin, bean-to-bar makers are popping up across the country. It's great to buy local, but if you want to go online there are a few places to try:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.chocosphere.com/" target="_blank">Chocosphere</a> - The one-and-only multi-brand importer on the west coast (there are a lot more on the east coast, but none seem to have web shops like Chocosphere). Pro-tip: Go to their Bargain Basement section and order one of the variety packs. Those chocolates are usually &quot;expired&quot;, but that just means they're past their sell-by. Chocolate takes years &amp; years to go rancid/become truly inedible, so their bargain basement packs amount to high-quality sampler packs for cheap.</p>
<p><a href="https://themeadow.com/" target="_blank">The Meadow</a> - A pretty sweet little chain primarily in Oregon but also in NYC. They don't have Chocosphere's gigantic selection, but I always see something at The Meadow that I can't find anywhere else.</p>
<p>This final one isn't a shop, but it's a great way to find smaller brands that are producing award-winning work: Check out the website for the International Chocolate Awards. Here's a listing of this year's <a href="http://www.internationalchocolateawards.com/2017/06/americas-competition-2017-winners/" target="_blank">Americas Competition winners</a>, almost all of them have web stores too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but I'd assume a &quot;quick &amp; dirty&quot; comparison between 2 different &quot;Identical %&quot; chocolates might be to compare the nutritional label on them, if we're after higher liquor and lower cocoa butter ratios, the bar with the lower % of fat content/gram should have the higher liquor ratio as well.</p>
<p>ETA: Sure Enough! Comparing 2 brands of &quot;70% Cacao Dark Chocolate&quot; on amazon <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91qJ5kdc4PL._SY679_.jpg" target="_blank">one has 18g of fat per 40g serving</a> while the <a href="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81moxqxIP%2BL._SL1500_.jpg" target="_blank">other has 19g/40g</a>. </p>
<p>Guess I have to order both now to confirm my hypothesis!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are on to something. Plus the 19g/40g bar also has more sugar per serving. Sugar adding extra weight to the serving, so the chocolate liquor ratio would be even lower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm allergic to something that's found in chocolate, as are two of my family members as well. We all note that white chocolate gives us much more of a reaction than milk chocolate, and milk more than dark. I've always assumed it was the additives found in chocolate but I'm looking at this basic breakdown and I'm now wondering if it might be one of the bigger ingredients seeing how it's pretty much the same across all brands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get a headache from white chocolate. When I learnt it has cocoa butter (and not real chocolate apparently) it made more sense. </p>
<p>And for milk chocolate well I'm lactose intolerant, so dark chocolate it is. Some googling says milk chocolate doesn't have cocoa butter so I'm not sure what could cause it for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cocoa butter is chocolate as you call it.</p>
<p>Roasted Cocoa bean ground fine = Cocoa liquor (liquid)</p>
<p>It looks like a thick chocolate syrup.  </p>
<p>You take that liquor and press it through a screen and you will separate the oils from the cocoa bean mass.  Thus you get cocoa butter.</p>
<p>You take the liquor, add cocoa butter, milk, sugar and mix it up and you get milk chocolate.</p>
<p>White chocolate is the cocoa butter only, no liquor, milk and sugar.</p>
<p>So either milk, sugar, or cocoa oil is doing it to you.  Any chocolate bar will have cocoa oil in it unless is the $1 santa bunny that is not real chocolate but cocoa powder mixed with palm oil and sugar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to make sure it's good dark chocolate. Dove, Godiva, Hershey's, and most other common brands that have 'dark chocolate have milk in them. I also can't have dairy,  and I live in a fairly rural area, so it's always difficult to find dark chocolate without milk products. </p></div>		</li>
