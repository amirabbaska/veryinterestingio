			<p>&gt; capitalism works both ways. if company A isn't paying you enough, look into company B, C, or D. Employers like to say &quot;you're lucky to have a job blah blah blah,&quot; but if they are willing to pay you for your time, so is someone else, and probably more. it seems like my generation isn't willing to accept that &quot;company loyalty&quot; is a dumb idea, and will only prove to work against you. its bullshit.<br><br>I <strong>know</strong> I'm worth more than the 8 dollars and change I get an hour to work the holiday season at an overpriced toy chain where clueless parents and coupon-clipping customers carelessly roam around, letting their kids run amok, ride bikes and scooters around the store, leaving toys where they don't belong or at the registers when the prices don't work out for them. At the end of the day, it's us, the wage-slaves, who have to fix everything up. It takes us hours, and it's a bit unfair to put so much time into such a tedious routine and not get much in return. If it wasn't for us this company wouldn't be up and running. I'm tired of the bullshit people give you when you want to vent about how bad it is and having to keep a fake smile or straight face when you know deep down inside it's not worth it, but it's money anyway. That you should be grateful. <br><br>We can't keep letting those who can't stand up for themselves or what they believe in from holding those of us who want a better way of life back. We need to get the message out that enough is enough. I can't see myself having to bust my ass working two or more jobs just to make ends meet; I'll work myself to death!<br><br>Not what I plan on doing. I will not die a slave.</p>		</li>

<li>Millenials are much, much more likely to ditch their employer. We don't for a variety of reasons - it's expensive, it's unpleasant, and it's entirely possible it'll leave us with a shitty resum√©.<br><em> Condos have an unfortunate tendency to not hold their value - factor interest, depreciation, and fees, and you're better off with a crappy apartment. Furthermore, if you're changing jobs regularly (see A,) you lose a large percentage of the </em>original retail price<em> of the house - and, if you don't need a ton of space, you're better off renting and putting the savings into the market. <br></em> We're all pushing for 10% more. It'z a zero-sum game. </li>
