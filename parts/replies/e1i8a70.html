			<div class="markdown"><p>Just in case anyone is confused by the above: pKa and pH are not the same thing. A pH of -31 would correspond to 1*10^31 M of H3O+. Which is not only practically impossible, but also mathematically impossible as it would require each water molecule to be ~10 million protonated water molecules. pKa is simply put an indication of how much a specific compound &quot;wants to&quot; give a hydrogen atom to water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beyond the pKa of H3O^+ you can't even talk about the ability to give it to water because of the leveling effect.  IE all acids stronger than H3O will donate nearly 100% of their protons to water to form H3O.</p>
<p>They can actually measure the pKa of super acids by looking at how well they protonate other acids or compounds that don't want to be protonated.  For example you can perform a similar experiment in acetic acid and look at the equilibrium of protonated acetic acid to non-protonated acetic acid. Since acetic acid doesn't want to accept a proton you can actually differentiate between super acids. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wonder if anyone has ever managed to spill that in a lab.  Can't be in solution with water, can't be stored in glass (or virtually anything else for that matter, PTFE containers being the exception).  In fact, just based on the wikipedia article, I imagine clean-up ad first aid would be big headaches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another &quot;completely off the scale&quot; example is Fluorine, which is a stronger Oxidizer than Oxygen, it can oxidize water. FOOF (another compound) is such a strong oxidizer it can set sand, ice and gold on fire, there is almost no way to actually put out a FOOF fire, you have to let it finish using up its fuel. For that reason many chemists refuse to work with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then there’s Chlorine Trifluoride, ClF3. Yes, chlorine and fluorine, and the fluorine wants out. In water, it reacts violently, making Hydrochloric Acid, Hydrofluoric Acid (really really nasty), and Oxygen. Oh, and did I mention that it can burn ASBESTOS. The Germans decided it was too dangerous as a chemical weapon in WW2.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Let's stick to the IUPAC nomenclature, shall we? Oxonium! =)</p>
<p>To be fair, i was thaught &quot;hydroxonium&quot; back in the days. Used that for years until i encountered &quot;hydronium&quot; or &quot;oxonium&quot; and had to look up the IUPAC definition</p></div>		</li>
