			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, we did the same thing in a bandwidth agreement.  They told us that we should've told them we amended the Word document they sent us.  We said they should read their contracts first.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, that's generally illegal. I'd have to ask my wife what the precise reason is (she's an attorney), but IIRC it's something like 'bad faith', and it should nullify a contract. Other countries have other laws and precedents though, so you'd want to check with an attorney first.</p></div>		</li>
