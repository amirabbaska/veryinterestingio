			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, like it, but missing an explanation of diffusion and why the streams of smoke stay so thin, which seems to be op's main question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you agree that it is because the timescales of the convective/turbulent mixing are much shorter than the timescale at which diffusion acts?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree to that as well as the idea that the smoke would likely have a temperature difference when compared to the surrounding region thus giving it a thin flow appearance moving upward where there is a lower temperature change due to the previous smoke having already heated the nearby air and following the rising nature of heat. Also, I would expect that the bigger the temperature difference between the smoke and nearby air, as well as, a the lack of turbulence would produce longer laminar flow regions from the end of the cigarette. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The heat from the cigarette causes air to rise, taking the smoke particles with it for visual indication. The air transitions from laminar to turbulent flow after a short distance. This transition point can be roughly calculated by the Reynolds number of the fluid, which is a function of distance traveled (along with other properties).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that would be because the &quot;lines&quot; and swirling we see aren't actually created by the smoke.  The definition we see is the smoke &quot;coloring&quot; the air that is rising due to heat (the smoke particles are very fine and so very subject to being carried around by these currents).  Think of it as dropping ink on a surface with fine lines and scratches.  The patterns created by the ink spreading out are actually a representation of the medium itself and its features, simply colored by the ink.  In this case the air is the medium, and the ink is the smoke.</p>
<p>Consider also that if the cigarette burned cleanly (without smoke, like a candle), you would still see those lines and swirls in an infrared camera.  The smoke is incidental.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. Why is it so different when you exhale in still air at very cold temperatures? It makes a puffy cloud rather than thin streams.  Is that because heat transfers to other air instead of staying with the frozen water vapor?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shapes of the two clouds are not very different, are they? If you exhale cigarette smoke in the same way you exhale warm air on a cold day, you'll get a cloud that's similar in shape. The biggest difference is that the smoke cloud is made of solid particles that stick around for a while, but the warm breath cloud is made of liquid particles that rapidly evaporate and become invisible again.</p>
<p>Edit: I think the perceived difference could also be due to the fact that when we see the breath fog up in cold weather, usually the person is just breathing normally, in contrast to a smoker, who intentionally blows the smoke away from himself so that it doesn't linger around his face and eyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone may ask, why you can't blow cold-air rings.  It's because what you are exhaling from a cigarette is not just the atmospheric composition, but a multitude of very heavy laden chemicals.  If the atmosphere were thicker (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT-fctr32pE" target="_blank">say like water</a>), or had some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_nrzvYKYlY#t=0m50s" target="_blank">visual composite to distinguish it from air</a>, you would see the smoke rings.  Else,
they are there, but [invisible against the backdrop of the rest of the air around it.]

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you exhale in very cold air, you can also see the condensation of the water vapor in your breath. The big puffy cloud is the smoke, plus all of the condensing water vapor. The air you exhale when its cold out probably can expand more because there will be larger relative differences in density in cold weather.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to the tracing aspect, I'm wondering if this is because of the relative stickiness of the cigarette smoke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not about the particles being sticky, the particles get carried along because of their size and weight. Because of their small weight/size they respond very quickly to changes in the flow and &quot;follow&quot; the streamlines.</p>
<p>Think about putting ping pong balls in a stream. They will be carried along by the fluid and show the local currents.</p></div>		</li>
