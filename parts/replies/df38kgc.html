			<div class="markdown"><p>Counterintuitively, an object can actually keep accelerating forever and not hit light speed. The thing is that the <em>rate</em> of acceleration continues to slow so it never gets there. Think of the activity you can do where you stand 10 feet away from something, and start walking with the challenge to get there by making each step half as long as the last one. Theoretically you will keep moving forward, but as close as you may get, you will never cross that line.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah that's cool I can understand that. What I'm wondering though is that if things do continue to accelerate, even if it's at a small amount, why don't we have a bunch of asteroids flying around that are near light speed, given they have been accelerating in space for such a long time? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: just found your post where you explain this with what I mention below. Thanks. </p>
<p>I don't see how this analogy applies to constant acceleration. I asked another poster the same thing: can you explain why does the rate of acceleration of an object continue to slow? Doesn't this have to do more with the mass of the object increasing as the speed increases, and therefore require more energy to accelerate?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. It will continue to accelerate but it will be getting infinitesimally closer to the speed of light without reaching it. For example, something accelerating at 1g at 99.9% c will reach 99.99% c, then 99.9999% c, then 99.9999999999999999% c and so on</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So let's just say 99% is the fastest we could build a spaceship. Wouldn't that still be good enough? Doesn't seem like we would save a whole lot of time by going 1% faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless you use a (theoretical but quite possibly real) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_drive" target="_blank">Alcubierre drive,</a> &quot;by which a spacecraft could achieve apparent faster-than-light travel if a configurable energy-density field lower than that of vacuum (that is, negative mass) could be created.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rather than exceeding the speed of light within a local reference frame, a spacecraft would traverse distances by contracting space in front of it and expanding space behind it, resulting in effective faster-than-light travel. Objects cannot accelerate to the speed of light within normal spacetime; instead, the Alcubierre drive shifts space around an object so that the object would arrive at its destination faster than light would in normal space without breaking any physical laws.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is absorbing that energy at close to light speed? There is no friction if there is nothing in space. That energy from diminishing returns of propulsion has to be going somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The object is itself is &quot;absorbing&quot; the energy as kinetic energy, the same as at lower speeds. The classical formula KE=1/2 mv^(2) turns out to be an approximation which is only accurate when v is much smaller than the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes no sense. So the object is getting hotter. Because of what? It's just heating up because it is? Friction within the molecules of the object itself? How is the energy lost that would be transferred into kinetic energy?</p>
<p>Edit: or are you saying the object gets heavier? When you approach the speed of light does energy begin turning into mass? Energy that would be used as forward acceleration is then dumped into making the object more massive?</p></div>		</li>
