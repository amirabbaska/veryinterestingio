			<div class="markdown"><p>But Matt from Demo Ranch incorrectly stated that the glass was used to break up the bullet (similar to what you see in the ceramic coated armor plates he often tests). Whereas it seems the idea of the shattering glass is to use up some of the energy by being shattered allowing the more flexible plastic layers to catch or slow down the bullet further.</p>
<p>I think OP probably had the same though as me in that I can see why Matt would say that, but it just doesn't feel right being glass is nowhere near as hard as ceramic. </p></div>		</li>
