			<div class="markdown"><p>I am speaking as a spider enthusiast only and study spiders as a hobby, but to add to this, the most commonly liked spiders are those belonging to the family Salticidae, aka jumping spiders.</p>
<p>Despite the fact jumping spiders have all the similar characteristics of other species of spiders, including sensory hairs, eight eyes, eight legs, chelicera, and a pair of pedipalps, people who do not typically like spiders have reported thinking most species of salticitae are cute, or the only kind spiders they like. I believe this preference for jumping spiders is mainly due to appearance, their intelligent and curious nature and jumping all playing secondary roles in this perception. Having the large eyes typically makes them look less alien, being colourful, chubby, and hairy also make them more likable.</p>
<p>Another thing I'd like to note is with tarantulas, although being large spiders, they are also stubby legged, plump bodied, colourful and hairy like most species of jumping spiders. They are also perceived as cute by some people who don't often find spiders cute. They do not have large eyes, instead two small, side-by-side eye clusters. Despite lacking the eyes that jumping spiders have, tarantulas still meet the requirements of cuteness, while net casting spiders, although having similar large eyes to jumping spiders, do not.</p>
<p>Net casting spiders in the deinopidae family are mostly perceived as &quot;scary&quot; despite fitting most of the requirements for spider cuteness (large eyes, and hair covering their bodies). The &quot;face&quot; and body of a net casting spider is also elongated and almost skeletal looking with their long chelicera and narrow width, giving them a less infantile proportion, unlike the broad and shorter face/chelicera of a jumping spider. In addition, the long wiry legs and larger leg span to body ratio make them more freaky than cute in terms of the cuteness bias. </p>
<p>Having a plump and stubby appearance certainly plays a large role in spider/insect cuteness as it gives them an infantile appearance. Jumping spiders have the combination of plump bodies, rounder broad faces, often colourful hair/fuzz, and large main eyes, which is why they look so darn cute for a spider. They fit almost perfectly into the cuteness bias talked about in the articles linked by OP.</p>
<p>Edit: I'd also like to add that webbing has been mentioned as freaking some people out. Jumping spiders, and many other spiders in fact, do not web to catch prey and use webbing only as a safety line, and this could also play a part. They're not just sitting out in the open like orb weavers, ready to catch you off guard and get in your hair and clothed (although orb weavers are mostly harmless and quite beautiful). Net casters also don't web, they use their web exactly as the name describes to catch prey, but because they're long legged, dull, and narrow faced, they're &quot;creepy&quot; instead of cute.</p>
<p>Needless to say, all spiders have venom, but it takes a lot to get some to bite. Being venomous is innately threatening but we forget that most spiders have no interest in biting humans and wasting their venom on us rather than food.  New world tarantulas flick hairs before biting as defence because venom is far too precious to them, and most spiders would rather make a run for it.</p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="http://walkermcknight.com/jumping-spider/" target="_blank">Here's a post I found that covers what I mentioned in better detail</a> it definitely seems like this is a very common observation indeed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would think movement has a lot to do with it as well, as an admitted arachnophobe, I have almost no issue being near or even coming in contact with any kind of insect, even ones with the similar &quot;alien&quot; appearance of Spiders like assassin bugs, yet I want spiders nowhere near me, the only explanation I can give to this is how they move, an insect tends to move very differently than a spider, I've not studied this by any means but just through casual observation the way a spider moves is perceived to me as &quot;creepy&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cant speak for other insects. but spiders legs move sort of like a piston. they're hydraulic and can only move inward or outward. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks, that's very true and I forgot to mention movement as a factor. And I believe that the longer the legs, the easier it is to observe the gait of the critter, which turns a lot of people off because it becomes faster and more distorted looking the longer and skinnier the legs are. Jumpers actually tend to move differently because of the way they prefer jumping, even small distances, and almost appear to move at a lower frame rate than others.</p>
<p>That being said, I think we percieve movement of spiders, and insects for that matter, as far more complex than in reality. Spiders tend to move like two quadrupeds combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/GtHzpX0FCFY" target="_blank">Here's a video that breaks down their walk cycle.</a></p>
<p>Tarantulas when not startled walk extremely slow, which makes the gait not appear freaky like, say, a huntsman, which has very long legs. Jumping spiders do have the same walk cycle as they have 8 legs too, but their movement is fast and short, often a pause between movements. Going a larger distance, they almost always jump rather than run. </p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/5eABaBg-Tyc" target="_blank">Here's a video of a tarantula walking normally</a>, note how slow and smooth the movement is. You can observe exactly the movement style as the animated video above, but as someone who actually likes spiders, I will admit I find this movement a lot less uncomfortable to look at than longer legged and faster moving spiders. <a href="https://youtu.be/LvIBOugOFuw" target="_blank">Here is a calmly walking huntsman for comparison.</a>
And <a href="https://youtu.be/FhpL5h8sEHo" target="_blank">Here's a video that slows down jumping spider movement.</a> and you can observe the similar movements. It seems like jumping spiders appear to always be observing their environment and judging distance, and almost seem to calculate every movement, even if just moving their carapace to look around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Add to this that spiders(or at least T's) have poor eyesight and mostly perceive the world through vibrations on their hairs. To them we are big shadowy things that make a lot of noise. The 'more afraid of you than you are of them' thing is quite true.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For example, cats purposefully utilize the frequency range of a baby's cry when attempting to solicit care.</p>

<p>I never understood this though. I hear a cat meowing or a kitten mewing, and I want to cuddle it. I hear a baby making any noise whatsoever, especially crying, and I want to ram my face into a wall until I knock myself out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a reason for this - there's a counterveiling evolutionary reason to <em>not</em> find babies cute, because otherwise babies can potentially cause you survival harm (basically, by devoting too much care to the baby, and not enough to siblings/your own survival).</p>
<p>There's a sort of tug-of-war.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>kind of funny to think about, cats evolved to sound more like babies, babies evolved to sound less like babies, as a result, cats are more baby than babies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do scientists figure stuff like that out? I understand we can do tests to see things like, &quot;humans are predisposed to find babies cute&quot; and other concrete things. But how do we figure out why? How could we know that some people hating babies is based on evolution and not on, well, babies being annoying?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be because when a cat is meowing there is less of a social stigma of petting it or picking it up or otherwise trying to calm it. But in most cases a crying baby is with their carer already and if you, as a complete stranger, were to just walk over and try picking it up someone would call the cops.</p>
<p>So the stress you feel when hearing a cat in distress can be addressed because you can easily try and make it feel better, but the stress of hearing a child cry just builds and builds because in most social situations you expect the child's parent/carer to look after it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another fascinating fact is that the front cortex, the area of the brain responsible for the &quot;cuteness&quot; reaction, is the same part of the brain that processes  rage and violence. This is why you have the urge to squeeze the life of out of something tiny and adorable. This effect is observed in the novel &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; where Lenny keeps accidentally killing the mice he catches.</p></div>		</li>
