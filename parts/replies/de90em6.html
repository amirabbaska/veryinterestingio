			<div class="markdown"><p>You're getting down voted but this is exactly why there was fighting. These days with playback and the intense supervision of the league on every play and every action of every player the sanctions for foul play are much more serious even if it was not called during the game. So fighting does not have such an important role anymore. It's more traditional now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment was super relevant.  Fighting exists as a deterrent to getting dirty with the superstars.  It's not nearly as necessary as it was years ago, but the rules just haven't caught up.  </p></div>		</li>
