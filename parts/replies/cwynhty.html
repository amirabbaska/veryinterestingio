			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy to think that transistors on these processors are actually closer together than the wavelength of light. This makes etching extremely difficult. They use advanced lens techniques that I don't really understand to allow them to still etch. With heat and physical transistor limitations we will soon or later reach a peak before we are unable to keep the speed capacities increasing. People really take for granted what it has and does take to get these processors to where they are. Let's not even get into the rediculouness that is parrallel processing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically because the amount of time it takes for the signal to travel from one side of the processor die to the other. When you increase the processor, this time increases, necessarily making the whole thing slower. Yes, gigahertz processors are that fast. The speed at which electricity travels through it is becoming a bottleneck.</p></div>		</li>
