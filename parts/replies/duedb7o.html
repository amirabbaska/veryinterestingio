			<div class="markdown"><p>This area of study became a little contentious in our lab. A new postdoc was studying how 300 hz sound would cause stress responses in mice. </p>
<p>But, I studied hearing acuity in mice for my dissertation and mice don't hear below 1 kHz unless the sound is very loud. Even then they only go down to about 500 Hz. And my new colleague was claiming subtle 300 Hz sounds would distress mice.</p>
<p>It's weird, we both have evidence to support our claims. I think the key takeaway is that the sound is doing <em>something</em> to the mice. I would wager that pressure sensors in the skin and internal organs are detecting the 300 Hz sound. As others have noted there is a growing body of literature showing that daily noise is having deleterious effects on our health. I'm curious to find out what the trigger/cofactor is. I don't think it's as simple as increased cortisol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about the field but I've never really heard of someone saying infrasound with something that you could actually hear. I've always seen it implied as it was as more of a feeling or other kind of sensory response.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely the sound is having an effect in non-auditory cells. People normally forget that sound is a physical phenomenon (oscilatory and localized pressure) and not only a &quot;hearing phenomenon&quot;. Pressure over cells activate mechanical response genes, there is pleanty of scientific evidence. </p>
<p>Thinking that it's only cortisol is forgetting about the rest of the living organisms that respond to sound. I'm doing my PhD in sound effects over bacteria genetics, you could be surprised by the results. Or maybe not, because you have already intuited it ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High frequency sound waves have also been recently demonstrated to facilitate larger molecules crossing the blood-brain barrier, due to the mechanical changes they induce.  It's currently being explored as a mode of delivery for certain drugs AFAIK.</p></div>		</li>
