It is a fact that we have executed innocent people. Removing the wait and the appeals process would increase the rate at which that happens significantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean the answer would be to just remove the death penalty and let them rot in jail until they die of natural causes. The argument against that is typically &quot;Its such a waste of resources&quot; but because of all the appeals and courts and lawyers and so on it ends up being a lot more expensive to execute some one than just keep them in prison. I don't know what the answer is but yeah its kind of a mess.  </p></div>		</li>
