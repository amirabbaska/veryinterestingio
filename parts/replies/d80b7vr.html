<p>Just because we can make our calculations work with cross sections doesn't mean they represent the underlying physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I didn't mean the conclusions...just literally the underlying physics. Like you know how with little kids you can see from day to day how they're adding another layer of knowledge? I marvel at how much knowledge had to be assembled over so many lifetimes -- and at the theories and invention of tools to measure those theories -- in order to write that reply.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That general relativity is a model that's consistent with our measurements isn't quite the same as &quot;known&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the type of star and isotope of interest. Often there is agreement within the uncertainties of the calculations. Other times the abundances will be off by over an order of magnitude.</p></div>		</li>
