<p>The Nazis would literally get thousands of unsolicited letters everyday from Germans wanting their neighbours taken off to concentration camps. Often they weren't even really gay, just single and loners in a small town where people were arseholes. But it wouldn't just be one person in town writing letters, the Nazis would often received dozens from different people about the same completely harmless person so of course then the guilt of that person was then assumed as why else would all these normal people take time out of their day to write letters.  </p>

People making jokes about Hitler, in a pub when drunk for example, where snitched by the whole village collectively to make themself look good.</p></div>		</li>
