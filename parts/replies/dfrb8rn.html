			<div class="markdown"><p>I know someone who's a bit like that. </p>
<p>One example is that she very strictly doesn't tolerate people that lie to her, yet she lies regularly (often says things like &quot;I was supposed to hang out with [friend] but I don't want to, so I'm gonna tell her I'm sick/busy/working.&quot;) </p>
<p>It's not all bad qualities like that, but almost all the things she doesn't like about other people are qualities she also has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, this is one of those things that tends to rub me the wrong way, but others look past.</p>
<p>In your example, most people see a difference between serious, meaningful lies and &quot;little white lies,&quot; and some see the latter as a necessary tool. I tend to see them as the same thing with different severities; if you can rationalize and even pride yourself on the little stuff, the worse stuff will eventually not seem so bad.</p>
<p>I find I have a pretty negative reaction to people who rationalize away red flags, even if they don't technically do anything most people would consider wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I try not to tell white lies at all personally, I'd rather just tell someone &quot;I don't feel like leaving the house anymore&quot;, but usually if I say I'm gonna do something I stick to it. </p>
<p>I think it's more the double standard with the person in the example. She has literally cut friends out of her life after finding out they told her a white lie to get out of hanging out, but yet she does it all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh, I feel the same about another girl. We have such similar personalities but she is a lot more likeable, so I just find myself hating her because I feel like I should be in her position. Basically &quot;we're exactly the same, why don't people like me as much as they like her?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
