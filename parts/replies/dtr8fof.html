<p>In reality, if they wanted to prevent residual glare from their face, they would do blacking on the sides of the nose, as that's the only place with any appreciable amount of visible skin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's an interesting point. Do any athletes black their noses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in high school we all used eye black and many people put it over their noses. There is a noticeable difference and the best way to describe it is that your upper cheeks seem to disappear to yourself visually. You don’t notice the glare of your skin until it isn’t coming into your eyes anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I should probably fully specify in my OP that the eye black really only makes a difference with a visor which is why you don't really see it in other sports where head gear isn't worn. With a hat and eye black, you eyes experience significantly lower lux than with just the hat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By that same logic, if the lens hood on a camera isn't blocking the edges of the picture, it's not helping... but that's definitely not true.</p>
<p>It prevents light from coming in from angles too steep to make it to the sensor/retina, which won't be seen, but would still be detrimental to the sensor/retina perfectly &quot;seeing&quot; the light coming straight in through the lens/eyeball.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't really analogous. Without a lens good, the sun is shining directly on the glass, illuminating it, though it is out of the field of view. Blacking the cheeks doesn't change whether the sun is hitting the eyes directly or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to get killed for posting this, but I was told that Alaskan Malamutes (my dog) have their eye masks as an adaptation to deal with the glare from light on snow. Their fur is often white on their faces otherwise. They can't exactly wear sunglasses. I can't find the reference, but I just did a look at a bunch of northern dogs. Huskies, Swedish Elkhounds, Norwegian Elkhounds, Keeshond. That's like 3 continents of spitz dogs that have some kind of dark eye mask. Sorry for not being very scientific. I looked, honest.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gotta admit first that I know nothing about Alaskan Malamutes history. That said, most dogs breeds evolved through human forced selection, that means humans bred the dogs that had some qualities they wanted, like being good hunters, being strong, small, big... And since genetics are very complex and we didn't understand them very well,  a lot of unwanted characteristics also appeared as genetic byproducts, some are harmless (the shape of the ears, colors of fur...) and others are bad (diseases, malformations...).</p>
<p>If Alaskan Malamutes evolved without much human intervention, your explanation could be correct. But most of the dogs we have now have a lot of characteristics that are in no way adaptations to nature.</p>
<p>Edit: Also, wolves that live in snowy places don't have masks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're absolutely right. I talk about this a lot. All dogs have basically the same genotype. Only different phenotypes. A toy poodle is as dog a dog as a german shepherd. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong on that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also, wolves that live in snowy places don't have masks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, but wolves are all over. The wolves in snowy regions now used to be in non-snowy regions. We just pushed them out. Not only that, but it's the polar bear analogy. Wolves need camo more than they need non-glare. Sled dogs are doing very different things than hunting wolves. </p>
<p>So it might have been a bit of both. If Dog X was great at not pulling a sled off a cliff it might have been bred more by its human owners. And it might have not pulled a sled off a cliff because it happened to have a mask.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that it's not just dry dark skin we're dealing with but wet skin glistening with sweat. </p>
<p>With a layer of water (sweat) on the skin, the light absorption difference can be minimal if not more reflective with dark skin underneath the reflective water layer. </p></div>		</li>
