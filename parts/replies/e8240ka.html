<p>You could say it doesn't exist, that humans are just biological computers. But then, a person would have the same ethical value as a tree or a computer, which is clearly not the case. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. It seems like the hardest philosophical questions that we face all have background definitions of &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_it_when_I_see_it" target="_blank">I know it when I see it.</a>&quot; We intuitively know what consciousness is, but describing it technically is nearly impossible.</p>
<p>I know I'm conscious. I know you are conscious. I can't prove either.</p></div>		</li>
