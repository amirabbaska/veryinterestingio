			<div class="markdown"><p>But am I damaging my hearing if it doesn't hurt? For example, when I'm on the metro, I listen to a certain volume, it's not too loud when I'm in the train, but if I listen to music in that volume when I'm in a silent room, it feels too loud, am I damaging my hearing in both cases?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert in noise induced hearing loss but basically: If it hurts, you're definitely damaging your ears. If it doesn't hurt, it still might be doing damage to your hearing.</p>
<p>There's this rule I read about that says you should only listen to 60% volume for up to 60 minutes a day with earbuds (this is kinda silly, because not all volume ranges are the same, and some music is louder than others)</p>
<p>But if you're having trouble hearing with headphones at lower volumes it's worth investing for better fitting earbuds/headphones. If they can fit into your ears, it'll block out other sounds so that you can hear the music easier.</p>
<p>I also recommend earplugs for loud events, like concerts or monster truck riding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, yes you are. I forget the exact decibel level where you can have damage but if it's too loud in a silent room, it's too loud in the train.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer! Except the damage is the opposite... Yes, high pitches are more painful, but lower bass tones are actually a lot more destructive to your ears. The bass tones carry more energy, and are like someone banging on your door with a battering ram, as opposed to the high tones which are more like someone rapping incessantly on your door with a cane. The later is more annoying, but the former is more destructive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, your ear has an internal mechanism that can sort of turn off your ear, if it needs to, to protect itself from dangerous it distracting noises, in an emergency. (Source: &quot;On Combat: the psychology and physiology of deadly combat in war and peace&quot; by Grossman and Christensen)... This is why a lot of people who, for example, accidentally shoot themselves in the leg only hear the shoot as a bit of a pop, and don't have ringing ears after, because they had (if only subconsciously/instinctually) a slight warning that the sound was coming.</p></div>		</li>
