			<div class="markdown"><p>Let it also be known that all those &quot;titles&quot; don't always carry the same authority.  For example, here in Pennsylvania, sheriffs and sheriff's deputies do NOT have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_power_\(United_States_constitutional_law\)" target="_blank">Police Power</a> (power to compel obedience to laws) like actual Police Officers do.  </p>
<p>A sheriff can't pull you over for speeding, for example.  As far as I know, sheriffs in Pennsylvania <a href="http://www.mcall.com/news/mc-pa-court-sheriffs-police-power-bill-20170504-story.html" target="_blank">still don't have arrest power or investigative powers</a>.  But I know they were trying to change that, so it may no longer be so.</p>
<p>Of course, this differs from state to state.  The sheriffs in Texas DO have those powers.</p>
<p>So what DOES a sheriff in Pennsylvania do?  They ferry criminals from jail to court and back.  They are in courtrooms to keep the peace.  They might do search and rescue, or road patrol.  Many other duties, but there are some things that definitely do NOT overlap with the duties of Police Officers.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes and in many places in the US they still have Constables. TN still had Constables as late as 2008. Some counties still do. Although in TN they can arrest IIRC.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that every one of these classifications has asterisks attached to them. </p>
<p>Some counties (like Cobb, in GA) have both a Sheriff with deputies <em>and</em> a police department (which is separate from the police departments in the individual municipalities within Cobb County).</p>
<p>Fulton County (also in GA) has a Marshal's Department, alongside a Sheriff's Office and police departments in the separate municipalities in Fulton County (like Atlanta). The Marshal's office performs more of the functions related to the courts than the Sheriff's office does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to tag on the comment about the Texas Rangers, since I live there. The Rangers act kind of like a state level Secret Service/Marshal service for the state of Texas. They apparently do alot of coordination between Texas jurisdictions, as well as protection for the Governor.</p></div>		</li>
