			<div class="markdown"><p>Oy, so it turns out finding good Google Earth calibrated images of hurricane photos is hard! So many dead links, broken KMZ files... </p>
<p>Anyway, I found an OK one of Hurricane Flossie (2007). I'm developing a means of exporting NUKEMAP data to KMZ so it can run in Google Earth (because NUKEMAP3D died when Google discontinued support for the Google Earth Web Plugin — thanks, Google!). There are still a few features that need to be implemented so it isn't live yet, but I can render a few things pretty easily:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/9ijzjDr" target="_blank">Fireball of the 100 Mt Tsar Bomba in the eye of Hurricane Flossie</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/kfkOyJ1.jpg" target="_blank">Full-sized 100 Mt Tsar Bomba mushroom cloud rendered OVER Hurricane Flossie</a> — this is just an example, it wouldn't look like this in real life since Flossie wasn't actually flat, but it gives you a sense of how big the full mushroom cloud would be</p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://i.imgur.com/o6qQ4pL.jpg" target="_blank">Mushroom cloud at an angle</a> — again, not meant to be taken literally since I don't know the altitude of the hurricane and it is being rendered as a ground overlay (the mushroom cloud top is over 30 miles up, the diameter is 127 miles). </li>

<p>That's far taller than a typical hurricane (about 17 or so km, aka the height of the troposphere).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eye of a hurricane is characterised by low pressure, which keeps air rotating around it. It would definitely be interesting to see what the extreme pressures induced by detonating an atomic bomb in its center would do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm now suddenly terrified by thought that this question will probably get asked in the White House the next time a hurricane comes toward the U.S.</p>
<p>As a way to counteract global warming, would it be at all feasible to try to use tropical cyclones to generate electricity? I know it's like space elevator level possible but crazy expensive and challenging, but having structures to weaken hurricanes and use it for carbon-free power seems like it would pay for itself both ways. </p></div>		</li>
