			<div class="markdown"><p>You may have better results if those with genetic defects you didn't allow to breed, at least until you reached the stable point for your gene pool. I'm not saying toss them down a cliff, a la <em>300</em>, but just don't pass those defects on to future generations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Solid point.  There would have to be a trade-off point on this issue.  It would depend on how many breeding people in the pool did not have visible defects.  Because if the &quot;safe&quot; population drops too low we will need to let the &quot;defective&quot; population breed anyway.  But if the &quot;safe&quot; breeding population is high enough then excluding the defective would be optimal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I understand it, incest only produces genetic abnormalities because the two siblings are related and how genes work.</p>
<p>Obviously if I am carrying a set of recessive alleles which corresponds with a genetic abnormalities then there is a very large chance my sibling will be carrying those exact same alleles too, meaning that if we breed there is a high chance for those recessive genes to become expressed, aka for a genetic abnormality to occur. </p>
<p>Theoretically if you find/design/alter two humans with a genome that is genetically &quot;perfect&quot; in terms of abnormalities, you could inbreed for generations before genetic abnormalities occur through basic random mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you could design two humans without any of those recessive traps then the issue becomes moot, as you said.  Some people use this to explain how Adam and Eve could have been the original ancestors for all humanity--they were genetically perfect to start with.</p>
<p>If we are crunching numbers...well, let's assume that parent 1 has 1 recessive gene for a terrible condition.  Let's say in the population as a whole that 1/10,000 carry the gene.  For generation 1 of our experiment, the odds are 1/2 that an individual carries the gene recessively.  For generation 2, assuming it is generation 1 parents, the odds are 3/8 to carry the gene recessively and a whopping 1/16 chance to have the condition manifest (both genes the recessive disease).  Multiply this effect by multiple generations and multiple original imperfections and what we get is a severe clusterfuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if the recessive allele is homozygous in, say, the second generation, that individual is likely to die, and the recessive allele would decline in the population. It is therefore likely that the recessive allele would be strongly selected against in a small inbred population (much more quickly than in a large outbred population).  As long as you can keep some individuals alive, you could theoretically eliminate that allele from the population over time, just through natural selection.</p>
<p>This, in my opinion, makes the whole idea of a 'minimum viable population' somewhat moot, because it all depends on the frequency of recessive deleterious alleles in the population, which will be constantly changing.</p>
<p>In the book &quot;Song of the Dodo&quot;, David Quammen outlines the story of the Mauritius Kestrel, which declined to just 4 individuals at one point.  Conservation biologists figured it was a lost cause, since their models would predict horrific inbreeding effects in such a small population. The population has rebounded well, however, and is doing much better today.  </p>
<p>Quammen pointed out that this population has historically had a very small range that could only have supported small populations. He suggested that recessive alleles have long since been selected out of the population, which allows them to survive population bottlenecks without issue.  </p>
<p>I find this to be an interesting idea, and maybe it suggests that there is no &quot;magic number&quot; for a minimum viable population size: it all depends on historical trends and the current genetic makeup of the population.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;High chance&quot; is probably overstating it.  If you assume both siblings are just carriers of a single allele of a recessive disease, there's only a 1 in 4 chance of the child actually having the disease, although a 2 in 4 chance of the child being a single allele carrier of the disease, no worse off than either parent, but no better.</p>
<p>It's an unacceptably high risk to take when other breeding partners are available, but it's still a 3 in 4 chance of any offspring being no worse off than their parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would hold true if the offspring's potential mates were drawn from a whole population, but we are mating these offspring with each other rather than a random other individual.  Basically, the parent with the single disease allele mated with someone from the general population who had, say, a 1/10,000 chance of also being a single allele carrier.  But the offspring have a significantly higher likelihood of having the allele, so when they mate there is a 1/16 chance of <em>both</em> parents passing the allele and the condition being expressed, and 3/8 for passing a single allele to the offspring.  Those numbers are pretty damn high.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We know that a single mating pair would not be enough to keep humans alive. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think we know that at all.  In fact, I strongly suspect it's not true.  You can grow full populations of other species of mammals from a pair, or even a single pregnant female (see: domestic Syrian golden hamster) though that would be a lot harder or impossible with humans given our generation times and typically single births.  </p>
<p>The main reason a pair might not be enough is the fact that humans are group living animals and would have a hard time foraging and caring for offspring, etc, with no group support.  But if you put them in a predator free environment and provided them with food and shelter, you could avoid that problem for the most part.  They'd also have to avoid the behavioral pressure not to breed in such a situation...this effect helped wipe out the passenger pigeons.  Once there were too few, the rest didn't have the right social situation to exhibit breeding behavior.  But barring all that, I don't think the genetics are an insurmountable problem.</p>
<p>You'd get plenty of birth defects true, but to actually halt population growth you have to get an extremely high percentage of inviable offspring, and that's unlikely to happen.  Once you get past the initial small population, there's no &quot;time limit&quot; imposed.  Barring a nasty disease that the population can't avoid coming along before mutations build up again, a population that made it past the early danger zone would be set.</p></div>		</li>
