			<div class="markdown"><p>The company I work for has a plant in rural middle of nowhere SC cheap land, tax incentives, and unskilled labor is lower cost there. but it's often hard to hire and keep more skilled labor because most of them don't want to live in such a rural area. Recently we have a couple employees who  have a deal with a motel near the plant and stay there monday through thursday. this way their family can live a 1.5~2 hours away in one of the major cities which is better for kids and spouses (schools, social life, activities etc..) and they aren't too far away to get back on fridays and the weekends.  this is a pretty sweet deal for the motel because you have a room occupied the 18~20 nights a month that it's typically unoccupied and the room is open for the weekends where you might get a surge of better paying buisness</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since the motel properties are usually paid for, any monies that the owners receive is profit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't mean they don't have property taxes to pay.  I've seen motels, that judging by the town, probably pay at least $20K a year.</p>
<p>I know nothing about the motel business.  Don't know if that is considered a lot of money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In many municipalities, the tax structures are different , depending upon what type of business is operated. In my own area, many of the &quot;residential motels&quot; are behind in their taxes and only pay when threatened with foreclosure or prosecution. Even then, after the usual amnesty, they often settle the matters for pennies on the dollar.</p>
<p>It's kind of an &quot;open secret&quot; for which the city and county attempt to offset these losses by increased scrutiny of the property and fines for delinquent structural and maintenance issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea but that's peanuts (though it's probably more than that...I know people who pay almost that for their house). But rough math says 50 rooms @ $30/night and 70% fill is $383k. Have 5 full time people running the desk at $40k each and 4 maids at $30k, and $50k in property taxes gets them $30k/yr profit. Play with the rates a bit and you make boatloads of cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the math for the type of places that op is referencing though is more like 30% full on average, staff is making about 30k for the shift manager (which may be the only employee) and the cleaning service is probably getting about $7.50/hr. These motels usually have between 20-50 rooms and their clientele looks like they stayed up all night the past 5 nights cooking meth and then some construction workers who buy their product. Yay the south is sweet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Local politicians love to overtax commercial property, because only a tiny portion of voters actually own commercial real estate, whereas a much larger portion own housing. Voters want to see quality schools, but at the same time they don't want to pay high property taxes.</p>
<p>This is why commercial real estate almost always gets taxed the hardest. And this model won't work forever. As retailers start to die out as a result of online stores and delivery, and offices start going remote and workers work from home, eventually towns will need to find new ways to fund their public organizations such as schools.</p></div>		</li>
