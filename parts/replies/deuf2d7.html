			<div class="markdown"><p>I have seven spots of grey/white hair. My hair is normally brown. </p>
<p>I have been told that it's where angels kissed my head. My mom said that when <del>u</del> I was very young, I said that it's where I was shot by a plane in a past life. I have also been told that fairies dye my hair in my sleep. </p>
<p>I just think it's a kind of neat thing. It's only really noticeable once it's pointed out or once my hair grown out really long.  </p>
