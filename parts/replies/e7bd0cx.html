In summary, it's incredibly complicated (as is all of climate science), and the amount that each effect contributes is not fully understood. The causes/contributing factors in our climate cycles (for which ice ages represent on end of) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Period changes in earth's axial tilt and orbital eccentricity</li>
<li>Periodic changes in solar output</li>
<li>The position of the tectonic plates</li>
<li>Oceanic current cycles</li>
<li>Earth's atmospheric composition--most notably volcanism, and anthropogenic CO2 currently being released</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated, but first you have to define two different scales of change or it gets hopelessly confusing.</p>
<p>The Earth fluctuates over the last half billion years or so between periods that don't have Ice Ages or major continental ice sheets (&quot;greenhouse&quot; phases) and periods that do (&quot;icehouse&quot; phases).  These last tens to a couple hundred million years.  For example, for the entire Mesozoic Era and the first half of the Cenozoic there were no continental ice sheets.  None.  There were probably glaciers in mountain ranges still, but ice sheets like Antarctica or Greenland simply didn't exist in those times, let alone ones that covered more mid-latitude continents.  We know this because in the Cretaceous Period, for example, even at high latitudes near the poles we have full forests and what would be considered warm temperate climate conditions that only briefly may have dropped below freezing.  The whole Earth was generally warmer or at least had a more evenly distributed temperature.</p>
<p>This &quot;long term&quot; scale of fluctuation is not explained by periodic variation in the Earth's orbital parameters (eccentricity, axial tilt, etc.), known as Milankovitch cycles.  Those latter cycles are too short (tens to hundreds of thousands of years).  The long-term cycles are controlled by things such as CO2 concentration, solar output, and continental position and its effect on ocean currents.  Basically, the Earth's continents and oceans have to be in the right configuration or an Ice Age doesn't happen.</p>
<p>In the long-term cycle, we've now got Antarctica parked roughly over the south pole and a relatively isolated Arctic Ocean.  This sets up the conditions where Ice Ages can occur in the long-term sense.  Those conditions have existed since ~30 million years ago in the transition between the Eocene and Oligocene, which seems to be about the time that the first ice sheets show up in Antarctica.</p>
<p>Once you have the right conditions for an Ice Age, it's like the Earth is in a sensitive state where it can flip-flop between two climate modes: interglacial like now, or glacial with ice sheets as far south as New York or Germany.  Individual glacial and interglacial periods occur on shorter scale (tens to hundreds of thousands of years).  The most recent glaciation was the Wisconsinan (~750000 to ~10000 years ago), but there were many glacial and interglacial stages before that.  Since about 10000 years ago we've been in an interglacial known as the Holocene.</p>
<p>This sensitive, short-term fluctuation appears to be controlled by Milankovitch cycles, and the key factor seems to be what happens in the mid latitudes in places like northern North America and northern Europe in order to accumulate more permanent snow.  The exact timing of maximum and minimum solar insolation with the seasons in the mid-latitudes is probably a big part of it.</p>
<p>It's important to understand that this sensitivity isn't merely about it being &quot;colder&quot;, it's also about delivering enough precipitation in the form of snow to those latitudes, so you need the right ocean current setup at the same time as cool enough temperatures to precipitate plenty of snow (might imply warm oceans somewhere nearby), but not melt all of it before the summer is over.  Once you start doing that the system is prone to tipping towards more accumulation because 1) ice reflects more sunlight than bare ground, and 2) eventually an ice sheet develops enough altitude that it reaches heights that are cold, as if it was creating its own mountain.</p>
<p>If you go back far enough (older than 545 million years or so in the Precambrian), you get into a range where the Sun was significantly dimmer, and there is evidence that at times the Earth experienced more substantial glaciations that reached all the way to the equator, the so-called &quot;snowball Earth&quot; situation.  There's plenty of controversy about whether it truly got that extreme, but regardless Precambrian glaciations appear to have been more intense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have always been fascinated by this idea:  &quot;Global cooling in the Cenozoic, which led to the growth of large  continental ice sheets in both hemispheres, may have been caused by the  uplift of the Tibetan plateau and the positive feedbacks initiated by  this event. In particular, tectonically driven increases in chemical  weathering may have resulted in a decrease of atmospheric C02 concentration over the past 40 Myr.&quot;</p>

<p>We are technically still in an ice age, called the <del>Holocene</del> <strong>Pleistocene</strong>, which started 2.6Mya</p>

<p>It’s semantics, sorry. Pleistocene started ~2.53 million years ago, while the Holocene is younger at ~10k. Frankly the Holocene is just another hot spot in a cold world, mimicking the Eemian before it (~130,000 years ago). </p>
<p>But important to frame our current predicament with global warming. Each glacial period had ~185 ppm CO2, each interglacial (like the Holocene) has 285 ppm CO2. We crossed 410 ppm CO2 this year. </p>
<p>Put more frankly, 285 ppm CO2 leads to nice July days in New York City. 185 ppm CO2 means a mile of ice on top of New York City in July. What will 410 ppm CO2 mean, let alone the fact our foot is still on the gas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thankfully co2’s greenhouse effect is logarithmic, meaning each additional molecule has slightly less effect than the last. One might then warn about positive feedbacks, but be wary of anyone who claims positive feedback science is well understood, testable and predictable on global scales. It isn’t, with any reliable accuracy.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I belonged to a beekeeping club and they invited a guy from NASA to give us a lecture on global warming and it's impact on beekeeping.  </p>
<p>So this guy paints this picture of doom and gloom and claimed that if the climate in our area increases by 1 or 2 degrees honeybees will die off.  This made no sense to me at all sense he was describing the climate which is 200 miles south of my state which has no problem with raising honeybees.  He also only talked about CO2 being the cause of global warming. So at the end I asked a few questions such as how do you know bees will die off since the the effect for this hardiness zone will be a warmer winter and a hotter summer, which actually benefits honeybees.  He proceeded to say that the bees will be out of phase with flowers and will starve, which again made no sense since flowers bloom as the length of the day increases and with temperature.  Which is why in my area we see some flowers bloom in January and some years in march.  Honeybees will leave the hive to find food as soon as the temperature gets warm.  I've seen them out of the hive in January.   So I asked him why he hadn't discussed the output of the sun on global warming.  He became red in the face and literally said &quot;the sun has no effect on climate&quot;.  People literally began giggling at that point.  </p>
<p>After the discussion, I asked an entomologist in the club what he thought about the bees dying off due to global warming and he said, he's wrong, it just doesn't work like he described.  </p>
<p>I'm certainly not a global warming denier but spreading nonsense helps no one.  I was shocked that someone using his NASA credentials would be distributing information which was so inaccurate.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is where we disagree. I don’t see any basis for separating the Holocene from the Pleistocene  climatically. A case can be made for relabeling it due to  changes in human development (eg expansion and agriculture), but the distinction is not meaningful for describing natural climatic processes. Nothing makes the Holocene magically different from its interglacial predecessors.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://projects.ncsu.edu/project/treesofstrength/treefact.htm" target="_blank">A single tree can absorb around 48 pounds of CO2 in a year</a>. If we assume it lives for 40 years, we can estimate that it is responsible for sequestering 2,000 pounds of CO2 during its lifetime. </p>
<p>In 2014, the USA alone emitted 15.1 trillion pounds of CO2 into the atmosphere. So, for just the USA, and just the year 2014, we’d need to plant 7.55 billion trees. And the USA isn’t the main emitter of CO2. Globally, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/carbon-dioxide-emissions-rise-to-24-million-pounds-per-second/" target="_blank">we emit 2.4 million pounds of CO2 <em>per second</em></a>. So in the time it has taken to read this message so far, we’d need to plant 14 million trees. </p>
<p>So, getting back to your question, it would take a fuckton of trees to undo the CO2 emitted since we started this conversation. But to get back to 185 ppm CO2, last seen in the Late Glacial Maximum around ~20,000 years ago, we’d need to plant a lot. Let’s do the math. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/print.php?r=45" target="_blank">1 ppm CO2 roughly equals 17.2 trillion pounds of CO2</a>. To undo one ppm CO2, we need to plant 8.6 billion trees. <a href="https://www.co2.earth" target="_blank">We hit 410 ppm CO2 earlier this year in the middle of the summer</a>. To get down to 285 ppm CO2 - the pre-industrial average,  we’d need to plant over one trillion trees. To get back to the ice age, we’d need to plant 2 trillion trees on top of <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-many-trees-are-there-in-the-world-video/" target="_blank">the three trillion we have today</a>. </p>
<p>But - this part is important - those trees cannot decay, or else they’d re-release the CO2 to the atmosphere. We’d need to bury them completely for the effect to last. A healthy forest needs around <a href="http://www.sbcounty.gov/calmast/sbc/html/healthy_forest.asp" target="_blank">60 trees per acre</a>. For our purpose, let’s not go back to the ice age, but just undo our effects to the atmosphere (ignoring ocean acidification). That would require about 16.7 billion acres, or 26 million square miles. For comparison, Russia is 6.6 million square miles in area. Let’s assume a maximum height of 40 feet for our trees. We’d need 5.5 trillion square feet of sediment to bury it.  </p>
<p>Let me know if I missed anything or made mistakes in my math. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To add to your last point: many people confuse ice ages with glacial periods/ cold stages. So when most of europe was covered in ice for 10-100k years that's a glacial period of the ice age. </p></div>		</li>
