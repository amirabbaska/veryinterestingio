			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh, thats not economics it's finance. </p>
<p>To clarify my point: economics is largely taught in highschool classes, and this isn't that. To learn finance you by-and-large have to go to buisniness school, which not many people do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's 100% correct if you would apply it on long term movements (can be as long as 5+ years) . In the long run it's inevitable, but not really applicable for short term movements.</p>
<p>you could also argue that the stockmarked is not 100% efficient  and is not strictly based on underlying value, but more on sentiment. In my experience those kind of drops are mainly caused by daytraders(/flashtraders) &quot;predicting&quot; the movement, and thus making it a self fulfilling profecy, of which they can make money... Then &quot;savings&quot; are announced to prop it back up. Those savings are either really executed (meaning they already wanted to do it and now have a valid excuse), or just forgotten about in a couple of weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just add, the perception of job performance and pay of CEO's and other executives is very linked to these short-term results and Wall Street reacts pretty negatively to missed expectations. In some ways, this distorts incentives of CEO's towards short-term results instead of long-term results. I would say to much focus on short term results is one of the problems currently facing our markets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, even though it's usually far more expensive to fire someone and then have to hire a replacement the next year. </p>
<p>Hiring freezes usually make more sense since the employee is already gone anyway </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really accurate. In order to maintain profitability, a company needs to grow faster than the rate of inflation. If a companies earnings (revenue) drops by 3%, that is usually a pretty significant loss, unless operating costs have dropped similarly. Say you have a million bucks in revenue. If that drops by 3%, that's 30 thousand a year, or nearly two 2017 minimum wage workers. Furthermore, since the inflation rate is 2% you might have to actually fire one or two more minimum wage workers to maintain your profit margins. If you're accustomed to making 10 or 100 million annually, then that's a lot pf layoffs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hope this isn't a bad question - Do a company's assets have no bearing on its valuation?  For instance, Coca Cola owns brands that would be considered nearly priceless assets even if their company suddenly became unprofitable altogether.  Or if a company has, say, no debt and has billions in cash, and a share of their stock represents some fraction of the company and thus some fraction of that cash, isn't there value in that even if the company never earns another penny?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They absolutely can. But it depends on the type of company. A company in heavy industry might have assets which form a large part of the balance sheet. A tech company has basically (comparatively) worthless physical assets but has a lot of value in IP. Companies like Coca Cola have a lot of &quot;good will&quot;, or brand value.</p>
<p>Sometimes you'll have companies where the company valuation, for whatever reason, is *lower* than the tangible assets. In these cases you'll frequently get finance companies who will buy them wholesale and strip them for their assets. These are sometimes referred to as &quot;vulture capitalists&quot;, and hated because all the employees usually get fired. But it's also pretty rare because that kind of valuation just doesn't make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coca-Cola’s assets are valuable only insofar as they help Coke, or whichever company owns the assets, make money. If Coke suddenly turned unprofitable and was being sold for scraps, potential buyers would need to do their own valuation of Coke’s assets by determining how much future earnings they stood to gain by owning those assets. They would do it in a similar way: by figuring out the future cash flows of those assets (basically the future profit those assets will net them) and then figure out their current value based on that.</p>
<p>A company with lots of cash but no earnings or other assets or liabilities would probably be valued more or less equal to value of their cash on hand since cash has a pretty straightforward value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess what I don't get is this - there are companies that pay a very low dividend or sometimes even no dividend at all, even when the company's profits are large.  Thus, it seems from my layman's perspective that the price of the such a company's stock should have very little to do with the company's profitability, since these profits basically aren't ever distributed to the shareholders.  So how then do investors determine a price for such companies and why would anyone want to own stock in such a company?  </p></div>		</li>
