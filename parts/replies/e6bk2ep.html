			<div class="markdown"><p>I’d like to add if you have poor tear quality, wear contact lens or even around air conditioning, then you may find this occurring during the day too, and at night it doesn’t quite solidify so you wake up with eyes that feel sticky! </p>
<p>It is a real pain, been dealing with it for a couple years now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glad to hear it has worked for you, sadly nothing I’ve tried so far has had much relief, bathing my eye with hot boiled water is slightly helpful. </p>
<p>I wear RGP lenses, well just the one at the minute, had a Cornea transplant in April on one eye. Have a disease called Keratoconus. Hoping I can eventually wear glasses. </p></div>		</li>
