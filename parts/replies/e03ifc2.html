			<div class="markdown"><p>But it does matter. A speakers efficiency is not the same at every frequency. Just like a car doesn't make the same horsepower at every RPM. It is a curve and it tapers at each end.</p>
<p>If you make a speaker only go from 20hz to 20khz it will perform very poorly near the ends. By extending that out, you can get more accurate reproduction in the range we DO hear.</p>
<p>Also, on the lower end, you actually CAN hear below 20hz, it just takes a TON of power to do it. Plus you can FEEL it, so lower is better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just in the interest of knowledge, 20,000Hz is not the definitive cut-off for hearing in all humans. Most people just don’t take proper care of their ears when they are young so a fair amount of the population can’t hear above 16kHz by the time they are 25.</p>
<p>I don’t have a source for this, but when I was in school I was taught women also generally tend to have slightly better hearing range than men, up to about 22kHz iirc.</p>

<p>I was able to find this article where a negligible amount of people were able to perceive all the way up to 28kHz under controlled listening conditions as well.</p>
<p>I recently had my ears checked and can still perceive up to about 21.5kHz as well, albeit very softly.</p>
<p>All this to say that headphones and speakers with frequency ranges up to the 25-30kHz range aren’t entirely unnecessary, just that the majority of people don’t get any added benefit from them.</p></div>		</li>
