			<div class="markdown"><p>Got to any paint store.  There are a zillion silly names for every hue and shade of the common colors.  Some of them are already in common use.  Do you already differentiate maroon from red, or chartreuse from greenish yellow, or gold from dark yellow?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In modern times, with all the commercially available paints and so on, we have names for so many different shades that it's unlikely, though not impossible, that we'll have another big category of colour be named. That said, other cultures have distinct names for colours we would just consider a shade of another color.</p>
<p>In Japan for instance, they have a colour they call mizu, which we would think of as a very light blue. Much like we call light red pink and consider it to be its own colour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again though, we DO SEE those wavelengths of light. We SEE those colors, just as the Greeks could SEE blue. We just haven't maybe given them their own distinctive names yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was hoping someone would mention this! I - for the life of me - cannot find the study that was done, but color wheels of varying shades of certain colors were displayed to peoples of differing socio-ethnic backgrounds. There was one society that had nearly hundreds of words that identified greens, yet only a few for red; when shown to these people, they would give a name to 7 out of 8 differing - oh so very slightly - of the samples of green. Typical Europeans/Americans would only point out one, or two at best. Yet the exact opposite would occur with the red color wheel.  </p>
<p>This is going to bug the tar out of me until I find the article. If I do, I'll link it in an edit.</p></div>		</li>
