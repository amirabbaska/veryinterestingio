			<div class="markdown"><p>There are different sizes of infinity. For example, the integers can never be paired off with the real numbers because there just aren't &quot;enough&quot; integers. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality" target="_blank">cardinality.</a></p>
<p>The continuum hypothesis is that there is no set whose size is larger than the integers, but smaller than the reals.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fermat's theorem is actually pretty dang useful in computing. You use it in congruences, which in turn makes it possible to quickly verify if a number is divisible by another or not, thus being essential in fractional math in computing</p></div>		</li>
