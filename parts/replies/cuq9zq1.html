			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy fuck, can you imagine just being sat in an electrified cage being excruciatingly shocked until you die of cardiac arrest or shock (edit: pun unintended) or something? Did it have any shutdown periods or anything? Was it not enough just to keep the guy in the cage until the owner came in next morning?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So clearly the law wasn't carried out correctly in this instance. But he was robbed 10 times that year and went to the police many times to no avail. And the guy he killed was a convicted burgler and rapist. So I don't think anyone is losing too much sleep over this specific scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a previous thread on this very same subject, many Redditors told of emergency responders and officials almost dying due to booby traps or being exceedingly careful when entering homes during the foreclosure bubble.</p>
<p>Murderous idiots would booby trap their homes to kill and maim anyone who entered them to &quot;prevent&quot; their homes from being foreclosed on and  then innocent people would pay the price.</p>
<p>Which is exactly why booby traps are illegal.</p></div>		</li>

My friend has a contract with HUD in a decent sized city and has foreclosed probably thousands of homes over the years and never saw this.... lots of dildos and disgusting messes unfit for rats to live in, but never any booby traps.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This!  I was on medic duty when we were called out to a situation like this.  We have one guy in our area who is just a bit off in the head. When he's on his meds, he's a funny old guy, but when he's off his meds he's paranoid and often hurts himself (accidentally). One time we went searching for him because a his medical alarm went off, but we wouldn't even get near the front door because of the sign that said, &quot;Door guarded by shotgun.&quot;  We were speaking with our cop escort, and they said that there is a booby trap on that door, so we made sure to check the whole property before making the officer attempt an entry. </p>
<p>Luckily the man had just fallen asleep and the medical alarm went off in error, he opened the door for us and pretty much thanked us for coming out and checking on him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And for those that want to skip that here is the short resumé:</p>
<p>Elderly lady (age 79) was sitting in the passenger seat in a car that was stopped in the parking lot of the McDonald’s where she had bought the coffee. She had the cup between her knees while removing the lid to add cream and sugar when the cup tipped over and spilled the entire contents on her lap.</p>
<p>The coffee was not just “hot,” but dangerously hot. McDonald’s corporate policy was to serve it at a temperature that could cause serious burns in seconds. Mrs. Liebeck’s injuries were far from frivolous. She was wearing sweatpants that absorbed the coffee and kept it against her skin. She suffered third-degree burns (the most serious kind) and required skin grafts on her inner thighs and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Liebeck’s case was far from an isolated event. McDonald’s had received more than 700 previous reports of injury from its coffee, including reports of third-degree burns, and had paid settlements in some cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the approximation of that case isn't actually that far from the truth. And yes, I've read the case.</p>
<p>She did sue for the product being given to her exactly as intended. The severity of her injuries are irrelevant, and are only used to garner sympathy. She alone was responsible for the accident that she caused to herself.</p>
<p>The fact remains that she herself sat her coffee in her own lap, and then proceeded to take the lid off of that coffee and then proceeded to spill it on herself, while she was wearing sweatpants. None of that had anything at all to do with mcdonalds.</p>
<p>Coffee, whether it's 140° or 180° is hot. You probably don't want to spill it on yourself. In fact, it was 180° because enough of their customers were complaining that their coffee was too cold by the time they got to work to drink it, so Mcdonalds did what their customers wanted, and then got taken to the cleaners because of it.</p>
<p>Mcdonalds did not violate any industry standard or FDA regulation by serving coffee at 180°</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Indiana, a federal district judge concluded the industry standard for coffee temperature is between 170° and 205° F. In Minnesota, a court ruled coffee brewed at 190° and held at 180° is within industry standards. These judicial determinations are supported by the fact that most home coffee machines hold coffee for serving at temperatures between 170° and 185° F.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you take the covers off of your electrical outlets and your toddler gets electrocuted from it, should you be able to sue the power company for providing the electrical outlet with electricity? Because that's essentially what her lawsuit was.</p>
<p>Mcdonalds did not force her to spill coffee on herself. She sued because she couldn't afford her medical bills. She was rewarded an outrageous sum of money because her lawyer played the sympathy card and it worked on a jury that doesn't understand what personal responsibility means.</p>
<p>If the US had a proper socialized healthcare system like every other civilized nation, she never would have sued in the first place, there wouldn't be warning labels stating the obvious and ambulance chasers wouldn't exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always post in response to the McDonald's Hot Coffee Lawsuit, because it seems like the pendulum has swung too far in the the other direction on Reddit.
A few facts about the case and hot coffee in general. The coffee was indeed 180-190 degrees but that is not far from industry standards and you'll find equally hot coffee at Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, and convenience stores today. All liquids that are over 160 F will give you 3rd degree burns in under a minute. This inherent danger persists with very few challenges.</p>
<p>It is often argued that McDonald's lost because they knew about a danger and failed to act. This is not the case. In fact, McDonald's did not change their brewing practices as a result of the lawsuit, simply because there was nothing to change. Following the Liebeck case, no other &quot;hot coffee&quot; lawsuit against McDonald's or any other establishment has been successful. See: McMahon vs. Bunn for interesting discussion on how hot coffee that can scald is not itself a defective product. <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1365042.html" target="_blank">http://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-7th-circuit/1365042.html</a></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of misinformation surrounding the case, mostly that it has something to do with a flimsy cup falling apart,and that's why Liebeck won the case. This is simply not true. Liebeck received the cup of coffee without issue, removed the lid and held the open cup between her legs to add cream and sugar. The cup tipped over and spilled onto her lap.</p>
<p>The American Coffee Association recommends coffee be brewed at 205 F. When restaurants brew at this recommended temperature directory into an airtight thermos, it stays above 180 F for hours. This is very common.
Consider that many Americans make tea with boiling water 212 F at home regularly.</p>
<p>There is indeed the common misconception that Liebeck was greedy and that the lawsuit was frivolous that got trumpeted around. However, Liebeck's victory was unexpected and would be unlikely to win if it were heard again. The most common legal explanation is that she was awarded damages by a sympathetic jury.</p></div>		</li>
