			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds like a interesting VR game (at least for nerds). Get dropped in a random part of the galaxy and you have to get home. Score is based on number of moves or time taken. Difficulty modifiers include absense/presence of dust clouds or other physical phenomena that may occlude observations and whether those pesky vogons reach Earth first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any idea how many a few is? I did a bit of searching but the few sources I found discussing this just use a generic term like 'a few' or similar.</p>
<p>I'd definitely day alpha centauri is within a few light years and I'm curious if they would make it that far. Even if the chances are pretty low any thing will detect them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So,  from Alpha Centauri, would the Sun appear like it is in the Centaur constellation (and presumably it would also be Alpha Centauri, i.e. the most bright star in the constellation, because Alpha Centauri A has a similar absolute magnitude to the Sun's)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, of course - that's pretty much in the opposite direction since you're looking from Alpha Centauri to the Sun and not vice versa. And it'd be by far the brightest star in Cassiopeia.</p></div>		</li>
