			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much. If I had some really good ideas about how to exercise, those ideas don't become invalid just because I happened to get an unrelated knee injury at 22, or because I had genetics that prevented my muscles from reaching the same level as for example Usain Bolt.</p>
<p>Obligatory car analogy: A racing driver's chances of victory are dependent just as much by the team's mechanics as the driver's own skills. A sprinter's &quot;vehicle&quot; is their body, and the sprinter him/herself doesn't necessarily know all that much about physiology or the psychology required to train hard every day for years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I trained under some of the best grappling coaches in the SE United States and it's not even about injuries keeping these guys from being top level competitors. It's just a different set of skills. </p>
<p>When you're competing, it's more reactionary than anything. You really don't... at least in combat sports... have the opportunity to really think about what's going on. It's said if you're thinking you're a step behind. Really hard to explain to someone whos not been there themselves but some people just have the ability to go into autopilot and be moved ahead of their opponent. These are the world class competitors. </p>
<p>On the flip side there are people that understand the nuances of what they are seeing. They also have the interpersonal skills to be able to explain that to their students and push and drive them in a direction that will help them improve. </p>
<p>The best competitors I've been around weren't the best coaches. And the best coaches had lack luster competition performance. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another good example to add to your explaination is that there are superstars that can't coach for shit. Mike Singletary was an amazing NFL linebacker, but while he was able to identify flaws in a player's actions and decisions, he didn't seem to grasp that very few players can match his physical ability. He'd get on a guy about not laying out a blocker and hustling over to the ball carrier fast enough when the player had given it everything he had, but Singletary used to do that with ease. He coached everyone like he was coaching a younger image of himself.</p></div>		</li>
