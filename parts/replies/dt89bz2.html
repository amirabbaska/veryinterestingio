			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone can correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe it’s because fighting the infection is prioritized over making you feel okay. Your body is under a lot of distress fighting off this infection- your temperature rises for viral infections in order to denature the virus proteins. They “die” (are inactivated), but your cells also don’t function optimally at those temperatures. The added mucus is unpleasant in your throat, but is one of the first barriers in preventing further infections. Your body is using a lot of energy to fight, so you feel tired.</p>
<p>I don’t think it has much to do with evolutionarily trying to make you feel bad, but instead there was no reason for evolution to “fix” feeling bad, because you don’t die of feeling bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be very surprised if the &gt;4˚C temperature increase during a fever caused viral proteins to denature (this also wouldn't make sense evolutionarily, there's nothing that makes viral proteins inherently less stable than any other protein). Instead, fever increases blood flow and boosts the immune system so that it can eliminate the infection faster.<br />
I agree with your comment about evolution not having a reason to fix feeling bad. I've linked a good review on how fever boosts the immune system below.

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting article. Thank you. If I understand the implications correctly, for a common infection like the flu you should let the fever run its course and not take fever reducing medicine like aspirin, but for severe infections like sepsis or for neurological injuries you should block the fever or even actively lower the body temperature below normal. (I would assume that for either of the latter two you would be in a hospital under the care of professionals.)</p></div>		</li>
