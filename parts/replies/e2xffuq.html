			<div class="markdown"><p>The word humane is a stupid word.</p>
<p>&quot;So you're telling me we're going to name the word for mercy and justice after the same species that caused all wars, including the World War 1 and 2; vastly expanded upon methods of torture, and capitalized on child porn?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I guess our species is just really good at propaganda. This is going to be really helpful once we make English the official language of the Galactic Federation&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Oklahoma is the first state where it is being designated as the primary method of execution, but I believe it is an option in a few other US states.</p></div>		</li>
