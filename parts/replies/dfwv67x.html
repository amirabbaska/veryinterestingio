<p>Seems like the people responsible for evacuating victims from sarin gas should have known this....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're gonna kill a dude and you want to take his house, you should kill him without destroying the house.</p>
<p>Killing the dude ain't right, taking his house ain't right. But the question is &quot;why kill the dude this way instead of that way&quot;, not &quot;was it okay or morally better to do it this way than that way?&quot;. It was a question of why and not a question of which is better.</p>
<p>OP hints at the morality question by juxtaposing the image effects of each, but ultimately the answer is a &quot;it's just good business&quot; kind of answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably.</p>
<p>Probably to do with where you shop for conventional weapons Vs chemical weapons too. </p>
<p>In the west we don't sell chem weapons so it's just not good for business.</p></div>		</li>
