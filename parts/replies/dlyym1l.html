			<div class="markdown"><p>Gamma Ray's are used all the time in imaging, it has its own modality, Nuclear Medicine.  Gamma Ray's are actually usually higher energy than x-ray (at least in the medical field) and aren't used more prevalently for imaging because they penetrate <strong>too much</strong> therefore they pass right through the detector.  </p>
<p>Gamma Ray's and X-rays are practically the exact same thing, they are just named differently base on where they originate from, X-rays from the electron shell and gamma Ray's from the nucleus or from an annihilation event of a positron and electron.</p>

<p>Edit: X-rays arent reflected off bones, they are absorbed by bones because they are more dense then the surrounding tissue, where as they pass through the surrounding tissue because it is less dense. A X-ray film is actually a graphical display of what X-rays actually made it <strong>through</strong> the patient, not what's reflected.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, actually gamma rays and high energy, or sometimes known as &quot;hard&quot; x-rays share a certain part of the EM spectrum, but where the x-rays end, the gamma rays begin and go on to even higher energies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As they alluded to in their comment, there is more than one way to define x-rays and gamma rays. In some fields, you draw a totally arbitrary line along the EM spectrum, and call everything with an energy higher than that line a gamma ray.</p>
<p>However in medical physics, they are defined by their origin and not by their energy. X-rays come from atomic transitions and bremsstrahlung, while gamma rays come from nuclear transitions and high-energy processes like e^(+)e^(-) annihilation. Using this definition, the set of possible x-rays and the set of possible gamma rays have a fairly large overlap in energy. There are x-rays with more energy than some gamma rays.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanted to point out that x-rays and gamma photos are distinctly different in terms of origin. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key difference between gamma rays and X-rays is how they are produced. Gamma rays originate from the nucleus of a radionuclide after radioactive decay whereas X-rays are produced when electrons strike a target or when electrons are rearranged within an atom.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this is where the nomenclature around gamma can get confusing. Historically yes the name distinction came about because those different physical processes produce radiation in distinct energy ranges. In nuclear physics gamma radiation is related to the photons emitted from a nuclear decay. In particle physics though the gamma symbol is used to denote photons in general of any arbitrary energy, and if you're in astronomy gamma radiation refers to any high energy photon observed from some source out in space. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>X-rays can also be emitted whenever you accelerate a charged particle perpendicular to its velocity (see [synchrotron radiation](<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron</a> radiation)) , for example bending electrons around a synchrotron will produce very intense, tunable energy radiation, for example producing xrays. This is how X-rays for scientific research are produced at large facilities like <a href="http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home.html" target="_blank">Diamond Light Source</a>. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What we can do though is put someone in a device surrounded by sensors, shoot a collimated x-ray beam at their body and see what direction the rays bounce off. Studying the deflection angles and moving the collimated beam around you can build up an incredibly detailed map of internal structure, this is how CAT scans work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not how CAT scans works. CAT scans (although more commonly refered to as CT scans now for whatever reason), are still imaging absorption. In other words, rays that bounce and change direction are not used (and in some applications are actually a problem). CT is similar to a simple radiograph, in that the principle measurement is the decrease in X-ray strength along a straight line from the X-ray source to a point on a detector. The diference is in CT the source and detector are rotated around the patient to collect this information from many angles, and the data is turned into a 3D volume image using computational methods.</p>
<p>I believe that diffraction gratings can and have been used to do CT scans like you've suggested (i.e., measuring scatter), but it's not really my area so I don't want to speak too much on it. Although as far as I know it's far from clinical practice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The image I always had in my head was of a x-ray source and then a semi circle of detectors on the other side of the patient so you were able to see the small angle scattering along the axial slice that you were currently trying to image. If it's just looking at attenuation though I guess that kind of setup is done  so you can get information of x-rays passing through the patent at different angles of incident. That would make sense, you'd be able to resolve edges better. </p>
<p>I've never done any nuclear medicine work so it's also not my area of expertise. I'm used to working with particle beams that you actively keep underground and stay the hell away from while they're running. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The image in your head is right except that small angle scatter isn't the quantity being measured. And add that the source and detector rotate around the patient. Are you using the particle beams for imaging?</p></div>		</li>
