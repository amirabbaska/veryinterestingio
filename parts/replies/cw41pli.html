			<div class="markdown"><p>To first order, you're right that 2 photons don't interact. But strictly speaking, this isn't true in general.</p>
<p>You can check just by drawing a Feynman diagram for QED with 4 photons as the external lines. At tree level there's no way to make the diagram fully connected. However, at order alpha^2 (e^4 ) you can do it. So, photons do have some interaction because they can spontaneously produce fermion/anti-fermion pairs. (They also interact gravitationally, but that's even weaker than the QED corrections).</p></div>		</li>
