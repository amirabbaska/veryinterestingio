			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm married to a Dyslexic, and have 2 sons, 1 has been diagnosed and the other has a 90% chance of being dyslexic (family statistics).
1 in 5 people are Dyslexic.
1 in 20 is diagnosed.
If you haven't been officially diagnosed I would suggest it. It will show your problem areas, but more importantly your gifted areas. My son at 6.5 was diagnosed now nearly 8. It showed he has a 2 points below genius level IQ in the Verbal category. He is also in the &quot;very high&quot; rank in the visual/spatial category. He is now classified as twice exceptional (2E). We learned more about how to help his high areas along with how to help his lows (which we have lots of knowledge about already).  Dyslexia comes with lots of struggles but man the gifts that come with it are amazing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I realised I related alot to that reading your comment. I often have problems with organising my sentences, organisation and time keeping. I'm getting better at the last two, though I still get words mucked up.</p></div>		</li>
