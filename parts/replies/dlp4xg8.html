			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to this, you could compare the mucus in your intestines (and protective cells lining them) to A large constantly regenerating fence keeping the wolves at bay. Where the enamel of your teeth doesn't regenerate and react to the junkyard dogs. Saliva does as okay job at keeping things from getting out of hand,  but can't keep up with poor diet and lack of brushing attracting more dogs.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The enamel of your teeth does regenerate, or brushing (which is essentially removing the top layer of enamel) would wear them down to nubs. There are compounds in your saliva (and found in some toothpaste nowadays) that bind to the surface of your teeth to begin creating new layers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, just not as a reaction to damage/infection. If you have an ulcer from H.pylori or some other nasty infection the mucus membrane layers of your G.I. tract react immediately and start a healing process to counter the bacteria.
To be fair, my field is more bacteria than teeth though (didn't know saliva had tooth spackle). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ummm... no. Brushing does not remove enamel. Which is good because enamel does not regenerate. Certain compounds like fluoride can help strengthen enamel, but once it's gone it's gone. Take good care of your teeth boys and girls. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also not correct.  The current #2 response is more accurate in that they don't actually attack your teeth, it's their waste that causes damage to your teeth.  In other locations the bacteria doesn't come in contact with your bones/teeth.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You seem to believe that the word cadaver refers exclusively to a preserved body. It does not. Unpreserved dead bodies can also be called cadavers.</p></div>		</li>
