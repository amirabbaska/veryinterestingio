			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived in Chicago about ten years ago and worked at Water Tower for a couple years. Did you ever happen to notice this absolute hulk of a man with a big pack of randoms piled on his back going up and down the mag mile all day? It's been a decade so who knows if he still roams, but I couldn't help but notice how he was completely avoiding everyone and just went about his business of silently collecting. He was so tall and bulky and generally scary as fuck looking, but didnt bother a soul. </p></div>		</li>
