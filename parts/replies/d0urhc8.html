			<div class="markdown"><p>Take the number line example again and stand at zero. Now start stretching that number line so that both the negative numbers and the positive numbers get farther away from you. Let's say that every number gets mapped to twice it's value- 1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4, 3 goes to 6, etc. It's kinda like that, infinite and expanding. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so the universe outside of our observable universe is infinite with infinite space and energy? Is this more of a philosophical position or do we have evidence for that?</p>
<p>Was the very early universe infinite as well, like immediately after the big bang?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely hate this explanation in use with infinite ... the distance between can be measured relatively - the center is always the center even if there are infinitely more smaller measurements.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Even if the central bodies of density are moved on - the location where it occurred was still a thing...allowing for the gumball theory too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Expanding doesnt mean the objects in space moving through space away from a common center.</p>
<p>It means all of space is expanding in all directions. The distance between any number of objects just keeps getting bigger. Everything gets farther away from everything else. It's in every single direction!</p>
<p>Just like he had the analogy of the balloon, now pretend you drew dots on it and then blew into the balloon: they're now all farther apart!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if we go out far enough in any direction, will we ever reach a point where there are no galaxies or stars or anything?  </p>
<p>If everything is moving away from each other in every direction due to more space coming into existence in a uniform matter everywhere, of course there would seemingly be no center.  </p>
<p>However, if we ever found that there was a distance far enough out in all directions where no matter seemingly exists in a spherical-like manner, wouldn't the center of the universe be considered the center of this sphere-like collection of matter?  Why is it assumed that matter started off being infinitely packed not in a single point but out in all infinite directions?</p></div>		</li>

<p>What this guy said. The only 'edge' is the boundary of the observable universe, which is the part that's close enough that we can receive light from. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But there are a finite number of stars, right? What would be stopping someone from setting up an arbitrary 3D cartesian coordinate system, assigning each star a set of coordinates, and using the average as an estimated &quot;center&quot; of the entirety of matter within the universe? Aside from the practical problem of tracking down every star, including those out of our visible range, of course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, because there <em>is no edge of the Universe</em>. What you might confuse this with is the 'edge' of the <em>observable</em> Universe, which is simply the part of the Universe within which light can still reach us, for any distances beyond that limit, the total amount of space between that distance and us will increase faster than light can travel in the same timeframe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand all of the analogies that are thrown around about this topic, but the part I'm hung up on is the claim that space is infinite and has no edge.</p>
<p>If the universe started as a single point and then expanded rapidly in the big bang, what expanded? I would imagine that it was the edge of the universe.</p>
<p>I always figured that past a certain distance, well past the visible universe, there would be no more matter/energy. Wouldn't that point be considered the edge?</p></div>		</li>
