			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add to your excellent response the fact that the human feet contain approx. 250,000 sweat glands which produce an approx. average of half a pint of perspiration daily. The foot has more sweat glands per square centimeter than any other part of the body. They are also extremities at the far end of your body away from your heart. Despite gravity, you still need good circulation (promoted by healthy lifestyle, exercise, and heart health) to pump fresh blood through to your extremities. As /u/SelectCase stated, there are multiple parts of the brain at work here; while your feet may be cold, your body is still going to perspire and your feet and armpits are the two places where that is going to predominantly occur.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor. But it could indicate that from what I've ever read. Normally, people will get cold feet and hands from time to time. If it happens very often or becomes extreme (lasting for long periods of time, getting exceptionally cold, etc) then you might want to consider asking your doctor, or at least working out more often. I don't mean powerlifting or running marathons - simply walking at a brisk pace to get your heart rate up maybe for 5-10 minutes every hour or two throughout the day. This is especially true for people who, like myself, are programmers or otherwise sit at a desk all day; sitting for long periods of time is terrible for you. </p>
<p>However, your torso and your brain consume a lot of energy and produce a lot of heat which the body needs to regulate. Be happy your feet get cold ... My skin runs hot all the time. I'm always hot so I tend to keep my apartment at like 58 to 60 degrees - especially when I sleep. My girlfriend sleeps with a hoodie on and like 5 blankets while I wear shorts. And I'm not even fat lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate this feeling so incredibly much that I just wear light cotton socks to bed. Seems to regulate everything perfectly - no longer feel cold, no awkward clammy or sweaty feeling either.
I've recently learned people hate wearing socks to bed though. What gives? So nice to not feel clammy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never had my feet sweat in bed, as far as I'm aware. Definitely not noticeably. I like my extremities to &quot;absorb&quot; the coolness of the areas of the bed I haven't touched yet. Other side of the pillow concept, but for my feet. Socks are oppressively warm. I don't sweat in my sleep in general. My room is always cold, and I use just enough blanket to be at a comfortable temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like my feet can't &quot;breathe&quot; if I wear socks to bed. It's probably because I use too many blankets (I love the heavy feeling of at least two comforters) and sometimes my feet need to reach colder temperatures immediately to cool off my hot head. </p></div>		</li>
