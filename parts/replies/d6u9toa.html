			<div class="markdown"><p>LOVE THOSE. </p>
<p>My feet hate me a lot and any time I wear new shoes, or wear shoes I haven't worn in a couple weeks, all the skin on my heels rubs away, leaving large--sometimes up to 1&quot; diameter--open wounds. They're a pain in the ass to heal, since wearing closed-back shoes aggravate them (but I get blisters from sandals and flip flops). I was doing an elaborate system of tape all over and around my foot so the bandaid wouldn't fall off, but that looked unprofessional for work (imo) and I had to replace it daily. </p>
<p>I bought a pack of hydrocolloid dressings on a whim and haven't gone back. My healing time was cut in half and I can actually wear normal shoes with the bandages on. Absolutely worth the money too, especially since you would use at least 5 times as many bandaids in the same amount of time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those bandages are amazing for a blister, but if you want to avoid blisters in the first place get some mole skin when you new shoes. I use it until I break in new dress shoes and it works amazingly well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately I think my problem is less about breaking in the shoes and more about breaking in my feet... No matter how many times I've worn the shoes, if I take a week or two break from wearing them my feet lose any callouses they've built up in those spots (I have soft/ delicate skin and I sweat a lot).</p>
<p>I'm willing to give it a try though--how exactly does it work? Do you stick it to the shoe or your skin?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THANK YOU! I am always trolling around looking for bandaid &quot;advanced healing&quot; bandages because they work so well, but can never find them. Now I know what this type of dressing is called. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>
