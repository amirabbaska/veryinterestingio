			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in a chemistry lab. My job sometimes includes taking dog or cat Dookie out of a bag, placing it in a pan and drying it out in an oven.  Can confirm that even double bagging in Ziploc doesn't stop the smells ad well as a garbage bag. Also nice to know that I'm probably covered in poop, just from the smell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, this doesn't necessarily mean there are small particles of whatever you're smelling in your nose. It means that there are some chemicals in your nose. For instance, when you smell rotten eggs, you're smelling hydrogen sulfide, a byproduct of bacteria, not little bits of rotten egg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. You smell some chemicals that are present in poop. But poop is very complex and the bulk of it is composed of dead/live bacteria and some undigestible food waste. Those aren’t entering your nose unless you’re physically sticking it into the shit, or an explosive liquidy shit gets aerosolized. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you just flushed a toilet, particularly after a bout of diarrhea, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2672.2005.02610.x/full" target="_blank">maybe.</a> The smell you associate with poo and farts is just gas molecules, a byproduct of gut bacteria. But, in rare circumstance those gasses can be accompanied by aerosolized bacteria. Fortunately your nose has plenty of defense mechanisms against bacteria.</p>
<p>You might also be wondering about farts. I happened across <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1121900/" target="_blank">a brief experiment that indicates farts do contain gut bacteria,</a> but it's unlikely to leave your trousers. The gasses of course will leave your trousers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biochemist here with lab experience. This is a common misconception, and I'm surprised to see it at the top.</p>
<p>That's not how your nose works. You can't smell tiny particles. Tiny particles would never reach your nose (they pulled down by gravity), and you don't have receptors to smell them anyway because they would so rarely make it to your nose. And at any rate, that's not how your smell receptors work.</p>
<p>Instead, your nose smells gases.</p>
<p>That's why hydrogen sulfide (and other sulfides) smells bad. They like poop/farts/rotten eggs. &quot;Poop particles&quot; don't make it to you nose -- but hydrogen sulfide gas does. Hydrogen sulfide is released by bacteria in your gut breaking down sulfur-containing proteins.</p>
<p>More extreme examples: That's why cadaverine and putrescine smell like dead bodies. Corpse particles aren't reaching your nose, a foul smelling amine gas (again the result of breakdown of proteins in dead organisms) breaks down and is released.</p>
<p>The smells that you commonly associate with objects -- freshly cut grass, dirt, raspberries, poop, leather, arcing electrical wires, you name it are caused by small, gaseous molecules that your nose can detect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This! Why do people have such a hard time understanding this! It's really simple. Only a tiny amount of gas escapes from the poop. If the gas you smell was poop then the entire poop would eventually vaporize into a gas.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I had a coworker blow his hands off with an air hose after he snuck out to smoke. He claimed he could blow off the smell so the boss wouldn't know.</p></div>		</li>
