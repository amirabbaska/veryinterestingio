<p>Put a phone under a speaker (on) and send it a picture message for a neat demo.</p>
<p>Edit:  The comments about it being kept on ban due to &quot;too many phones connecting to a tower at once&quot; or any variation of this are flat out wrong.  If this were the case then a tower near heavily trafficked highway intersections would always be going down.  It's not hell on the nerve center, they just don't want to upgrade everywhere.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My house mate (a few years ago) was an FAA engineer, and I asked him this question as well. </p>
<p>His response was the same as yours -- that mobile phones used to interfere with instrumentation, but now the reason is that the cell phone carriers (AT&amp;T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, etc) <strong>asked the FAA to continue the ban</strong> during take-off and landing, because having 200+ people (times however many planes are flying low) connect to the same tower (or switch towers) all at the same time is hell on the MTSO (&quot;nerve center&quot; for the cell phone network).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really what happens. Think about how far you can be from a cell tower and still have service, and then think how at 30,000 feet you're only six miles or so above ground with only the fuselage between you and cell towers. The problem isn't that upon landing all of the phones will suddenly connect - it's that while in midair, phones will try to connect while in a position they aren't designed to handle. Since they would have a good view of numerous towers, each phone would have trouble distinguishing the actual optimal cell for its position and would switch fairly frequently, which can be taxing on the network. </p>
<p>200 people connecting at once is nothing. Think about how many people are sitting in an average airport. And realize that of the passengers on the plane, there is going to be a pretty regular distribution between carriers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If everyone turns on their phone gradually after the flight it's much easier than every phone connecting to the cell tower as soon as it's in range (and they're on a plane, they'll all come into range at once - hence the stress).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not connecting that adds stress, it is switching. When you are on a call while driving (hands free of course), you will occasionally switch towers. This is usually handed off smoothly or you get the infamous dropped call. </p>
<p>Put 200 cell phones on a plane, and try to hand off all those connections to the next tower at the same time and that can overload a given tower. They are built to handle only a percentage of their calls switching off at one time. </p>
<p>(There is a difference in load between handing off a call and a cell phone to tower registration, but I hope this makes for an easier analogy to understand). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an annoyance that is easily mitigated. I'm not sure why it isn't in EMI/RFI testing prior to fiemding other than it is because the phones are supposed to be off so why bother.</p>
<p>I once argued with a flight line tech about phones (I was also a maintainer for years but she didn't know that). Anyway she complained that she had experienced cellphones causing instrumentation to fail. To her the 'fix' was to just not use phones around the plane for the similar reason above. But in reality that cluster likely is grounded poorly
and there can be a lot more issues that will cause it to fail aside from cellphones. She should have checked the component with a bond meter (basically a sensitive ohmmeter).</p>
<p>Put simply, aircraft should include cellphones being used within the EMI/RFI test plane. Granted, antennas that the pilots use will definitely conduct that RF energy but bandpass filters can take care of that quite easily and bandpass filter design is very, very common in comms design.</p>
<p>Edit: typos. Probably more as this is pre-coffee and from a phone.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, that's a problem with everything in an airplane.  Static wicks can only do so much.  When a phone is transmitting inside an aluminum tube that is essentially a Faraday cage, it's extremely difficult to dissipate RF energy.  On top of that, airplane voice communications are AM, so they cannot easily filter out noise, the TDMA communication pulses from an older cellphone start and stop so quickly that they make a significant amount of broadband noise, and again being inside a Faraday cage, they blast that signal at full power.</p>
<p>Altogether, the only way to fix this is to either change aircraft or cellphone communications standards, or put cellphones in airplane mode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to understand what you mean. Are you saying that cellphones' multiplexing (TDMA/FDMA/CDMA) has a waveform that dips into VHF/UHF spectrum due to a change in amplitude/power? I'm not really following there but maybe I'm not picking up on what you mean. Even if there is a case where cellphones transmit a carrier that dips that low into the licensed UHF/VHF spectrum I'm not sure how they pass FCC. Granted maybe there's an exception but you'd have to show me for me to believe it.</p>
<p>Remember waveforms are physical and in our environment but we just can't see them. To interfere they must be on the same spectrum or they will pass through each other unphased (even in regard to the frequency phasing sense and not just the nontechnical meaning of 'phase').</p>
<p>I do deal with RF, especially in regards to aircraft all the time but i don't deal with cellphones at a detailed level, so maybe there is something that you know that I don't and I didn't get the point you were making.</p></div>		</li>

I guess maybe the cockpit is more up to date, but the last time I flew everything looked at least 20 years old in the 4 planes I was in.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cell phones don't operate anywhere near airborne comms or ILS/VOR navigation bands.  Bad grounding  will increase EMI/EMC susceptibility issues.   That said, bad grounding shouldn't be fixed by turning off phones as there is still a latent defect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aircraft comms use VHF (around 110MHz-140MHz) and sometimes HF (&lt;30MHz). There is strict enforcement on any emissions on the particular  frequencies they use. Cell phones use UHF (700MHz or greater).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree that a bad ground is going to cause a lot more problems which actually what I said as well if I recall correctly. However, it is an RFI issue if waveforms are interfering with each other. RFI is EMI as well.</p></div>		</li>
