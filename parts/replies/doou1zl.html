			<div class="markdown"><p>This was the correct answer ~3 years ago. We now estimate [EDIT: in a Western setting, where people generally have adequate nutrition, healthcare, etc] adult height is 80% genetically determined (far more than weight/BMI), and have found specific variants explaining 20% of this heritable variation (16% of total variation). By clever maths (eg calculating the power to detect a variant given the current sample size, and assuming that if we detected a variant that a priori we have 50% chance of detecting, then there's likely to be another one more out there that we missed), we can estimate that common genetic variants explain around 60% of the heritable variance in height. The rest of the heritability may be hidden in rare variants, gene-gene interactions, gene-environment interactions, copy number variants, and epigenetics. The problem of &quot;missing heritability&quot; used to be a hot topic in statistical genetics, but as sample sizes get bigger and statistical methods get smarter, we're discovering that most of the missing heritability is there, we just haven't got sample sizes big enough to find it yet.</p>

<p>When we look at professional sports, we are looking at the outliers of genetic studies. These NBA players often don't have parents who are 6'8&quot;. The NFL lineman don't have parents that are always 6'4&quot; 320 pounds and can run a 4.6 40.</p>
<p>I think you 75% comment is right on in terms of generalizing this topic, with that 10% being far too relevant to people who observe a limited group of people because we are bombarded with professional athletes which are truly exceptions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But as a counter to that look at the amount of children of pro/semi-pro athletes who in turn become pro athletes themselves. When both parents are pro athletes it raises even higher. How much of this is genetics and how much is upbringing/culture is in question of course.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Look, for example, at the Polger sisters in chess. There's evidence that the younger sisters benefited from having strong opponents present to develop their skills against.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't in question though. If twin studies, which are the primary way of assessing heritability attributable to genetics, explain 75% of the variance in height, then 75% of the variability in height is explained by genetics, not upbringing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point that you are presenting is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean" target="_blank">regression toward the mean</a>. Basically, if you take any measurement and observe any extreme value, the next measurement from the same population will most likely be less extreme. Even if the two measurements are correlated (such as parent and offspring heights), you shouldn't expect to observe a second measurement <em>so extreme again</em> - something <em>slightly above average</em> is much more likely.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: this is valid for fixed traits like height, not fancy processes like stock prices.)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>But his dad only contributed 50% of his DNA. (and even then, lots of genes don't express themselves every generation).</p>
<p>For you to get a whole view of which aspects are inherited, which are lifestyle, and which are genetic but caused by mutations or combinations of DNA not present in the rest of his family you would need to look at the numbers for the larger family tree.</p>
<p>Looking it up I can't get hard numbers on the height of his parents and their families, but I CAN get hard numbers on the height of his sons.</p>
<p>Michael Jordon is 6' 6&quot; his son Marcus is 6' 4&quot; and his son Jeffrey is 6' 1&quot;.</p>
<p>The average African American man is 5' 10&quot;, so the fact that all three of them are above average is decent evidence that there is a genetic component to it. (yes, lifestyle might play a role as well, but it is unlikely that MJ was raised significantly differently from his parents, so that wouldn't explain above average height in it's entirety) though a sample size of three is probably not the best to be making assumptions off of.</p>
<p>Where that genetic component came from? I dunno. could be his mothers family, could be a combination of traits from both side, could be a spontaneous mutation. he's not <em>ridiculously</em> above average in the height department and variability like that happens all the time. genetics are complicated.</p></div>		</li>
