			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the book talks about many such cases. It mentions that any source of water would be surrounded by dead bodies. </p>
<p>However, the author also interviewed survivors who were badly burned, dehydrated and were not able to get to the water due to the crowds or corpses around it. These people survived (up to today, despite being right there and being irradiated) while people who had been in the same room and drank water died.</p>
<p>While many people died due to radiation, I do not believe radiation would have killed them 2 hours after the blast, right when they were near a water source and drank. And after the huge amount of radiation they were exposed to, I also do not believe that some radiated water would have killed them on the spot.</p>
<p>As such, water intoxication seems to be a more likely explanation and ties in with other things I've heard in the past, like people being told to drink slowly after surviving a shipwreck or spending time in the desert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry. It is the first time I wrote a post and I was worried that a wall of text would scare people off. I wrote the gist of it: the author clearly stated that water kills, and I clearly stated this in the description, together with my question.</p>
<p>People assuming it is radiation directly contradict this. It shouldn't be necessary to add all the conditions that are not to blame (radiation, bloodloss, burns, starvation, being crushed in houses, being burned alive in the subsequent firestorm, ... ) when I clearly state that the water caused their deaths.</p>
<p>I will - if I can - add the title of the book to the description for those people who might be interested, though.</p></div>		</li>
