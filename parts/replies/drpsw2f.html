			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the scientists concluded that it was nearly coincident - there is an issue of sensitivity for the gravitational wave detectors as well - they can only detect a certain frequency range of oscillation (ie as the neutron stars are spinning in, radiating gravitational energy out, the orbits get smaller and smaller and the orbital period smaller - like how a spinning coin on a desk goes brrrr at the end at increasing frequency - thus the gravitational wave signal looks like a chirp signal).  I don't know too much details on this but i am guessing the stars may have spun for a few seconds longer than the gravitational waves detector detected them.  Which would account for the few second delay in the gamma-rays etc.  On the hand after traveling 130 million years there is bound to be gas, dust and debris along the way in very small amounts - but it could have a measurable effect - since light does slow down when moving through gas and one could imagine that 130m years of going through interstellar material could have had an effect - while supposedly gravitational waves do not slow down (let someone else confirm this).</p>
<p>Also i wonder what effect the gravitational event must have had on the light coming out of that area - although presumably the light event would happen at culmination of all that spinning - ie on impact of the two neutron stars.  So gravitational waves were going out for some time as the orbits decayed - then the light emanated on the collision event.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also possible that the gamma waves come mostly from a slightly later stage of the merger(like collision). Gravity waves are the brrrr right before the coin lands and the gamma rays could be the snap of the coin stopping.</p></div>		</li>
