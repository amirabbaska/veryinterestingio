<p>The Fourier transform is an orthonormal linear operator. Why does that make it a bijection?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The proof is trivial due to the definition of orthonormality. The real proof is in demonstrating orthonormality. </p>
<p>Fun fact: not all Fourier transform definitions are orthonormal. One of the most popular definitions actually isn't orthonormal, but is frequently used by people because of its historical usage and the illusion of shorthand.</p></div>		</li>
