			<div class="markdown"><p>Science doesn't always have to be 100% right for it to &quot;work&quot;. Like, our models of how biology or physics or economics or anything else works right now, are certainly not 100% correct and in the far future our descendents will probably think we're just as goofy as the Greeks were with their four humours. But regardless of that, if our flawed models can still be applied to the world to enact positive change, there is still some value in them.</p></div>		</li>
