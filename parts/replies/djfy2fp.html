<p>*Lactic acid buildup. <em>Lactose</em> is a sugar found in mammalian milk. Lactic acid is a byproduct of anaerobic metabolism.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lactate buildup. Lactic acid is not a byproduct of metabolism. That is a persistent medical myth. Lactate, on the other hand, is  a byproduct of metabolism and is itself consumed by mitochondria for energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lactic acid doesn't exist in the body. It's actually just lactate. Lactic acid is only present at pH values inconsistent with cellular muscle function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but it quickly converts to lactate in most/almost all cases. I'm being picky about this because I work with exercise physiologists and am in college in the same field. They're trying to dispel the myth of lactic acid as the cause of muscle soreness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also while standing, a person has to constantly make small changes to their position in order to keep balance, that, with relying on the same muscles to suport him for long periods of time, leads to poor blood flow, and fast muscle fatigue and discomfort. </p>
<p>Ironically standing still is much more taxing than walking.</p></div>		</li>
