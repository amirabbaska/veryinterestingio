			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Technically,</em> the &quot;true&quot; tarantula is a wolf spider (<em>Lycosa tarantula</em>) which is native to Mediterranean Europe.  People started using the term &quot;tarantula&quot; to descibe any large spider they were unfamiliar with, especially when Europeans started colonising the New World, and it's now stuck as that group of spiders' (Theraphosidae) common name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The scientific name in this case is kind of interesting with the spider; the vernacular name for the species of spider was &quot;tarantula/tarantola/tarantella&quot;, derived from a nearby city in Italy called Taranto, where apparently this spider was quite common (also the origin of the &quot;tarantella&quot; dance.  Linnaeus just followed this with the species name when he described it in 1758.</p>
<p>To add extra confusion, there was a genus of Amblypygid also called <em>Tarantula -</em> since absorbed into the genus <em>Phrynus</em> IIRC.  Fun fact.</p>
<p>EDIT - spelling is hard when you've only had one coffee.</p></div>		</li>
