			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend who works in audio kept being a dick and playing all these different pitches to see if I could hear them and then laughing in shock when I couldn’t hear some of them so then I went and got a long overdue hearing test.</p>
<p>Daily life examples I guess would be like the sole of someone’s shoes sliding/shuffling against a concrete/tiled floor rather than normal walking. That sound never used to bother me but really gets me now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, that’s interesting. I was wondering if you work in audio because I’d think your average person wouldn’t notice.  Of course it’s also possible that working in audio would expose someone to that hearing damage right? Either way it sounds like your dick friend actually helped you in a way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm constantly adjusting settings when I listen to my car radio or headphones with my phone because some hearing loss in my right ear has left me really sensitive to sharper sounds. Like the treble adjuster has to slide lower and I have to bring the bass up. </p></div>		</li>
