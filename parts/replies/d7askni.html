			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the way E = mc^2 is taught in high school makes it look like it has something to do with nuclear reactions. People get very, very angry when you tell them it has nothing to do with the nuclear force and it applies generally. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. People are often surprised when I tell them that E = mc^(2) works just the same for <em>chemical</em> reactions. As if there's some magical difference between chemistry and nuclear physics such that relativity only applies to the latter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well only if the objects are in rest. People seem to forget E=mc² is only the simplified form after all.</p>
<p>E² = (m_0 * c²)² + (pc)² is the full form where p is the momentum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No new molecules appear. It's a consequence of how mass is defined. In relativity, mass is defined to be the energy present in your system in a frame of reference where the total momentum is zero. So by compressing the spring, you are introducing an elastic potential energy which contributes to the mass of your system.</p></div>		</li>

When you realise that all the heavier elements that are not man made is the result of millions of supernovas and supernovas result in the birth of more stars that in turn keeps the whole chain reaction going it's mind blowing.

			<div class="markdown"><p>There aren't any new molecules. The molecules that are already there just become more massive, because they have energy imparted into them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>... And actually, it turns out that most of the mass that those molecules had in the first place came from energy anyway. If you add up the mass of the up quarks and down quarks that make up a proton or neutron in an atom, you'll find it comes to only about 1% of the mass of the proton or neutron. The remaining 99% is from the kinetic energy and binding energy of those quarks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's confusing because people keep calling it &quot;mass&quot; when actually it's &quot;mass-energy.&quot;  The point of E=mc^2 is that mass and energy are different forms of the same thing; with a very small amount of mass being equivalent to a huge amount of energy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They're actually different <em>aspects</em> of the same thing. In the same sense as you can count money in pennies or in megabucks.</p></div>		</li>
