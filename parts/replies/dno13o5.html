			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh no. No no no. I've had some farts that seriously made me consider moving just so I wouldn't have to step foot in the same house that was violated by my gas. Truly disgusting. Just thinking about the smell now makes me feel sick. I usually end up leaving the room for a few hours in the hopes the smell dissipates. </p></div>		</li>
