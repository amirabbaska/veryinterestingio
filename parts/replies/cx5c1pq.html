			<div class="markdown"><p>Methane would need to take up 5 to 15% of the gas in the atmosphere to detonate. Those are the upper and lower explosive concentration limits.</p>
<p>There probably isn't enough methane on the planet to create this mixture.  Yes, methane in the atmosphere would burn at a flame source but the ignition would not propagate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unlikely. The atmosphere right now is over 70% nitrogen which is fairly inert and certainly isn't flamable. Ogygen is next with 21% and then the rest form that 9%. So they're pretty disperse and small. Methane is fairly volatile and reactive I think so idea that a huge fireball would be created from a nuclear war is incredibly unlikely. It's radioactive fallout we should be more worried about (high energy atoms and particles decaying and releasing huge amounts of energy). I don't know enough to comment (only a mechanical engineer not a physicist) but radiation and a nuclear winter (basically the shear force of all these explosions forcing dust into the atmosphere to create a sun-blocking blanket) is the bigger worry than the atmosphere setting alight. </p></div>		</li>
