			<div class="markdown"><p>Railcar mechanic here. The way the truckset(wheels side frames and bolster) attatches to the body of the railcar is either a 14 or 16 inch centre plate which is circular. It slots into the circular &quot;bowl&quot; of the bolster. So as the car corners the entire truckset actually turns underneath the car. When a car is on our repair track for a wheel change we always inspect clean and lubricate the bolster bowl and centre plate that slots into it. Checking for very specific wear tolerances,cracked welds, loose bolts etc. We inspect the components of the truckset for wear that can cause a condition called &quot;parolellograming&quot; which could cause the flanges of the wheels to eat at the rails during cornering and potentially cause a derailment. </p>
<p>So have no fears buddy I take my job and ultimately your safety very seriously. Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey that's awesome! I guess you could say that trains or at least the railcars are quite modular and simple in assembly?</p>
<p>I'm curious what you reaction would be to <a href="https://youtu.be/4qgyGAJkvWY?t=3m38s" target="_blank">this video</a>. It will probably look appalling to you but that's how most of my country's railway is. It's amazing how strong the suspension is to be able to endure all that vibration and keep going.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of subway trains. The Montreal Subway uses normal (altho really big) Tires. <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=montreal+subway&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjom_bJzorVAhUq6IMKHbWOAnwQ_AUICygC&biw=1920&bih=971#imgrc=QrOZ0tWYGEEXuM" target="_blank">https://www.google.ca/search?q=montreal+subway&safe=off&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjom_bJzorVAhUq6IMKHbWOAnwQ_AUICygC&biw=1920&bih=971#imgrc=QrOZ0tWYGEEXuM</a>:</p>
<p>Some subway train seem to use slightly conical shaped metal wheels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The STM Metro also, until recently upgraded Azur &quot;trains&quot;, used to use wooden brakes that are soaked in peanut oil and saline. This was to avoid carbon dust as a health hazard in stations. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“See this?” asks Arseneault, brandishing a planed piece of wood about 40 cm long, four cm thick and as wide as a stick of Juicy Fruit. It smells like it just came out of a deep fryer—which it did. “They’re the brake pads. They’re made out of yellow birch, from Quebec. We douse them in boiling peanut oil and salt water so they don’t heat up.” Why wood? “Regular brake pads are rough on the wheels, and because the Métro is totally enclosed, carbon dust from regular brake pads would be a health concern. Plus, these are cheap. Ten dollars each. We had to fight like hell with the engineers from Bombardier to get them on the new cars.”</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can help confirm this. There is a rail about 85 yds from my front window. My favorite is when the freighters &quot;burnout&quot; and the next 50 trains get to bounce off the divots before its fixed. You'd think it would be quiet but you would be wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the source for this, but I've been told it's favored by train engineers. Thought I'd share it:</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not allowed to run the train
The whistle I can't blow…
I'm not allowed to say how far
The railroad cars can go.
I'm not allowed to shoot off steam,
Nor even clang the bell…
But let the damn train jump the track
And see who catches Hell!&quot;</p></div>		</li>
