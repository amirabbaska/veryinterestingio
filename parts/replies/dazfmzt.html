<p>Not to mention the sheets that define the architectural floor plan, and the structure.</p>
<p>Chew on this for a bit... The plans are two dimensional. They take all the information on the sheets in the drawing package and create a three dimensional building.</p>
<p>Think about all the time it takes to create those hundreds of sheets of information. There's a shit ton of things that need to be considered (a small list here): what type of toilets, what type of drinking fountains, how much heat will the people and lights generate?, what HVAC (air conditioning) equipment needs to be selected to meet that heating demand?, how big of a duct is needed to flow the proper amount of air into each room?, how much waste are the toilets going to generate?, how much water is going to be used?, how big do the pipes need to be to properly flow the shit to the sewer and water to the toilets, and sinks?, what size water heater do I need?, what type of receptacles (plugs) are needed in each space?, how many?, how big do the wires need to be to those plugs?, how big does the conduit need to be to carry the wire to those plugs?, what size breaker is needed to protect that circuit?, what is the total electrical capacity for all the circuits in a certain area?, what performance do the windows need to have to keep the sun from heating things up too much?, what kind of door handles should there be?, what should the ceiling look like?, what color paint should the walls be?, what about flooring?, how much space do I have between floors for all this crap (pipes, ducts, wires, etc.), etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p>All this stuff needs to be considered. On top of that, you need to document everything through specifications to make sure you're getting what you're paid for. After the building is built, you need to make sure it's build correctly, and you need to make sure everything specified was installed like the contractor said he would.</p>
<p>On top of that, you need to commission all of the systems to make sure they're working as designed.</p>
<p>Even though it sounds like a lot... It's not too incredibly complex doing this stuff, especially with the use of computers. There is a lot of &quot;re-using stuff that works&quot; on subsequent projects. While each project is slightly different, you can pretty much copy a lot of things from one project to another. It helps to have standards. </p>
<p>With computers, it's easy to share and change information as the project evolves. They even have the ability to model buildings in 3D now and you can see EVERYTHING come together as designed.</p>
<p>Years ago, you could only envision everything in 2D on a computer. Before that, it was just 2D drawings that were drawn by hand. If one thing changed (a wall moved, or window shifted position), you had to break out the eraser and start over in that area that changed. It was a huge headache (from what I understand). Design firms used to be much larger from an employee headcount. Now, because we have computers, it's a lot easier to do this stuff, so you don't need quite as many people.</p>
<p>It used to be an engineer would tell a bunch of drafters what to do. It's like playing Operator. The more you have to pass information down the line, the harder it is to get what you want. Now, the engineer can draw up things by himself (he probably still has help).</p>
<p>It's amazing to think about what goes on behind the scenes in construction. But, most people don't think much about it...</p>
<p>Also, I've worked in the aerospace (designed cruise missiles) and automotive industries (designed intake manifolds)... The process is pretty much the same everywhere. The same, but different.</p></div>		</li>
