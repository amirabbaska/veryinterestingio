			<div class="markdown"><p>Potassium is needed by the kidneys to be able effectively excrete sodium. In that sense, they are balanced. If you eat too much sodium, you will lose stores of potassium as they will be used out excreting the sodium. The same is true in reverse, which is why sodium sensitive hypertensives (who have no kidney problems) are told to eat low salt and high potassium. It is the essence of the what is known as the DASH diet for hypertension. The primary cause of essential hypertension in most adults is an overload of blood volume. DASH reduces the body's stores of sodium, and the excess fluid that keeps homeostasis along with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nephrologist here. This is incorrect.</p>
<p>To clarify:</p>
<p>Ingesting salt (NaCl) does cause renal potassium loss. This is due to increased delivery of Na+ to the distal tubule, and thus increased reabsorption of Na+ via the ENaC channel but little reabsorption of the chloride (anion). </p>
<p>The increased reabsorption of a positive cation relative to an anion makes the distal tubule electrically negative, and thus increases the electrochemical gradient for potassium excretion via the principle cells in the collecting duct.</p>
<p>The potassium is excreted because the sodium has been reabsorbed. Potassium is NOT required for sodium excretion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, I believe you, but what of this statement from the Harvard Medical School:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Potassium_and_sodium_out_of_balance" target="_blank">https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Potassium_and_sodium_out_of_balance</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>One way to flush sodium out of the body is by getting more potassium.</strong> An interesting report from the Trials of Hypertension Prevention suggests that changing the balance between these two minerals can help the heart and arteries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what I've been told by many doctors, including some world famous nephrologists. Someone isn't correct here, and if it's them, then I've been doing it wrong for a long time (i.e. DASH diet) and screwing myself up in the process. Now I don't know who to believe, and it also suggests that the DASH diet is a fraud, which also seems hard to believe. Why has everyone been telling me the opposite of what you are saying for so long?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Does that mean reduction in blood sodium also helps reduce the potassium stores too? Or does it just prevent loss of a stable amount of potassium? What happens if you eat too little of either? </p>
<p>And what does DASH stand for?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nephrologist here. Sorry but droid-mike is incorrect. Here’s a my reply from elsewhere:</p>
<p>The key point is that sodium delivery to the distal tubule increases potassium excretion ONLY bc the sodium is being reabsorbed and making the tubule negative as I explained in another post.</p>
<p>The DASH diet recommends potassium because when you decrease salt intake below your typical baseline, your body will respond by increasing aldosterone to retain whatever sodium it can. This will cause K loss - thus the recommendation of a high potassium diet to prevent hypokalemia. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some antihypertensive drugs, like ACE inhibitors for example, actually increase serum potassium. Increasing dietary potassium intake with these drugs onboard could lead to hyperkalemia, which can be life threatening. Potassium intake is one of those things that a patient should discuss with their health care providers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what OP may be referring to is that the primary cations (positively charged ions) within our serum are Na+ and K+. They necessarily have an indirect relationship with one another. If serum Na+ goes up, the kidneys will filter K+ to preserve electrical neutrality. If serum Na+ decreases, then K+ gets reabsorbed by the kidney. In this respect they’re not really “counter-agents” but rather positively charged ions that by their nature are kept in balance with negatively charged ions.</p></div>		</li>
