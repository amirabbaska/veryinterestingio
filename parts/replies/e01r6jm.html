			<div class="markdown"><p>The main reason for this is, there is only really two ways to generate electricity in a useful quantity. </p>
<p>First is with the use of a generator, which involves 2 main parts, the Rotor (bit in the middle) and the Stator (the ring around it), basically you turn the rotor and induce an electromagnetic field into the wiring in the stator. So when using a generator you need to have a powerful torque to drive it, whether you use a wind turbine, water turbine, steam turbine (either from a dam, coal, nuclear plant etc). All you're doing is turning a big hunk of metal with a magnet attached.</p>
<p>The second way is with Photovoltaics (PV) which is what a solar panel is. Basically a Light Emitting Diode, working in reverse if I remember correctly. Light enters the panel and the blue smoke causes a DC voltage to be generated, this is then put through an Inverter to give you 230vac @50hz (110vac @ 60hz for you Americans).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One such example of another method of producing electricity is the piezoelectric effect. Some materials, often crystals, when you apply heat/pressure to them, will create an electric charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the chemical method, which is used in batteries and fuel cells, and the radioisotope decay method like alphavoltaic and betavoltaic cells. Also, if steam generators are two bulky or heavy, you could opt for thermoelectric generators, which work in a similar way to photovoltaic cells, but using heat differential, rather than a light source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it seem like there is a possibility for a fundamental shift in techniques? I know there's onlyh a handful of mechanisms for producing electricity (electrochemical, kinetic, PHV, maybe 2more?) and I guess kinetic is still the best we got!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't much possibility of creating a better heat engine.  There are hard physical limits that we are right up against.  I mean incremental improvements are possible but you won't see a doubling or anything.  No matter how our methods of creating heat may improve (fusion power?) our methods for turning heat into mechanical work will not be significantly improving in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generating electricity from heat mare efficiently than steam turbines would require skipping the mechanical energy conversion step, going straight from heat to electricity.  The methods we have for that aren't very efficient, and require... a high temperature gradient, meaning a cold end, which makes that impractical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The best way to increase efficiency is simply to increase the operating temperature of the turbine. The hotter the better. The problem is that high temperatures weaken/damage metals. So modern advancements in technology come in the form of material improvements - advanced ceramics and better manufacturing methods are being developed to make turbines that won't break down at high operating temperatures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s less a matter of expansion and more a matter of enthalpy when it comes to using steam to do work.</p>
<p>Water is just ideal because it’s readily available and easy to pump through a system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're familiar with the ideal gas law (Pressure<em>Volume=number of molecules</em>Gas Constant*Temperature, PV=nRT), any liquid that we push from the liquid to gas phase at the same temperature will expand the same. It's more to do with the cheapness of water, and it's relative inertness when pure.</p></div>		</li>
