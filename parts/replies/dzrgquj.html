			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem of overcoming the pipe head pressure on standpipes and sprinkler systems in an extremely tall building is usually dealt with by having a large main pump with additional pumps on higher floors. All things said an adequately designed sprinkler system and a building incorporating fire-resistant materials is really the best way to deal with commercial high rise fires, as most fires can be knocked down in the incipient phase by sprinklers. </p>
<p>High rise residential buildings may or may not have sprinkler systems, depending on the fire code and the age of the building, but all residential highrises should have a standpipe system in place, either installed when built or retrofitted with them.</p></div>		</li>
