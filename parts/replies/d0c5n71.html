			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, while a TV show is shooting, the writers' room is (hopefully) working a few episodes ahead, the next episodic director is in prep, and the post team is working on the previous episode, whereas in a movie, things are happening far less simultaneously--the director and crew preps, then everyone moves to production, then they move into Post.</p>
<p>TV often has a lot more wheels spinning simultaneously than features do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28computing%29" target="_blank">pipelining</a> when done in computers.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.ni.com/cms/images/devzone/tut/clip_image013.png" target="_blank">this example</a> note that 4 jobs (episodes) are completed in 7 time units, whereas if there were only 1 job it would still take 4 time units to complete. The more jobs you can pipeline, the more efficient the overall process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But the single biggest difference between TV and film is what typically defines them: TV is about dialogue, movies spectacle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to highlight this. TV is radio first with pictures added. Film is the moving pictures first with sound added. This more than anything is what separates the forms.</p>
<p>You can have visually stunning TV shows, and great dialog in movies, but they are set up very differently in terms of what drives their structure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other people are trying to uplift GoT, and it is very good.  But it is not even close to a feature film of the same type.  A GoT movie should be miles ahead, visually.  I doubt that a movie would go too far, in order to not leave the TV production behind.  And of course, they are doing many episodes a season on HBO.  </p>
<p>Sopranos was called movie quality and it was.  It didn't take big spectacle to mimic a good Gangster film.  Mostly dialog.  I know this breaks your mold but <em>you</em> are right.  Is anyone seriously going to contend that a 10 year old Fanasy Epic on film visually blows GoT away?  Clearly people suspend some disbelief for GoT, and I like the show, but really...  </p>
<p>I am a Tolkien geek and The Battle of the Pelennor Fields blew me away.  </p>
<p>Fans of both won't care if I post this, but marketing execs will and... well, they're not paying me any money, so, circa 2003:  </p>
