			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in the infantry, medics had a very useful procedure.  They'd draw out all blister fluid into empty syringe, then draw something from a vial into the syringe, shake it a few times, then inject some of the fluid back into the blister; just enough coat the entire blister, but not &quot;inflate&quot; if.</p>
<p>Within a few minutes, blister area would be as tough as leather.  Strap on the boots with dry socks, and off you go.</p>
<p>Hurt like hell apparently.  Very strong burning sensation for  few minutes.</p>
<p>I was lucky to have never gotten a blister....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice read, I had always been taught to put duct tape on it. I only ever did it once and when I did, the giant blister was gone in a day. Something about the duct tape acting as extra protection for the skin and letting it heal faster.</p></div>		</li>
