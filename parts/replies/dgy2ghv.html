			<div class="markdown"><p>Most mainstream religions still do a lot of these things.</p>
<p>At some point, when they become socially recognized religions, they don't have to anymore.</p>
<p>Every religion starts as a cult. We've even seen cults turn into religions pretty quickly. Mormanism was considered a cult when I was a kid, but by 2012 it was so accepted that a Presidential nominee was a Mormon.</p>
<p>Scientology is still considered a cult by most people, but it's quickly gaining religion status.</p></div>		</li>
