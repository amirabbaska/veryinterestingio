<p>Now, in the instance you fell into a man-size VFT, and it closed around you, sealing you up inside, and you continued to struggle and try to get out instead of sit very still as to not agitate the trigger hairs (which would release you, as the trap would think it did not actually catch you. Bugs are too stupid to not resist, we are not), </p>

<p>I'm not gonna lie, if I fell into a man eating venus fly trap I wouldn't have the presence of mind to do this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my observations, the VFT really starts to slow down in its production of new traps, and for seemingly no measurable reason. VFT have very shallow root systems that are very inefficient at absorbing nutrients from the soil - their natural environment is in Peat bogs, which are nutrient poor and highly acidic. To make up for its inability to obtain nutrients through the soil, it obtains it from trapping insects. So you would think that it would live forever so long as you kept the mouths fed, right? So long as it was fed, it would keep obtaining the nutrients it needs, and repeating the cycle.</p>
<p>But after so many years, traps won't grow back as fast after feeding (a trap can be used for feeding 3-4 times before the single trap dies, and a new one takes its place). A VFT can have somewhere between 5-7 traps on average, and only needs to eat from 1 trap to survive for a month or so. They go dormant in winter, so they need to store up enough bugs to make it through to spring. </p>
<p>So when they grow old, their traps seem to break down after only 1 or 2 feedings, and then a new trap doesn't regrow to replace broken traps at a normal 1:1 ratio. An older VFT might lose 3 traps, but only grow a single small trap to replace them. I've tried to look for fungal infections or parasites in their roots when I observe these symptoms, but I've never found any culprit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How big is it now? Pics? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I've had upwards of around 60-70 VFT at times. Here's a link to a pic not too long ago: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/1yXIu" target="_blank">Here</a> and a group of matured adults <a href="http://imgur.com/a/aQAaP" target="_blank">Here</a></p>
<p>It's a hobby I suppose.</p></div>		</li>
