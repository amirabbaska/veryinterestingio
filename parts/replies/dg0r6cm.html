			<div class="markdown"><p>So I was confused with your explanation, since I had looked it up a while ago, and thought I remembered that pomelos were a hybrid themselves. So I went back to look it up again and German Wikipedia explained to me that:
The German 'Pomelo' is a hybrid between a pomelo and a grapefruit, whereas in English pomelo means pomelo, while in French a pomelo is a grapefruit. But in Spanish a pomelo is a pomelo, a grapefruit OR the thing we Germans mean by 'Pomelo', which is a thing that is classed as a type of pomelo anyway.</p>
<p>So being confused about the different citrus fruits in English is apparently only beginner's level confusion!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up thinking one of them was the older word for the other, i.e. grapefruit being some newfangled anglicism. But apparently they are dustinctly different fruits:</p>
<p>Pomelo crossed with mandarine resulted in bitter orange (?). This was re-crossed with mandarine to result in the sweet orange. And the sweet orange got crossed again with a pomelo, which resulted in the grapefruit.</p>
<p>Tadaa! Now it looks obvious, doesn't it..? /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here &quot;pomelo&quot; are completely different than &quot;grapefruit&quot;. They are much bigger, have a much thicker peel, and even the segment walls are so thick they are inedible. You have to actually peel each segment individually!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In French pamplemousse is a grapefruit. Unless you're talking technical names then perhaps you're correct. I studied French for 12+ years and pamplemousse is the only term I've ever known to mean grapefruit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Around here we also tend to have &quot;satsumas&quot; and, more recently the crappily-named &quot;easy peelers&quot; thrown into the mix. Along with &quot;mandarins&quot;, &quot;clementines&quot; and &quot;tangerines&quot; this gets confusing as hell, with five different names for essentially the same fruit with some minor variations. It's doubly confusing when the naming seems almost random in relation to the properties of the fruit you end up with.</p>
<p>The best ones (in my opinion) are the very easily peelable ones, less sweet flavoured but juicier, and less likely to contain pips, but I'll be damned if I can establish any consistent pattern as to which of the above five names get applied to that particular fruit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy fucking shit, what a coincidence. I swear to fucking god I was literally just eating an orange about half an hour ago, and wondering if you could make a hybrid orange that you could peel more easily like a mandarin, and thought you could market them as EZ Peel. In my hypothetical thought, I would have named them differently though. Wow, honestly my mind is blown that I came across this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ironic thing is, I could swear the little bastards that they label as &quot;easy peelers&quot; are way harder to peel than satsumas. Probably still slightly easier than oranges though, I guess.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Incidentally, satsumas are the least sweet of the five so are presumably the ones you are looking for. </p></div>		</li>

<p>They're only just above a lemonade for me. </p>

Since moving to MD I still splurge on fresh squeezed OJ (11$ at whole foods) but it can't compare to honeybell. It's only 6$ in Florida. That and the lack of cold weather are the only things I miss. </p>
