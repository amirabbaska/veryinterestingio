There is many many many times more galaxies beyond that horizon than there is within our observable sphere. We know that the universe must be about 90 some billion light years across given the time it has had to expand since the Big Bang. And we can only see 14 billion light years in any direction.<br />
The vast majority of the universe has already fallen past the point of no return and we will never be able to see it. </p></div>		</li>
