<p>If you have a long list of things you want to get done but wind up not doing them day after day. Just go and do one short task; something that takes 5 minutes or so. Don't have any requirements to do anything besides that short task. </p>
<p>By taking this approach, one of two things happen. You either get 5 minutes worth of work done that you otherwise would not have done or you keep working past the 5 minutes and get more done.</p>
<p>You can commonly break big tasks down into smaller ones too:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A giant pile of dishes that are so precariously stacked that OSHA would shut you down? Go clean, like, 5 dishes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need to vacuum the floor or be fully engulfed by pet hair? Shittly vacuum one room. </p>
</li>
<li>Laundry getting out of hand and you are tired of buying replacement clothes instead of cleaning them? Just toss a load in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just make your arms and legs do shit until something you want is done. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much the answer, once you start it's easy to keep going. You need to push yourself to get going but then it's easier. As to how you get that first push is on the type you are. I find it easier to set a time I need to start by. Makes me feel guilty and bad if I miss it so I try to keep to it. </p></div>		</li>
