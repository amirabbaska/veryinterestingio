			<p>I don't even have video games and don't watch TV. I have a &quot;dumb phone&quot; that I use only for emergencies. I really couldn't care less on most days about the Internet. And I like spaghetti. So I'm with you on the giving up &quot;stuff&quot; thing, because I don't even have stuff to begin with and really don't care to acquire any.<br><br>The problem I have is with the marriage thing, and the fact that you stated it was &quot;most important.&quot; Under no circumstances will I compromise or sacrifice my independence to split assets with some dick husband. I work alone, thank you, and don't see why fawwing in wub is of any importance whatsoever. If that condemns me to mediocrity or poverty, so be it; at least I'll be poor and free rather than chained to a split income. Fuck romance and dating. Sex is overrated too.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hey, no judgement here. The point was that  a pair/triad whatever is needed today to advance economically. It may suck, but that's the society we live in today. <br>And I didn't mention kids. Huge economic burden, but I'm glad I have them - because they bring light into my life. But still they cost me in the drive for economic freedom. It all comes down to choices. (as to sex, it can be overrated, but it can also be mind blowing...pm me for more on that!)</p>		</li>
