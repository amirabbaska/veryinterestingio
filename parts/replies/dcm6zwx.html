			<div class="markdown"><p>Precisely. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_\(circuits\)" target="_blank">In electrical engineering a node</a> <em>refers to any point on a circuit where two or more circuit elements meet. Without any further knowledge, it is easy to establish how to find a node by using Ohm's Law: V=IR. When looking at circuit schematics, ideal wires have a resistance of zero. Since it can be assumed that there is no change in the potential across any part of the wire, all of the wire in between any components in a circuit is considered part of the same node.</em></p>
<p>Hence in a part of circuit comprising just two parallel resistors there are just two nodes. There can be only one voltage between two nodes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best answer, these analogies are hard to follow and fall apart in certain situations unless you know all of their caveats.  There's a lot more science to this. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff's_circuit_laws</a>. </p>
<p>KCL (Kirchoffs Current Law)</p>
<p>The current entering any junction is equal to the current leaving that junction. i2 + i3 = i1 + i4</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>KVL (Kirchoffs Voltage Law)</p>
<p>The sum of all the voltages around a loop is equal to zero.
v1 + v2 + v3 - v4 = 0</p>
<p>With those alone you can answer your question. </p>
<p>Experimentation/Tools:
<a href="http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/" target="_blank">http://www.linear.com/designtools/software/</a> LT Spice is a good tool for testing these kinds of things. <a href="http://denethor.wlu.ca/ltspice/" target="_blank">http://denethor.wlu.ca/ltspice/</a> is a decent tutorial the first example I believe is a voltage source with a resistor.  There's probably more simple apps on phones now. </p>
<p>Another extremely easy way to do this is to buy a MultiMeter, battery, resistors, and a breadboard and test out the voltage levels yourself as it helps a lot having hands on experience. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the voltage is the difference in potential between two point. Like the difference in water pressure. However the current in each resistor will be different, like the water flow would be different with two different restrictor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if the butt of R1 had a higher voltage than the butt of R2 then current would flow between their butts till voltage evened out. Same at the other end.</p></div>		</li>
