			<div class="markdown"><p>See... most likely not.  Assuming you mean with the naked eye or with some backyard telescope, definitely not.</p>
<p>But if by see, you mean detect, then sure.  Lasers could be detected (assuming a relatively powerful source and sensitive receiver).</p>
<p>Or, if your light source is something really bright, like a nuclear blast, then that might actually be bright enough to see with a relatively weak telescope.  (Possibly even a powerful backyard deal).</p>

<p>It's easier if you think about it like this:  radio is essentially the same as light, just at different frequencies.  If you can send a radio signal from place to place, you are basically sending light from place to place (assuming your signal and receivers are powerful enough).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A flashlight shining from earth would certainly be able to shed photons on mars, but would be a very small fraction of all of the Earthlight hitting mars. You'd never be able to tell the difference between normal Earthlight and Earthlight+a small flashlight on mars. </p></div>		</li>
