			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really a celebrity-focused show, and the actors don't really try to promote themselves in relation to JfL:G. It's rooted in an older prank culture unlike modern YouTube/celeb prank videos.</p></div>		</li>

My clip didn't make the cut, and I'm kinda happy, my cousin got caught by them and everytime the clip airs she gets ribbed by the whole family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't answer the question at all though. Having a good relationship with the police and being in Canada has nothing to do with impersonating police officers. As an counter example here's an example of Eric Andre impersonating a cop in New York City while definitely not having a good relationship with the police force there.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that. It just doesn't ELI5 correctly. The reason why shows can impersonate police officers isn't because they are mostly shot in Montreal and the reason why Just for Laughs can do it isn't because of their relationship with the police. Sure it doesn't hurt them and is a nice to have kind of thing but it just doesn't explain why it happens at all.</p></div>		</li>
