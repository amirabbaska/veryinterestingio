			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the vitamin issue that some vitamins are only <em>found</em> in fats (i.e. they're fat-soluble instead of water-soluble)?</p>
<p>So you can't get them without fat, not that they won't be absorbed if you don't eat some random fat added to whatever fat actually contains these vitamins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily.  For example vitamin K is originally bound to a protein.  Vitamin K1 is also called phylloquinone and is used by plants for photosynthesis.  It's originally bound to the photosystem I protein.  During digestion the protein will be degraded, but without dietary fat, the vitamin K won't be absorbed as well (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8813897" target="_blank">source</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point was, the order doesn't matter. Whether you first consume the vitamins or the food is irrelevant. </p>
<p>What does matter is that it comes together in your stomach. So you have to eat it within, say half an hour. </p>
<p>And it that sense it's not limited to vitamins. Iron for example also needs fats to be absorbed. So, if you eat a bowl of greens for the iron and a piece of cake, it's better to eat it within a certain amount of time. But if you want to eat the greens first and then cake or the other way around is up to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. The order can also have an impact if there is a pre-existing condition as well - over production of acid or pregnancy for example. Or if a person is on certain medications </p></div>		</li>
