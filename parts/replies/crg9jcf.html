			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer.  It has nothing to do with dentistry or removing teeth.  Many mammals and even intertebrates have nerves in their teeth.  This is not unique to humans.  A small mammalian (or even invertebrate) common ancestor had pre-teen it would break on food and starve to death.  The members of the same species with more &quot;feeling&quot; in their teeth would live longer and thus reproduce more.  That's what most likely lead to nerve endings.  It is just a happy coincidence that they allow us to tell a dentist which tooth is infected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agree with /u/YummyKisses. This is the best answer. Two examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bite through a pencil. Do you use your front teeth or back teeth? Back. In fact, you would be hard pressed to overcome the natural urge to use your back teeth. This is because of nerves in your front teeth that help to prevent damage to your teeth and temporomandibular joint.</p>
</li>
<li>Slide jaw to the side. Nerves in your canine teeth tell your jaw muscles to lighten up the load. We see from previous example that nerves in our posterior teeth don't have that effect. When you wear away your canine teeth (bruxism, for example), you contact on your posterior teeth when you slide to the side. This is one way people end up with temporomandibular disorder. This why some people need to wear a bite splint at night.</li>
