			<div class="markdown"><p>So the orbit of the earth around the sun is only stable if the sun's acceleration is (roughly) constant? If the sun was <em>cough</em> jerked around, the orbit would be unstable and we could end up anywhere?</p>

<p>We're absolutely sure that current position is what orbits use. </p>

<p>When you say &quot;current position&quot;, do you mean relative to the sun's frame of reference or the earth's frame of reference? Because our frame of reference is 8 light-minutes away from the sun's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about objects orbiting an object which is itself in orbit? I was thinking about the sun orbiting the com between itself and Jupiter, but I suppose this also applies to moons. Does the changing angle of Earth's acceleration count as jerk, as far as the moon is concerned? </p>
<p>If so, does Earth &quot;project&quot; its gravity forward to the point where it truly will be, or is the projection on a line tangent to Earth's orbit at the time the &quot;gravity wave&quot; was emitted? If the latter, that would mean a planet's moons always orbit a point slightly further away from the sun than the planet's true center of mass.</p>
<p>Edit: I made a diagram to illustrate the point. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/c7Tbl" target="_blank">Does the moon get pulled to A or B?</a></p></div>		</li>
