			<div class="markdown"><p>They should have qualified the statement as allotransplants (transplant between different individuals) requires immunosuppresants. Autotransplants (transplant within the same individual) do not elicit an immune response. Isotransplants (transplants between genetically identical or very near-identical individuals), while anatomically identical to allotransplants also do not elicit an immune response.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great response.</p>
<p>The only thing you possibly left out was the distinction between the bodies ability to detect and mount an immune response when the parasite is within the digestive system and when it is in the bloodstream as I took from the OP's question that he meant things like Tapeworms when he said parasites and not things like Malaria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but even many kinds of helminths that end up in the GI tract have a life cycle that exists within the bloodstream. It's still difficult for your body to mount a proper response to them, even when they're in contact with many more of the body's immune cells. When I learned how hookworms migrate through the body I was a bit horrified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also the fact of alloreactivity. T-cells are positively selected to interact with MHC, but negatively selected so that they don't bind too tightly to your own MHC molecules. </p>
<p>As a by-product of this system a huge percentage (~10%) of T-cells end up having a strong affinity for a given non-self MHC molecules since negative selection only tests their affinity to self-MHC. This is a far higher frequency than any pathogen responsive T-cell and it means a huge T-cell response is generated in response to foreign MHC molecules</p></div>		</li>
