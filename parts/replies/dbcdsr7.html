			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on which carrier. USPS very likely to be late. Especially in the holiday season. UPS and FedEx are usually on time, something like 92%. However they might deliver it super late at night.<br />
Severe weather will also cause delays.
Use your tracking number and sign up for updates! Good luck.</p></div>		</li>
