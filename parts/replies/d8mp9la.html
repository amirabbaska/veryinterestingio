			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it's because none of the biological processes in you that use energy are 100% efficient, so each one produces a little bit of waste heat. Consider your so-called basal metabolic rate - the bare minimum &quot;maintenance power&quot; that your body needs to stay alive, without actually doing anything. For an average, adult human, that amounts to about 2000 kcal/day, or about 100 watts. And pretty much all of that is released as waste heat.</p>
<p>That is also why hotter ambient temperatures feel much, much more uncomfortable while you are doing some sort of strenuous physical activity - your muscles are consuming a lot more energy, and thus producing a lot more waste heat as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if biological processes produce waste heat that keep you warm, then why are reptiles cold blooded? I don't imagine they have somehow developed 100% efficient ways to break down calories into energy. Unless I'm wrong and they have which is pretty cool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup.  a 95 degree day feels hot as hell - even though it is still cooler than body temperature.  one of the things that affects heat transfer is temperature difference between the 2 systems (in this case your body and the environment).  in this scenario the rate of heat transfer is very small, short of what would keep us comfortable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>None of these answers explain why a warm bath or shower feels nice. According to these explanations they should both feel terrible because heat can't leave the body, yet that is obviously not the case. I have seen this question asked many times on reddit and I have never seen an explanation that adequately explains what is going on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the short term a hot bath will allow your muscles to relax, and it's especially nice on cold days when your hands and feet are cold to begin with. However, if the water is too hot and you stay in it for too long, your body would start to overheat and it wouldn't feel so nice anymore.</p>
<p>So we're talking about two different things here: The body's ability to maintain a stable temperature on the one hand and the effect that heat has on muscles, joints etc.</p></div>		</li>
