			<div class="markdown"><p>Which theory explains that time isn't a fundamental aspect of reality?  I've often had to explain to people that all measurements of time are based on movement, and that time is no more than a useful concept in the same way that heat is, but I don't know the name of the current theory which supports this in order to point people to the studies where it's been tested and not yet falsified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't want to get into an argument about what's fundamental and what's not -- and especially that time isn't -- but it sounds like you're after Einstein.  Or would benefit from him.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that relativity is what I'm looking for, or if it is it's been under my nose all this time.  I'm looking for the theory which denounces time as anything more than a useful general concept, and which seeks to replace all functions of time with separate functions for movement and space within our equations.</p></div>		</li>
