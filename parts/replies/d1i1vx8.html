			<div class="markdown"><p>Indonesia is outside top 100 in GDP per capita by every metric. The fact that the rich own a big chunk of that even means the country is even poorer. Countries with similar GDP: Namibia, Kosovo, Sri Lanka. The country is poor whether you like it or not. No amount of white knighting will change that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a few points:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I don't disagree that poor countries exist. But what's a little annoying is redditors who get all their info from random internet sites claiming to know much more about a country than someone who lives in it. I experience this very frequently on this site, so perhaps it's just anecdotal, but you're damn right I have a gripe with it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's not about Indonesia - it's about reddit's general attitude toward several countries. As I've mentioned in other comments - India. Go to literally any thread about India and I can assure you one of the top comments will be racist as fuck. Something something designated shitting, something something rape. When India did the Mars mission all the upvoted comments said &quot;But they have poverty, how dare they go to space! How dare they have nuclear weapons!&quot; redditors constantly call India poor. By your own metric - India has the third highest GDP in the world by PPP. And yet it is poor? There is poverty, that doesn't make it poor.</p>
</li>
<li>Based off these two points, you've got to be kidding me if you think racism isn't a problem on this site. Especially toward Asians/brown people, I see it on every goddamn sub. Indians are rapists/shitters/fuck their space mission. It is fucking ridiculous. If you need proof you can go and look for literally any thread about India. Seriously. That's what I was trying to say in my original comment.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indonesian here. Get out of the country and you will realise how miniscule $1k a month is. </p>
<p>While the relative buying power of $1k is huge in Indonesia, it is not even enough to pay for my lodging now that I'm living in another country. </p>
<p>We COULD HAVE BEEN rich, but we are not. </p>
<p>On a side note, looks like things will change under jokowi ahok's hands. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Indonesia is also part of G20 (20 biggest GWP contributors) in the world. Granted, there is a huge gap between the poor and rich, so if what people mean by poor is poor standards of living then the average Indonesian is poor. </p></div>		</li>
