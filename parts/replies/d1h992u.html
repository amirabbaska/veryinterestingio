			<div class="markdown"><p>One minor correction. Northern Wei, Sui, and the Rouran Khaganate were not around during the Three Kingdoms period. The Three Kingdoms was with Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu in 220-280 AD. Which was then unified by the Jin dynasty, which because of internal strife, the war of the eight princes, and Wu Hu uprising, retreated to south China, forming the Eastern Jin.</p>
<p>Northern Wei was a dynasty that unified northern China in 439 AD, ending the Sixteen Kingdoms period (the fracturing of Northern China during the Western Jin), while in the south the Liu Song dynasty reigned after supplanting Eastern Jin. Thereby starting the Northern and Southern dynasties period, up until the Sui completely unified North and South in the late 6th century. </p></div>		</li>
