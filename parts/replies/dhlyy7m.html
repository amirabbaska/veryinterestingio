<p>ELI5 answer: Potassium is an intracellular ion (inside the cells), sodium is extracellular (outside the cells, hanging out in the blood). For cells to suck up glucose (carbs in the blood) there's a shift between sodium and potassium; sodium moves out of the cells and potassium moves in. This drops the potassium levels in the blood lower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! I was interested due to a few health problems I have. I have Restless Leg Syndrome with Periodic Limb Movement Disorder. One involves my legs feeling like they need to move (to a crazy degree) and the other involves involuntary twitches of my legs, usually at night.</p>
<p>What I noticed is that when I did a ketogenic (very low carb) diet one year, my symptoms flared up to an insane level, where I could no longer sleep due to the symptoms.</p>
<p>When I introduced carbohydrates back into my diet the symptoms went back to a tolerable level, and as I have targeted more foods that provide electrolytes (leafy greens, nuts, seeds) it seems my symptoms have almost disappeared.</p>
<p>What I understand electrolytes are certainly involved in nervous and muscle function and deficiencies can cause a range of problems. However I've never had a blood test show any problems with electrolytes ever, even when on the ketogenic diet.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that the blood levels are not the issue and it may be more a problem with how the electrolytes are used in my cells.</p>
<p>I can't find much information on this sort of thing in relation to RLS and PLMD, so I'm interested to better understand the relationships between electrolytes and carbohydrates. Mostly just out of curiosity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While this would be unlikely (a malnourished person that we see in a developed country is usually malnourished as a result of disease and they don't want to eat a whole lot) a few things would probably happen. The digestive system will likely have slowed down and will be sluggish, so stomach emptying will probably be slow and they may feel nauseated. The GI tract lining, which contains certain enzymes to break down food, has probably atrophied a bit, so later they may have some bloating or diarrhea, especially with dairy. A Christmas dinner is usually robust in carbs, so yes, they may have some drops in potassium or phosphorus once the meal has emptied out of the stomach and is being absorbed into the blood stream. Some symptoms may be feeling like your heart is skipping, feeling very weak, or confusion. </p></div>		</li>
