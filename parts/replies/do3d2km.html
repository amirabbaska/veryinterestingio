			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to be clear, the wolf fifth is a part of the circle of fifths if you use a certain tuning schemes.  You pick one fifth as a throwaway to make the others sound better.  The exact one can vary with the tuning scheme.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, but how does this relate to the guitar, which isn't tuned in 5ths, but in 4ths (except for that one pesky major third) ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fourth is just an inverted fifth, so it works out the same way.  The circle of fourths has the same notes as the circle of fifths, just in reverse order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But this doesn't relate back to the guitar. Again, why does ascending in fourths do anything with regard to wolf fifths?</p>
<p>You're somehow delving into temperament, but I don't get the relation with which note each guitar string is tuned to.  With a certain fussy attention to temper, could we not just as easily tune to ascending fifths? </p>
<p>Really, you have to spell it out for me as I'm just not seeing where wolf fifths come in here. Or temperament in general, as that seems wholly  separate from the choice of EADGBE. I'd love to get this connection. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Many tuning strategies go for the second option, and music written for them simply avoids the using the bad fifths.</p>

<p>Modern music instruments and western music are tuned to equal &quot;temp√©rament&quot; (sorry I don't know the english word). It would probably sound bad to a 18th century musician, but we're used to it, and it's way easier to build/tune/write music for.</p></div>		</li>
