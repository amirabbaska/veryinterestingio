			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever watched the documentary &quot;Sunshine&quot;, you would know that they did something similar during the Great Ice Age, because the Sun got dark so they had to blow it up. Of course, that's how the dinosaurs died aswell. And then Christopher Colombus killed off the Indians without realizing how they saved the Sun God from going dark. Now he's angry and of course we have Global Warming. Pretty soon the Ice Age will come again and we'll all be stuck on a big train. Then it will crash and the dinosaurs will come back. See, it's a big circle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if history is indictative of anything, then we must return to our hole-dwelling roots as hairless rodent-like creatures. I propose that we put babies in holes as quickly as possible, so as to speed up the evolutionary process. Meanwhile, we need to get our best diplomats and scientists to discover how to communicate with the mole people who have taken over the underworld in our absence. Perhaps we must learn to mate with them, by practicing on smaller rodents, I am not sure. But irregardless, the current system of heliocentric-driven consumerism must come to an end, and we must realign the universe based on the moon and stars, and we should learn how to love each other and move towards a poop-based economy.</p></div>		</li>
