<p>I wouldn’t consider doing meth to be a good hobby.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always love when some friends ask me how I can waste my time gaming, when the first thing they do when they get home is turn on their favorite reality TV show.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My exgf was completely against gaming. She hated the fact that her daughter and I played video games. What did she do all day though? Sit on the couch staring at the TV. She just flat out refused to understand that her daughter playing Minecraft was actually good for her daughter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't wait to play Minecraft with my future kids someday. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends not only on exactly <em>what</em> you're watching in each of those categories, but also how you engage with them afterwards. </p>
<p>Watching documentaries is a good hobby if you develop the critical faculties to analyse the form, content, context and ethical rigour of the shows you watch. If you're simply devouring poorly-researched true crime and films about how aliens built the pyramids, it's not so good. </p>
<p>The flip side of that is that once you've trained those critical faculties you can apply them to other things, so if you find the right people to watch with you can binge on Drag Race and get your intellectual stimulation from the discussion afterwards. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Documentaries generally teach you things. Even if you aren’t engaging with them critically, you can soak up information.</p>
<p>Obviously that all gets tossed out the window if they’re “documentaries” about made-up events.</p></div>		</li>
