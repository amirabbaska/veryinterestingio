			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, this seems to be the calculation for a column of Martian atmosphere. This is the correct answer if you try to dig an open pit or shaft deep enough to have 1atm pressure at the bottom.</p>
<p>An airtight pocket buried in Martian soil and rock would be different. This calculation is probably more complicated though, because the material properties of the soil and rock above you will determine how much of the weight of that column is supported by neighboring soil and rock rather than by the air pressure of the chamber, while atmosphere is supported only by what's directly beneath it (gases cannot support shear stresses). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The key question is whether digging underground makes maintaining air pressure and temperature better than on the surface.  Imagine you dig a tunnel a ways down, then dig out your colony, then just cap it with a series of airlocks and failsafes and pressurize the remainder of the colony.  Based on /u/Astromike23's calculations, getting to a reasonable temperature with no heat inputs would require about 1/3rd the depth, so about 19km down.  However, I'm certain that the surrounding rock would insulate all the heat generating activities you would be doing in a colony just fine at pretty shallow depths.  Likely too well, so you'd probably need some heat vents.  But is all this better than just building a pressurized and insulated colony on the surface?  I don't think so, but there's so many variables it's hard to say for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think temperature would really be the challenge for a mars colony. We have pretty good insulation materials which could be used to isolate the colony and since you will have plenty of heat producing machinery as well as some people you will most likely end up with a heat surplus.</p>
<p>I mean: We can easily build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_house" target="_blank">houses</a> that require no additional heating even during winter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While digging at the current atmosphere pressurization is problematic for the reasons outlined, digging deep open air shafts could provide a mid-term solution for colonization. Most colonization plans have strategies to increase air pressure, either through the release of chemical compounds in the dirt and rocks or by bombarding the planet with comets. Achieving breathable surface air pressure would be a massive undertaking, but tripling or quadrupling the current air pressure is something much more achievable on human time scales. Achieving a 0.024 earth atmosphere equivalent air pressure and digging a mohole ~13km and living at a balmy 0C/32F might be something humanity could achieve in a couple centuries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A temperature estimate from atmospheric properties would be a minimum.  Heat from the interior of Mars is probably a bigger contributor.  At a modest geothermal gradient (e.g., <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/geomars2001/pdf/7044.pdf" target="_blank">this paper suggests ~6.4K/km to ~10.6K/km</a> [PDF]), a depth of 56.8km would mean the rocks of the walls of your cavern would be toasty hot, even given the low initial surface temperatures.  That same paper suggests liquid water would be expected well before reaching 10km depth (4.7km to 2.8km for brines, 8km for fresh water, depending on the thermal conductivity of the overlying rock/ice).</p>
<p>As you mention, there's nowhere 10s of km depths have been achieved.  The pressure from overlying rock is too great and would easily collapse any sizeable voids.  The rock itself wouldn't be strong enough to maintain the space.  The deepest mines on Earth are 3 or 4km deep.  On Mars with similar crustal materials you could theoretically go deeper because of the lower gravity, but realistically you wouldn't be able to push the technology as far as here on Earth.</p>
<p>So, although you'd never realistically reach depths to get atmospheric pressures typical of Earth, temperatures are a lot closer.  With a bit of heat generated from whatever power source is used to run the facility you probably wouldn't have to go deep at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We believe mars is geologically dead but that doesn't mean it's core is cool.  Compared to an apple we live and have dug only as far as the skin of that apple on Earth.  Mars may still have a hot core and as others have mentioned there's radioactive elements down there providing heat even if it's not molten.  Obviously we don't know for certain but it's not a given that you can drill to mars' core.  If we could it would provide a lot of answers for us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It turns out that e is a natural base for anything where the rate of change of something is directly related to the amount of thing itself. If you know any calculus, this is directly related to the fact that:</p>
<p>d( e^(x) )/dx = e^x</p>
<p>This is useful for population growth, where the rate of population increase is directly proportional to how big the population already is. Similarly, in the case of compound interest, the amount of money you earn is directly proportional to the amount of money you already have.</p>
<p>In the case of atmospheres, the pressure (which is just weight per area) is directly related to the weight of the entire column of atmosphere above you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>-I would think that it has to do with exponential growth. In many areas of mathematics, e is used as a base. For example, the ln (natural log) is the base e logarithm. Exponential growth, such as that of a population, is almost always modeled as A=Pe^(rt) , where A is the current population, P is the initial population, e is 2.718..., r is the growth or decay constant, and t is the time since the initial population. </p>
<p>-This is because the derivative of e^(x) is also e^(x). Meaning that the rate of growth is equal to the size of the population. This is not true of other bases, as the rate of growth is only directly proportional to the current population.</p>
<p>-In this case, some of the variables have to be adapted  a bit but the equation still holds true. </p>
<p>-P is the initial atmospheric pressure (in this case 0.006 atm)</p>
<p>-e is still 2.718... </p>
<p>-r is still the growth constant. I will show how to find it later.</p>
<p>-t is the depth below the ground in km. </p>
<p>-So we have Pressure = (0.006atm)*(e)^(r<em>depth). We want e^(r</em>depth) to equal e when depth = 11.1 km, since the pressure at that point would be 0.006*e. So r*11.1 km = 1, or r = 1/11.1km. </p>
<p>-Therefore, the exponential growth model for the atmospheric pressure at a depth t (in km) on Mars  is </p>
<p>-Pressure = 0.006atm * e^(t/11.1km)</p>
<p>-Since we used e, we ended up with an equation of the same form that is used all over mathematics to model things such as growth, and decay. For example, populations, half lifes of radioactive elements, bank accounts that are compounded continuously (only used in math classes I'm sure) etc. </p>
<p>-Please let me know if I made a mistake or if this is completely wrong. </p>
<p>EDIT: formatting. </p>
<p>EDIT 2: added the second bullet point about the derivative of e^(x). thanks to u/hawkman561 for jogging my memory. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The short answer is that we really don't know. Just like pi seems to be all over nature and accurately quantifies a vast number of things, so is the ratio of e. Physicists, and mathematicians both have yet to solve the question as to why these numbers work.</p>
