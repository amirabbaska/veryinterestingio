<p>Science, man. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first chemo nurses told me that the doctors have repeatedly said there is no reason or evidence that the saline &quot;taste&quot; should happen and that they believe it's a just in the patient's head.  The nurse then looked at me and said, &quot;But today is your first treatment, you didn't know about that possible side-effect, and the very first thing you said to me is that you tasted the saline.  I just roll my eyes when doctors tell me that now.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This just means that none of the MD's have cared enough about the effect to research the causes of it.</p>
<p>BTW: I taste/smell saline as well.  In college, I used to donate blood via a &quot;One Stick Pheresis&quot; method.  I could always tell when they were returning the components they were not capturing.  Even if I closed my eyes and didn't watch the machine work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im an anaesthesiologist, and found this to be true to basically all patients who get saline from a pre-filled syringe (in a plastic bag from the manufacturer), never when i myself prepare (not cooking NaCl in water, just filling the syringe myself) the saline.</p>
<p>Which is weird, because it should only contain saline, which shouldn't give this feeling you experience. Ive been in contact with our 2 manufacturers, apparently they have some additives in the prefilled syringes, which hasn't been declared.</p>
<p>This is a super long story, and ill end it here. Sounds like you like the taste :) Some of my patients don't, so I've stopped using the pre-filled  ones.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe 1 in 20 times someone blames a valve it's because of an actual valve. 19/20 they just are in the wall of the vein</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>“Flush it through”... never. Get right up against that valve and apply suction. Either draw back or hook up a vacutainer. I’ve had far more saves with that. Flushing will just blow your vein. I usually just hook up a green top (tube is vacuum sealed so as soon as you puncture the green tube with vacutainer it begins to draw. While the tube is drawing the valve will open. Advance catheter while tube is filling. It’s works like... a lot of the time. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s a reasonable thing that happens.. the catheters aren’t the most robust things and can kink like a mofo. If it hits a valve it’ll start bunching up or take a left to go out for lunch. Do this on 90 year old vein walls, they’re not going to hold up and you blow the vein </p>
<p>You might be right though. I might just suck sometimes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was getting an IV once and the nurse told me she accidentally pushed the needle through the other side of my vein (like in the vein, and then back out the other side). I didn't feel anything different, how did she know that she went to far? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She knew because she’ll have a flash of blood, but can’t pull or flush from it. The flash of blood in the IV shows that you hit the vein at some point, but if the IV doesn’t work then that means you went too far and left the vein.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also if you get a flush but can’t advance the catheter anymore, You exited the vein and now you’re are in the muscle.  </p>
<p>Sometimes if you retract and get back in the vein, the vein might start bleeding from the other side and you end up with a bruise. (usually happens to old people because they lack tight cushion around the veins)</p></div>		</li>
