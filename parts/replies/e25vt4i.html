			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Radiative heat transfer is proportional to the 4th power of the temperature in absolute scale (rankine or Kelvin). So while the heat transfer would be more efficient at higher temperature, a big enough heat exchanger could compensate for that. </p></div>		</li>
