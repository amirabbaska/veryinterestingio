<p>A dremel @ 30000 rpm with a 4&quot; disk attached to it can move a spot @ 157 m/s</p>
<p>If you cut a 5mm hole it takes 31 microseconds for the hole to pass by, that's 9.5 km </p>
<p>So you'd need the 2 sources to be about 4.25 km away from each other.</p>
<p>Doable, especially with a set of mirrors to increase the distance (although each mirror absorbs a signifigant fraction of light, like 10% ish)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel reasonably confident I did an experiment not very different from this (I forget the exact configuration of the rotating mirror and slits) but the only other mirror we used was only like 100m away.</p>
<p>IIRC, we had a small mirror rotating quickly, and a laser would bounce off of that mirror, to the large mirror far away, and then back to the small mirror (which would rotated some small fraction of a degree), and you could measure that change in angle depending on where the laser spot was showing up elsewhere. So using the known distance between mirrors and the known speed of rotation you could calculate the time it took for the light to travel 200m. Something like that, anyway.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A few people in my modern physics lab got within 1.7% error doing it in a ~30 m hallway. They didn't use &quot;household&quot; items though...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah we did the same experiment in undergrad. However we had the advantage of using precision scientific equipment (stable, controllable roto-mirror from Leybold and a photodiode array for displacement measurement). We were able to set it up in the class room. The frequencies of the roto-mirror weren't extremely high either, ranging from 100-600 Hz, but they were very stable. In this setup we observed displacements of the laser spot on the order of tenths of a millimeter. We measured <em>c</em> within 1% of the definition.</p>
<p>This general setup was invented by Foucault. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizeau%E2%80%93Foucault_apparatus" target="_blank">Here</a>'s the wiki page for those interested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did this as an experiment in undergrad. The concept is definitely sound. Our experimental error was between 60-80% thanks to our highly variable Dremel speeds.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't know about the spinning disk, but the Foucault method can be done in a long (~30 m) hallway with the right set up. Idk about getting the materials though, they're not quite household. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Adjust the distance between the light and the telescope until you can see the light when looking thru the scope.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rather than starting with a known speed of your spinning disk and adjusting the distance (which then would need to be measured somehow), wouldn't it be easier to start with a known, precisely measured distance (e.g., between two mountain peaks) and vary the speed of your spinning disk? As I understand it, that's essentially how Michelson, Pease, and Pearson did it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes that would probably be easier.  You need to measure the RPM in either case so making the distance (angle) a constant is a good idea.</p></div>		</li>
