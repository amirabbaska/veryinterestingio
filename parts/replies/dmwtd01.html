			<div class="markdown"><p>Anaesthetist here, it's not really central vs peripheral, it's whether it ends up on the right side of the heart (the lungs) or the left side of the heart (all other organs).</p>
<p>The venous system, regardless of central or peripheral will drain to the right side and then through the lungs which effectively filter out small air bubbles. </p>
<p>The other organs are more susceptible to even small air bubbles, which cause trouble if they get to the left side, but this is very unlikely unless it's a paediatric patient.</p>
<p>Large air bubbles can be a problem even on the right side, but not in the volume you get via an iv line.</p>
<p>The lethal dose for dogs is about 7ml/kg which would be a few hundred ml of air for a normal adult.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the IV tubing is roughly 10ml, the body <em>should</em> be able to handle and metabolize roughly 10ml of air. Theoretically the person starting the fluids/med could totally forget to prime the IV tubing and the patient not have any adverse effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IV tubing volume varies.</p>
<p>Also, some nurses send back tubing with bubbles because they don't want to clear them.</p>
<p>As an IV tech, I hafta say you are a pretty shitty tech if you can't achieve zero bubbles, so nurses should send them back to pharmacy if that happens.</p>
<p>I've seen nurses and pharmacists freak over one small bubble, but the main concern is the ton of tiny bubbles for a central line. Still... zero is so easy, I'm not sure why it's an issue, tbh</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Biomedical Engineering technician here: it's also worth noting for the unaware that infusion pumps are equipped with Air In Line (AIL) sensors that monitor if air a dangerous amount of air in in the line. These sensors are fail safes, as in, if they stop working, they infusion pump will simply refuse to function. </p>
<p>If the AIL detects air in the line, it immediately stops the infusion and the infusion pump/module will alarm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well explained. I just thought I'd point out bubbles in a vein won't normally go to your brain because the blood (and bubbles) in your veins return to the right side of the heart and get pumped through the lungs where any bubbles big enough to do any damage do the brain get stuck. The danger is when there is enough blood filling the right side of the heart that it can't pump properly (blood is incompressible so the heartbeat forces it towards the lungs, air is compressible so the heartbeat squeezes it without pushing all of it through the valve). As other comments mentioned, there are also situations where there is a hole between the right and left side of the heart so the air can go to other organs but most people don't have this problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Central lines actually have a much smaller diameter than the majority of larger peripheral IV lines (dual-lumen central venous catheters typically are  18/20 gauge while peripheral IV lines can be up to 14 gauge routinely in cases where high flow rate is required such as trauma).</p>
<p>Additionally, venous air embolism resulting in air bubbles going to the lungs is far more common than arterial air embolus with air going to the brain, coronary circulation, or systemic circulation. Infusion of air into a central line will likely cause demise of a patient due to rapid elevation in pulmonary arterial pressure resulting in rapidly decreased pulmonary venous return to the heart. This sudden decrease in blood return from the lungs to the heart and thereby the body is much more likely to cause a fatal arrhythmia than an air embolus to the brain.</p>
<p>Prevention strategy is as described above: all central lines must be thoroughly flushed, and air bubbles should be minimized in any line that enters a patient.</p>
