			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably got whacked by something is the general consensus. Planets form in the solar plane and will naturally rotate within that plane with everything else as they accrete. When a planet rotates weird, like Uranus on its side or Venus rotating backwards, the only simple explanation is that at some point something smashed into them and disturbed their rotation... they didn't form that way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Hold up - that <em>used</em> to be the consensus, but is generally not the preferred explanation any longer in planetary science.</p>
<p>Some 30 years ago, it was the standard answer that Uranus' odd axial tilt was the result of a giant impact. Bear in mind, though, that this was relatively soon after the Apollo missions had confirmed that our Moon had formed via giant impact (although there's evidence now that even this may not be so straightforward).</p>
<p>So, this may have been a case of &quot;when you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.&quot; Giant impacts started being used to explain everything a bit odd in the solar system. Uranus is weirdly tilted? Must've been hit by something! Venus rotates backwards? Must've been hit by something! Huge cliffs on Miranda? Must've been hit by something! Weird two-tone coloration on Iapetus? Must've been hit by something! Neptune has a mysterious source of internal heat? Must've been hit by something!</p>
<p>This hypothesis started waning about 15 years ago when impact simulations were getting good enough to show that it's exceptionally difficult to produce an impact that's large enough to tilt Uranus but not completely obliterate the planet. It's a little more likely to do this with multiple impacts, but still not exactly easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0181" target="_blank">The most likely scenario</a> at this point is that Uranus had some kind of gravitational near-miss, enough to induce a tidal torque that could turn its axial tilt. There's also some evidence that this scenario would require ejecting some mass in the process, possibly a big moon. The remaining moons would eventually fall in line with the new inclination angle of Uranus' equator due to tidal forces acting over billions of years. This explanation also has the neatness that it may explain why Uranus doesn't have a big moon, which we'd expect from most formation scenarios; moreover, there are at least some formation scenarios that suggest Uranus and Neptune swapped orbits early on, providing ample opportunity for this gravitational near-miss to occur.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not from here, and as a rogue planet, just got snared in the gravity of the sun and formed a stable or semi-stable orbit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned above, in the late 70's we realized <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/275037a0" target="_blank">you could bring Venus to a standstill</a> just from the tidal forces exerted by the Sun acting on the planet. You can then get a very slight backwards rotation from the effect of solar heating of the very thick atmosphere acting as a secondary torque on the planet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, I thought Earth's poles mimicked this behavior? Why look to Uranus?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, but it's not as extreme. Uranus's axis points almost directly at the sun during the solstice, resulting in nearly 50% of the planet sitting in perpetual darkness regardless of the rotation of the planet, not just a a sliver near the poles like on earth. This isn't the case during an equinox, which sees just about 0% of the planet sitting in perpetual darkness due to the axis pointing 90 degrees away from the sun. The Earth is like the leaning tower of Pisa, Uranus is like a felled tree. The effect is more pronounced and Unlike Earth, Uranus around the time of a solstice behaves just about the same as a tidally locked planet. Earth on the other hand still has far more than 50% of its surface exposed to a regular day and night cycle even during a solstice, making Uranus a much better choice for this comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically any poles will get half a year of continuous dark and half a year of continuous light. However, the greater the tilt, the larger the arctic circles will be - regions <em>around</em> the poles which experience continuous night for multiple rotations. Further, when an atmosphere is involved, you end up with an awful lot of <em>twilight</em> at the poles of less tilted bodies, but on a planet like Uranus the poles will still be in the dead of night for almost half the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that occurs because of earths slight axial tilt. Uranus is so close to 90 degrees of tilt that there are (earth) years when a full half the planet gets continual darkness, which doesn’t happen on earth </p></div>		</li>
