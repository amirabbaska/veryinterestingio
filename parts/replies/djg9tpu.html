<p>More specifically AD is likely a Deficiency Disease where you lack the cues for Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis over a long period of time, which leads to chronic HPA-Axis dysregulation, which leads to an accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles which makes it hard to protect the Hippocampal Complex from neurotoxic events. </p>
<p>This is why AD seems to begin in the Hippocampus, and leads to memory loss. </p></div>		</li>
