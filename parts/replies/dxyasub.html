			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer should be at the top. Important to distinguish that the exhaust gasses aren’t re-entering the engine. And that compression isn’t changing but manifold pressure is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without getting too technical...</p>
<p>When manifold pressure is above atmospheric (boost), the charger is cramming air into it and the cylinders are consuming it.  When you let off the pedal, the throttle plate closes and, suddenly, the air that's getting pumped into the intake system can't get out and the exhaust is no longer expanding at the rate the turbo is spinning.  The force on the turbo is now much higher from the pressure side of the intake, which will force the turbo to slow down very rapidly or even reverse it's spin.  You'd be taking it from over 100,000 RPM forward to 0 or backwards in a fraction of a second, which can be extremely harmful over time.</p>
<p>Take a drink straw and blow through it really hard, then put your finger over the other end.  The weak seal between your mouth and sinus releases the pressure through your nose.  Your lungs are the turbo, your finger is the throttle plate, your nose is the blow-off valve.</p>
<p>The purposed of a blow-off valve is to release that pressure and prevent damage to the turbo.  </p>
<p>Side note - blow-off valves have a close cousin (often they're actually the same device) called a diverter valve, which does essentially the same thing.  However, a diverter valve redirects the air back into the intake system upstream from the turbo rather than blowing it off to atmosphere.  When you'd use one or the other depends on the type of fuel management system your car is using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I asked this elsewhere, also, but hoping you can give me a good answer too...</p>
<p>How does a turbocharger affect scavenging of exhaust gasses from the cylinders?  Are the harmonics/momentum of the exhaust system still able to pull the gasses out of the cylinder effectively, or does pushing through the turbine force the cylinders to have to be more responsible for pushing gasses out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure I understand exactly what you're asking.  It's not the flow of exhaust gas that drives a turbo, it's the expansion.  Once exhaust valves are closed, the still hot and expanding gasses have nowhere else to go.  Unless you have a cylinder misfiring, the easiest path out will still always be the turbo or wastegate.</p>
<p>In mutli-cylinder reciprocating engines, it's not the cylinder in the exhaust cycle that's doing the pushing, it's the cylinder that's currently in the power stroke, which also generates so much more force than the backpressure added by a turbo, it's not a real issue.</p>
<p>Forced induction also requires some slightly different camshaft geometry than a naturally aspirated engine.  Primarily the lobe separation angle. </p>
<p>Edit:  To add just a little more to this, a turbo does result in increased backpressure, but it's a pretty negligible impact on low RPM power.</p></div>		</li>
