			<div class="markdown"><p>An immunologist I work with coined the term 'barrier hypothesis' which implies that a breakdown or loss of maintenance of barriers to the environment will expose the immune system in a non-tolerogenic manner. This can lead to allergic response. </p>
<p>It's common to see children with atopic dermatitis developing food allergy for instance. That hypothesis suggests that happens because they are getting sensitized through the skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, that is very peculiar for me to know: my sister has had atopic dermatitis (well, she technically still has, but it is better than it used to be) and has various food allergies (from shrimps to eggs and even kiwi). Some of these are for foods she even used to eat before, but  developped over time.</p>
<p>I hope more info can be discovered on that for the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I like the barrier hypothesis. One thing it doesn’t do very well, at least as I understand it, though, is explain the uptick in autoimmunity/allergy we’ve seen in the past several decades.</p></div>		</li>
