			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. If the USA wanted to kill Mahmoud Ahmadinejad when he visited they could have, whatever security he had isn't going to matter if the US was that serious about it. But it sets a <em>terrible</em> precedent. Now the USA assassinated a foreign leader in peacetime on their own soil when they invited him there. Once that happens why would any foreign diplomat ever visit the USA? And how could a US diplomat ever feel safe in another country?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US has an executive order against targeting heads of state, except in wartime.</p>
<p>Edit:  The reason for this executive order is simple.   If foreign heads of state believe they are targeted for assassination by the US, they might target the US president for assassination.  This came about as a result of the Kennedy/Castro era.   Kennedy had targeted Castro for assassination at one point, and later it was feared that Castro had targeted Kennedy for assassination.</p>
<p>Edit2:  Just to clarify, the executive order forbids assassination attempts.  It does not forbid military strikes targeting foreign leaders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That has been long over ridden (and had loopholes as well, i.e. &quot;clear and present danger&quot;). Other acts aside, the PATRIOT ACT allows for even US citizens to be killed, without any charged at all.
However, I did not read OP's question as to world leaders actually killing each other, it looked as if he was only asking about citizens within host nations. In any event, I think one would have to actually be five to think Obama would meet someone with a handshake and a Beretta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to live next to the UN in NYC and the security details are unreal, especially for the &quot;more controversial&quot; people. When Ahmadinejad visited the UN I doubt he even saw outside. They built a special covered area into the back of the hotel for his car to pull up to so he never had to be in the open. Two women who were upset with him for &quot;insert horrible thing attributed to him here&quot; managed to make it into the lounge of the hotel he was staying at and caused a scene. There was a big deal made about how big a security breach it was. Compared to normal &quot;UN is in session&quot; security, the security around for Ahmadinejad was significantly greater. I have only seen it greater for when the US President is at the UN. Secret Service do not mess around, at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No sense of humor with these guys. I was going to an event at a local high school where Joe Biden was speaking after he became vice president. Going through the metal detectors, which are operated by uniformed Secret Service agents, I cracked a bit of a joke.</p>
<p>&quot;Secret Service? More like Obvious Service, amirite?!&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this! Back when I lived in San Francisco I hung out with a bunch of Silicon Valley people. I asked this same question at a dinner hosted in a location with a direct line of site into Obama's hotel room.</p>
<p>Just so happens one of the venture capitalists there had the answer, as he was an investor in a company that made a product for just such an occasion.</p>
<p>The chemicals and film used in the lenses for long range scopes give off a very specific light signature. Before the president/ other dignitary is in town, there are massive LIDAR machines placed on the top of buildings through the city in any instance where the potential target might be in open air.</p>
<p>So, if you take out a gun with a scope (or even high powered binoculars) in open air, chances are LIDAR will pick it up. You'll have a sniper trained on you until the Secret Service can come and determine you're not a threat.</p>
<p>EDIT: not sure if this was the company he was an investor in - but here ya go <a href="https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/81714" target="_blank">https://www.sbir.gov/sbirsearch/detail/81714</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That only works if you can get a reflection between lens and LIDAR. Put this in front of the scope's lens</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hawke-Sport-Optics-Adjustable-HX3224/dp/B007UYS4VG" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Hawke-Sport-Optics-Adjustable-HX3224/dp/B007UYS4VG</a></p>
<p>and the LIDAR has to be at a very close angle (as seen from the scope) for a reflection not to be obstructed. If you don't want to invest 20$ you could as well buy a bunch of black straws, glue them together (in a cylindrical dense packing) and cut out a disc 2 cm thick.</p>
<p>Most high-tech solutions to security problems can be rendered ineffective by very cheap means.</p>
<p>Also you can DDoS the LIDAR by hanging AR coated binocular lenses into trees all over the city.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>holy shit!  That's what I'm talkin' about, that is some high tech stuff!  Man that really wraps that issue up nicely, obviously it would be practically impossible to do that sort of thing without a powerful scope or whatever.  Thanks so much!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Chances are&quot;... To be honest, that sounds quite a bit implausible. Not that they aren't trying, but that these attempts guarantee detection in any sense. There's no reason why there should be a clear line of view between some detector and a specific compound (the AR coating?) in the scope unless the detector is close to the target, or along the line of view.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't really defend against an expert sniper. The problem (for the baddies) is that there really isn't that many expert snipers in the world who would be good enough to carry out an assassination, actually want to carry out the assassination and, most importantly, get away with it. No matter what the movies would have you believe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hm, yeah I guess I hadn't considered that angle.  I think someone else mentioned something to that effect.  I suppose that a truly good sniper requires training and equipment that just isn't available to your average crazy person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, but it's actually pretty easy: just have <em>your</em> expert sniper stand where the VIP will be speaking and point out all the good shooting spots, then secure them. Put up visual barriers along any on-foot travel routes (the secret service use big canvas blinds and tents for this) and don't make unplanned stops. You just made any sniper's job 99% more difficult, to the extent that a successful sniping would basically be act-of-god territory, akin to a meteorite strike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer.  The entire international order depends on certain rules being followed.  When nations act outside of this system - by sponsoring terrorism or assassinating public and private citizens off the battlefield - they end up pariah states in the end.  Sadly, some non-rogue states have started using some of the worst tactics of the rogues just because they can.  This doesn't bode well for the future.</p></div>		</li>
