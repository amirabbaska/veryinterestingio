			<div class="markdown"><p>It very well could be.  For awhile when I was younger, I was a cutter (I am much better now).  Because of that and some other things, I have a slightly different relationship with pain.  It is almost exhilarating at times.  Other times it is almost a blinding rage depending upon the type and level of pain.  I also dealt with migraines a lot when I was a kid and and found those to be almost crippling.  I drove a chisel in the front of my finger one time down to at least the tendon and barely flinched.  But a minor hangover and I'm done for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can see this. I sliced the top of my finger a couple weeks ago from a disposable razor that was in my purse. I put my hand in it reaching for my phone charger and yup a bloody nasty CREEPY mess. At first I was in shock from the skin hanging and everything and then after I was flipping the fuck out, Immense stinging and pain and that eerie feeling of the tip of my finger being sliced open. Almost like when you cut your nail too close to the skin <em>shiver</em> ...I had no pain tolerance and that freaked me out more than anything when it comes to blood and cuts (broken bones being a different level of pain) even though I've sliced my skin shaving my legs or fell and tore my knees up many times. I wore a bandage for days after that not even wanting to look at it because I was so disgusted by it, and the sight made me feel sick. Yet, I could look at an open wound from skidding my knee on the concrete. So it depends on what's causing the pain IMO.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever pulled a muscle or had a cut that made normal life hard, it becomes apparent that it affects your affect. Heck, even having a cold can make a person less patient.</p>
<p>On the flip side, pain hurts worse when you're tired or stressed as opposed to when you're content, rested, and or happy. </p></div>		</li>
