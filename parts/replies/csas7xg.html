			<div class="markdown"><p>I know I'm really late to the party here, and I didn't read through many responses, but here is my answer as a professionally trained chef.</p>
<p>Onions work as a great foundation for almost any dish, but even more so for stocks, sauces, and soups.  One of a chefs best friends is a good ol yellow Spanish onion. (Spanish is actually a size clarification, not an origination.)  Yellow is typically your best bet when it comes to cooking because of the flavor profile, and conductance of other flavors when cooked.  There is a French term 'mirepoix' which is a ratio of 50% onion, 25% carrots, and 25% celery that is the vegetable base of any stock, and a good majority of soups.  What most people don't realize is that yellow onions have a great sugar content, and that's because if you eat one raw, there isn't very much sweet about it at all, but the sweetness comes from caramelizing, which basically means Browning the sugars in them, hence the dark and sweet flavor of French Onion Soup.  A side note, to get a yellow onion to cook down without caramelizing, add salt at the beginning of cooking the onion down; it makes them come out transparent but still removes the tartness, think the limp semi white onions you get on an Italian sausage sandwich.</p>
<p>Red onions are less tart and have a great mouth feel, that's why you see them in salads very often.</p>
<p>Almost any professional kitchen stocks those two types of onions, one for raw and one for cooking.</p>
<p>Green onions are sweet by nature and work well as a garnish because of that and the aesthetic contrast of adding green to a dish.</p>
<p>Pearl onions are mini white ones and work well in sauces due to flavor and mouth feel after cooked, most noticeably in a beef stew type atmosphere.</p>
<p>Also, google onion brule, sounds horrible but works wonders in soups and sauces.</p>
<p>Feel free to message me any questions related to this or cooking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LPT: If you soak sliced red onions in water before using them raw in a salad, they are less &quot;biting&quot; and more subtle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the ability to caramelize an onion.  If done properly, it actually brings out the flavor of the food and adds quite a lot to the dish.  (I'm normally the kind who eats my steak without sauce or anything, but a good caramelized onion is incredible on it.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go really easy on the baking soda if you follow this method, or else the onions will break down completely and you'll end up with mush. That's fine if you just want the colour and flavour for a sauce, but not if you want some recognizable pieces of onion in the finished dish (like a French Onion soup).</p></div>		</li>

<p>You just reminded me of when I was a little kid and got a tupperware bowl, some spices and salt from the kitchen so I could make soup. I actually thought that soup was just water and spices. Was disappoint.</p></div>		</li>
