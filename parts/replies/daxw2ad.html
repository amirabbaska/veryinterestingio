			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's go through some molecules:</p>
<p>CH4 methane -&gt; NH4^+ ammonium, totally fine<br />
CH3CH3 ethane -&gt; CH3NH3^+ methylamine, sure</p>
<p>I'm just going to assume the proton disassociates from here on.<br />
CH3CH2OH ethanol -&gt; CH3NH(OH) N-methylhydroxylamine, weird but stable<br />
CH3COOH acetiic acid -&gt; CH3NO2 nitromethane, totally fine<br />
C6H6 benzene -&gt; C5NH5 pyridine, still good  </p>
<p>In simple molecules, it's perfectly fine. However these molecules have very different chemical properties. It also drives the release of protons, lowering pH. But with the rates of radioactivity, it probably doesn't matter in any kind of macroscopic system.</p>
<p>Edit: added chemical names
Edit: methylnitrate -&gt; nitromethane</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things like that almost always has some sort of niche use because there are just so many different compounds and classes of compounds. Synthesis becomes more complicated the more moving parts you have, so I don't doubt that somebody somewhere might eventually make use of that. On the other hand, getting enough isolated carbon 14 to make a significant amount of product sounds extremely cost prohibitive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the carbon 14 case, the chemistry wouldn't be too exciting. You wind up with a quaternary nitrogen instead of a carbon, which for every case I can think of isn't out of the range of known structures for organic molecules: carboxylate becomes a nitro, benzene to pyridine, methyl to an ammonium, amide to a hydrazine N-oxide, etc. The pH would decrease over time since you're ejecting electrons and generating acidic protons, but if the beta decay is captured by the surrounding environment the bulk change would be nil.</p>
<p>Makes for some interesting changes to peptides and nucleic acids on geological timescales, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is neat. This relies on carbon and nitrogen having similar properties. What about (beta-) decay of some radioactive oxygen isotopes to fluorine? It would seem that a change like that could result in some very interesting chemistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, fluorine is so electronegative you'd wind up with an open valence on one of the groups attached to the oxygen. Funnily enough, assuming you're in water, you would likely wind up with an alcohol and an organic fluoride from an ether,  and a carbonyl would form a fluorohydrin, which can just eject fluoride and reform the carbonyl. An alcohol would form a super acidic proton and an alkyl fluoride.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have a stereotypical divalent oxygen, I believe that one of the bonds would end up breaking and making a radical and leaving the fluorinated compound pretty normal. eg: R:O:R'-&gt; R:F: + .R'  </p>
<p>I would not expect any charge or anything to show up. In the case of an oxygen double bonded (eg: carbonyl group), I would expect a radical to form on the non-fluorine species and the fluorine to fill it's valencies through the breaking of the pi bond. In the case of something like carbon monoxide with a triple bonded oxygen....the best I can come up with is a C=F radical. I'm only a junior chem major and I can't find anything supporting any stability of a carbon-fluorine double bond. It would have some resonance stabilization....but it's definitely exotic. My real guess is that the species would form for a very short amount of time and then decompose. Maybe someone more educated can chime in, especially on the triple bonded case.   </p>
<p>Edit: I can elaborate or add some diagrams if anyone wants a better explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a great description of the effect of recoil on the parent molecule, but I think it's worth adding that recoil is not quite the end of the story. Some of the energy released in the nuclear reaction can directly couple to electronic excitations in the host atoms and/or kick off secondary electrons produced can also wreak havoc. To quote <a href="https://books.google.se/books?id=pRXIwIV-hB8C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=recoil+c14+decay&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jl2Xv1w1_8&amp;sig=IYQD0DbYZ4EBMWuS9rlbJIhg3IE&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiij5e19eTQAhXB2SwKHXRtAvwQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=recoil%20c14%20decay&amp;f=false" target="_blank">a book that was posted below</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The chemical consequence of the beta-gamma decay Te^131 - I^131 have been studied in solutions of dibenzyl telluride. [...] <strong>In the solid phase the Te-C bond was ruptured in 98.2% of the nuclear events</strong>. Assuming [blablabla] the I^131 atoms should only have a recoil energy of 1.89 eV [...] <strong>Charge of electronic excitation effects [...] probably account for the high percentage of bond rupture.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, the degree to which these additional effects will be important will vary from case to case. However, I think it's fair to say that in general nuclear decay events will tend to be more destructive (sometimes a lot more) toward the host molecule/matrix than you might estimate from considerations recoil alone. </p></div>		</li>
