<p>This is made even worse by the fact that doctors and hospitals don't have to be transparent with how much their services cost (or even what services they will charge you for) keeping what little competition their could be from actually happening. </p>

<p>Doc here. Doctors and hospitals are <em>not the problem</em>. We charge a billing <em>code</em>. The insurance company then pays the agreed price for that code. How much the insurance company pays depends on the contract the doctor's office or hospital has with the insurance company. How much of that price the patient pays is based on the contract the patient has with the insurance company. </p>
<p>The insurance company is the middle man and is only one who has all the info to tell a patient how much a procedure will cost. Doctors and hospitals would LOVE to give patients a clear price but all we can do is tell them to call their insurance company. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The insurance company didn't lie, but wasn't totally truthful either. They can't tell you the cost because there are several levels of complexity when performing any office visit or procedure, each with its own billing code. <em>After the procedure</em> the doctor decides what level he performed.  </p>
<p>So the insurance company <em>could</em> have given you a range of prices, but they couldn't tell you the exact amount until after it was billed. </p>
<p>BTW, I hope everything is okay with the ultrasound issue. Be sure tell your doctor you're not getting the procedure. There might be other options or some urgency you didn't appreciate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I won't be using insurance. How much is the procedure?&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, I know our system is broken-bordering-on-shattered, but someone has to be able to answer THAT question. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Insurance biller here. yes he is correct. For the cost of a procedure the doctors office can not tell you. From the Insurance company standpoint we can not tell you what the expected owed amount before a claim will be either. The reason why was stated before. Doctor X has a contract with insurance company Y to have them pay a certain amount and have the remaining being what you(the patient owes). Now let's use a standard office visit as an example. A office visit cpt is usually a 99214 for an established patient. Doctors office bills insurance 250 for this code. Contract the doctor has states that they will pay 100 for the code. Now here is the key, in some contracts there are things called provider write off(see why you have co-pays). So with all of this if the insurance company says after this visit you will owe this much then it can come back in a lawsuit since I said you owe this much. So what I would suggest if you want to have a rough estimate on what you would owe is to get the CPT(Also know as HCPC) codes, then call your insurance and ask them what THEIR billable amount for said code is. Company is not at risk of lawsuit, doctor is not risk at lawsuit and if you Fuck up the math then you Fuck up the math.</p>
<p>TL;DR: both the doctors and insurance company can not tell you your amount owed before a procedure. It is due to legal reasons. If you want an estimate get the procedure codes(CPT) and ask your insurance for their BILLABLE amount.</p>
<p>TL;DR(doctor advice): have your billet look up your respective states Medicaid rate and development fee schedule. Your billers will thank you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That does not explain in the slightest why uninsured individuals walk away with overly inflated bills no normal person can ever afford and no hospital administrator ever expects to be paid in full, whereas insurance companies negotiate it down.</p>
<p>Hospitals are definitely <em>part</em> of the problem, especially the ones that are not upfront about the actual price an unaffiliated consumer would be charged.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They bill outrageously high expecting to only get paid what the insurance companies adjusts for. So the &quot;price&quot; is just some huge number that they assign that has little do with the actual cost of the procedure. After you speak with the billing department and tell them you are paying cash you can probably negotiate the bill to be something reasonable. Is this retarded, wasteful, and inefficient..Yep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because they cross their fingers and hope you'll pay something of it. It's completely fucked up, but they do have a lot of service that goes unpaid. They are trying to get that person to make up for it. </p>
<p>With that said, universal health care would cover this. That is, until the government decides to shut down and not pay for it for a few days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue here is, as you partly point out, that neither the patient, the doctor or the nurse have any idea what a procedure costs. None of them are directly involved in setting these prices, which is largely determined through private negotiations between health insurance companies and hospital bureaucrats. Single-payer health care systems are not a walk on roses either though. For example, the NHS in the UK makes up an incredible percentage of government spending and has recently received a lot of criticism for sub-par performance, both related to health care and to the inefficiency of spending. Prices are also driven up by tight regulation of the medical profession, with both equipment and personnel having to go through stringent (and expensive) certification. Health care, sadly, is one of those things that are just really, really difficult to get right, political considerations aside. I think you are spot on with your critique of the American system, but the European systems are far from exemplary industries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whatever your criticism of the NHS, it is considerably better at getting people healthy and cheaper than the US system. It may not be a walk on roses but its definitely not a walk on burning coals. While it takes quite a chunk of spending, very few people actually mind that. The complaints about the cost come from politicians who want to replace it with a private system. If you ask the people a large majority say it should get all the funding it needs.  Besides, it takes a far smaller chunk than child benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in London, and it always confuses me to hear Brits complain about the NHS. They think it's expensive, but it's not. It's actually one of the most efficient healthcare systems in the world. France's may be better, but it also costs its users more. The US's is extremely expensive and the care is, in my experience, often inferior.</p>
<p>There are complaints about wait-times, which I understand, but it's no better anywhere else -- particularly not in the US, where wait-times are what fear-mongering conservatives use as the bogey man to scare Americans away from single-payer systems. And yet as any American will tell you, multiple-hour wait times in private clinics are the norm, and often you will be scheduled to see a specialist weeks later than you expect. For example, I had a possibly cancerous mole removed from my calf. It had recently grown in size, was not homogenous in color, and was larger than the head of a pencil eraser. Parts of it had been removed years before because of concerns it could be cancerous; there is a history of melanoma in my family. The doctor agreed it was dangerous and needed to be removed, but I had to wait more than a month to have the (trivial) surgery done. It was benign, luckily, because if it had been melanoma four weeks could have been the difference between life and death. Was I on some shitty insurance in a shitty city clinic? No, Blue Shield, and the clinic was the Palo Alto Medical Foundation. Pretty much top-of-the-line.</p>
<p>In contrast, I had major surgery here in London last year. The NHS is amazing. Professional, efficient, and most of all, I didn't need to worry about what it was going to cost or whether my insurance would pay.</p>
<p>Like I said, France's quality of care is slightly better -- but when you look at how much they take out of your pay check to support it, it stops looking like such a good deal. The NHS on the other hand strikes an incredibly good balance between cost and quality.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, good quality care costs something. Doctors and nurses and other medical professionals work their butts off and are generally less well paid than they should be, given what they bring to the community. When the moment comes that it's your life, you want to know that the money that goes into the system is a) sufficient and b) appropriated as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>And because we all get older, health problems are inevitable. You <em>will</em> eventually find yourself in a position when your life is in a doctor's hands. When that happens, you'd rather be in a place like London or Paris than New York or Chicago, unless you're a billionaire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The inefficient spending is due to suppliers charging whatever they like because they know they Government will just pay up. They would cut costs massively if they properly kept track of everything they are being charged for. </p>
<p>You mentioned sub-par performance, that is due to idiots walking into accident and emergency with bloody nose bleeds and colds, genuinely. These are the people who are waiting more than 4 hours to see someone because they really don't need to be there! </p>
<p>The Gov. would save so much money if they put more effort into managing how effectively it is run, rather than just throwing more money at it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with everything you're saying except for the insurer bit. Insurer A has incentive to keep prices lower than insurer B because this will result in lower premiums and more membership for them.  The problem is there are so many insurers that none of them have any real bargaining power so this is a poor system for keeping health care prices down </p></div>		</li>
