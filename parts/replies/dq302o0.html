			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, scuba diving would scare the crap out of me. </p>
<p>Looking down into an abyss, knowing animals that have been apex predators since the dawn of time lurk in the shadows. The graves of men lay below me, their bones still with anxious patience, waiting for the depths to reclaim its rightful treasure. Under water I cannot scream. I can't run. I can't fight. Creatures would look at me, not with fear like most do on land. They would see an ill-equipped prey animal, with flippers and bubbles. Their cold dark eyes would tell of their own survival. How they have killed without remorse. How they have been attacked and fought off predators twice their own size. Their scars would prove it takes more than speed or intelligence to survive these harsh environments. The brutal beasts would investigate me by gnawing, grabbing, dragging me further down. Down until the pressure from the water pressed hard against my chest. Down until I felt my ribs collapse into my lungs. Down until the bone crushing weight of the ocean contorted my joints into a tied heap of knots. My skull would finally give to the pressure of a thousand atmospheres. My last thoughts to be thought would be of excruciating pain and fear as the cruel beast from below continued its spiral into total darkness.</p>
<p>Yeah, sorry. You're a better man (or woman) than me. </p></div>		</li>
