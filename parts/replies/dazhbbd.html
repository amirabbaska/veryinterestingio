			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. It's just amazing that such complex things are broken down into the simple stuff the build crew can handle.</p>
<p>Ive worked in the legal industry and am aware of transaction management - but making that physical as well as mental is to me what makes the process you describe so fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a structural engineer gone contractor and it really is amazing to watch come together. Add to the fact that the crews from subcontractors that come to do the work usually haven't so much as looked at the plans before arriving on site. Communication and coordination is the name of the game!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In U.K. popular culture builders have a reputation (definitely unfair - it's a stereotype) of just being straightforward jack-the-lads but I'm always trying to reconcile that with the same guys putting together a Zaha Hadid building flawlessly...coordinating all that requires a sensible approach from the lowest ranked guys on the lot too!</p>
<p>EDIT: This wasn't intended as some kind of insult, more just highlighting a cultural stereotype and how you can't match that with the reality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not saying that you were saying this...but &quot;build crews&quot; are made up of VERY skilled and experienced workers a lot of / if not most of the time. Yes, there is general labourers who push a broom of get you material and clean up after you. But most build crews are not a bunch of dummies swinging hammers and are people who have gone to school to learn to do their jobs and have thousands of hours of experience doing them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if it's been mentioned yet, but the blueprints for these kinds of buildings are incredibly detailed. There will be entire pages dedicated to wall sections which show a side cutout view of what's specified for the wall. They literally spell out every single detail (i.e. 8&quot;x20&quot; concrete footing @ 4,000PSI, #4 steel reinforcing each direction every 2&quot;)  that's just for the footing, then there will be arrows pointing to each part of the wall specifying exactly what material to use for sheathing, screw/nail spacing, what insulation to use, waterproofing material, how to fasten the brick, etc...there really is an incredible amount of detail. It's up to the construction manager to follow up with the contractors and carpenters to make sure these details are followed and everything is built in the right order. I've only just cracked into residential construction, so I'm sure these are 10x more complex with commercial construction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, everyone has a job, and the smaller you can break the overall scope down the more seamlessly things will be put together. For example in a chemical plant, you will have a team working on demolition of existing structural steel, demolition of existing pipelines, and maybe demolition of existing tanks or other large assets. They work from the current sets of layout drawings compared to post-demolition drawings.</p>
<p>You'll also have teams working on building or prefabricating the future equipment. A proper design will have drawings of what the area will look like once the demolition crews are done, and they'll have drawings of what the area will look like once they've built and installed their new equipment. You might even have phase specific drawings so they are connecting dots rather than filling in gaps.</p>
<p>Basically: plan ahead, make sure everyone knows their job, and have good designs/drawings. Hold people accountable for their timeline and budget so everyone knows when it's their turn to be in the hot seat for the critical path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former home builder, the process usually went like this: Customer looks at various plans (usually a model home if you're a bigger builder). Customer selects plan, selects lot in specific neighborhood (have to meet HOA code). Customer wants to make changes. Plans submitted for approval, loan app taken to bank for 70% of the value. Call OneCall to lay out where utilities may lie underground on site. Get availability of the guy who digs the basement. Utility companies are notified that a new home hook up is required at site. Paperwork submitted to them so they complete on time. Call the electrician and have a temporary pole for electricity installed. Framing crew and concrete guys notified for availability (had 2 framing crews and concrete guys that worked exclusively for me). Be on site for basement guy so you can go over the elevation so the house doesn't sit too high or too low, if it's a walkout, daylight, etc. Maybe turn a daylight into a walkout without disrupting neighboring lots. He does this with a transom (a surveying tool that gives elevation. Elevation is always figured so many feet above the street curb. Call plumber and notify for ground work. Layout the footings and sump pit. Layout and digging the footings is done by the foundation guy. The local inspector inspects the footings (what the walls sit on) for proper depth, width, and location. Footings are poured. Then the foundation guy comes in and sets up the forms for the walls. The forms are inspected, then the walls are poured. After about 3 days the forms come off, and the walls sit untouched for 2-3 weeks so the concrete cures. The basement guy comes back and backfills around the foundation so you have access, and no pitfalls. The plumber installs the drain tile and ground work, and the same day the concrete guys pour the floor to prevent the theft of the copper in the ground work. Next is the framers. They frame according to the plans, after you insure they have the most current version, and go over any changes or special items. The roof trusses and materials were ordered weeks ago, and delivered anywhere from a few days to weeks before the job starts. This depends on whether you have room to put things wherever you want. The framers frame the house, install the roof felt, windows, and exterior doors. The garage floor is poured so you can drywall the garage. My handyman comes in and installs temporary stairs from the garage into the house for safe and easy access. The framing is inspected, then the insulation is installed and inspected. Then the plumbing rough-ins, HVAC, and electrical rough-in. All must pass inspection before you can start drywalling. After drywall, the trim carpenter comes in and installs all the interior doors, baseboards, window casing,  cabinets, towel bars and toilet paper holders, door knobs and cabinet knobs and handrails. Some handrails may be temps as the permanent ones may be installed after the flooring, depending on design. Then the painter comes in, paints everything, stains and varnishes the woodwork, and paints the foundation wall to match the color of the siding, and all exterior doors. While all of this is going on inside, the exterior is being done. The siding, brickwork, roofing, decking, pouring the driveway and sidewalks, installing the sprinkler system and laying sod (usually last after the final grading). Any tile work is now done. After the tile work the electricians come and hang lights and install outlet covers, hook up to the toilet fans, and connect the furnace and fireplace if there is one. The plumbers install sinks, shower and bath hardware, toilets, and install the permanent water meter. Then the flooring is installed. After a walk through with the buyers to ensure everything looks correct, all the final cleaning and touchups are done, fix everything that may be incorrect. Then the appliances are delivered and installed. You have to be there in case they damage the flooring, so you don't eat that. Then all of the utilities are inspected again, and you get your final occupancy, hopefully comfortably ahead of closing on the property. During all of this you have the site cleaned several times so no one has to work in a cluttered environment. I've left out a lot, but this give you an idea of the complexity of just building a house. You have to really have your act together even more to do this with commercial building. So, no drinking, smoking weed, anything that will distract you from doing this with 15 projects going at once, while planning another 15-25. Sleep does not come easily in this profession. You lay awake every night trying to make sure you didn't miss anything.</p>
<p>TL:DR A lot of details go into building a house, several of which have been left out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you send out the surveyors, and they put little color coded flags everywhere and document what all the flags mean on the site map. Then the graders go out and give the site a rough grading at which time the surveyors come back out to double check the grading and reflag everything. Except of course, one of the surveyors notices that the graders have uncovered what appears to be a Native American graveyard. Now you have to pay off the surveyors to keep their mouths shut, and have your undocumented day laborers throw all the evidence in the skiff before the county comes out to inspect your storm water runoff handling. Also, the sewer line you were going to tie the whole project into is about 8 feet higher than what the records show, but that's actually a good thing because now you can truck in a bunch of dirt to keep all those bones and pottery nice and covered like they should be!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for making this point! Yes everyone has a job to do, yes there are lots of moving pieces to fit together to make a building or a new plat or a golf course come together. I work in Land Survey, I'm talking a bit out of my depth of knowledge, I rarely work on commercial project, but it's the surveyors that make the &quot;marks&quot; on the ground for the foundation, the pipes, utilities... you name it. There are many different methods, often time with large building with multiple stories the use of grid lines.  It is the surveyor's task to precisely marke out sets of grid lines for the other contractors to then measure off of to do their job.... set the foundation, or lay out the floor decking, the elevator shafts and so on. As the building is constructed floor by floor the surveyors had to transfer the same grids to the next floor with little room for error, +/- 0.002 of a foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah no problem. While I feel managers are important, how large buildings go together largely falls to the responsibility of the survey crew and the initial desires. Managers and contractors obviously are very important and need to follow the designs though (I am not trying to devalue them)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Newspaper articles always mention the developer and architect who completed a new building, never the Construction Managers/GCs who coordinated the whole thing.</p>

<p>Believe me, I've wondered this too.  I wish there was a reality show that went around and showed the life of a building getting constructed.  The networks won't do it (except for Megastructures) but maybe some enterprising YouTuber could make a name for themself doing this.</p></div>		</li>
