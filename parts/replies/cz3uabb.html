			<div class="markdown"><p>i would like to add something else to this: </p>
<p>the further up in the foodchain an animal is, the more toxins like lead and quicksilver accumulate in their bodies, therefore posing a risk if you rely on it as a primary source of food (for example, the corpses of fisheating eagles count as toxic waste, due to high levels of quicksilver)</p>
<p>so if you want to eat humans, start with vegans, they are healthier for you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mercury and lead binds to cells of living organisms and are very hard to get rid of. If you eat one microgram of lead, that one microgram will stay in your body until you die.</p>
<p>Plants and algae have basically the same concentration of toxins as the medium they are in, as they take their nutrients directly from the medium. For each gram of plant a herbivore eat, it is also eating a small amount of toxins. The other parts of the plant it ate, like the water and the nutrients leaves it's body easily as part of the metabolism, but the toxins don't, so the concentration of those will raise each time it eats. The older the animal, the higher the concentration.</p>
<p>So, carnivores eat food that have an already high concentration of toxins, so it builds up way faster in their bodies. Carnivores that eat other carnivores even faster.</p>
<p>I had a textbook that had an estimative of an increase of 1ppm per level of the food chain, so it would go</p>
<p>Plants: 1ppm
Herbivores: 2ppm
1st level carnivores: 3ppm
2nd level carnivores: 4ppm
and so on... Have no idea if that is accurate, though.</p>
<p>One thing people don't realise is that some fishes are way up the food chain, they eat fish that ate fish that ate fish that ate insects that ate other insects that ate plants (or even higher). And then birds eat those fish.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Toxins concentrate the higher up the food chain you go. The animals at the bottom (let's call them Level 1) absorb small amounts of toxins from the environment. The animals that eat those animals (let's call them Level 2) eat the accumulated toxins in the Level 1 animals, which means they have a relatively higher proportion of toxins. The Level 3 animals that eat <em>them</em> get even more toxins, and so on, so by the time you're at Level 6 or 7, you're basically toxic waste.</p></div>		</li>
