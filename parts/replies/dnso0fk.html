			<div class="markdown"><p>True.</p>
<p>Because drives are now so cheap, it's not worth it for anybody to fund enough research to be sure that no data could possibly be recovered.</p>
<p>You just shred them, because by the time you want to securely delete them, you can buy a bigger, faster, new one for cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given the NSA guidelines posted by MidnightExcursion below, I'd suggest that just because there's no indication it's possible doesn't mean someone somewhere can't do it if they really want to.</p>
<p>At best, you might assume it's unlikely, but it's always safest to assume anything is possible. Remember when no-one thought the NSA could possibly be monitoring every single communication in the country? yeah, good times...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may be dated, but I would not trust this kind of information to be <em>out</em>dated. Because underlying physics has not changed. Yes, the writing density has increased, and system go harder to the limits than ever to increase capacity, but a harddisks electronic is made to read data with <em>sufficient</em> precision to work and with very tight speed constraints. Taking the platters offline and examining them with high-precision equipment is a different beast altogether.</p>
<p>And if your aim is to make sure that no-one else reads certain information, you're better be safe than sorry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to describe it is this: the hard drive only knows where your data is by looking at a directory, like a table of contents in a book. Delete the table of contents and the hard drive forgets where your data is. This is what happens when you &quot;delete&quot; something. Then when you create new data, the hard drive starts writing over the existing data as if it wasn't there.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Therefor, if you want to get rid of the information you have to heat the drive beyond the Curie point.</p>

<p>That's not strictly true in the case of hard disks, though. </p>
<p>They can recover data by reading impulse on that part of the disk with more precision. But it's not as simple as that, depending upon the method used to erase the disk. If each track was simply overwritten with a series of 0's and 1's, correcting the current value of the data and retrieving the old data would be simple. </p>
<p>However, erasing the disk with randomly generated 0's and 1's would make it much more difficult. It still wouldn't be impossible, though it would be harder. </p>
<p>The real nail in the coffin for the idea that data cant be destroyed is multiple passes of random data when erasing the disk. Anyone attempting to recover the data can get more accurate equipment, but even specialized equipment can only be so accurate. In fact, at some point your accuracy must be smaller than the charge of an electron, because the charges that hold these 0's or 1's are miniscule. </p>
<p>If you wrote 35 passes of random data to every sector if the hard drive, I have a hard time seeing how the data that was on it could possibly be discovered. Unless I'm missing something. </p>
<p>None of that stands for SSD's though, which probably do need to be heated or at least very strongly magnetized in order to have their data be truly destroyed </p>
<p>Also, all of this neglects the reality that most people never actually erase their data. When you delete a file, you're just deleting a reference to the data, not the actual data itself. It still sits on the HD until the OS overwrites the unassigned storage. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Which has, to my surprise, being thoroughly disproven. Link is elsewhere in this thread. Perter Gutmmans &quot;35 passes&quot; seems to be dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing is only theoretical. There have been no known real world examples of recovering data from a single pass of zeros from a HDD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The real reason is that it takes hours to zero a drive and seconds to smash it to bits</p></div>		</li>
