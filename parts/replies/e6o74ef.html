			<div class="markdown"><p>In other words, if there is eventually a trade of goods and/or services for the money being received by the 2nd country for the given money, there should be a <em>balance</em> in the economy with no inflation? </p>
<p>Edit: Serious question, btw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In this super simplified setup that's basically it. </p>
<p>However, you have your money and I have mine and apples and bananas are far from the only commodity. So it's a little trickier than everyone just having dollars since the currency itself is also &quot;product&quot; you can purchase. This introduces some degree of trust/regulations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Say you had two cups filled with water. You poured water from one cup into the other. Since the cups are isolated, the water you took from cup 1 will stay in cup 2, and thus increase the <em>water supply</em> of cup 2 and decreasing it in cup 1.</p>
<p>Now imagine there was a slow but unlimited flow between the two cups. You pour water from cup 1 into cup 2, but eventually the water trickles back into cup 1 until they are at the same level as before. In this example, you didn't increase the actual supply of water available to either cup, just temporarily shifted where it was located.</p>
<p>Replace cup with country and water with money and its a super rudimentary example of how trade (the flow of water) affects the model.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There should be a balance, if you ignore outright uncertainty and &quot;erring on the side of caution&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course national economics are huge beasts and complex processes, they are not necessarily easy to predict (case in point: the 2008 housing crisis).</p>
<p>Basically you're guessing, hopefully in a qualified manner to increase the odds of being correct. Those guesses translate into adjustments in regulation and guidelines from central banks that other banks must follow (banks being the main institutions for flow of money and credit). But since you are never completely correct, neither will there ever be balance. This unbalance can so far as seeing healthy economies completely crashing because nobody believes in them.</p>
<p>Also, somewhat confusingly the simplest job of the regulations and guidelines is to determine the amount of money, the difficult bit is to ensure flow of money. Because since FIAT money (the name for this type of currency) is only measured in what it is worth when it is used in buying and selling, it will collapse if there is no flow.</p>
<p>But exceedingly confusing: A currency's flow can be kept upright by selling and buying of the currency itself, which is a bit like speculating in gold except you're buying something on the promise that it is worth something, even though it won't necessarily ever buy anything except more promises. If you think that sounds like a right house of cards, then you understand why many crypto-currencies are suddenly looking at the grim prospect of regulation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>But yeah, too far down the rabbit's hole.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because most countries have their own currency. Increasing the supply of one of them devalues it, so its purchasing power abroad falls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You missed a piece there. When the money supply increases (and thus prices inflate) that rarely leads to an immediate wage increase, especially at the bottom. So if I'm making $1 a day, and I used to be able to buy 2 apples with that, if the price doubles but my pay doesn't, all of the sudden I can't buy 2 apples, only one.</p>
<p>This is what has happened recently in Venezuela. The money supply has grown exponentially (and I mean that literally, not figuratively), but the minimum wage (which is also the average wage) has not. Thus people cannot afford to feed <em>themselves</em> enough calories to eat for a day after a day of full time work, much less feed their family or pay rent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's all part of the delayed propagation I was talking about. Wages usually are the last to rise, but they do eventually.</p>
<p>When you have hyperinflation like you do in Argentina, the economy is largely falling apart and money starts to just plain become worthless</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Historically wages <em>usually</em> rise, though not always. The <a href="https://aflcio.org/sites/default/files/migrate/files/Five-Causes-of-Wage-Stagnation-in-the-United-States.jpg" target="_blank">current state in the US</a> is demonstrable of that, though there's a ton more going on there than just money supply changes.</p></div>		</li>
