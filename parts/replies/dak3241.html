			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if my layman-mind is interpreting this correctly. In theory, a pregnant woman should expose herself to peanuts, cats, dogs, horses, farm animals and what ever other allergies there are out there. As to make the babies immune-system accustomed to these things and not freak out when in contact with them later in life?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like sound advice to me.</p>
<p>One thing I find weird about myself, is that I am allergic to cats (confirmed by doctor and blood sample). My girlfriend has two cats, and I just refuse to let myself react to them. Sometimes I itch a bit in my nose, other than that nothing. So maybe, just maybe mind over matter is a thing?</p>
<p>I do meditate at least once a week. Probably helps as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has this really been proven? That would be very cool. Bamba is great because it's very soft so babies can chew it with their gums.</p>
<p>It's sugar free and gluten free so diabetics and celiacs can enjoy it too. I did a low carb diet where it was actually a recommended occasional snack.</p>
<p>Also pregnant women and adults in general eat it because it's fucking delicious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A <strong>correlation</strong> is &quot;these two things are both happening at the same time&quot; which is quite easy to prove. All you have to do is observe both things at the same time.</p>
<p>The <strong>causation</strong> is &quot;this thing makes the other thing happen&quot; which is quite hard to prove when the subjects are humans. For that, you need lots of data and some models and some theory, and even then you are not necessarily proven. </p>
<p>The easiest way to prove it would be to conduct an experiment. Sadly, humans do not want to take part in experiments that can lead to a higher chance of getting a harmful allergy. They might still be able to run the other side of the experiment and try and <em>avoid</em> the peanut allergy by giving pregnant woman and young children peanuts, but it will still be lacking a strong control group.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could it be detection rates? Like maybe they haven't changed at all, just that kids died of 'choking' or something because nobody really knew what was causing it? I'm sort of thinking along the lines of the cancer rates in 1st world nations being shown to be so much higher, but how it lowers greatly when accounting for the fact that cancer doesn't get screened as often in mud-hut villages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's possible, but unlikely. The rates of serious allergies have increased markedly whist detection methods have no changed. The social aspect is not likely to lead to an increased detection of people with severe allergies (though it very well could for more moderate forms). Allergy deaths are unlikely to be mistake for something else either. </p>
<p>The comparison is a little different in context too. It isn't a comparison between a country with little to no medical infrastructure and one with world class infrastructure. The comparison is one over a relatively short period of time, within the same area. Places that already had great medical infrastructure in the past, where people absolutely would go to a doctor for life threatening allergies.  </p></div>		</li>
