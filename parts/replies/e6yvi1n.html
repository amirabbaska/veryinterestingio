			<div class="markdown"><p>Physics major here, but not very confident in my abilities. </p>
<p>If the umbrella was able to <em>absorb</em> the oncoming air, momentum would balance and the skateboard wouldn't move, right? But it doesn't; it <em>reflects</em> the air, which results in twice as much momentum being imparted on the umbrella which pulls the system forward. Correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's where the more correct answers here are aiming, yeah.</p>
<p>Of course it's not going to purely absorb or purely reflect; it's going to do...  something complicated.  A tiny umbrella might let most of the air past and only reflect a little of it, for instance.  And friction or turbulence is going to sap some energy somewhere along the way.  I think the general answer is that the skateboard could end up moving forward, backward, or nowhere, depending on the shape of the umbrella and the properties of the blower and maybe a lot of other things; and I think that the &quot;canonical&quot; answer matching some kind of ideal blower and ideal umbrella, if one could be come up with, is more likely to have the skateboard moving as if the blower is pushing it by the umbrella-sail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. I think this is the answer. The air bounces off with the opposite velocity imparting -2mv to counteract the initial mv of the blower, making you move forward. </p>
<p>In terms of the reason it would bounce off with the same speed, that depends on the material but it's reasonable for most solids and the maths works out if you use conservation of energy and assume there is no heating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without the umbrella, it will propel you in the opposite direction of the blower, so there is some acceleration present without the umbrella and the umbrella at best will just deflect that force in a different direction with less efficiency. But as mentioned, there is a complex conglomeration of factors involved where creating a model might be the easiest way to experiment with results. My instinct says that any sail-like dynamic on the umbrella would be canceled by the mass of air coming out of the blower itself and movement would be determined by deflection with losses through turbulence. Since a sail is big to catch the most of a broad source of energy, and we are looking at focused energy, a cap on the source would be the most efficient sail which might as well be a u shaped tube or hemisphere cap where then you are figuring the difference between output and turbulence to figure how much less efficient it would be compared to pointed backwards.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming we are holding the leafblower and the umbrella tight. We are adding a force in the forward direction. Similar to someone pushing us in the back. If the force from the leafblower can overcome the frictional forces between the wheels and the ground and wind resistance on the other side of the umbrella, the skateboard will move forward, if I am not mistaken.</p>
<p>Edit: I should say similar to wind blowing at our back to move us forward instead of a push.</p></div>		</li>
