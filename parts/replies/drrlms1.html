<p>While some of the better ones could get very very dark,  plasmas were <em>not</em> capable of true blacks. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In theory that was true for CRTs, but in reality it was more like those LCDs which can shut off some parts of the backlight. When you light up a pixel on a CRT the light is also emitted out the back of the pixel, a lot of them then bounce around inside and come back out of other pixels. That's why when you have a black screen with an illuminated part on a CRT the black part doesn't look black.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plasma has an unrelated issue with similar effect, the response time to bring a pixel up from true black is too long so most displays use 'almost off' instead of off</p></div>		</li>
