			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate, once the sample is fixed in formalin, it will be disposed of as a non-hazardous waste by the hospital's hazardous waste disposal contractor. If they're disposed of fixed in formalin, they'll be drummed up and sent for incineration. Depending on volume, they samples may be drained from the formalin. In this case a drum of formalin is sent for incineration as a non-hazardous waste and the tissue will be red-bagged and sent for incineration. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to what you've already stated.... Most things taken from the body (including tissue/organs, foreign bodies, medical devices, etc) go to the pathology department for examination before disposal. There are some general exceptions where specimens are not sent to pathology - including: placentas that appear normal during delivery, teeth removed for dental caries, foreskin from newborn, orthopedic hardware, tissue from cosmetic surgery, fat from liposuction. This list is not written in stone and varies from hospital to hospital. Ultimately it depends on your lab/hospital protocol to determine what needs to go to pathology.</p></div>		</li>
