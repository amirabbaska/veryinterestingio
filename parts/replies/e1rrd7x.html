			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for everyone, but most of my family in the south basically doesn't cook that kind of food when it's 85 degrees plus. </p>
<p>Cookouts and barbecues, fried foods, etc, those are all 'regular weather' food. Which, when you live in 75+ summers, means 75 or so. You're used to it, so it feels like normal temperature. </p>
<p>Just like us, once it gets warm by their standards, they switch to lighter fair.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many people in the Southbor of Irish, Scottish, or Scots-Irish descent. Both Ireland and Scotland (the whole of the British Isles, really) tend to be cold,wet and damp places, so hearty, fatty foods were good there, since they kept you warm.</p>
<p>When they emigrated to the southern US, they took their cuisine with them, but didnt bother to modify it much for the climate</p></div>		</li>
