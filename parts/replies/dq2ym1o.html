			<div class="markdown"><p>All the above. But also the fact that solar arrays need to be folded up for launch then unfolded in orbit.</p>
<p>Spacrcraft engineers <strong>hate</strong> mechanical things, especially complex mechanisms whose failure would cripple the mission. Making mechanisms that work reliably in space is not easy, especially as metal moving parts have a tenancy to bind in vacuum - a phenomenon called <em>vacuum welding</em>.</p>
<p>Obviously it's a problem they had solved - deployable solar panels were a thing then. But why take the risk? If an Apollo CSM in Earth orbit had a solar panel jam half-way open, the lunar landing would've been cancelled and the astronauts would have had to come home. The entire mission would have depended on one mechanism working correctly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another issue is if they had relied on solar panels instead of fuel cells and they were unable to open while already on trajectory for the Moon they could potentially run out of power and freeze to death and/or never return to Earth. With fuel cells you can keep the heat on so long as you have enough fuel, which is much easier to plan for than external folding panels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on Intelsat V &amp; VI.  On V we had several cases of solar panel arrays having trouble opening.  </p>
<blockquote>

<p>Most of the problems we had were mechanical. To put the fuel cells in perspective, they had three on Apollo and <em>each</em> was 3KW, 28VDC @ ~110A.  For a total of 9KW. That would run my house. The equivalent solar array would be enormous. Bigger in area than the capsule itself At least a ~50m^2 array that would have to unfold in space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does vacuum welding occur because, with no atmosphere to occupy the space between metal surfaces in contact, the metallic bonds extend across the gap between them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! The oxygen in the atmosphere reacts with the surface layer of metals and produces an oxide layer which helps prevent it. It's my understanding that in space, atoms between two pieces of metal that come into contact can't &quot;tell&quot; which piece they belong to, so they bond together. The oxide layer and whatever atmosphere is present helps prevent that because the metal atoms never come close enough together to bond</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funnily enough, the lunar orbiter version of the Soyuz (7K-LOK; analogous to the Apollo CSM) eschewed the solar panels used by the rest of the Soyuz family for - you guessed it - fuel cells. </p>
<p>Solar panels of the era had a substantially lower power-to-weight ratio than modern solar panels, and fuel cells were typically more efficient. As to why the regular Soyuz had solar and the 7K-LOK didn’t, I’m not sure. I suspect the weight of fuel cells was less than the weight of solar panels + water + breathing oxygen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first handful of Soyuzs used solar cells. Then they dropped them and used batteries on all the Soyuizs launched to the various Salyut space stations in the 70's. </p>
<p>When the upgraded Soyuz-T was introduced in the 80's, the solar panels came back and have stayed with all subsequent versions.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, weight. Solar cells can be quite heavy and a lot of design decisions for Apollo were driven by weight.</p></div>		</li>
