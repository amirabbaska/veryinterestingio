			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to elaborate on why it distorts: the refractive index of air varies slightly depending on its temperature (and thus density). This is why a mirage happens in the desert or on a hot road surface. The hotter air near the surface refracts the light at a different angle than the surrounding air causing weirdness to be seen. </p></div>		</li>
