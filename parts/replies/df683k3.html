<p>This immunity is irrevocable, except by written consent by the diplomat's country. So even if a diplomat went out on the street and killed 10 people and screamed that he was waving his immunity, he would not be tried in the host country, unless his country's government agreed to this.</p>

<p>As you say, this depends on the country. If an American went on the rampage in Afghanistan, the US might run with the line that they weren't confident in the Afghan court system and they would be returned and tried in the US.</p>
<p>If a member of the US Embassy walked out into Central London or Paris and murdered 10 people in cold blood, then the international community would pretty much be &quot;You do whatever the fuck the British/French Government want - you owe them <em>big style</em>. If they want to try them, you're going to hand them over, if they're happy for you to try them, then they'd better be getting an equal or greater sentence than they'd get in Britain/France&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course that's assuming the perpetrator makes it out alive - if French or British Armed Response arrived at an active shooter situation there's a fair chance the shooter will be killed before their diplomatic credentials are established (they'll certainly be arrested, pending confirmation of their immunity - until they're confirmed as an Accredited Diplomat they're just &quot;some guy&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, everything you said is correct. I just gave the extreme case to show the technical and theoretical limits of diplomatic immunity. In the extreme case, of course questions of politics come into question, and that will depend on several other factors specific for each case. But even then, the country has the legal right to not waive their agent's immunity and the host country would have to comply or face applicable punishments under international law. </p>
<p>In the case of the US Embassy member in Central London, for example, the US could still maintain his immunity and he would not be tried in the UK. But, as you mentioned, at a high political cost, and an unnecessary one if the US looks at his case and sees that he literally just lost his mind and went on a rampage. Why go through the hassle and costs to fly this bozo home only to fire him from the State Department, arrest him, pay for his jail time and lawyer, clog up a court, etc? Let's just let the British be happy and try him. </p>
<p>However, maybe there is no clear evidence that it was him that did the shooting (no video or audio, proof is only circumstantial, etc), and this guy shoots Washington a cable saying that this is all a big set-up by the UK, and convinces them, the US may choose to bring him home to figure out what's up. </p></div>		</li>
