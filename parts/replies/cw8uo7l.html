			<div class="markdown"><p>But it's your brain that interprets pain.</p>
<p>I'm by no means anything close to an expert on the human body, and everything I have here is the result of some quick searching, but there are a number of chemicals that work essentially as analgesics within the body, and dopamine is one.</p>
<p>There are sensors throughout the body called nociceptors which transmit signals to the spinal cord and up to the brain.  The nociceptors seem to specifically carry the &quot;pain&quot; signal.</p>
<p>So when the brain is secreting its analgesic chemicals, they inhibit the nociceptors.  So basically, they are stopping the trasmission of &quot;pain&quot; signals being sent from the nerves at the site of the injury to the brain, which is why it appears to hurt less or not at all.</p>
<p>It's all in the mind, and has little or nothing to do with inflammation.  Look at it this way: there are people who literally cannot feel pain or lack the proper response mechanism (CIP - Congenital insensitivity to pain^(1)) which is the result of chemical imbalances or straight up irregularities/mutations in the brain.  They still get inflammation...they just can't feel it (or can but their brain doesn't know how to respond properly), so the fact of inflammation as a bodily reaction to an injury is not itself the cause of pain.</p>
<hr />
<p>^1 There are generally two types of non-response exhibited.</p>
<p><em>Insensitivity</em> to pain means that the painful stimulus is not even perceived: a patient cannot describe the intensity or type of pain.</p>
<p><em>Indifference</em> to pain means that the patient can perceive the stimulus, but lacks an appropriate response: they will not flinch or withdraw when exposed to pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, but you made a few connections that aren't. Nociceptors do carry the pain signal up the spinal cord, and the brain does secrete analgesic chemicals to inhibit them. However, this is more how painkillers and some anesthetics work than how the body normally operates. The brain only holds a finite amount of these chemicals and they aren't used unless necessary (fight or flight). Inflammation is actually why OP feels his injury at all, he's talking about why he can scrape his skin and only notice it a few hours later. </p>
<p>OP's question is because the injury wasn't deep enough/didn't hit the pain receptors below the skin. Or the injury could be so big that it cuts the nerves before they can signal, but once the immune system inflames the area the nearby receptors are activated and send the pain signal. CIP is actually extremely interesting and you are completely right, they could bite off their hand and wouldn't feel any pain because the area where nociceptors reach the brain is altered and the signal isn't recognized. But this is only in a very, very small percent of the population and doesn't apply to this situation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thoroughly disagree. It is true that CIP patients do not feel pain, but this is due to a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1399-0004.2007.00790.x/full" target="_blank">loss of fuction of the sodium channel Nav1.7</a>. </p>
<p>Nav1.7 is expressed on nociceptive (pain sensing) neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (the cell body of neurons that carry information from the periphery to the central nervous system). Upon opening of Nav1.7, it causes an influx of cations, which depolarises the neuronal cell membrane and ultimately lead of firing of action potentials. It is the abnormal/ectopic firing (i.e. too much action potentials) generated in nociceptive neurons that lead to sensation of pain. </p>
<p>It isn't just something that happens 'in the mind', CIP patients have neurons that don't fire in respond to ALL painful stimulation, and inflammation is ONLY one type of painful stimulation. </p></div>		</li>

<p>In other words, about the point where you start ignoring the blue chips flying at you and just keep turning the feed as usual unless a big one gets stuck in your arm hair against your skin or something, and even then just shake it off while turning the feed with the other hand. (Before you suggest long sleeves - no. Just no. Very bad idea for a variety of reasons.)</p></div>		</li>
