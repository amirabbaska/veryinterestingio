			<p>It could also be due to nerve damage. I don't feel much on my right leg since I had surgery in my knee. The doctor somehow damaged my nerves down there..<br><br>It's quite unlikely that he doesn't feel because of brain damage unless he hit his head pretty hard. And that would often also lead to more mental problems.</p>		</li>

			<p>But it's your brain that interprets pain.<br><br>I'm by no means anything close to an expert on the human body, and everything I have here is the result of some quick searching, but there are a number of chemicals that work essentially as analgesics within the body, and dopamine is one.<br><br>There are sensors throughout the body called nociceptors which transmit signals to the spinal cord and up to the brain.  The nociceptors seem to specifically carry the &quot;pain&quot; signal.<br><br>So when the brain is secreting its analgesic chemicals, they inhibit the nociceptors.  So basically, they are stopping the trasmission of &quot;pain&quot; signals being sent from the nerves at the site of the injury to the brain, which is why it appears to hurt less or not at all.<br><br>It's all in the mind, and has little or nothing to do with inflammation.  Look at it this way: there are people who literally cannot feel pain or lack the proper response mechanism (CIP - Congenital insensitivity to pain^(1)) which is the result of chemical imbalances or straight up irregularities/mutations in the brain.  They still get inflammation...they just can't feel it (or can but their brain doesn't know how to respond properly), so the fact of inflammation as a bodily reaction to an injury is not itself the cause of pain.<br><br>**<em><br><br>^1 There are generally two types of non-response exhibited.<br><br></em>Insensitivity<em> to pain means that the painful stimulus is not even perceived: a patient cannot describe the intensity or type of pain.<br><br></em>Indifference* to pain means that the patient can perceive the stimulus, but lacks an appropriate response: they will not flinch or withdraw when exposed to pain.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're right, but you made a few connections that aren't. Nociceptors do carry the pain signal up the spinal cord, and the brain does secrete analgesic chemicals to inhibit them. However, this is more how painkillers and some anesthetics work than how the body normally operates. The brain only holds a finite amount of these chemicals and they aren't used unless necessary (fight or flight). Inflammation is actually why OP feels his injury at all, he's talking about why he can scrape his skin and only notice it a few hours later. <br><br>OP's question is because the injury wasn't deep enough/didn't hit the pain receptors below the skin. Or the injury could be so big that it cuts the nerves before they can signal, but once the immune system inflames the area the nearby receptors are activated and send the pain signal. CIP is actually extremely interesting and you are completely right, they could bite off their hand and wouldn't feel any pain because the area where nociceptors reach the brain is altered and the signal isn't recognized. But this is only in a very, very small percent of the population and doesn't apply to this situation.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;It's all in the mind, and has little or nothing to do with inflammation. Look at it this way: there are people who literally cannot feel pain or lack the proper response mechanism (CIP - Congenital insensitivity to pain1) which is the result of chemical imbalances or straight up irregularities/mutations in the brain.<br><br>I thoroughly disagree. It is true that CIP patients do not feel pain, but this is due to a <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1399-0004.2007.00790.x/full" target="_blank">loss of fuction of the sodium channel Nav1.7</a>. <br><br>Nav1.7 is expressed on nociceptive (pain sensing) neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (the cell body of neurons that carry information from the periphery to the central nervous system). Upon opening of Nav1.7, it causes an influx of cations, which depolarises the neuronal cell membrane and ultimately lead of firing of action potentials. It is the abnormal/ectopic firing (i.e. too much action potentials) generated in nociceptive neurons that lead to sensation of pain. <br><br>It isn't just something that happens 'in the mind', CIP patients have neurons that don't fire in respond to ALL painful stimulation, and inflammation is ONLY one type of painful stimulation. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Indifference to pain means that the patient can perceive the stimulus, but lacks an appropriate response: they will not flinch or withdraw when exposed to pain.<br><br>In other words, about the point where you start ignoring the blue chips flying at you and just keep turning the feed as usual unless a big one gets stuck in your arm hair against your skin or something, and even then just shake it off while turning the feed with the other hand.

			<p>But even then, it's not really that.  It's the noxious stimulus that activates the nociceptors.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociception" target="_blank">Nociception</a>  is the encoding and processing of harmful stimuli in the nervous system.  The nociceptors, or pain receptors, only respond to tissue damage caused by intense chemical (e.g., chilli powder in the eyes), mechanical (e.g., pinching, crushing) or thermal (heat and cold) stimulation. Once stimulated, a nociceptor sends a signal along a chain of nerve fibers via the spinal cord to the brain. Nociception triggers a variety of autonomic responses and may also result in a subjective experience of pain in sentient beings. Nociceptive neurons generate trains of action potentials in response to intense stimuli, and the frequency of firing determines the intensity of the pain.<br><br>So it's the paper cut, for example, that triggers the nociceptors and thus the pain.  The body then reacts after the fact to heal the wound, which is where the inflammation process (<a href="http://cichirowc.com/uploads/2012-01-30_Inflammation_and_the_healing_process.pdf" target="_blank">healing</a>) comes in.  So while I will concede that inflammation can hurt because of nerve compression, it is not the reason for the delay - that rests more squarely on the chemicals in the brain inhibiting the nociceptors initially.</p>		</li>

			<p>The inflammation, or oedema don't squeeze pain receptors, there are stretch receptors that senses mechanical stretch and pressure and they are not the same thing as pain receptors (i.e. nociceptors). <br><br>Inflammation causes pain because it promotes angiogenesis, which means more blood flow to the site of inflammation. With more blood flow, more immune cells are directed to the site of inflammation. Immune cells are capable of causing pain by 1) releasing factors that directly sensitise nociceptors; 2) attract and recruit more immune cells to the site of inflammation and 3) activate other signalling cascades that lead to the release of other pro-inflammatory and pro-nociceptive mediatiors, such as glutamate and substance P.<br><br><a href="http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n11/abs/nn1992.html" target="_blank">source</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Also I'd imagine it depends on what you're doing - something that requires more concentration, or more bodily resources, might limit you feeling smaller injuries. </p>		</li>

			<p>Dopamine isn't only used in the brain, it is a neurotransmitter in other areas as well.<br><br>A delay could be due to a slower bleed in the damaged area, as well as the inflammatory reaction that takes place. Substances like bradykinin lower the pain threshold so that otherwise normal stimulus hurts (to prevent you from further damaging sensitive tissue).<br><br>Furthermore, neurotransmitters like adrenaline and serotonin act in a similar way as opiates to blunt your sensation of pain early in an injury. This is so that you are not as distracted by pain when your life is still in danger (such as fighting off an attacker or escaping a fire).</p>		</li>

			<p>Jumping on to your comment to say that your body is hurting in some way more often than not. Even if you can't feel any physical pain, there is something wrong with your body that's hurting right at this moment. Dopamine is blocking the pain out for you, so you can't even notice it. </p>		</li>

			<p>For the longest time I thought the Adderall I take daily had dopamine in it. I feel like that's a common misconception with a lot of drugs that effect the brain. They aren't chemicals that cause the relief/effects, they just trigger the chemicals already naturally in your body to go into overdrive. </p>		</li>

			<p>This is correct, but there's also additional factors at play. <br><br>There's two key things our brain does to our body after tissue injury, they're called hyperalgesia and allodynia. Hyperalgesia is increased pain response and allodynia is pain on a non-painful stimulus.<br><br>So best to think of when you really badly hurt yourself, like a sprained ankle or worse kind of pain. What initially happens is pain due to the event, then inflammation and swelling causing additional pain. But also, the brain increases our pain response and suddenly that mild swelling pain is actually quite bad, and that light feather touching it actually hurts.<br><br>Not only is there the injury and inflammation causing pain, but pain causes our brain to make us feel more pain.</p>		</li>

			<p>You are correct, the &quot;dopamine&quot; that /u/barbodelli is talking about isn't released at the site of the injury, but rather in the brain stem to intercept the pain pathway's signal.
