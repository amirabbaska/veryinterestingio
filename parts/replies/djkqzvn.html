			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, the difference between the two states, sleep and unconsciousness, as it applies to the question is that your body can still process that time is passing, even when you are asleep, which is why you can wake up, and before you actually register anything in your room, know you are late, as an example. </p>
<p>However, when you are unconscious, your body generally cannot process that time has passed, as it has no inputs to reach that conclusion. Its similar to what happens when you are put into a sensory deprivation tank. Since you have no sensory inputs other than touch, you quickly become unable to tell how much time has passed. A large part of how we observe time is based on what we can observe with our senses, hence why time seems to pass slower when we are watching a clock, because with each movement of the second hand, we are processing an input that we have taught our brains to associate with time.</p>
<p>Depending on how deeply you sleep, this can also occur, but its also tied to how well you sleep. You sleep in cycles, and depending on which cycle of sleep you are in, you can feel very differently upon waking. IIRC, there are cycles of sleep where if you are awoken in, meaning some stimulus that your brain registered is what woke you (as opposed to your body just going &quot;it's time to wake up, I've rested enough&quot;) throws you into a higher state of awareness more quickly, thus your brain doesn't spend nearly as much time during wakening processing the time spent asleep. This is largely believed to be due to it makes more evolutionary sense for your brain to not spend time going &quot;hey what time is it&quot; when instead it could be going &quot;Is something about to eat me?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is happening at the cellular level when we are unconscious? Do neurons everywhere stop working?  Is there a gateway that sits between the brain and the body that controls incoming signals? </p>
<p>Also, is there a difference in the brain when we are unconscious due to trama Vs. medication? </p></div>		</li>
