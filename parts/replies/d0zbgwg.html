			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha I didn't know that about the big mac. Funny thing is that when I did the backpacking Europe thing after high school, McDonald's dollar menu was how we determined our purchasing power in each country. The Swiss franc was the reason we only spent a weekend in Switzerland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually joking about this with someone in the bar on Saturday night, he had moved from Boca Raton to Pittsburgh and was complaining that it's difficult to order a value menu item down there because many of the fast food workers speak Haitian/Creol so you can only tell them numbers and get full understanding, but essentially the sandwich down there tasted exactly the same.</p>
<p>So I started telling him that before I was 21 I had been to 19 different countries and made a point to eat a big mac in every country (some don't serve them so I tried) and oddly enough, like coke, a big mac in most countries is essentially the same as one ordered everywhere in the states.</p>
<p>It's the Budweiser thing, it is great because it's consistently the same.</p>
<p>We live in a wonderful country when our crap junk food products have no variation throughout the world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen the Big Mac measurement and I've always wondered: does it take into account local costs for its component units?</p>
<p>Beef is comparatively very cheap in the U.S. since we produce a lot of it. If expect a burger to be more expensive just about everywhere else, even if buying in dollars everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Big Mac Index used to determine purchasing power parity has a lot more flaws than just that. For example, how do you determine the price of a Big Mac for a country like India that does not serve beef in its McDonald's menus. With the differences in menus and factors such as demand for the Big Mac, it makes using the Big Mac Index pretty shaky. </p>
<p>It's important to note that the Big Mac Index is a decent estimation on whether a currency is undervalued or overvalued but should be sometimes taken with a grain of salt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Link to a cost adjusted index from <a href="http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index" target="_blank">the Economist</a></p>
<p>A couple of relevant quotes from the explanation: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>THE Big Mac index was invented by The Economist in 1986 as a lighthearted guide to whether currencies are at their “correct” level. </p>
<p>Burgernomics was never intended as a precise gauge of currency misalignment, merely a tool to make exchange-rate theory more digestible. </p>
<p>India's Maharaja Mac is made of chicken</p>

<p>What would salt be related in any way to economics?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Big Mac Index is just for estimates, we use much more complex models to discuss purchasing power and trade imbalances when we need to be precise. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we measure purchasing power, we try to put together a 'basket of goods' that give a broad measure of the things people need and buy. This can be hard when comparing two different countries with radically different kids of consumption. Fortunately for us, the Big Mac is the perfect basket of goods.</p>
<p>First, Big Macs are produced in a competitive free market where the  actual market value for the good will be charged. If Burger King can undercut McDonalds, they will. Because of that, we know that the Big Mac's price is reflective of the cost of the basket of goods needed to create it.</p>
<p>A Big Mac needs produce, baked goods, spices, meat, and grain to make, so to start with it's a perfect measure of the things people need to eat to live. It also needs rent in a central location where it is produced, electricity, gas, the things you need to keep yourself warm and under a roof. Finally, it needs access to chemical preservatives, banking loans to start production, and access to the cheapest available labor, making it a perfect sample basket of goods for any business as well. If a country is poorer, that basket of goods may be a luxury good for many people, but if you can buy all those things for half an hour of work, you aren't poor (in a global sense)</p>
<p>Because the Big Mac touches on all aspects of the economy, because it's in a highly competitive free market, and because it's an identical burger everywhere, it's a perfect basket of goods to determine purchasing power. Some countries will have some of those goods cheaper and others more expensive to reflect different market strengths, but if all of those things are more expensive in one place than another, that place is a terrible place to do business and is generally going to experience a decline in currency value, resulting in that burger costing the same in USD as it does elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two additional things need to be noted:</p>
<p>Currency valuation is often (in some small but significant part) a sign of overall world confidence in the stability of the country and its ability to maintain economic output. When a country becomes destabilized (or fears about the country's stability become wideheld or plausible to the right people), you tend to see marked devaluation as people start dumping their holdings. No one wants to get stuck with a currency that's about to go hyper-inflationary. This tends to find equilibrium eventually, but can be a rollercoaster in the short-term. </p>
<p>Second, currency manipulation is a monumental factor, both internally and externally. In simple terms, this can be accomplished internally by artificially suppressing the value of export goods to entice more of another country's currency and spur economic activity, and externally by hording and releasing mass amounts of another country's currency to play with its value according to basic principles of supply and demand. A second way to manipulate a country's currency externally is to undercut the price of one of its principle exports on the world market. This happened recently when (warning: oversimplification ahead) OPEC slashed prices on oil to cripple Russia's ruble.</p></div>		</li>
