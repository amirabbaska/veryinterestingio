			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for the great question. In the context of electric vehicles, there is a lot of synergy between all-electric battery vehicles and fuel cell vehicles. They both will use very similar power trains and subsystems, fuel cell vehicles will use batteries, and battery vehicles may use fuel cells as range extenders. Fuel cell vehicles have the advantage of filling in less than 10 minutes, often less than 6 minutes. While there are more charging stations for electric vehicles than hydrogen filling stations, forward thinking states such as California and states in the North East are supporting the development of both technologies. Finally, there is growing interest in fuel cells for medium and heavy duty vehicle use in applications. We believe that there is enough market space for both technologies and/or a combination. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are consumer hydrogen generators available today that go all the way up to 300 bar (i.e. direct or 1-step from going in a tank) but the economics it only makes sense off-grid or with microgrids, since a large, central electrolyzer has lower capital cost per unit volume and buying electricity at an industrial scale is cheaper. Also, with large entities out there wanting the energy economy to work quickly and much the same as it is today the focus is really on getting large infrastructure in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only laws placing limits on home hydrogen storage that I've ever heard of are in Japan; but in certain places there and in Korea there are large investigations of co-gen heat and electricity systems based on fuel cells, so there clearly is some significant hydrogen storage allowed in the home. Otherwise, it's a free world - for an energy storage medium compressed hydrogen is pretty safe and low-efficiency hydrogen generators have been off-the-shelf for over a century.</p></div>		</li>
