			<div class="markdown"><p>Human organs don't regenerate in any meaningful way. Even though individual cells will be replaced, we don't grow back large portions of an organ  (except the liver does do a good job of growing back).</p>
<p>They don't give you transplants where there is a section of donor organ attached to a host organ, they don't attach half a liver to your liver or half a lung to an existing lung. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely accurate, specifically with the liver: it's the one organ that, somehow, is able to regenerate fairly well. The regenerated tissue isn't quite as functional as the original (the vasculature gets all messed up), but half a liver will increase in mass to nearly that of a whole liver given enough time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One exception to this is bone donations. (Not bone marrow, but the hard white stuff.)  </p>
<p>In that case the bone is from cadavers. Living bone tissue grows around it and through it.  For many types of bone grafts the donor bone fragments get absorbed by the body and new bone grows in its place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of research being done using animal or human organs where they strip all of the cells, leaving only the cell matrix (and shape of the organ) behind. The matrix itself does not cause graft/host rejection. They can then use patients own cells/stem cells to coat the structure, and implant. It's really cool stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientist here from [Miromatrix Medical] (www.miromatrix.com) where we are working on fully biologic organs.  We use perfusion decellularization and perfusion recellularization to remove the cells of a donor pig organ such as a liver, kidney or heart and then seed the remaining organ scaffold/matrix with cells to make a functional organ.  The goal is to create fully functioning organs without the need for human donors.  Check us out!  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crazy! It seems some progenitor blood cells in the transplant found their way to her bone marrow and replaced her cells there. She would have been very sick. So she received a liver and bone marrow transplant, in effect.</p>
<p>Blood type change cab happen in BM transplants if you use BM of a different blood type (I think it is generally avoided). In a BM transplant special drugs are taken to kill the patients BM (usually there is something wrong with it like infiltrated with leukemia or aplastic anaemia) before the transplant. Not uncommonly the transplant doesn't 'take' easily. What happened to the lady in the link is very rare.</p>
<p>There have also been instances of mothers changing blood types as some of their baby's cells circulate in the blood (so really she'd be a mix).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can offer a little insight on this. My mother has undergone 2 kidney transplants in her lifetime; one from my aunt when my mother was 17 and the second came from my father when she was 40. She's now 47 and still has the kidney from my father but ever since the transplant has been on anti rejection meds. Neither kidney ever functioned as well as it should and the average is always around 25-30% function. The anti rejection medication she takes are indeed immunosuppressants and my mum has to be very careful about contracting any illnesses as even the most simple of colds effects are multiplied tenfold and she finds it very difficult to shift an illness once it sets in. Ironically my mother works full time in a pharmacy so is surrounded by sick people and quite often contracts their illnesses but she loves helping people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a full liver transplant 3 years ago, and am on a high dose of immunosuppressants. Oddly, I've not been any more sick than anyone else. I could count on being sick once a year on average before the transplant, and that still holds true now. However, the main difference is I'm sicker a little longer, and it seems harder to get rid of the bug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a variety of types of anti-rejection meds, all of which suppress the immune system. The initial doses are very heavy, and often multiple drugs are given at once. Then, over time, doses are gradually reduced to a lifelong maintenance dose. The patient has fairly frequent monitoring for rejection early after the transplant, which decreases in frequency as they stabilize. If there is any evidence of rejection, the doses may get ramped back up.</p></div>		</li>
