			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify for the OP, in the car example the relative speed of the two cars is slightly less than 200km/h when seen <em>from the perspective of the cars</em>. It is still true that someone standing on the side of the road would see the distance between the cars decrease at 200km/h.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an oversimplification when we say &quot;nothing moves faster than light.&quot; But saying &quot;when we observe the path of any particle against any inertial frame, we never measure it exceeding the speed of light&quot; is a bit long-winded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so is that why time slows down for the cars? Because they're covering the same distance but at a slower speed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's slows down because they <em>don't</em> cover the same distance in both reference frames. From the perspective of the cars the distance between them will be slightly shorter, but from the perspective of a roadside observer the clocks on board the cars go slower. Both ways of seeing it results in the drivers having aged slightly less than if they were stationary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks to compression of space at relativistic speeds, you 'can' travel 2M light years in about 20 years (I think I read that example for travelling to Andromeda galaxy once). For an outsider you would still take 20M years at the speed of light to reach your destination. Those numbers may or may not be partially accurate but the concept stands, that the faster you move, the shorter your distance and taken time becomes. </p>
<p>Being closer to high Gravitation sources (bent space) results in time passing slower.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Â Relative to the earth's age in billion of years, the earth's core is effectively 2.5 years younger than the surface   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>All you have to do is bend some space and become eternal for an external observer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main thing was Maxwell's equations. These equations describe electromagnetism, which includes light, because light is an electromagnetic wave.</p>
<p>But the weird thing about these equations is that they didn't appear to be universal. If you look at the equations of mechanics (e.g. throwing balls around from trains etc), then they don't change if you boost the entire system by some constant velocity. But if you boost the velocity of an electromagnetic system, suddenly the equations aren't consistent anymore. If you want to keep Maxwell's equations correct, you have to do some weird stuff with how you scale space and time when you change velocities (the &quot;Lorentz transforms&quot;), but this was assumed to just be a weird mathematical quirk.</p>
<p>The standard solution was that there was some background &quot;stationary&quot; reference frame, and in that frame Maxwell's equations would all be correct, while everybody else (at different velocities)
sees modified versions of the equation. However, the Michelson-Morley experiment showed that apparently Maxwell's equations don't seem to depend on your velocity at all, contradicting the theoretical prediction.</p>
<p>So Einstein puts that all together, and says that maybe Maxwell's equations really are true for everybody (which means that, for instance, the speed of light is the same for everybody). For this to be true, that mathematical quirk - the Lorentz transforms - that keeps the equations consistent at different velocities if you do weird things with space and time turn out to be <em>actual physics</em>, and these become the actual relationship between space and time between things moving at different velocities. These equations are the ones that give you time dilation and all that stuff: you have now created Special Relativity!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not gonna lie it's fuckin cool how you can create theoretical equations like maxwell's to describe one aspect of something you observe in real life, and through some weird mathematical quirks, you deduce new seemingly unrelated info about real life physics that you <em>hadn't observed yet</em>. Reminds me of that Monster thing in maths with the weird number that appears in two seemingly unrelated places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say, &quot;Anything! (As long as it has mass.)&quot; is a bit more accurate answer.  We don't want to suggest that &quot;the universe&quot; (aka &quot;everything&quot;) is a &quot;preferred reference frame&quot;.  Also, we don't want to suggest that light itself can be considered a valid reference frame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The (overly) simplified answer is that light doesn't experience time or space.  From  the perspective of light, there's exactly 0 seconds between emission and absorption, no matter how far light travels.  And without time or space, it's meaningless to talk about the relative speed of anything compared to a photon, including other photons.  </p>
<p>OTOH, physicists don't like this analogy because the concept of trying to create a reference frame for photons is basically the same as dividing by zero.  So it's more technically correct to say &quot;it's undefined&quot; and &quot;photons do not have a reference frame&quot;.  </p>
<p>OTOH-OTOH, you can talk about two particles zooming at each other, each going 99% the speed of light (0.99c) from your perspective.  From the perspective of either particle, YOU are traveling towards it at 0.99c and the other particle will be traveling <em>only slightly faster</em>, 0.99995c (99.995% speed of light). </p></div>		</li>
