			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen it a couple of times with some of the beauty bark in my yard. What I think is happening is the Spider uses it as the original anchor line and as the web fills out, it gets pulled off the ground slightly while still anchoring the web. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had one build its web between my car and the overhang of my balcony. Naturally when I went to work I tore it. Every day after that I would approach my car in the morning in time to see the spider detach the web from my car and pack it up. There is a light over my car so it is a good place to setup shop and that little scamp identified my car as a hazard, worked out when it needed to pack up. Smart little bugger; I had a lot of respect for it after seeing that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a human, sure, but do spiders possess mental capacity to comprehend the concept of gravity?</p>
<p>Edit: okay, guys, I get you, and you're probably right, but I've still been downvoted for asking a question, which is actually what this sub is for. What's wrong with you, reddit?</p></div>		</li>
