<p>It's varies from 50-99% of that.</p>

<p>Why not slower?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of electricity is also known as signal velocity, wave velocity, or group velocity. It's a little more than eli5 but it's basically the interaction of the electrons and the field fluctuations.</p>
<p>Don't think of it like a line of people that is moving (queue) but rather like a line of people that tells the person in front of him what the person behind him said.</p>
<p>Election velocity and drift ARE slower, but they're only a part of the picture. It's how fast they carry the information that we're talking about here. Normal wiring is 0.7-0.9c.</p></div>		</li>
