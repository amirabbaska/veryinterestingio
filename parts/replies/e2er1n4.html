<p>This is the big one.  People think you just hop in the machine and then either 'Cancer' or 'No Cancer' lights up on the screen.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Seriously.  Looking over a single part of the body can take a few days to get results back.  Doing a full body scan on every patient would take <em>forever</em> and miss a lot of shit unless your cancer is very well developed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd be curious if large scale scanning would help there, after doing it regularly for a few years when people start come up with obvious signs of cancer you'd be able to look at their historical scans and learn how the cancer looks as it grows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you have imaging, the radiologist reviews all pertinent previous imaging that they have access to. We do perform monitoring scans on certain people, but such a form of screening is only performed when strictly necessary, to avoid unnecessary radiation in the case of CT scans, a significant expense both in cost and time, undue stress to patients, and the risk of overtreating incidental findings which /u/nobeardpete detailed. Also, the huge volume of &quot;normal&quot; scans actually runs the risk of exhausting the reporting radiologist, which can lead to them missing things, due to fatigue, even the best radiologist can never be 100% perfect, they will miss things, particularly tiny little findings, which might be debated as to if it is normal, abnormal or artefact. </p>
<p>Most patients who end up having CT scans or MRI scans for screening reasons tend to have been treated for one form of cancer or another, or are very high risk due to genetic / history reasons (long term heavy smokers might get a CT chest, for example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s no reason the radiologist needs to even be in the same country to look at the resulting digital image immediately. It’s not like they’re using chemically developed plates that need to be physically present.</p>
<p>Cheap educated foreign (3rd world) labour could be used to cheaply flag any obvious issues allowing the radiologist to rest for the more obscure symptom related searches.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think radiologists currently have a pretty good idea of how it looks as it grows.  The problem is scale.  It's like having a Google Earth view of the USA, and trying to spot a deteriorating building that will eventually grow into a crumbling city.  Sure you can do it, but it's incredibly time consuming.</p>
<p>There are ~ 37 trillion cells in the human body. Even if you ignore the ones that rarely turn cancerous, and only look for groups of hundreds or thousands of cells, it is still an enormous task.   </p></div>		</li>
