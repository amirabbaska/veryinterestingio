<p>Finally ease of repairs due to normal maintainance and damages. If we have a fault and even if we know it is between two manholes that are 200 feet apart. Well how do we know exactly where and how do we fix it. </p>

<p>Does a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-domain_reflectometer" target="_blank">time-domain reflectometer</a> not work for this purpose?</p>
<p>Several comments seem to suggest other approaches are used, and I'm curious why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I am aware. Methods like this are more used for telecommunications lines such as cable and phone that are more likely to experience persistent faults (ie something that is wrong with the cable that can be located think of something like a nicked wire in contact with a conduit).</p>
<p>That combined with a power distribution system usually consisting of either single or three phases where each phase may be affected differently and occasionally experience intermittent faults. </p>
<p>Most of your detection systems using magnets and signals can only be used when the cable is de-energized or at least the ones I know of do. Which means turning off the whole feeder from the sub and effecting every single customer both residential and commercial on it, in order to keep them on you would have to do feeder switching which would require governmental notice and clearances from a control center to balance feeder loading as well as having overhead/urd resources in the area capable of holding that load and heat for however long it takes.</p></div>		</li>
