			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. If all you have is a pencil, you're not going to be writing millimeter-size letters. You have to invent a new writing implement first. Microprosessors are &quot;written&quot; with light, using a process called photolithography (literally &quot;light stone drawing&quot;). Now, normal visible light (~500nm) has been too crude a tool for decades already, and the process has been shifting to shorter and shorter UV wavelengths. We're getting close to the x-ray range and it gets harder and harder to control such high-energy ionizing radiation at the ever increasing accuracy and precision required.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>X-ray, or EUV is what they're going for right now. Problem is that to get a decent throughput you need a lot of EUV light, and you can't just buy EUV lightbulbs at the precision and power level needed. Long story short, it requires shooting balls of tin with lasers to create a plasma which emits EUV light, which is a big big <em>big</em> inconvenience all around. </p>
<p>Also, when you illuminate the wafers you need to do several steps of illumination, meaning that positioning the wafer back in the exact same position is critical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, even EUV (around 13.5nm wavelength) is not rolled out yet for high volume use.  14nm and 10nm technology nodes are, I believe, still made with 193nm light but using complex multi patterning techniques to increase resolution for sub-20nm features (also worth noting that 10nm technology does not be 10nm features but rather performance equivalent to planar technology with 10nm dimensions).  Some info can be found <a href="http://semiengineering.com/kc/knowledge_center/Multipatterning/196" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. The limits of printing with UV wavelengths are already at hand; printing with shorter wavelengths than that is either impossible, untenable, tomorrows news, or a dead end that will be obviated by a new method that uses a novel process. It's anyone's guess, so stay tuned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer.  On every industry, engineers and plant folks are doing the best they can to beat the competition.  It takes many many labour hours on the part of many people in multiple disciplines to get &quot;improved&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both concepts are present in the comment.</p>
<p>Quality assurance is making sure that the processes being used to generate output (in this case, a processor) are efficient and as error-free as possible. Quality control is checking the output (the manufactured processors) for defects. Problems found in QC may sometimes (but not always) lead to a change in QA protocol.</p>
<p>So, the commenter was right, but you identified a second concept that went unmentioned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes... and no. My use of &quot;QC&quot; was more in a <em>de facto</em> sense than <em>de jure.</em></p>
<p>First, have you tried explaining &quot;QC&quot; vs. &quot;QA&quot; to a layperson? Add to that acronym buffet SPC, Mil-spec, CAGE codes, ISO 9001:2008, AS9100.D, etc., and you've lost most people. The same people who never read the EULA before hitting the &quot;<em>ACCEPT</em>&quot; key.</p>
<p>Second, the number of end-users installing their own operating systems is a <em>shrinking</em> market segment. By the time a manufacturer has installed the chipset and loaded (or attempted to load) the OS and other attendant software, they will know if they have received one of the few defective chips that slipped through QA. Which, if they are ethical, they're going to reject back to the chipmaker for refund or credit.</p>
<p>By the time the device is in the end-user's hands, the screening process, depending on the degree of interaction the device manufacturer has with the chipset, hovers in-between QA and QC. </p></div>		</li>
