			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the same exactly, but when making wooden barrels they aren't water tight until the wood soaks up water and the planks swell up and it becomes water tight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually why barrels are stored on their sides when filled with liquids - a barrel on it's side will cause even distribution of the liquid across the entire stave, which means the barrel swells correctly and stays watertight. When you stand it &quot;up&quot; and the barrel is not completely full, you have swelling in only the portion of the stave that is in the liquid, which  causes gaps in the staves and can lead to them splitting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the exact opposite - it’s to keep them impregnated with salt. Besides keeping the wood moist, and thus swelled up and the joints watertight, it’s important to keep the decks coated in salt water. The key reason is that the fungi that cause wood to rot, cannot grow in the presence of salt water or dried salt crystals. So even after a big rainstorm where the decks get coated in fresh water, sailors will still “swab the decks” with sea water to replace the salt that would have gotten washed away. </p>
<p>On the modernised tall ship that I crew on, we do a deck wash every morning with salt water - but we cheat a little bit by using our high pressure fire hose. It’s a lot faster than the bucket method. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s also important to keep the wood coated in salt water (which turns into dried salt crystals).  This prevents the growth of fungi (rot) and is the key reason wooden ships don’t rot.  (Rot is a problem however for freshwater ships in places like the Great Lakes.)</p></div>		</li>
