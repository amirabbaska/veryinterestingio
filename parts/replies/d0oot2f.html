			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no real upper limit on the wavelength of a photon. The longest wavelengths we can reasonably detect are so called &quot;extremely low frequency&quot; waves, they are used in some military communication and atmospheric science. In general, the longer a wavelength is, the larger a detector has to be in order to detect it. This sets a limit on how easy it is for us to see these things. Theoretically, as far as I understand, light can have an infinite wavelength. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Light can tend towards an infinite wavelength, but it can't actually &quot;have&quot; it. As wavelength tends to infinity, so frequency tends towards zero. At zero frequency, it has zero energy - it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>In fact, this is what happens to light at the event horizon of a black hole. From the perspective of an outside observer, it's infinitely redshifted, which is equivalent to saying it cannot escape the event horizon.</p></div>		</li>
