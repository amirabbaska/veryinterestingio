			<p>They have to get the ads from somewhere.  Most sites get their ads from other sites that specialize in making ads work (like AdSense, by Google), because it's a lot less work.  Getting ads from somewhere else is one of the things AdBlock blocks.  So if they tried, the ad probably wouldn't make it to your computer.</p>		</li>

			<p>The very reason they know you have AdBlock is because you are blocking one of their dummy links that serve no other function than to detect if you're blocking the ads.<br><br>So, just as you blocked the original adds, if they would try to put in ads in that popup you would block them as well.</p>		</li>
