			<div class="markdown"><p>To do it the other way round, the thickness of a dollar coin is about 2 mm, which is around 5000000 copper atoms thick. This means that we can cover an area 5 million times the area of the coin (in theory, you could do this by slicing the coin into 5 million atom-thick sheets). This gives a total possible area of 2755 m^(2). <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282mm+%2F+0.4+nm%29*pi*%2813.245+mm%29%5E2" target="_blank">According to WolframAlpha, this is around half the size of an American football field</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very cool. But because I am dumb, I am confused. chrisbaird said the atoms arranged in a square lattice would be 200,000x too far to form stable chemical bonds. So does that mean if you had 200,000x more atoms (or 200,000x more dollar coins) it would be enough? How does it become 185 billion dollar coins?? Is some squaring involved or something?</p>
<p>I am dumb btw, not sure if I mentioned that before.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For some reason, I find this statistic very surprising.  Normally when dealing with atoms, we are used to working with numbers on the order of Avogadro's number.  Talking about millions of atoms at the macroscopic level seems a little surreal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My gut feeling was &quot;it can't be right!&quot;. But it all checks out. A difference between an angstrom and a mm is only 7 orders of magnitude, and once you switch to area it gives you a linear increase of only 3 orders of magnitude. A pathetic stadium from a whole coin worth of atoms!</p>
<p>It's funny how we are so smart and can think about atoms and copper lattice, yet our basic intuitions of volume and scaling are so flawed!</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am a physicist and I would never approach this problem the way /u/chrisbaird. Not that there's anything wrong with it, just that it's a substantially more complex process to arrive at the same conclusion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gold is the most ductile element. <a href="http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/JeniferVilfranc.shtml" target="_blank">Here</a> is the best source I can find as to the thinness that gold leaf can get to without resorting to some sort of expensive lithography. Averaging those together, and you can consider gold leaf to be about 100nm thick. That's still ~440 atoms thick. You would need a relatively modest <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=100+nanometers+*+area+of+Earth" target="_blank">0.051 km^3</a> of gold.</p>
<p>Of course, that's still 51,000,000 cubic meters! That's $37 quadrillion worth of gold! Impressed yet?</p>
<p>Well, that's 1/10 the gold estimated to be dissolved in the oceans.</p></div>		</li>
