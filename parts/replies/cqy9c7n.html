You <em>have</em> to trust the sovereignty of another country. It's a founding principle of the UN, and is necessary for positive globalization. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with universal jurisdiction is that a court requires some form of power to enforce any rulings. Law must have teeth. A law that has no teeth is a law that cannot be enforced.</p>
<p>In the case of war crimes, the country that wins the war is immune. Only the losing country has its leaders (military and civilian) charged with war crimes, usually by the country that bested it.</p>
<p>Without the force to impose one's will it will simply be ignored. You can see this with the UN. The UN can pass any sort of resolution it wants, but unless it gets the big countries on board its resolutions will be ignored. The resolution isn't worth the paper its printed on without military or economic power to enforce this resolution.</p>
<p>Might does make right. The country with the most might is the county able to decide what is right. There's no authority above nations. Its only nations. And in the case of nations, the biggest, toughest, strongest nations are the ones who not only write the rules but also enforce the rules on everyone else.</p>
<p>Its kind of like the bully on the playground. If the bigger kid demands your lunch money and there's no bigger authority around (like an adult) there isn't much you can do. You can fight but you'll lose. The bigger party gets to impose their will on the smaller party.</p>
<p>The only way for the smaller to win is to band together, in which case they become the biggest kid on the playground. In the end, its still the biggest kid on the playground who writes and enforces the rules.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This doesn't sound right. Any kind of source or example? I'm pretty sure soldiers committing war crimes would still end up being punished, even if their country wins.</p></div>		</li>

Well, except I gather the ICC is currently deliberating bringing proceedings in relation to the CIA torture.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>R2P, responsibility to protect, is a principle that has slowly become the standard behaviour in these situations since the Rwandan genocide and the massacres in former Yugoslavia. It states that the sovereignty of a nation-state can be discarded if it fails to protect the basic human rights of its citizens. For example the African Union has a mechanism, based on this principle, that allows the other states to rapidly dissolve failing oppressive regimes. R2P was also the justification for the intervention in Libya, and it was used to attempt intervention in Syria.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens if that country doesn't follow jus ad bellum? Like, if I am belgum and I want to attack the UK, what stops me from just doing so? Couldn't I also ignore the fact that the UK would be like &quot;You aren't allowed to do that. We are suing you.&quot; How do declarations of war work in this way? Wouldn't it be impossible to declare war unless  breaks the rules and attacks first?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This comes down to a more general question, of 'why do we follow the law?' I mean, I can ask the same of you. Why do you not steal a fancy new 60&quot; Plasma TV? You might have some moral concerns (stealing is bad), some legal concerns (the law says that stealing isn't allowed and I don't want to get in trouble), and some concerns about your reputation (if I get caught, what will people think of me?). If you've thought about it long and hard you might also come up with other reasons (e.g. if everyone breaks the law, and we erode its authority, what will stop people from breaking into my house and stealing my stuff in a few months?). Law is not magic, it cannot stop you from physically taking the TV. Nor can it stop a country from declaring war, if it is set on that course. But the existence of the law deters violation, and when there is a violation, there are consequences.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reputation</em></strong>: I think that countries don't want to be seen as violators of international law. One of the reasons you don't steal the TV is because, if you are caught, you will be labelled a thief, with all the negative social consequences of that. People care about their reputation and their self-image, and so do countries. Look at the immense damage that has been done to the standing of the United States in its international relations since the War on Terror began. Being a country that has disregarded or violated international law in very serious ways over the past decade has done real damage to its reputation and soft power abroad. There is a reason Obama set repairing America's image as a foreign policy priority when he was elected.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reciprocity</em></strong>: All law, and international law especially, is based on reciprocity. If Belgium attacks the UK today, and sets a precedent that this is OK, what will stop Germany from attacking Belgium tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong><em>Enforcement/sanction:</em></strong> International law is very far from perfect, and one of the areas in which it struggles is enforcement. Assuming you live in a developed country, typically your parliament will legislate laws, your courts will adjudicate disputes and declare violations, and your police force or other appropriate agencies will put the court's orders into effect (e.g. placing a criminal in prison, or siezing a person's assets if they refuse to pay a debt). In international law, the last step is difficult. You have law, you have courts, but you don't have an international police equivalent. It is up to states to enforce serious violations, for example by imposing sanctions. To bring this back to the specifics of your question, if Belgium decided to attack the UK, many European (and non-European) countries would likely protest that this is a violation of international law, and seek to bring Belgium into compliance with the law through various sanctions. Perhaps you might even have the EU or NATO respond militarily in collective self-defence. Also, although this is not currently possible, before too long the leaders of Belgium who ordered the war might be charged with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_of_aggression" target="_blank">Crime of Aggression</a> at the International Criminal Court, since Belgium has signed up to the court. In other words, though you can't put a country in prison as you do with an individual, negative consequences often follow for violators of the law.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> The reason international law isn't simply ignored is because doing so damages your reputation, risks undermining the law and making you vulnerable to the same kind of violation, and violations will often be punished by other states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the detailed answer! I'm actually interested in pursuing a career in international law and I was wondering (if you don't mind answering) what your thoughts are on it. What sort of work do you do? (Work for the government? An NGO?) and where did/would you recommend going to grad school? People always tell me law school is a mistake these days simply because of how the job market is for lawyers, but I've always wondered specifically how the market is for international lawyers. Any time I try to look into it I just see a bunch of firms working in international corporate/trade law, but I'm really interested in international relations or criminal law, including the topic of OP's post. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p></div>		</li>
