			<div class="markdown"><p>When talking to girls or anyone else who you want something from, are you a cavalier lier? Do you just say whatever you think will get you what you want at the time or do you have some loyalty to the truth? Also, whenever you lie (I realize this might seem like I'm presupposing an answer to my last question for you but its not. I lie. All of us lie.) do you feel anxiety about getting caught or do you just say what seems best at the time and see what happens?</p></div>		</li>
