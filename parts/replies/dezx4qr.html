			<div class="markdown"><p>How do we determine how fast black hole is spinning? We approximate their location by affecting objects around them thats a fact by how does the spinning off a black hole affects its surroundings or is there any other way to knowr the rotation speed of one?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/NSNick reported of one result for quasars <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5zorv7/psr_j17482446ad_is_the_fastest_know_pulsar_at_716/df0f9yh/" target="_blank">here</a>. Additionally, in its gravitational wave detections, LIGO was able to measure the spin of the merging black hole systems before (each individually) and after (the merged object). That's because even though there was nothing around the objects as far as we can tell, the differences in spin change the observed gravitational wave waveform.</p></div>		</li>
