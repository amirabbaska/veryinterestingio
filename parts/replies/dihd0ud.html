			<div class="markdown"><p>As a millennial who did nothing but save with his wife through their 20's and bought a house at 30, I'm near furious about this situation. Its only been in recent years that I've seen how fucked this generation is if we ever want to have the things our parents did.</p>
<p>Here my wife and I are, being frugal as fuck for the 10 years we should have been really enjoying life, because we figured this is the only way we can ever get a house. Now we realise the game was stacked against us, all of us, and we should have just said fuck it - let it all fall and then we'll buy.</p>
<p>Now the unyielding labour and savings of our 20's (and opportunities we didn't take because we thought we had to save) are at risk.</p>
<p>Awesome. I'm really hopeful for the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On one level, as I rapidly approach age 30 this August, I feel pretty guilty about more or less pissing away my 20's. Dropped out of college, spent a lot of time drinking and fucking, took trips with the GF, just worked a halfway decent job that thankfully isn't going to negatively effect my health. Shit, I could technically retire from this job in another 15 years.  </p>
<p>But then I look at what I got and... well, it's not much. Nothing to really show for a decade of my life. I didn't do any of the shit I was &quot;supposed&quot; to do. And it honestly doesn't feel very hopeful either. Just coming from the other side of things... you didn't miss out on much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha my mom was telling me how rough she had it she was only making 20 dollars an hour and her mortgage, Taxes and insurance came to 900 dollars and they bought the house at 100 grand back in the early 1990s. I'm paying 1650 rent for a shitty rental that is still original for 1983; in my sons room frost builds up on the wall in the winter just to paint a picture. I kept my mouth shut for the longest time when she said how tough she had it, not anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the international audience, to put Australia's bubble into perspective;  </p>
<ul>
<li>Average home in Sydney (5 million ppl) is TRIPLE average home in Tokyo (20+ million) and 2.5x average home in New York (20+ million), and only 35% more than the average home in London (20 million).  </li>
<li>Regional cities in Australia often have average home prices 10x average incomes, with extremely low population density, and surrounded by vacant land for development.  </li>
<li>Many non-coastal small towns with very high unemployment have average home prices far in excess of $400k.  The country has gone real estate mad, so younger people in large cities will rent, and invest savings buying homes in regional towns to rent out.  This drove prices up through no fault of locals.  </li>
<li>Average mortgage rate is 5.1% in Australia today.  You won't find a single property in Sydney where gross rents are over 5.1% of purchase price, even in the worst crime ridden areas.  </li>
<li>Australian mortgages are all fixed for maximum of 5 years, and then variable, so when rates go up existing homeowners are directly impacted. </li>
<li>Slum areas on the outskirts of major Australian cities have average home prices well in excess of $500k.  </li>
<li>Average income in Australia is $80k AUD / $60k USD.  Average household income is $101k AUD.  </li>
<li>Average home in Sydney $1.2 - $1.3 million.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer, my interpretation of the housing market is based on US observations, may not apply to other countries. I don't think &quot;boomers&quot; and their policies are the major contributing force to the astronomical housing costs. There are multiple factors that result in the inflated real estate prices, and it has more to do with demographics and demand. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There's the fact that the population of the US has more than doubled since the 40s. This rapid population increase is directly linked to demand, more people need houses. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People are moving to cities. In the 1940s, 56.5% of Americans lived in urban areas, while in the 2010s 80.7% of Americans live in urban areas. This percentage is only increasing as each decade passes. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The workforce has increased past the population gain of the US. How does this make any sense? Well, since the early 1900s, the percentage of women in the workforce has been rapidly increasing. More and more women work. In the 1940s, it was commonplace for women to stay home and tend to the household. While there are still significant portions of the female population that do not work, the majority of women work just as much as men do. In the 1940s, it was social expectation that women stay home, but in 2017 it is expected that even married women go out to work. So not only has the population doubled, the majority of women now work, therefore the workforce has increased dramatically. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wages have stagnated, this is actually linked to the aforementioned point. The economy sees income as a household sum, we witness this meta on a daily basis. When applying for a credit card, you list household income, when applying for a student loan, you list household income, when kids request subsidized lunch, the form asks for household income. No longer is the man of the house the sole income provider. Society is centered around the household model, and because women are expected to work, there are two income streams per household now. It is extremely difficult for a single (average) income household to get by, but a double income household at average wages is more than sufficient. The wages paid have been adjusted for this phenomenon, if you look at the Census Bureau data, middle quintile household income has actually increased significantly since the 40s and even almost 30% over the 60s. This isn't because singular people have higher wages, but because of the prevalence of double income households. Because the economy is centered around households, and because households are now double income, the singular income has suffered. It used to be that a middle class man can buy a nice family home, and provide for his wife and two kids easily. Now, that same middle class man will struggle tremendously to do the same thing alone, but can easily do so with his wife working too. But what if you're single? Well, that means you're fucked. If you were a single middle class worker in the 60s, you were rolling in money. Now the roles have reversed, married dual income households have higher wealth than single person households. The housing market reacted to this phenomenon with rising real estate prices due to dual income households, if they can afford more, charge more. The demand is strong enough that they can do this. </p>
</li>
<li>Many cities have reached their maximum residential outward development. NYC has developed pretty much every inch of land that can possibly commute to Manhattan within the 2-3 hour distance. This means there is no possible way to create new housing, while demand is stronger than ever. This is the same in LA and SF, I assume most major cities have reached this point already. In fact, NYC has even developed unusable land. There are parts of the waterfront Flushing/College Point area that is difficult to build on due to high fluctuations in soil moisture. This means that if you pave a road, it will be fucked up the following year because the water in the soil under it will swell and depress until the pavement cracks and either depresses significantly or bulges. Yet, the real estate market is hungry so they developed it anyway, repaving the roads over and over again. </li>
</ol>
<p>Combine all these factors and it's clear why real estate pricing has risen so fast. It's really only the urban real estate that has become unaffordable, you can easily move out to a small town and find a house for sub $100,000. Sure you might make 20-30% less income but your cost of living actually decreases to the point in which that lower income is worth it. I understand many people have specialized skills that are only applicable in cities, but for the majority of people, mid-sized town life is an option. Even lower density large cities like Houston have very affordable houses. Yet, a higher percentage of people move to high density cities per year and the population has increased dramatically. Also, these attractive cities are beyond their residential development capacity. There is no more new land available within reasonable commute times. So everyone in the city is competing for housing in limited supply. EVERYONE wants a single family home with a two car garage and a backyard, but when millions of people want something in limited supply, the price is only as as what someone is willing to pay, and there will always be another dude out of the millions of people that makes more money than you, looking to buy the same house as you. </p>
<p>How can we fix this? No amount of policy changing will fix this, you can't magically wave a wand and <em>poof</em> make some development ready land. There are still some major cities with affordable real estate. I'm especially talking about cities that haven't reached their maximum development phase. Even big cities like Houston have really nice big homes for sub 350k prices, sub 250k for more modest homes. That's completely affordable for a dual income household. A small 150k apartment is affordable for a single person. Cleveland has really low housing cost as well. Tulsa, Charlotte, Oklahoma City, Columbus, Harrisburg, St. Louis, Kansas City, Wichita, Little Rock, Cincinnati, Louisville, Salt Lake City, Baton Rouge, Syracuse, Buffalo, the list goes on and on. All these cities have affordable real estate that even a middle class single income household can easily afford, yet people insist on moving to and staying in NYC, LA, SF, Chicago, Miami, DC, San Jose, Boston, Cambridge, etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, the issue is, everyone would love to find the one smoking gun that everything could be blamed on. </p>
<p>One big easy to define problem can be fought and overcome, or at the very least it is easy to point fingers and assign blame. </p>
<p>It's a lot harder to deal with the idea that the issue has many many different facets and parts to it. Economics is stupidly complicated, and people often try and boil it down to one specific thing that everything can be pinned on. </p></div>		</li>
