<p>However napping for 20 mins (not 10) is meant to be beneficial as you get the rest from the first stage of sleep but as you are unlikely to be as relaxed as when youre woken from sleep you're less likely to enter the next stage of sleep which is likely why you feel less tired post nap then you do post snooze.</p>

<p>Statement.  Wondering why it's true?  Here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>as you get the rest from the first stage of sleep but you are unlikely to be as relaxed as when youre woken from sleep</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Word removed because it was a typo.]  That's why.  Also:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you're less likely to enter the next stage of sleep (which is likely why you feel less tired post-nap then you do post-snooze).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[Mildly edited for readability].</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand the best sleep comes during REM cycles, which I also understand to be the time dreams occur.</p>
<p>My question: I tend to fall back into a dream even during small, post-snooze sleep of a morning. Is this not just as beneficial?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes from vague memories that mostly sounds right.</p>
<p>Another viewpoint is that throughout the day you build up metabolic toxins in your brain which are processed when you sleep. After a full night of sleep, 10-20 minutes of rest will not make as much of a difference as most of the work is done but after half a day of activity 10-20 minutes can help a lot to clean up.</p>
<p>I'd need to look for sources if this is still an acurrate understand or has been refuted, but I don't have the time at this moment right now.</p></div>		</li>
