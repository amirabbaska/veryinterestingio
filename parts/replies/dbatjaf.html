			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying that as long as we define &quot;touching&quot; as &quot;interacting&quot;, we're good.   </p>
<p>My fingers touch when the atoms that comprise them intact, preventing the macro &quot;fingers&quot; from moving through one another.   </p>
<p>Yeah, I'm fine with that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this answer. pop science loves to cite the whole &quot;not touching&quot; thing, because what we think of as solids never touch, but when you get down to that level its not a bunch of marbles, its a bunch of forces and yes those forces &quot;touch&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well technically those forces are still acting even when your fingers are a foot apart. Just dramatically more weakly. If you use &quot;force interaction&quot; as your definition you really end up with a continual gradient fit touching and not a distinct thing you can say &quot;okay now they're touching&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the nuclei touch and form into one nucleus they will undergo fusion and release huge amounts of energy. It's the same process used to power a hydrogen bomb or a sun. </p>
<p>It doesn't usually happen because the protons repel eachother due to the positive charge they have. The only way too push them together is with huge amounts of energy. In the sun, all of the surrounding matter crushes down on the core and pushes the nuclei together. On earth we just set up a mini atomic bomb around the hydrogen core and explode it inwards. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The nucleus contains protons which have a positive charge. Just like magnets, two nuclei vehemently repel each other. If you could apply such tremendous force between your fingertips, that the two nuclei touch each other, you would be dangerously close to creating a little black hole. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't ever really touch but we get close enough that the interaction of the atoms cause them to &quot;push&quot; back from each other almost as if they were 2 gigantic super powered magnets with both north poles being pushed together. In other words you're not going to get them together</p>
<p>VSauce did a video on this a few years ago. </p>
