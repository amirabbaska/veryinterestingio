			<div class="markdown"><p>The burnable bits will catch fire and burn, some metallic parts and the glass may partial melt, or simply get crushed under the weight of the lava flow like a car crushed. The lava has a lot of weight in it.</p>
<p>Think about what happens when you burn an aluminium or tin can, it turns to powder typically. Metals of different types and thicknesses behave differently. Thicker Steel usually becomes soft unless heated very high.</p>
<p>The gas tank will burst eventually and likely result in a small fireball, but the fuel eruption would be directed out to the path of least resistance. It depends how surrounded the gas tank, but it is doubtful it would have much of an impact on the lava flow.</p>
<p>If it becomes completely covered, then it will be a squashed piece of metal, with residues of the burnt &amp; melted parts.</p>
<p>University lecturers in the far off future will take students there to confuse them about the band of rust and strange volcanic glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless these future archaeologists are so distantly removed from the present (like millions of years and after a large scale extinction event) so that they have no cultural memory/aren't even technically homo sapiens anymore (or possibly even the descendants of a different surviving species altogether) then they're probably going to know/be able to figure out that it was a car.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was implying student geologists, I should have been more clear. Our professors used to throw in all sorts of joke environments, but with the aim of making us follow a scientific process to establish what we thought had occurred; to describe it and so forth.</p>
<p>I also think you are massively over estimating the time frame involved for thin metal, such as in a mangled, flattened, vehicle frame and &quot;cooked&quot; to break down into a red-yellow oxidized stain on any exposed surface in a tropical environment - have you never seen rust on a car? Even large steel objects/ structures without some form of protection (usually paint) from corrosion breaks down quick.</p>
<p>Do you really think that a historical record is going to be kept that a car was consumed by lava at a certain point and that a bunch of students in the future would even know about it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The hydrocarbons and other organic compounds will dissociate and if they come into contact with oxygen they'll burn. The aluminum frame and any other low melting point metals in the car will melt while some others (steels) will remain mostly solid. Flowing lava is typically over 700C and aluminum melts at 660ish while some steels can remain solid as high as 1500C.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of high end cars have aluminum frames and bodies with steel reinforcement to keep weight down and improve fuel economy or performance characteristics.</p>
<p>Some cheaper cars use aluminum more sparingly but it's a common material to find in automotive manufacture.</p></div>		</li>
