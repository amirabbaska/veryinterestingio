			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair it’s not always taught. I’ve always been terrified of bugs in general because as a toddler my mother locked me in a closet for days on end to be bitten by roaches and other insects. I have a real reason to be afraid of bugs in general. But I also recognize the importance of each insect. Spiders eat flies. I like that but hate spiders, plus watching a female black widow devour the male in person doesn’t help either. I’ve never been more intrigued and disgusted in my life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You learned to be terrified of bugs by an event in your life.  If you had not been locked in a closet with bugs in there, you might not have been scared of them later in life.  I'm not sure at what point a kid might have said &quot;fuck these bugs, I'm gonna just eat them&quot;.. but who knows.  Either way your reason to be afraid of insects is because of a life event.  If you were a puppy locked in a closet with insects you wouldn't be afraid of them, you would have eaten them.  </p>
<p>On the other hand some animals learn to be afraid of wasps and bees, after being stung.  I have observed my donkey when grazing in the dandelions as she will have her head down and see a bee and will move very carefully.. they don't react in panic like some kids do but they still learn from events that happen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That sounds a lot like &quot;you were taught&quot; - you were just taught by direct unpleasant exposure rather than by modeling.</p>
<p>Which, uh, sucks real bad, sorry to hear that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Meth head mother, enjoyed partying more than taking care of things. She’s done worse. Luckily I can’t remember any of this. Most of what I know about my mom has been from others saving me from the mess I was living in. 2 other times she was too high to do anything one being me almost drowning in the pool, luckily my brother was there to save me. And another time when I somehow got a glass beer bottle or something tripped and it cut my hand wide open. She was just gunna let me bleed out, luckily my dad showed up he just got done with work and he rushed me to the hospital. Somehow they never threw this bitch in jail and somehow she had more kids who have been taken from her and then somehow made more babies. I’m sorry for all of them and I hope she doesn’t have them anymore. She’s nothing but cancer to this world, but sadly the courts favor woman and my dad was the one who was getting in trouble over false claims. I’m sure karma will come back one day though. At least I hope it does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm the youngest of a big family. my youngest sibling is five years older than I. my mother decided when i was still fairly young, that now all her children were old enough to not need her brave example, she could stop pretending to not be afraid of spiders. because of this I learned to be afraid while my older siblings did not.</p>
<p>that said my second eldest brother had a phobia of ants. but that was because the eldest told him for years that the wooden posts of their bunk bead were filled with ants.</p></div>		</li>
