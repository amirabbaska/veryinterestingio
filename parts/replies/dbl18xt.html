			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is pretty much why parachutes are deployed to slow people down. A parachute has a high surface area (so more air resistance) and you don't gain any mass when it is deployed (so gravitational attraction to the Earth doesn't increase). Therefore the upward forces increase more than the downward forces when the parachute is deployed, and the terminal velocity of the diver is reduced dramatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could also have a linear drag force, where the force is proportional to the velocity of the object, whereas in a quadratic drag force it's proportional to the velocity squared. In general you can often write a drag force as a combination of linear and quadratic terms.</p>
<p>For a large object like a person, the drag force will be mainly quadratic. For something like an oil droplet moving in a viscous medium, a purely linear drag force would be more appropriate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add on to this: how your total drag breaks down between linear and quadratic terms depends on something called the Reynolds number.  Informally speaking, drag is dominated by the linear term when:</p>
<ul>
<li>The object moving is smaller</li>
<li>The object is moving slower</li>
<li>The fluid you are moving through is more viscous (oil, honey, etc...)</li>
</ul>
<p>The quadratic term dominates for larger/faster objects moving through less viscous fluids (most gasses, such as air). Things like airplanes or humans skydiving are solidly in this region.</p>
<p>There are also other fun and less common sources of drag, like wave drag: bad things happen with aerodynamics when you generate shockwaves, but luckily is only relevant from Mach ~0.8 to ~1.5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quadratic drag forces apply to systems with high Reynolds' numbers (that is, in turbulent flow), which increase with velocity and characteristic length (there's some formula for calculating it for a non-circular object but I don't remember).  A falling human is fast and large so quadratic drag applies.</p>
<p>For a slow-moving and/or small object/fluid (laminar flow), drag is linearly proportional to velocity.</p>
<p>There's no strict cut-off so both linear and quadratic drag are approximations.</p></div>		</li>

<p>no. if it did parachutes wouldn't work.  you'd open the parachute and not slow down.  </p>
<p>everything falls at the same rate when you get rid of air resistance.  the leaning tower of pisa experiments used two objects of differing mass but both were dense enough to render air resistance negligible.  terminal velocity has everything to do with air resistance.  in a vacuum there is no terminal velocity,  (other than the speed of light)  any object will continually accelerate all the way down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i'm confused. parachutes work because of air resistance. i get that. and you said weight differences don't matter if the shape is reasonably similar (e.g. two different balls of around the same size/shape being dropped from the tower of pisa). so if that's the case, why does adding a lead belt to a skydiver make a difference? the size and shape of your body isn't meaningfully different? have i become lost in the line of reasoning? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most comments here are just saying &quot;there's drag so they don't&quot; which isn't incorrect, but I feel it's an incomplete answer. </p>
<p>OP asked about terminal velocity, the point at which a falling object no longer accelerates. This is dependent on mass as well as drag. With the leaning tower experiment, the dropped objects didn't have enough time to reach terminal velocity and were accelerating through the entire fall, so they hit the ground at the same time. Had the experiment been done from a great enough height that the objects reached terminal velocity before impact, they would not have landed simultaneously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you, this is about the terminal velocity. They accelerate at the same rate but have different terminal velocities. (when the deceleration caused by drag is equal to the acceleration caused by gravity.) The length of the drop matters.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This implies that terminal velocity is a binary thing - you accelerate at constant acceleration until you reach terminal velocity, and then you stop. That's not the case. The object with the lower terminal velocity will fall more slowly than the object with higher terminal velocity starting as soon as you release them.</p>
<p>It would be more accurate to say that the dropped objects didn't have enough time to reach a velocity that is a significant relative to their terminal velocities, so they hit the ground at approximately the same time, but &quot;significant&quot; and &quot;approximately&quot; are dependent on each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Higher drag doesn't only imply lower terminal velocity, but also lower acceleration, so there would be a difference even before reaching terminal velocity. The differences are just too small to be measurable back in Galileos time.</p></div>		</li>
