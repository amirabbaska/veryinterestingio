<p>The hypothesis is that in unequal societies, women <em>need</em> to pursue demanding, technical or high-status fields in order to get any kind of financial and social independence. </p>
<p>In more equal societies, women have the luxury of choosing fields they are actually interested in, and that these tend to be more traditionally female-dominated fields (education, nursing etc.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you expand on this? The majority of answers in this thread claim that women are discouraged from entering STEM in education (despite most teachers being female) yet when this paradox claims when women have freedom of choice they choose non STEM orientated professions. This is a very interesting study</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does this somehow mean they aren't being discouraged?</p>
<p>That discouragement could take many forms that aren't particularly sexist, including a female science teacher saying &quot;Oh, I planned to go into research but didn't because I wanted to have children&quot; implying that you can't have children and go into professional science. Or maybe they talked about how when they were in college, the grad school seemed like a boys club, and that discouraged young women from going into science because it formed preconceived notions. It could be a male science teacher talking about how there weren't a lot of women in his program. It could be a female social studies teacher that a young woman looks up to who makes an offhand comment 'Bleh, physics!' when she sees the student studying for her physics test. Discouragement can take many forms, it it doesn't have to be conscious.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Social effects can be complicated, though.</p>
<p>Personally, it strikes me as akin to having controlling parents, where a child might be more inclined to rebel against them to get some control back. Without controlling parents, there's less desire to rebel in a sense.</p>
<p>As for the last paragraph, interests are shaped by society, aren't they? Especially if you discard other interests (or never pursue them) that you feel aren't a good fit. Which can certainly include some negative reasons, such as if you were raised to think that you weren't good at math or if you think a certain industry might be sexist. You can certainly be pushed towards interests. To be clear, this can also happen for many other reasons, too. Eg, it seems common that east asian families push their kids more towards higher education. And lots of kids take interest in what their parents do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about forces pushing against them to not enter those fields? Are they greater than the forces in the western world but are simply overcome by the determination for independence?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much for doing what you do as a high school science teacher! I would get started by showing your female students this: <a href="https://500womenscientists.org/updates/2017/3/26/meet-a-young-scientist" target="_blank">https://500womenscientists.org/updates/2017/3/26/meet-a-young-scientist</a>
Just give examples of successful female scientists, show that it is possible!  Overall, just encourage your students to be passionate about science and follow their dreams!  Mentor the super sciencey ones and help them get in contact with local labs to start exploring different scientific fields.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for realizing that the wrong approach can be condescending. Not many people realize that and can come off that way. I'm not a part of this organization but I'm a woman working in engineering. My advice to you would be to stay enthusiastic! Become a mentor in some sort of STEM club, share interesting news in science with students. If you're worried about being patronizing, then ask questions to gauge a student's level of interest or confidence in the material before trying to explain something.</p>
<p>I tried to keep the answers broad, but if you have a specific question or scenario in mind, feel free to send me a message.</p></div>		</li>
