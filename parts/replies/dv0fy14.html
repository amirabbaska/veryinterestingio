			<div class="markdown"><p>Alton Brown explained it in one of his Good Eats episodes (I'll see if I can find a video of it in a bit). Essentially, if the oil is hot enough, it boils the liquid on the food's surface which forms the bubbles you see. The bubbles of super hot air will &quot;air fry&quot; the surface to crisp. Meanwhile, the gas escaping outward prevents the oil from penetrating the food.</p>
<p>Without the bubbles, the oil would penetrate your fried chicken and make it soggy. It's the high heat (and the fact that oil and water don't combine) that causes the hot air bubbles, the bubbles that crisp your food and keep it from going soggy.</p>
<p>I found the name of the episode: &quot;Fry Hard.&quot; <em>Nice.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, the most interesting part of that episode was his demonstrating that two pounds of fried cod absorbed about a teaspoon of cooking oil - or about 4g/40cal of fat. I love tofu and my favorite way of cooking it is to coat it in corn starch and deep fry it, and it's kind of an uphill battle trying to explain to people that it doesn't turn into some kind of pure fat bomb as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other replies, as long as you don't fry something at too low a temp or for too long the food is constantly expelling steam in all directions outward which doesn't let too much oil intrude inward into the food.</p>
<p>If you've ever gotten a dark brown french fry that hung around in the fryer for a few rounds, it was probably hella oily because it had lost all its water, had no outward movement of steam and oil was allowed to soak in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this </p>
<ul>
<li>oil = non-polar</li>
<li>H₂O = polar </li>
<li>They're immiscible – oil floats on top of water. </li>
<li>Oxygen breaks things down (breaks apart molecular bonds)</li>
<li>Oils tend to preserve things (by blocking atmospheric moisture/oxygen)</li>
<li>Most of the biological world is either:
<ul>
<li>a lipophilic hydrocarbon (non-polar), or… </li>
<li>a hydroxy-bond molecule (polar)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, consider that most deep frying is done rapidly, probably <em>almost instantly</em> causing <a href="http://www.compoundchem.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Food-Chemistry-Maillard-Reaction.png" target="_blank">the Maillard reaction</a>, which reacts w/sugars &amp; caramelizes the outside of frying food, browning it while keeping the inside part safely tucked away from sogginess.</p></div>		</li>
