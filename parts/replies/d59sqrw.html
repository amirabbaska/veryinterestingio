			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great ELI5 answer.</p>
<p>I would like to mention for this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For every second that passes &quot;in the rest of the world&quot; (for lack of a better reference frame), you also age by one second</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anywhere that is closer to Gravity goes faster. An astronaut will age slower than someone on earth. A watch on your wrist will go slower than a watch on your foot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, the astronaut and wrist examples are more natural application of this principle. The numbers just start to get appreciable once you reach astronomical scales.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. This puts it in a new perspective for me. You're saying that, &quot;Time-travel&quot; would be to age you so slow that everyone else shoots past you. Then when you leave the black hole you just join up with the rest of the world wherever they're at a the time?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Roughly, yes.</p>
<p>More specifically: you are not <em>entering</em> the black hole, because to do so would be to spaghetti-fy (which is a real word) and therefore die.</p>
<p>Instead, we are getting <em>closer and closer</em> to it, letting the effects of time dilation warp our reality, before &quot;exiting it's influence&quot; so to speak, or more generally just turning back home. </p>
<p>This is well-known science. It's literally programmed into our satellites orbiting the Earth that they have to account for the time dilation of their speed around the Earth, in order to keep the time on their clocks equal to the times on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing about &quot;being trapped&quot; but rather everything to do with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation" target="_blank">time dilation</a>.</p>
<p>Time dilation is merely the perceived difference in time between two people or objects. It is typically measured as the difference of elapsed time between two events, as recorded by Person A and as recorded by Person B. On Earth, we are for all intents and purposes in nearly the same reference frame, so there is <strong>rarely</strong> any need to talk about time dilation when you're determining how to send a phone call or email to Japan from the US.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when Person A is NASA's center in Houston, and Person B is a satellite orbiting the Earth, now we're getting somewhere. And you better believe that all the satellites and rovers we've sent to Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto have to account for time dilation.</p>
<p>When time dilation is affecting two observers, it means that one person is viewing things &quot;more slowly&quot; than the other. Time dilation is &quot;created&quot; by the following two effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>massive gravitational influence from a nearby body</li>
<li>relative velocity in different, nonparallel directions</li>
</ul>
<p>The black hole in this example is a prime case of #1. One way you could visualize the time dilation is to imagine a single ray of light. It is emitted from a flashlight located in space, and it's our &quot;event&quot;. Now, let's say you and I are standing next to the flashlight, and we wait for it to flash twice, on and off and on again. How many seconds were between the two flashes? We'd probably get the same answer. We are in the <em>same reference frame</em> with <strong>no time dilation</strong>.</p>
<p>Now let's say that I'm going to hold onto the flashlight, and you're going to sit in a spaceship, and rocket away from me at 10,000 miles per hour, starting right at the moment the flashlight turns on the first time. To me, the flashlight will take exactly as long as before, because I'm holding it in my hands and the flashlight hasn't changed. You, meanwhile, are moving away from the flashlight. The <em>ray of light itself</em> has to cover more distance in order to reach your eyeballs, and you can say to yourself &quot;yes, the flashlight has turned on twice&quot; and record the time. This is called red-shifting, when velocity <em>away</em> from a source causes time dilation.</p>
<p>Now let's say that I'm going to stand near a black hole, and you can either continue to rocket away in your spaceship, or stand still, but further from the black hole than me. Either is fine for this part of the example, as long as you understood the red-shift effect in the previous example. As I stand near the black hole, gravitational pull creates virtual, <em>artificial</em> distance between you and me. You're not really any further away from me if I measured it in inches, but if I look closely at my ruler, I might notice that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Length_contraction" target="_blank">my inches aren't the same size as they used to be</a>. Here's time dilation version number 2: the light from the flashlight in my hand will be caught up near the black hole with me, and will take longer to reach you. <em>Exactly</em> like the case where you were moving away from me and my flashlight, you and I will notice different number of seconds between the two flashes. It will stay the same for me, because I'm still holding onto the flashlight in my hands, but now that I'm being affected by gravity, you will notice <em>yet another</em> difference.</p>
<p>So, astrophysics lesson over. Let's get back to your question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you actually are trapped in the past of the world in the black hole which is your present and then when you come out you skip years?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's no &quot;being trapped&quot; concept here, really, which is why the answer to your question is &quot;No&quot;. I don't need to be trapped inside the event horizon of a black hole in order to be affected by its gravity. Just being near the black hole in space will be enough for the light from the flashlight to experience time dilation on its way to you.</p>
<p>The only right part about &quot;skipping years&quot; is that due to the effects of the black hole, you and I will <em>perceive</em> years at a different rate. Instead of thinking about the flashing light from the flashlight, and counting the seconds between the flashes, just change the example to revolutions of the Earth around the sun, and counting days in a year! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its more that time goes slower for you. If you are near a black hole it may seem like 1 day to you, but for someone on earth a 1 whole year had past.  If you spent 10days then to them it would seem like 10 years.</p>
<p>And the closer you get to the black hole the faster time moves for you. 1 day for you could be 1,000 years on earth. If you went back to earth they would think you went into the future.</p></div>		</li>
