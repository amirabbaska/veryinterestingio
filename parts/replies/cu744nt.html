			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't hire him because he was a young comics genius. Lee's uncle owned Timely Comics, and comics were considered a lowbrow form of entertainment. It was literally the equivalent of working at your weird uncle's porno shop. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Claremont was influential as a writer, but he was never anywhere near as involved in the business side as Stan Lee.  Lee had a vision, he understood comic books and the medium.  And he was willing to do what needed to be done to help Marvel succeed.  Even if it look like he had failed in the late 80's and 90's, he stuck with it.  Now, it seems obvious, back then, very few could see Stan Lee's vision.</p></div>		</li>
