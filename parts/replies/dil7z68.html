			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that heritability estimates (like these) are entirely <em>relative</em> measures. There's a sense in which it's not correct to say that 40% of personality is determined by genetic factors, or to use heritability as a reason for saying either genes/environment is more important. What heritability actually measures is the extent to which the variation between people is due to variation in their genetic makeup vs. variation in environmental factors. Thus it would be more appropriate to say that e.g. 40% of personality variation is due to genetic variation. That might sound like the same thing, but the point is that heritability depends on <em>how much people differ from one another genetically</em> and <em>how much they differ in their environment,</em> which is entirely dependent on the characteristics of the group being studied. </p>
<p>Hypothetically, if we study people who don't differ much in their environmental experiences (similar nutrition, education, healthcare, life experiences, etc.), heritability estimates will tend to be high because the differences between people would primarily come from having different genes, not from having different environments. Alternatively, if we study a group with limited genetic variation, heritability estimates will tend to be low because the differences between people would be more likely to come from differences in their environment. The upshot here is that heritability is not a direct measure of how much genes or environment &quot;matter.&quot; Even if we found an extremely high heritability for personality, that wouldn't mean that environmental factors are unimportant. Conversely, even if we found an extremely low heritability, that wouldn't mean that genes don't matter. To use an extreme example, imagine that we populate Mars entirely with babies cloned from Elon Musk. The heritability of personality on Mars would be 0 because none of the differences between Elon-001, Elon-002, Elon-003, etc. would be due to genetic differences. Their personality differences would have to be due to environmental factors. However, that would obviously <em>not</em> mean that genes had no effect on their personalities.</p>
<p>It's important to remember this seeming technicality because it affects how we interpret the results of these studies. For instance, someone might take your TL;DR conclusion as meaning that genes are more important early in life and that environment is more important later in life. That's not really what's being shown. What seems more plausible is that most newborn babies have very similar experiences as one another, so the differences between them are largely going to be due to genetic variation rather than variation in environmental factors. That doesn't mean the environment doesn't affect them; it means they don't differ much in the environments they experience. Mature adults, on the other hand, are about as genetically diverse from one another as babies are, but they differ much more from one another in their range of environmental influences - causing a corresponding decrease in estimated heritability. That doesn't mean that genes no longer matter; it just means that adults experience more variation in their environments. </p>
<p>TL;DR: We need to be very careful in interpreting heritability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's always going to be a combination of both parents. Saying that intelligence comes from the mother grossly oversimplifies both intelligence as a construct and genetics as a whole. </p></div>		</li>
