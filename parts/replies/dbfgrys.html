			<div class="markdown"><p>I forgot to mention the problem with draftkings, which is that it's a sucker site. It's designed to use the fine print to never pay anything out to the vast majority of users. It makes a game out of the betting, so people feel that they're more involved, but there's a lot of rigamarol around getting paid your &quot;winnings&quot;. It's literally the opposite of a reputable bookie. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Uber is entirely a bet that self driving cars will allow them to reshape how people buy transportation (rather than owning a &quot;car&quot; you'll own 0.1% of a 100 car fleet that will swing by you when you need to use one).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's the chances that one of the really big auto makers figures out that it has the brick and mortar infrastructure to really challenge Uber in running this kind of thing? I mean, take the network of business partners (dealerships) that have a large space intended to hold a fleet of cars, the factories already in place to build the cars, and all of the name recognition you could want, and you're halfway to having the fleet that people can buy into. Build an app to allow people to call your cars and you could be up and running fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Decent but it's far from a sure thing for the automakers.  Consider that Wal-Mart was in an equally good position to become the dominant online retailer relative to Amazon in 1997, WalMart had stores accessible to everyone, excellent logistics, and enormous leverage with suppliers, but 18 years later Amazon is many times larger than WalMart's online business and is getting closer to being a rival for the parent company.  </p>
<p>Uber could conceivably bring an automaker that was late to the shift, instant credibility by bringing a massive customer base and the technology and data to better control the routing of cars.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A cooperative endeavor between Uber and one of them could be devastating. Enough real estate to house self-driving fleets (unless they leverage their current drivers into a distributed network of cars - three or four single families in the middle of the street could keep an Uber car that it doesn't own in its garage, charging a bit of rent, for the use of X number of users) and the supply chain for those fleets are a couple of the bigger hurdles for Uber in creating this kind of system. The customer base and tech are the bigger hurdles for the automakers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly it, a valuation isn't a trophy to show off, it's the side effect of someone buying a piece of a company.</p>
<p>For comparison, there are many public companies that have been, or were, losing money for a little while, and yet their stock still traded at decent prices, and any of us could have bought some.
If we did we'd be the ones setting the valuation for that company, and we could ask ourselves &quot; why would you value a company that's losing money at over a billion dollars?&quot;</p></div>		</li>
