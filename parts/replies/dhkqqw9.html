			<div class="markdown"><p>Homeless services, case manager, here. Thank you for your time! A follow-up question?</p>
<p>There was a period a couple years ago that our local (overworked, under paid, likely experiencing compassion fatigue) Mobile Crisis Therapists and psych ward intake workers appeared to be using &quot;anti-social&quot; as a throwaway term to describe many of my clients. When I would try to ask about evidence based treatment for anti-social pd, they would reflexively respond &quot;there is none.&quot; As I gently pressed, they would calm, focus, and then refer me to our local mental health authority's forensics unit and a particular program within the forensics unit. </p>
<p>Thankfully, the &quot;anti social as throwaway term for folks we are at at wits ends with and simply don't know how to help&quot; phase appears to have passed. Still, I'm left with the question: What is the gold standard of treatment for Anti-social PD? </p>
<p>My geographic region is fairly remote and unlikely to have practitioners trained and able to deliver gold standard treatment for Anti-social PD, let alone to provide said treatment for unfunded clients. Still, I would like to know what's out there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it it's talk therapy and that's it. And therapy hasn't done anything to make me &quot;normal&quot;, it just gave me some tools to use. It seems to me that ASPD is pretty permanent and something that you can't really change, you just learn to fake it and act like a normal person and generally nobody knows anything is different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi there. Sorry it's taken me a while to get back to you. Sounds very frustrating (and familiar) to hear people written off in that way using vague terms. It can be a very dismissing thing and equate to saying there's no hope. I think in particular &quot;anti-social&quot; (without the PD bit) can really just be a shorthand for &quot;we find them difficult&quot;, and often that stops us thinking about the lives and experiences people have had that might make them distrustful, angry or alienated through no fault of their own.
As far as treatment for ASPD, I had to do a quick double check of the Cochrane Library reviews to confirm my suspicion, but there doesn't seem to be a gold-standard, evidence based treatment that works for everyone. The NICE guidelines suggest targeted cognitive-behavioural group work addressing specific goals like anger management or managing impulsive behaviour. What is rarely mentioned is that there is an adaptation of Mentalization Based Therapy (MBT) for ASPD. MBT is an evidence based treatment for Bordeline PD, which aims to help people understand their own feelings and the feelings of others. It's mostly group based again. There are protocols for delivering it with ASPD, but to my knowledge this hasn't been evaluated very much. Overall, I'd say the lack of evidence for ASPD treatments has a lot more to do with not many people having tested and published any research on this subject rather than there being good evidence that it doesn't work, if you see what I mean. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. </p></div>		</li>
