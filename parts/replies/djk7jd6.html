			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, The Ghrelin part is interesting. I have Dysentry right now. I don't want to eat. So I stopped. The first 2 days I kept getting hungry. So much I caved and ate something (that food had barely time to say hello to my insides before it came back out the other end), but now I just feel hungry, but not so much I can't ignore it. I am on day 4 of not eating. So does the body eventually just give up releasing Ghrelin? Is that what happens to people who get a gastric band? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The release of ghrelin is based on your eating schedule and is fairly easily re-trained. After fasting for only 2 days I no longer get hungry even at my normal eating time, or if i change my normal eating time it only takes 3 or 4 days for my body to catch up and start getting hungry at the new time.</p>
<p>Of course this will be different from person to person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a feeding tube for ten years that I used all night while sleeping. Now, if I don't eat before bed I will get so hungry I will wake up. I haven't used the tube (had it removed and surgically closed) in about two years, I still get overwhelmed need to eat at night/have food in my stomach while sleeping. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I changed my diet around I went 'cold turkey' so to speak.</p>
<p>Directly from maybe 2000 calories a day of junk/sugar/carbs etc to 1200 (or less) calories of lean healthy stuff. </p>
<p>(Maybe not the best way, but eh it worked for me)</p>
<p>First few days were awful, constantly hungry all the time. Got slowly better the weeks after and eventually got to the point where I really just didn't 'feel' hungry most of the time. I'd eat dinner in the evening because logically i knew I had to not because I always wanted to. </p>
<p>Was sleeping about 6 hours, working full time, going to the gym 4-5 times a week and felt fine.
I figure I just did not 'need' what I was eating before (plus what I WAS eating was actually full of good stuff not just sugar) </p>
<p>As I lost weight and approached my ideal weight I stopped obsessing over the calorie count and relaxed my zero tolerance policy towards junk food, found I was maintaining about 1200-1400 calories a day, had very little taste or interest in carb heavy/greasy/sugary food, and just didn't get those intense 'hunger pains' i used to. </p>
<p>I always figured it was going to be a constant struggle to deal with being hungry, craving things I wasn't allowed etc. But really once my body got over it physically there just wasn't a mental component to worry about. </p>
<p>Then I got pregnant and it all went out the window XD Gonna have to do it all again in a few months&gt;&lt;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yeah, a lot of people talk about how not eating slows down your metabolism -- which is an <em>extremely</em> popular belief -- but the opposite is generally true: within the first I wanna say 72 hours of fasting your metabolism actually <em>increases</em>, primarily as a way for your body to be like &quot;hey, time to start moving, go find some food!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Warm broth is your friend. </p>
<p>When I got food poisoning a couple years ago, it was the only thing I could have more than a spoonful of without vomiting or blasting diarrhea. Even ordinary water caused problems, but for some reason, my body had no objections to warm broth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. This post has a lot of deleted comments. Anyway is all true, but there's another reason -- dehydration. A lot of people don't realize how much of their water intake comes from food, so if you have the same amount of fluid intake but haven't eaten in awhile you will dehydrate. Dehydration causes lightheadedness, dizzyness, headaches -- and nausea. These are also the precursors to heat stroke, which I only mention because it's summertime. Drinking water can also help calm the stomach.</p>
<p>I can attest to this from personal experience in a survival situation -- I went without food for a week and was dehydrated at the end. Honestly after a few days I stopped being hungry (very strange), but I didn't keep my fluid intake up as much as I should have despite a water source nearby. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah dude me and some of my buds got stuck in snow and had to hike out. Only took two and half days, but one of our buddies was refusing to drink stream water (we had a purifier but it wasn't made for winter, so that thing was frozen and useless) and with all the trudging through the snow and no food or water he was getting tired, nauseous, and loopy. We started getting really worried when he started saying we're getting surrounded by army men (we weren't). We made it to a ranger station (with no rangers present) kept hiking and met up with some steelhead fisherman. We all climbed on the sides of their jeep and bummed the remaining 12 miles back into town, and had the best damn subway sandwich of our lives. But that was the first time I've ever seen what a few days of no water and food can do to people it's kinda scary but I can't even imagine an entire week, that shit would suuuuuuck with a capital s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have spent a lot of time growing up in the woods or in nature. I survived the lack of food just fine but I still had mild dehydration because it is hard to gauge when you're engaging in a lot of physical labor and not eating. I didn't feel thirsty - It wasn't until the effects of dehydration (which I know well) that I would break and put my feet in the stream to cool down and drink until I pissed clear. Your friend didn't recognize the symptoms and didn't know how serious the danger he was in. After awhile you become disoriented and can't think. At that point you're the walking dead. You won't seek water because you literally can't remember it's important.</p>
<p>People who have never left the urban environment are domesticated animals - they have no survival skills. Any source of moving, clear water is good enough in an emergency. You will die of thirst long before any toxins out bacteria kill you. And if you remain dehydrated often your immune system weakens... Then you <em>will</em> die from what you fear as an urbanite.</p>
<p>My rescue was in dense woods. The searchers knew the importance of water. If I wasn't near it by then I was already dead. They found my fire I kept going the whole week with wet greens to make thick smoke.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just in case anyone actually wants some real sources on this information.</p>
<p><a href="http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/42/12/1791.short" target="_blank">Source 1</a> - hypoglycemia is probably the most common cause</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/ajg/journal/v99/n9/abs/ajg2004343a.html" target="_blank">Source 2</a> - interestingly, I couldn't actually find anything about gastric acid levels and nausea but I did find this about duodenal acid levels</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good that. And just to contribute slightly to the discussion on hand, anyone not eating enough to the point that they become hypoglycemic: do yourself a favor and keep a light snack on hand. Fruit, nuts, pocket sandwich. Because you don't want to fuck around with insulin shock. It can cause comas, seizures, or in extreme cases it can kill you. </p>
<p>I am unfortunate enough to have type 1 diabetes and my blood sugar drops every 2 hours or so. It can get terrifying at times. Count yourselves lucky that you can diet and fast for hours but do nibble here and there. It's better for the metabolism anyway. </p></div>		</li>
