			<div class="markdown"><p>I watched the commentary for Austin Powers years ago when that was still a thing and somebody, possibly the director, talked about the scene where Austin mentions a &quot;pussy cat&quot; and pauses for a long time between &quot;pussy&quot; and &quot;cat.&quot; Apparently, they had to shorten that pause by a bit to keep from getting an R rating. Something that small can be the difference.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously? Do you happen to know of a PG-13 movie that says &quot;Fuck&quot; in it? I figured even one was instantly an R rating.</p>
<p>Edit: So apparently I don't pay attention to ratings because I've seen almost all of these movies you guys are mentioning. Also, Be Cool and The Martian have both been mentioned like 10 times each. Read comments before you reply, folks.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Has that changed in the last 10 years? I remember Hairspray having teens smoking but it stayed PG.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually you can get two f-words in a PG-13 if you do it right. Oceans 11 and The Martian are good examples of this. Oceans 11 gets away with it by using it once normally, &quot;middle of the f<em>cking desert&quot;, and then later using it with a very heavy accent, &quot;Where the f</em>ck you been?&quot;. By saying it with such a heavy accent, the second f-word is almost unintelligible. So the movie got to put in two, while staying PG-13. The Martian also got past the one f-word limit in PG-13 by using creative techniques. They slipped in extra f*cks multiple times by either not using the audio of the word, instead just showing Matt Damon lipping the word, or by writing it out, instead of saying it. So in reality, two f-words  isn't a hard limit that results in an instant R. It's just a malleable criteria that movie makers are constantly pushing the envelope on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes the same thing in a sexual context gets a different rating. For example, &quot;I'm gonna fuck you up&quot; can get a lower rating than &quot;I'm gonna fuck you&quot;. Same word, different context. </p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out that different but equivalent sexual acts get different ratings sometimes. Cunniligus, for example, is more likely to get a higher rating than fellatio. But a full-frontal naked man is more likely to be rated higher than a naked woman. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I would imagine that's because of the male genitalia being far more prominent and visible in the average non-pornographic shot of a naked person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't entirely agree... while it is true that boobs are more accepted in movies than dongs, I actually think dongs are more accepted than full on vagina, as long as they're not erect dongs. A bit of bush now and again isn't totally uncommon, but I can't really remember very many full blown vagina shots in movies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also add that I think a dude's ass is less likely to get blurred than a chick's on TV, and it would be unlikely to see a naked chick's full bare ass in a pg-13 movie, but man ass could be in a pg 13 movie as long as it was in the name of comedy or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that a lot of the current rules that the MPAA uses weren't fleshed out until the mid-2000s. PG-13 movies could get away with a lot more profanity and a little more sexuality in the 1980s and 1990s. Go back to the 1970s before the PG-13 rating existed, and there were some PG movies that had profanity and nudity that would probably result in an R rating today.</p></div>		</li>
