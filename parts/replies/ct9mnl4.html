			<div class="markdown"><p>I did jury duty in the UK. The compensation is peanuts (£64/day) for  the 2 weeks that most people get, but it goes up to decent money.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/jury-service/what-you-can-claim" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/jury-service/what-you-can-claim</a></p>
<p>129 a day, * 253 working days in a year is £32629 for the first 200 days or less. So not bad pay for just sitting and listening to court.</p>
<p>228 a day amounts to £57699 a year, so a pretty decent salary if you get past the first 200 days.</p>
<p>My job actually continued to pay me through my 10 days though.</p>
<p>EDIT: As pointed out, you can only claim up to what you would have earned anyway. So if you were unemployed, you don't get the full stipend, you would get the same job seekers allowance that you normally would get.</p>
<p>That is to say, they will only pay you up to your current salary, so if you're only making 20k when you get called to jury duty, you can't make more than 20k a year being on a jury.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my job paid me in full, when I did mine too.</p>
<p>The decent money you talk about is an upper limit only.  You don't get that automatically, you just get your lost earnings replaced up to that amount .... so if you only earn £25k a year, you can only claim £25k a year.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I make $16/hour CAD and take home $100/day.</p>
<p>The UK government (assuming I lived in the UK) would pay $130/day for jury duty for 10 days, then $263/day for 189 days, then $460/day after that. </p>
<p>For the average person, those are <em>more</em> than fair wages.</p>
<p>And that doesn't include food or travel, which they also pay. </p>
<p>Can I quit my job and just do jury duty full-time? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish the US was this good about it. Jury duty in my town/county is $20/day for the first 10 days.</p>
<p>How the fuck somebody is suppose to survive on $100/week is beyond me given that the average rent around here is $650/month not including utilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first 10 days you only get £65/day. That's about 16K a year. You also get about £5 for food per day.</p>
<p>It's not <em>terrible</em>, but it's also not reasonable to convert that to Canadian dollars in terms of value (trust me, I'm Canadian!).</p>
<p>In London, where I live, you could easily be spending £1600 ($3236 CAD) a month on rent for a single bedroom flat. As you can imagine, that would eat out of your 16K/year salary quite a bit.</p>

<p>The cheapest boxed sandwich from Tesco (basically safeway) is a sandwich with hard boiled egg and some mayonnaise between 2 slices of white bread. In London that goes for £2.50, so you can imagine your £5 lunch stipend doesn't go super far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, cost of living is a huge consideration in this stuff. </p>
<p>New York &amp; San Francisco cost of living are way beyond most other places in the country, for example. What I make in Texas at a decent job (for Texas) would barely get me a crappy apartment in either of those two places. </p>
<p>The real win is getting a job in either of those two places, but living in a very low cost of living location. i.e. telecommuting or what-have-you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Er yes. Unless that's tax-free that would be untenable for a huge amount of people in london.
Is there any way you can get out of Jury Service if you're called, you know, just out of curiosity, for a friend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but there's an opportunity cost of doing something like this.  Let's say Bob is working for Super Accountants Inc. and would have been promoted to Sr. Super Accountant, but when the position became available he had been out of the office for two months on Jury duty and instead that promotion went to Jim.  Bob still gets his job back when the case is over, but he's still just a Jr. Super Accountant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always. In some states you can be terminated without cause at any time. Especially if your position is &quot;no longer required.&quot; So they can wait juuuuuust long enough to be outside of reasonable expectations then sack you immediately.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure where you live, but here in California, all employees are &quot;at will&quot;. That means they can pretty much fire you for anything (as long as it's not based on race, religion, etc). They could simply say &quot;once you returned you were underperforming&quot;. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good luck proving unfair dismissal in an &quot;at-will&quot; state. Your employer can fire you without warning or reason in such states. Since they don't need to state a reason, it is nearly impossible to prove their reason was unjust.</p>
<p>My state recently got all excited because we passed a law making gender identity a protected status so you can't be fired for being trans. But big fucking deal, you can still be fired for being trans... Or gay, black, female, Jewish, whatever.... Just as long as your employer isn't stupid enough to put his reasoning in writing. </p>
<p>I got fired for getting injured once. They took me out of the system while I was on leave. Nothing I could do. A company in my state could just as easily pull the same shit with jury duty.</p></div>		</li>
