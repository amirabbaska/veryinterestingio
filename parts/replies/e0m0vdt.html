			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s a rule-of-thumb that takes the place of painstaking calculations that are only important in high-stakes cases. 30 is about where, for systems that aren’t terribly skewed, the sample mean of the observations is close enough to a normal distribution to treat it as such. With a normally-distributed sample mean, the idea of standard deviation and chi-square test statistic become meaningful.</p>
<p>You can work with fewer data points, but then it’s better to use <em>exact</em> methods that depend on the process you’re investigating.</p>
<p>As an example, if you have a loaded coin with heads probability <strong>p</strong>, you’d flip the coin <strong>n</strong> times, note <strong>x</strong> heads, and use <strong>x/n</strong> as your estimate for <strong>p</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>distribution</em> of <strong>x/n</strong> is important if you want to put a confidence interval on <strong>p</strong>. You can show that, for <strong>n = 2, 3, or 4</strong> that clearly <strong>x/n</strong> is not normally distributed, but binomially distributed. And it still is for any value <strong>n</strong>. But around 30 or so, the binomial distribution is so similar to a normal distribution of the same mean and variance, that you can call it normal (with all of the <em>mercifully</em> simpler math that normal distributions allow) and assume a minimum of error.</p></div>		</li>
