Advertise a vacant job? Public Notices?  Classifieds?  There was really only one place to put your ad.</p>
<p>The car section in my local rag today has about a quarter of one page of car classifieds where it used to be a 10 or more pages.  Many newspapers have tried to defend their print divisions and given up their huge branding advantage and lost the chance to bring their classifieds and job ads online.</p></div>		</li>
