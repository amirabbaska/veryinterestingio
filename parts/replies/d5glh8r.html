<p>The dead skin either drops off after a while if you don't repeat the same action that caused them in the first place or dries or hardens and fuses with the skin bellow if you DO repeat the actions that caused the blisters in the first place.</p>
<p>You could break them, but there's a risk of infection, and then the pressure that that would be distributed equally by the liquid in the blister would be applied directly to the raw skin below instead. Quite painful, depending on the area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Warts are caused by a virus, it's not related to the blisters.</p>
<p>Edit: You can get the wart virus through cuts in the skin, so there is some small possibility that the virus entered through the blister wound, but most likely it is a coincidence. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wart" target="_blank">Warts</a> are caused by a virus, not by blisters. If your blisters indeed remained unbroken, you shouldn't have been at any increased risk for developing warts, and even if they were opened up you'd still have to come into contact with a virus that results in a wart. Blisters do not automatically become warts. Chances are what you saw was either the early stages of that same viral infection and thus you <em>already had</em> warts (which, as Wiki says, can resemble a solid blister), or you contracted the virus in that area later on completely by coincidence. Your mother's advice to avoid popping them is not to blame.</p>
<p>Fun fact, though: Many of the treatments to remove warts involve <em>creating</em> blisters.</p></div>		</li>
