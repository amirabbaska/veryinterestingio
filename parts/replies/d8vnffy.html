			<div class="markdown"><p>I did that once making the drive from Vegas to SF with my GF. She asked if I wanted to pull over at her parent's house about an hour away from SF, but I said no, I'm not making this a two day trip. Next thing I remember is waking up pulling up to our building in the city. Had to go through a toll bridge and everything. Weird as fuck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is this in any way related to ADD? I have ADD but also enjoy entering dissociative states and can turn it on/off somewhat. drawing for me turns it right on, I'm thinking of nothing and often not even processing what I'm drawing. I think this has to do with the &quot;muse&quot; artistic people talk about.... it's a dissociative state where you don't feel like the art comes from you, you're zoned out and the art just happens. </p></div>		</li>

Being in creative and productive flow states (as opposed to just zoning out watching TV) are the most calming thing I do, and really help with my depression and anxiety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very interesting thought. I'm not sure about the accuracy of what he said, though. I know the body can produce a lot of different chemicals depending on what the brain needs, but I'd be surprised if it can produce actual opiates. I have done no research on this so I may be wrong. But it does feel &quot;good&quot; when you zone out, like a very calming feeling, and I could see that being a feeling you'd want to repeat, so a mild &quot;addiction&quot; to zoning out wouldn't be impossible. Very interesting line of thought.</p></div>		</li>
