<p>1/T = (dS/dE), where the derivative is a partial derivative, and the other extensive quantities are held fixed. S is the entropy and E is the internal energy.</p>
<p>For a classical ideal gas, the equipartition theorem gives the relation</p>
<K> = 3kT/2, which allows you to relate the temperature to the average kinetic energy of the gas molecules.</div>		</li>

<p>I've always found this equation weird because 3 represents the number of dimensions of the space. I really don't understand it, but I guess the temperature is not just the kinetic energy of the particles, it is how much energy the gas can transfer through a 2D interface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same relationship between T and KE applies to atoms in solids, liquids and gases, and indeed, between T and any variable that appears quadratically in the Hamiltonian (e.g. x^2 in the harmonic oscillator). This is an elementary result of statistical mechanics.</p>
<p>If you partition energies, the relationship need not apply to the individual partitions. This has often been a source of confusion here.</p></div>		</li>
