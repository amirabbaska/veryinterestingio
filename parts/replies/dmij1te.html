			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer. Just to add, we also genetically engineer mice with mutations (usually ones found in human tumors) that give them cancer. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you want to study. Sometimes you can inject cells to the mammary gland, remove the primary tumor, and watch to see if the mouse develops metastases elsewhere.
Other times they just want to test a drug so they inject tumors just under the skin and watch tumor growth in response to treatment.
Injection into a vein (through the tail) gets the cells trapped in the lungs usually just by circulation patterns. Cells get trapped in capillaries and set up shop to become a tumor. If you inject straight into the heart, the cells go throughout the body, this is a good way to model non-lung metastasis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trying to keep this as ELI5 as I can. Yes, but you have to inject the cells into the blood stream, and they will migrate to the organ. </p>
<p>Other models you can inject directly into the organ (works well for some brain cancers), but most are the models where you inject into the animals flank and measure the tumour directly with callipers  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work with stem cell researchers. So I can only tell you about what I work with, but if I were to inject stem cells from the bone marrow from me, into you(assuming you have no immune system), those cells would migrate into your bone marrow and create a new immune system. Assuming you don't die beforehand due to the lack of immune system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another method is viruses carrying cancer causing mutant genes. You can inject these viruses which insert the genes into the cells they infect and create tumors.</p>
<p>And you can also do something called intra-uterine electroporation. You literally inject whatever DNA you want and zap the area with electricity. When you hit cells with a strong enough charge, it pokes tiny holes in them and they pick up the DNA in the environment! Bam! You've got your tumor!</p>
<p>The advantages of these approaches is you can apply them to whatever mouse you want! Immune system can still be present!</p>
