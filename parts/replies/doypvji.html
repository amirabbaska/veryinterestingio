			<div class="markdown"><p>You can tell he's not a native English speaker, but that didn't negatively impact his ability to communicate. Take this phrase for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>before someone start to bash on me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;Someone&quot; is the subject of the verb &quot;start.&quot; The subject is a singular third person noun, so the verb must be conjugated to match. The appropriate conjugation would have been &quot;starts.&quot; Using &quot;start&quot; instead of &quot;starts&quot; is an error in subject verb agreement, and native speakers rarely make such errors.</p>
<p>That being said, his mastery of (at least) two languages is impressive to me, and he is contributing positively to the discussions, so I'm glad he's here and I don't want him to get the impression I'm bashing him. I just don't want to blow smoke up his ass by telling him he's more skilled than he actually is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a native English speaker and I have found that almost every time somebody posts with the disclaimer that they are not a native English speaker, they speak English far better than my friends I grew up with. I'm kind of an ass and I'm pretty observant, so I tend to be pedantic about proper english, and I notice this shit all the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My ESL friends may have more hiccups than my EFL friends when <em>speaking</em>, but they tend to <em>write</em> better. The sheer amount of native English speakers I know who consistently write “defiantly” instead of “definitely” alone is staggering (albeit hilarious). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>THANK YOU FOR EXPLAINING THAT AWFUL WHINING!!!!! (Also the rest was perfect and quite easy to cogitate)
My roommates have said I'm insane and hearing things for years. But I swear to god, old TVs, chargers without a device attached, some lights (halogen), all have this high pitched whistle/whine that drives me batshit. High powered fluorescents seem to vibrate my skull. lol</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's actually a different phenomena (known as &quot;<a href="https://www.controlbooth.com/wiki/lamp-sing" target="_blank">lamp sing</a>&quot; in the theatrical world), but it does sound similar. Nothing to worry about, but I agree with the annoying part! </p></div>		</li>
