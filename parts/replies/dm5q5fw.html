			<div class="markdown"><p>Marsupials, or at least their fossil relatives, had a near global distribution during the Age of Dinosaurs. Their diversity took a real hit during the same extinction that ended the Mesozoic and brought in the Age of Mammals. It's kind of a fluke that they only survived in South America then later made it to Australia, likely by hiking across Antarctica. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, marsupials were everywhere at first, but soon went extinct. They survived because Australia wasn't subject to many of the changes that wiped them out in the rest of the world, due to its isolation.</p></div>		</li>
