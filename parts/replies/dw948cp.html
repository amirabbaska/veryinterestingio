			<div class="markdown"><p>As an avid ant keeper who has done a wierd amount of research into my little pets, this is my understanding as well. </p>
<p>Apparently, ants and other insects have muscles just like us, but they are proportionately stronger simply because of scaling. </p>
<p>I've always wondered myself whether the fact that their muscles are attached to an exoskeleton is more or less efficient than attaching to an internal skeleton</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With bones you can have excess growths or bulges (sorry I don't know the right term) where muscles or tendons can attach making use of the lever rule (e.g. Calcaneus bone of a horse, or the tendons helping the kangaroo jump efficiently). I imagine similar constructs are more difficult with exoskeletons as the muscles are inside the hinge.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really, arthropods have semi-elastic in-growths of the exoskeleton to which muscles attach called apodemes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am an entomologist but not one that studies muscle mechanics, that person in this thread is u/GucciCaesar. But, as far as I know, there are advantages to muscles attached to an exoskeleton, but they have more to do with energy efficiency than strength. As mentioned a couple times in the thread, their proportional strength is mostly due to the geometry of small muscles. </p>
<p>However, I think that arthropods have an easier time staying at rest, as they require less muscle contraction when not moving. And possibly move using less energy. But, u/GucciCaesar would need to confirm that, as it's not my field.</p>
<p>One thing I find interesting is how their bodies rest when they die. My beetles I study will sometimes tuck their legs in and pretend to be dead, which is kinda smart bc when I take one out of the container their days are numbered. If they do this, their legs tuck into the body. If they are actually dead, their legs stick out straight down. I can't use dead ones for behavior experiments so this is quite useful. I really do not like dead mammals, I have something of a phobia of them, but they always look limp. Insect corpses seem to have the opposite reaction. This is, or at least I think it is, why you find dead roaches and stuff on their backs. They die, legs stick out, fall over. And I think, this is due to endo- or exoskeleton.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question, regarding the strength of muscles and where they attach to.</p>
<p>I don’t have the answer, but you may find shark biology to be interesting!  If I recall correctly, teleost (standard/bony) fish have muscles attached to bone. Whereas sharks (cartilaginous fish) muscles are attached to their skin, which serves as a large exo-tendon. This is not an exo-skeleton, but you may be able to find research on the difference between internal and external muscular connection by focusing on them!</p>
<p>I could be off on a detail or two, as I’m recalling this from memory of a long-ago biology class.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading somewhere that gorillas have their muscles attached to their bones in different places than humans do. Obviously gorillas have significantly more muscle mass but their muscles are also optimized to let them slowly apply a great deal of force. If they were built like a human they'd move faster with the same muscle mass but have a lower limit on how much force they could exert. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but they'd also have greater absolute strength. You can even see this in normal humans if you look at strength sports. Lighter lifters will lift higher multiples of their bodyweight than heavy lifters, but heavy lifters will lift weights that the lighter lifters will almost never lift. Larger frames allow the human body to pack on more total muscle mass than smaller frames, but smaller frames have better mechanical advantages.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want a real world example in humans, look at weightlifting in the olympics. The 56kg weight class winner will be about 5' tall and max lift about 150kg (3x bodyweight). The super heavy weight class winner will be about 150kg bodyweight, 6'3 tall and lift about 260kg (less than 2x bodyweight).</p>
<p>The super heavy guys might be a bit of an anomaly, since with no bodyweight limit there is no penalty for fat mass, but the next class down (105kg) the guys will still only lift just over 2x bodyweight. </p></div>		</li>
