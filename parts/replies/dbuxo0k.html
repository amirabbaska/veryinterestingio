			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, you are not correct. </p>
<p>Your veins work partially by action of your muscles. When you walk, your muscles constrict the veins, pushing the blood up from the extremities of the body towards the heart. This needs to happen because by the time the blood has been through the capillaries, there is little pressure to bring it back to the heart, necessitating the stretch. </p>
<p>The good feeling of stretching after a period of long rest is a reflex which causes your brain to release dopamine, encouraging the practice. In addition to this, it warms the muscle. The other reason is to get the muscles ready to move, as many predators are crepuscular (active at dawn and dusk), and so for the diurnal (active during the day) humans, the times where they are most vulnerable are at night, and right when they wake up in the morning. </p>
<p>In the case of deep vein thrombosis, when the blood sits in the veins for too long, without stretching to aid the blood flow, the blood can clot and block the vein, causing the thrombosis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it wouldn't be lactic acid. That causes a sharp pain, and is filtered out into the blood stream before being sent on elsewhere for excretion. You can help promote transport speed by either moving around the body parts that are hurting or holding them in the air. Either way, that fosters the movement of the blood in the veins away from what's hurting, and therefore the lactic acid in the blood that's causing the pain. Moreover, lactic acid is only released in quantities that cause pain during extremely intense exertion. You're not getting to that point in day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>I don't know for sure what chemical is referred to, but my guess would be Calcium ions. Basically, the mechanism that facilitates muscle contractions involved movement of these ions within the muscle cells. When calcium is depleted, your muscles can't contract as quickly, leaving them to feel sluggish and movement more laborious.</p>
<p>That's my guess based on what little physiology I know</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>just wanted to add that while most stretching is beneficial, it's not always the case. Sometimes the problem areas stay tight and the 'loose' areas get stretched more and you get worsening muscle imbalances</p></div>		</li>
