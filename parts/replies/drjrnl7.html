			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that there is just no &quot;actual value&quot;.  Considering biology in terms of digital systems can make for an interesting thought experiment (and Paulingtons certainly had a good whack at it), but ultimately the question is inherently flawed.  Neurons don't transmit bits (nor anything that can be adequately converted to bits) just like human memory can't be equated to a hard drive capacity, or visual systems can't be measured in pixels and frames per second, etc. </p>
<p>It's natural that our understanding of human biology and psychology is tinted by the man-made technology of our time (Two famous examples: Descartes and the deterministic human condition viewed as a clockwork machine, and Freud with his theory of 'drives'   analogous to a steam engine) but we've got to thread carefully with these sort of analogies, they can be very misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't go quite that far. Electronic and biological systems both do information processing, and there <em>are</em> rigorous ways to think about information processing in the abstract. The problem isn't that the analogy is inaccurate -- the problem is that we usually have an incomplete picture of how the channel works on the biological side. </p>
<p>For example, we can represent DNA sequences on computers very easily. The information stored in a chromosome maps very directly to information stored on a computer. The process is also reversible -- I can design a primer, or even a whole gene or plasmid on my computer, have it synthesized from scratch, and it will work in a biological system. If you want to spend a lot of money and get a lot of press coverage, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/03/synthetic-microbe-lives-fewer-500-genes" target="_blank">you can even order up whole chromosomes</a>. However, sequence data doesn't include methylation states, which can sometimes serve as an additional channel. If you have the nucleotide sequence but not the methylation states, you have an incomplete representation. That does not mean that sequence on your computer is a bad metaphor. </p>
<p>For information carried by neurons, we can measure all sorts of things about the neuron that seem to be important aspects of how they carry and process information. We can represent those measurements on a computer, which is the same thing as saying that they can be expressed very precisely in terms of bits. The problem is not representing the information carried by a nerve. The problem is that we don't fully understand how the channel works. Some of the information we can collect about neurons and nerves is probably meaningless. Probably, the importance of most measurements we can make are context-dependent; whether they are meaningful or not depends on other variables. By that same token, there are probably things that neurons do that are important for transmitting and processing information that we either aren't aware of or don't have a good way to measure. That doesn't mean it's a fundamentally unanswerable question -- it just means that we have an incomplete answer.</p>
<p>The eye, for example, can most certainly be understood and quantified in terms of pixels, frame rate and ultimately bits per second. One encounters the same problems when comparing different video technologies, but that doesn't represent an insurmountable difficulty. A movie camera that shoots 35mm film works on very different principles than a digital video camera that shoots on a CCD chip. They have different light curves, frame rates, and focal lengths. One is analog, the other digital. The transport format is different (undeveloped film verses some kind of encoded data encapsulated in a stack of digital transport technologies). But, they <em>do</em> the same thing. You can count how many bits are in an analog frame by digitizing at higher and higher resolutions and then trying to compress the image. At a certain point, increasing the resolution doesn't add new information. You can account for different frame rates and resolutions. You can keep in mind the physical performance is different.</p>
<p>This kind of analysis has been done with the eye in great detail. The eye takes really, really crappy video. It has a lower frame rate even than film, though because it doesn't discretize time into &quot;frames,&quot; that helps avoid frame stuttering. Most of the frame is badly out of focus and low resolution. It has a giant hole just to the side of the middle of the frame, and smaller gaps all over the place where blood vessels and nerves get in the way. The color washes out to almost nothing near the edge of the frame. It has an absolutely <em>amazing</em> contrast ratio, though. That's why beautiful sunsets never look as good when you try to snap a picture of them. A large part of the art of photography is just dealing with the fact that no camera even approaches the contrast ratio of the eye. We probably don't understand vision perfectly, but the aspects that remain murky are mostly in the processing and perception.</p>
<p>I suppose what I'm getting at is that technologies <em>are</em> very useful for understanding biology, as long as one doesn't simply ignore the points of difference. The same is also true for comparing different technologies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the well thought out answer.  Even as an approximation I find it a fascinating exercise. </p>
<p>I will definitely tell my neurologist this the next time I go in, we were speculating about it at my appt today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although too late for your neurologist, it's worth noting that how neurons fire is not exactly binary either. So this is actually a low estimate, due to neural impulses also having an intensity attached. This is what the comment above meant by &quot;a strong enough pulse can activate it still during the refractory period&quot;.</p>
<p>It was a very fascinating question for sure!</p></div>		</li>

Even twin-ax copper can carry 100Gb over shorter distances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's for relatively cheap optics too.</p>
<p>With powerful optical modems you can multiplex many (88 C band wavelengths on a 50Ghz grid) 200G waves onto a single mode fiber for about 1.6TB /s on a single fiber. Can go even higher if you go gridless and pack them closer together, or if you go to fewer 400G waves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speed of light in fiber is actually significantly slower than the speed of light in a vacuum, to the point where electrical signals can beat it in raw transmission speed.</p>
<p>For instance (IIRC, grain of salt) very pure copper will transmit a signal at 0.75c, while fiber will transmit the signal at 0.66c.</p></div>		</li>
