			<div class="markdown"><p>Knowing how phones work isn't my specialty but I'm into cryptography and here's my take on it.</p>
<p>In the best case scenario, the noise from the speaker would perfectly represent the 1's and 0's being sent over the radio wave. But all that information would be encrypted to begin with so it would be more practical to just listen in to the radio waves yourself and crack it the old fashioned way. In a realistic situation, I'd imagine there'd at least be some noise that would make this process messy.</p>
<p>There are attacks similar to this known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack" target="_blank">side-channel attacks</a> but they usually involve listening in to the devices handling information -not the information itself. The idea is that you can listen to the devices and correlate certain metrics like: heat being produced, power consumption, and sound (as you mentioned) to gain information about what operations the computer is performing. This can reveal clues to what encryption keys are being used.</p>
<p>There have even been <a href="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Fansmitter-1.pdf" target="_blank">cases</a> of keys on computers being compromised by only listening to the computers fan, rooms away!</p></div>		</li>
