			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think your brain solves these problems mathematically, it's more like a wheight function. It recognizes that certain variables influence the result in a certain way, and it tweakes those until the desired result is reached. After trying 200 times.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren’t “you” a fraction of your brain? In one situation, your brain interprets data and suggests an action, then “you” either automatically carry out the action or search memory to figure out the pros and cons, then determine what to do. Your brain is always doing a lot more than our lazy selves are in control of.</p>
<p>I’m a novice to this, just writing thoughts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an Audio Engineer I️ never actually considered this in the way you broke it down but it makes perfect sense. Making a synth sound like its moving from a far away location to being right in front of you starts with a high frequency shelf that slowly raises, allowing more and more high frequency content through, as well as a reverb or an echo like you said, becoming less and less apparent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, a distant sound will be ‘shrouded’ and destructed by more diffuse reverberations, whereas a closer sound may still have reverb (unless it is a ‘cold’ artificial sound, like a synth), but will be prominent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should know this as an audio engineer because that is literally how you place sounds in the front-to-back plane. </p>
<p>If you want to make something be loud yet feel distant, you add reverb with no pre-delay and remove top and bottom end.
Conversely if you want to bring a sound to the forefront, you make it drier, boost bass and top end, and if you still want reverb you increase the pre-delay on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sound progression strongly depends on the media in which it’s progressed. </p>
<p>As a kid I had one of those fancy digital watches with a decent alarm beep.
Since it was waterproof my buddy and me tried it in a lake under water.
And guess what: there was no significant difference between that beep right next to me and 300m across the lake. </p>
<p>Human ears are definitely not designed for water acoustics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is true! The speed of sound in water is much much faster than in air (more densely packed particles- it is even faster in solids), so it is very much harder to differentiate this way for us.</p></div>		</li>
