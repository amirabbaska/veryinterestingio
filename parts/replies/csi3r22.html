<p>So by &quot;they tried&quot; do you mean they actually did shoot at the beach and they didn't reach, or they got shot or what?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In all honesty I'm not 100% sure.</p>
<p>I've read personal accounts that say they knew the range of the German guns so didn't even try, however there are official reports that say they did try. One cool one mentions a &quot;Strafing run&quot;, by which they set their engines to full, got in range for their own guns, fired a few salvoes and then returned to a safe distance. As a sort of hit &amp; run, guerilla-naval warfare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were even situations where smaller ships, destroyers, pulled right up to the beach and tried to protect the assault boats and infantry by engaging in direct gun battles with the German gun emplacements.  <a href="http://www.uss-corry-dd463.com/d-day_u-boat_photos/d-day_photos.htm" target="_blank">Here's a page on the USS Corry</a>, sunk while attempting this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>they did shell the beach to some extent, however a mixture of shitty weather, entrenched positions (shelling/bombing bunkers and trenches isn't that effective: see WW1) and lack of sighting, plus the fact that you can just plain miss. Some beaches were more successfully bombed/shelled than others.</p>
<p>Basically dirt is really good at eating a shockwave. Concrete surrounded by dirt is pretty safe too - unless you get into more modern day bunker busters that detonate underground.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget the totally cocked up landing drills, operation tiger. Basically a practice run was organised on the shores of Devon. The bombardment was suppose to be followed immediately by the landing of troops who would advance swiftly up the beaches. </p>
<p>The plan was that the naval bombardment would end and troops would land following a 30 minute beach inspection to make sure there was no unexplored ordinance etc. The plan was to aclimitise troops to the sights and sounds of live naval bombardment, as they would be experiencing in Normandy. Strict orders were issued not to cross a live fire white line, yet that order didn't reach the American lines who advanced well beyond that point. </p>
<p>A second collossal fuck up came in the guise of an attack by German eboats. They simply weren't expecting it and as a result Around 1,000 troops lost their lives. </p>
<p>What is perhaps worse is that the whole debacle remained classified until some years ago when excavations were done and tanks etc. recovered from just off the coast. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on that, shelling or throwing grenades at trenches is not effective because alot of times they were built in a zigzag manner so that when they get bombed the shockwave and debris would only travel a very short distance before being stopped by dirt/concrete, it was simply not worth wasting shells first trying to hit the actual trench by trial and error then when they do hit it, it only effects a tiny portion of the trench that might not even hit anybody.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fixed guns on land have an inherent advantage in accuracy over naval guns.  The gun on land doesn't move with the waves, and it can be &quot;zeroed in&quot; ahead of time.  This means that an observer in a fixed position watches where the shells fall, and call in those exact coordinates again, days or weeks later.  Plus the forces on land can dig into hillsides and build concrete bunkers to reach a level of &quot;armor&quot; that would sink a ship.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But guns on ship have an inherent advantage over guns on land.  A ship can move.  And with accurate maps and positioning, you can shell a beach with ballistic fire without being able to actually see it.  The land-based guns would have to sight the ships to be able to return fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every square inch of that beach was already zeroed in. Those guns were calibrated. You have to stay moving, if you stay still they will shell your position. Saving Private Ryan mentioned this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really accurate. There were ships with perfectly big enough guns. And they did pound the bunkers, and they pounded them with bombers too. But have you seen those things? They are all but indestructible.</p>
<p>Also - an event that happened on Omaha beach which was left out of 'Saving Private Ryan', was when the Captain of a destroyer saw the terrible slaughter that was happening, steered his ship right up to the beach and exchanged fire with the German guns at point blank range to try and give the soldiers a chance.</p>
<p>Spielberg left it out. Maybe because it was a British destroyer.</p>
<p>edit: I stand corrected below. Several American destroyers did it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that this was a land and sea invasion. Paratroopers were already dropped behind/in the German lines before the naval landings had started. They would have risked hitting their own guys, especially since the many of the planes (due to various reasons) dropped their men outside of the pre-designated drop zones. If they had bombed the beaches or behind the lines, they would have risked hitting their own men.</p></div>		</li>
