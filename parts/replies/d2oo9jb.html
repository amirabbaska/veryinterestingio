<p>first generation (tricyclics)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why aren't MAOIs considered first generation? Genuine question. </p>
<p>I recently learned about s-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e) for the treatment of depression. I figured it would be another placebo supplement, but was surprised to see a lot of positive studies on NIH. Do you have an opinion on SAM-e? Would be cool to hear what a neuropharmacologist thinks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, you can add MAOIs to the list of first generation. Why do you ask?</p>
<p>Similar to most other supplements, there's just not enough research about SAM-e to conclude anything.  </p></div>		</li>
