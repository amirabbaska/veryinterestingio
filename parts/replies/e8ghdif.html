			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! It's one of the major hurdles in making railguns a viable weapon. After ten or so shots the rails are virtually useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why tungsten? It's very heavy, and has a high melting point, which sounds like beneficial characteristics for a round that's gonna end up exploding either way, but are there other factors contributing to the choice as well? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think so. We can't quite put enough energy into the shell to get it to reach escape velocity, but a concept of NASA's involves using a railgun to accelerate a rocket to Mach 10, which then activates in the upper atmosphere and accelerates into orbit. It saves a lot of money on rocket construction and fuel.</p></div>		</li>
