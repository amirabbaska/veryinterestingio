			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that the definition of &quot;camera&quot; includes the crucial aspect that it is <em>image-forming</em>. Either using  optics (lenses and or mirrors) or a simple pinhole. It gets really difficult to form images with high-energy (high frequency) photons; on the other end of the spectrum you'd need a massive camera to form images using long-wavelength radio waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that's true. Should probably have elaborated that even though it's difficult, it's by no means impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's an argument that even visible light cameras don't form the whole image &quot;simultaneously&quot; since there's a measurable exposure time.  Early daguerreotype and tin-type cameras often had exposure times measured in minutes!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A camera does not need any photon detectors to be a camera. It's just an optic with an imagining plane some distance behind the optic and a housing to keep stray light out. The camera came well before any photosensitive materials used to record the images.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And how do you think the imaging plane works without detecting (interacting with) photons? I didn't mention recording mechanics anywhere.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The camera obscura predates photosensitive materials by about 2300 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Detectors that look at multiple spectrums (usually around the UV to visible light to near infrared range) and detect in bands in divisions of 5 or 10 or so is called multispectral imaging.  </p>
<p>The same systems that perform this for 40 or more divisions are called Hyperspectral imaging systems.  </p>
<p>And then you have just crazy shit like Fourier Transform Infrared and Raman chemical spectroscopy.  </p>
