			<div class="markdown"><p>Maritime compasses are sometimes spherical. An inner marked sphere containing a magnet and weighted below-center so it remains level is placed inside an outer spherical shell containing some lubricant so it can swivel freely. A compass of this type would function perfectly fine in space, although it might display a bit of 'tilt' as the magnet pulls against its off-center mass.</p>
<p>I have a miniature one on a keychain that I keep in my outdoor survival kit. It is not so great for using with a map but it is small and harder to break than a traditional compass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but it would still point in the right direction. You'd want the markings on the sphere to go all the way around so it could be read &quot;upside-down.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would not serve to keep the compass 'level' any more, no, but the magnet would want to align with the strongest magnetic field anyways. It would just be tilted a bit oddly because that weight still has mass that the magnet has to move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got it secondhand so I am not totally sure what it is, but it looks like an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Allen-Liquid-Filled-Ball-Compass-Pin/dp/B000VNGYEC" target="_blank">Allen Liquid-Filled Ball Compass</a>. You can probably find a cheap ball compass at any sporting goods store, or in the sporting goods department of most department stores. They are extremely simple devices so I would not worry too much about quality; an inexpensive made-in-China plastic one should be fine as long as the ball swivels freely inside the casing, there are no bubbles in the fluid, and there are no cracks or uneven seams in the casing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Essentially, compasses only works in a single plane. </p>

<p>I don't think this is &quot;essential&quot; to compasses. There are spherical designs for example. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>it will align itself with the strongest magnetic field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is basically the answer. </p>
<p>Compasses that are fixed into the structure of a boat need a specially calibrated table (with each one) which show how they are offset by fields originating in the boat itself. These could be due to anything from the radio, to just some metal in the boat's structure. </p>
<p>Something like the space station would have some pretty strong magnetic fields and a lot of metal so, as you said, the compass would just move according to how the interaction of all those things acted on it. </p></div>		</li>
