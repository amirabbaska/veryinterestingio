<p>The hole on my drill press plug terminals are almost exactly 1/8 inch(I can slide a drill bit through), pretty darn small for a real lock. </p>

<p>I dont think this is photoshopped, rather I think one of the holes was enlarged. I think the pictures people pass around is more of a hack and a meme than a manufacturer's idea. I wish I had a luggage lock to try.</p>
<p>The holes probably predate those little luggage locks, back in a time when safety wasn't much considered. They didn't even bother with ground plugs. </p>
