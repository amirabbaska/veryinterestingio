			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the real limitation is given by the Shannon-Hartley Theorem!  That theorem describes how even a weak signal, buried in noise, can still carry digital information, just at a lower number of bits per second.  In fact, your mobile device routinely receives a low-bit-rate stream from GPS satellites which were designed for using signals buried in noise.  A quick glance at <a href="http://linas.org/theory/seti.html" target="_blank">this link</a> suggests that interstellar communication could be achieved at something like 0.01 bits/second.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!  Yeah, the many commentators focusing on the inverse square law seem thrown off track by analog communications.  Also, one way to understand Shannon-Hartley is to realize that you can continue to talk in an ever noisier room as long as you pronounce your words ever more s-l-o-w-l-y.  (It's actually a pet peeve of mine when people in a loud place fail to both speak louder and slow down.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but thats not really what OP asked!</p>
<p>Question is if you (especially if you think about an alien signal) can see a signal anywhere or just up to a certain range.</p>
<p>Because, what if its an alien signal that we dont know language or thoughtprocess off? Would we think its background noise or would we know it is a signal? And even if we know it is a signal, could you still derive information out of it (0,01bits/second). Because i think we wouldnt even understand it right away if its not scrambled or have missing parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, except the 0.01 bits per second... considering bits are quantized, you're looking at 1 bit per 100 seconds, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So based on my (albeit limited) understanding of that theorem, it appears to describe an absolute theoretical limit for extremely-low-power communication.</p>
<p>But the question here is about detecting and distinguishing signals not specifically designed to be detected and deciphered at extremely low power. I'm not sure that's the same thing.</p>
<p>So, yes, aliens could, if desired, transmit to us. No question there. But if they aren't intentionally blasting out a specially-designed low-power-decipherable signal, would we reasonably be able to expect to detect their intra-system communications (ie. their TV broadcasts)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of interest is <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.188.1145&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">this paper on interstellar communication using Stars to increase antenna gain</a>. </p>
<p>Basically you can use the suns gravitation as lens to lower power requirements. The authors make the point that if you wanted to establish two way communication with alpha centauri: </p>
<p>put a receiver/sender on a direct line from sol and alpha centauri, each  a few hundred AU out, you can get away with using milli(!)watts of juice to communicate, with near-lossless perfection. </p>
<p>If Aliens talk between stars they'd surely do it this way and our chances of getting any of that are incredibly low. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>SETI doesn't listen for broadcasts, it listens for transmissions. That is, its listening for someone who is actively trying to be heard. That means in bands that penetrate the interstellar medium well and that aren't too noisy. It also means beamed transmissions.</p>
<p>Active SETI does the reverse, sending directed transmissions to potentially habitable planets. As for people who say we won't like what we find, the fact is there's little logical reason for interstellar conflict in a galaxy with hundreds of millions of uninhibited solar systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Saying they won't be hostile just because of their intellegence is a bad assumption. Imagine if a spider had equal intelligence to us but was still inherently a spider. They simply aren't analogous to us in any way and we can't make predictions about their values.</p>
<p>They lack a spinal cord and might not even experience emotions. Yet genetically we're very similar because we both share a common ancestor somewhere down the line.</p>
<p>Intelligence just means they will be better at executing their values. This is why many people are afraid of articical Intelligence. You can have something a million times smarter than Einstien but with a goal of collecting postage stamps. It won't be concious but will be able to talk and interact with people. Unconstrained it might convert the whole planet it a mass of stamps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, depends what you mean by rare resources. Pretty much everything stays at the bottom of the gravity well. Beyond oil I think we might actually have made useful materials <em>more</em> accessible by extracting and processing them. </p>
<p>Whether it's easier/more efficient to invade inhabited planets and harvest scrap cars or to mine uninhabited ones is an interesting question, I think.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I love this typo because technically you'd have to have inhabitants on a planet who then develop a society complicated enough to have social rules and creatures that have self-consciousness in order to have inhibitions...so it's not <em>wrong</em>. But I don't think that specifically is what people are hoping to find on other planets (although a huge number of planets without them might indeed lead to less interstellar conflict?!)</p></div>		</li>
