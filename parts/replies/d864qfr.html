			<div class="markdown"><p>Scientists have this mentality and like to think that everyone else does too. But the truth is that the people funding research is most often interested in profits. The thing about theoretical physics is that it has a span of about 60-100 years from being conceived to practical application. Lasers, gravitational wave detection, PET scanning, are all examples of this.</p>
