<p>your bowels become filled with gas(at a rapid rate), causing diarrhea</p>

<p>followup (serious) question: is the diarrhea caused by the rapid rate of gas buildup such that your body can't handle it? In other words, why can't your intestines just expel all the gas instead of going into diarrhea mode?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well...that's how it expels it, gas forces fecal matter to move at a more rapid pace and to be pushed towards the exit. Also, as /u/alanmagid mentions, lactose pulls water from the bowels causing it to further accelerate along. </p>
<p>Basically it's like using a high pressure hose to clean a clog from a pipe. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wha?? I had an ongoing argument (albeit a little tongue-in-cheek) with my biology major room-mate where I stated that farts (gas) were jet propulsion for your poop. But she insisted feces are entirely expelled by the rippling motions of your colon. You mean I was right??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diarrhea is  caused by the osmotic pressure in your bowel, basically, like other said, you lack the enzyme to process lactose so it remain in your bowel  increasing the osmotic pressure that made the concentration of your bowel more higher (more particles for unit of volume), to compensate this pressure you have less water absorbed by the large intestine and so you get liquid feces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The diarrhea has nothing to do with gas or bloating. The type of diarrhea seen in lactose intolerance is called osmotic diarrhea and it's one of the most common types of malabsorption syndromes. Basically, lactose can't be absorbed by your gut unless it's digested into more basic sugars first. So if it's not digested by lactase, it just sits there in the lumen of the intestine. As with other water soluble molecules that are osmotically active (cause a shift of water to the compartment of the body they are in), lactose &quot;pulls&quot; or &quot;retains&quot; water inside the intestine. The result is diarrhea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very clear, thanks!</p>
<p>So is it not the case that bacteria are digesting the lactase and releasing byproducts, or they are, but that's not relevant to the cause of the diarrhea?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do differences in your symptoms reflect different causes of lactose intolerance, like something youâ€™re genetically predisposed to versus your body reacting to something that recently happened?  Or, flipped the other way, do different causes of lactose intolerance result in different symptoms or reactions?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>honestly i'm not sure what exactly the differences are between being constipated and having diarrhea, it always seemed like very similar processes went into both but i feel like there's something i just don't know x.x </p></div>		</li>
