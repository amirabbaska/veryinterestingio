<p>Ham radio signals of even low power will travel a few hundred miles, when they will typically only go a dozen miles or so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except this is RFID operating on a UHF frequency, it would never (usably) go far enough for those to be factors. </p>
<p>Most RFID types operate in another frequency band, so this application is unusually long range, but 50ft is still to short to care about any of that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having a hard time believing it was simply air temp. It'd be interesting if they could compare the signal strength between summer and winter. If the signal strength is the same, then maybe there was less interference from other radio sources in the winter (air conditioners turned off, metal doors to building closed which attenuates external sources, etc). Or for a few bucks get an RTL-SDR dongle and just look at what's going on with that frequency.</p>
<p>If it really does seem to be purely seasonal, maybe it's <a href="https://www.scribd.com/mobile/document/322071063/Force-of-Atmospheric-Humidity-on-UHF-Radio-Signal" target="_blank">humidity related</a>. It'd be fun to test what a humidifier does to your reception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Humidity was a part of it if I recall correctly, this was a facility located oceanside. The lower humidity being mostly due to the air temp we called it one in the same. We were technically wrong, but for practical purposes it was correct. You are most likely more accurate for the root cause.</p>
<p>Radio sources and doors etc. were not a practical difference as the gates were in an open area and while raido was in use it was very well accounted for during testing and via periodic checks. I do not remember the tester used, but it was a dedicated unit and much more sensitive than a dongle (this project was 10 years ago for me now.)</p></div>		</li>
