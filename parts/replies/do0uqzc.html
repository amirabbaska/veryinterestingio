			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it isn't bad, it's just crystalized.  To re-liquify, heat a bowl of water in the microwave, then put the honey container in.  If the honey happens to be in a glass container, you can heat the container itself, but you definitely do NOT want to heat the actual container in the micro if it's plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can heat it and melt it out and it'll be fine.</p>
<p>Just don't go on heating it lots of times to get a bit out each time, that'll affect it.</p></div>		</li>
