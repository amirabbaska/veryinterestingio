			<div class="markdown"><p>Adderall isn't an amphetamine derivative. It is just amphetamine (racemic mixture of d-amph and l-amph). Methamphetamine is the N-Methyl derivative of amphetamine (which is still prescribed btw - Desoxyn). Vyvanse is a completely different animal. It doesn't interact with dopamine transporters at all in its unmodified state, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. Instead it is a pro-drug of dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and it must be cleaved into this active form by the enzyme trypsin in the blood. This is why it has such a long onset time (1.5-2 hours) compared to dextroamphetamine alone ~20 minutes).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You sound really knowledgable about this. My doc just prescribed me Adzenys XR and I was wondering how it compares to Adderall and Vyvanse. (My basic googling has said it's more similar to vyvanse, but not in eli5 terms)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am quite opinionated about the new Adzenys XR formulation. The blunt truth is that there is nothing exceptional about this delivery method and I find it dishonest for Neos to market it as an extended release medication. Don't take my word for it though. Take a look at the pharmacokinetic graph that is published by Neos. In the <a href="http://images.rxlist.com/images/rxlist/adzenys2.gif" target="_blank">graph</a> you can see the spike in plasma concentration that is almost exactly the same as the <a href="http://images.rxlist.com/images/rxlist/adderallxr1.gif" target="_blank">graph</a> showing the plasma concentration over time for Adderall XR.</p>
<p>My absolute favorite <a href="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/727/23028958560_2ae3ddc5bd_o.png" target="_blank">graph comparing Dextroamphetamine ER Spansules vs. Dextroamphetamine IR vs. Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine)</a> really illustrates how uninteresting Adzenys XR is. Instead of the nice, smooth curve of Vyvanse you get a a strange, delayed spike in the plasma concentration. It seems to me that Neos might've more accurately described Adzenys as a delayed release amphetamine. </p>
<p>According to the pharmacokinetic data presented by the manufacturer, you should expect to take the Adzenys ER tablet and 4-6 hours later feel like you took a moderate dose of Dextroamphetamine IR (Dexedrine). I can't imagine any scenario in which this would be desirable.</p>
<p>So to sum up, Adzenys ER is pretty lackluster and has a very strange pharmacokinetic profile. The only possible usefulness of such a formulation is for obstinate children who refuse to swallow a tablet and must be given a dissolvable candy-like medication. My advice is to request Vyvanse. It is simply far superior in every way. If Vyvanse is cost prohibitive, then Adderall XR is the next best option. If the cost is still an issue, then generic Dextroamphetamine IR taken twice daily will produce a somewhat similar effect. I apologize for the long-winded response, but stimulant pharmacokinetics is a topic that I feel strongly about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, your doctor loves the new patented shit that is essentially the same as the previous formulations but costs much more. He must have loved the pens the pharmaceutical company reps brought him.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is misleading. Since Vyvanse <em>will</em> become dex-amph, it is clearly the same animal as Racemic Aphm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The pharmacokinetics are completely different. The rate-limiting step of trypsin cleavage creates a molecular extended release. While d-amph is the final compound acting on the DAT in both Dexedrine and Vyvanse, the subjective differences reported by patients is vast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to hang some more detail off of your comment: Amphetamines are one of the best-understood compounds known to medical science. They have been in use for over a hundred years. So there's no more concern about 'unknown effects on kids' than there is for aspirin. Yes some people have side effect, but they are well-known and easily monitor-able. Their efficacy, duration and withdrawal characteristics are very predictable.</p></div>		</li>
