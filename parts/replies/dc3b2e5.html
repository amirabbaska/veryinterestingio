			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand it's difficult to do properly controlled studies on nutrition, since it basically has to rely on self reporting. People constantly lie, and it would be near impossible to do a 10 year study of a person under 24/7 supervision/monitoring so they don't cheat on their diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah all of the nutritional studies need to be taken with a huge grain of salt. They're basically quackery. It may be the best information we currently have, but it doesn't mean it's good information. Similar to a lot of the 'social/behavioral' studies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's the biggest issue with nutrition right now. It's impossible to do the studies required to truly accurately test anything while being ethical. It'd require force feeding people for years while preventing them from having any outside source of food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i read some of the early studies on saturated fats were from rabbit feeding studies where the rabbits got fucked up arteries. a whole mess of studies that i've seen, and i mean hundreds, show no correlation between sat fat intake and heart disease. lots of epidemiological studies do, when you compare one country to another, or vegans to people on the normal western diet (which includes shit like absurd amounts of sugar, trans fats, and processed meats), then it will show people who eat less meat get less heart attacks. then again you have countries that eat startlingly higher amounts of meat than the west who get LESS heart attacks.</p>
<p>but there is 200 other factors involved in a country vs country study or in a &quot;vegan/vegetarian vs everyone else in the west&quot; study, so its never clear. but most of the ones where they study 200,000 people, follow their diet, and try to connect sat fat intake to heart disease occurrence, have shown no correlation. </p>
<p>there is more to the history of all this too, as to why this idea got so promoted and became a fad promoted by food companies with &quot;low fat&quot; advertising, but its all really weird. all in all the studies on sugar and cholesterol in the blood show its much worse, we should be worrying about sugar intake and how it effects our heart if anything. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, they fed cholesterol to rabbits who would have no way of actually digesting it since they're herbivores. Of course they're going to have jacked up arteries, they're bunnies eating food they'd <em>never</em> eat in the wild.</p>
<p>I wanna say that the only true link between obesity, heart disease, and diabetes, is sugar. Countries that consume refined sugar have increased levels. Japan never had this problem until their diets started becoming more westernized. Same with the Pima indians, they had tons of food, ate plenty of saturated fats and fish, and were very fit and thin. Then their river went dry and they had no way to get water, farm, or fish. The government stepped in and helped them out with sugar and flour and now they have the highest rate of diabetes in the world.</p></div>		</li>
