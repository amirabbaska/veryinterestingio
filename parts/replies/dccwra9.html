<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic_staring_effect#Later_studies" target="_blank">A 1913 study by John E. Coover asked ten subjects to state whether or not they could sense an experimenter looking at them, over a period of 100 possible staring periods. The subjects' answers were correct 50.2% of the time, a result that Coover called an &quot;astonishing approximation&quot; of pure chance.</a></p>

<p>Note that this is for detecting someone staring at you when you <em>can't</em> see them. Detecting someone staring at you when you <em>can</em> see them is much easier. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct 50% of the time is what you'd expect for random chance.</p>
<p>The left over 0.2% that's better than random chance... we'll there were 10 subjects tested 100 times. So that's 1000 samples. Is my math right that means people beat chance just 2 times?</p>
<p>You'd need a bigger sample and I'd be skeptical about potential noise and leakage in the experiment. Like maybe the &quot;starer&quot; would be slightly quieter when looking or not looking, giving the &quot;staree&quot; some leaked information.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the most scientific but in high school we did an experiment where we partnered off. Your parter would stand behind you and either stare at you or look somewhere else. You would then say staring or not staring. There was a slightly better than pure chance result when the whole class was averaged. Not the most scientific but add in a few controls and bigger sample sizes and you have a good study. </p></div>		</li>
