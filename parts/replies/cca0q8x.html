			<div class="markdown"><p>As a side note, we have also taken other flying animals into micro-gravity (on a parabolic flight, not into space). <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/11804292_Behavioral_reactions_of_the_bat_Carollia_perspicillata_to_abrupt_changes_in_gravity" target="_blank">Bats</a> showed little to no sign of trying to right themselves, only showing some signs of distress at the unknown feeling of low gravity. Other mammals and <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/7417935_The_behavioral_responses_of_amphibians_and_reptiles_to_microgravity_on_parabolic_flights" target="_blank">reptiles</a> tried righting mechanisms used when they are put upside down in normal gravity, and some snakes actually grabbed onto themselves as a solid surface.</p>
<p>Also, although it is not fully described in the abstract of that second article, some reptiles that previously had the ability to glide, but due to evolution lost that skill, reverted to the mentioned 'sky-diving' pose, despite never using it under normal gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of humans (at least), long-term exposure to microgravity can have negative health-related effects.  While the full range of possible complications over time is not well understood, <a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0061372" target="_blank">some of the negative effect of microgravity on bone density are known</a>.</p>
<p>Astronauts have also lost <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/64249main_ffs_factsheets_hbp_atrophy.pdf" target="_blank">up to 20% of muscle mass in one to two weeks!</a>.</p>
<p>For the wikipedia article on this topic, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_of_spaceflight_on_the_human_body" target="_blank">see here</a>.</p>
<p>I do not know whether the flies would have sufficient genetic diversity to be able to overcome the physiological challenges of life in microgravity.  </p>
<p>I'd like to raise the possibility that they might just get sick and die out within a few generations (though I'm certainly not raising that possibility to the exclusion of all other possibilities).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it's shocking how poorly our bodies react to microgravity in the long term.  I've read that a significant number of astronauts even suffer permanent vision impairment.  And in a way, it's not shocking in at all.  Gravity is about the most constant parameter that we've evolved under since life arose on Earth.  We shouldn't be surprised that bad stuff happens to organisms when you take it away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>MOTHS HAVE TO LEARN TO FLY, IT'S MORE THAN INSTINCT. The moths brought from Earth couldn't fly in space, only the ones <em>born</em> there learned to float instead, so clearly there's some moment after birth where moths learn &quot;the rules&quot; of their environment and they learn to get around accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know that we can deduce that they have to learn to fly just from this.  Maybe there's some mechanism that they depend on to fly or even flap their wings that doesn't develop in a zero/micro-g environment or doesn't develop properly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I might not have phrased it well, but the point is that's still learning how to fly at least in some capacity. An instinct might tell them to flap their wings, but experience and the environment might decide how often and hard. We <em>can</em> deduce that <em>some</em> part of this behavior is a variable rather than an inborn instinct or all the moths would suffer the same way. It's just exciting to see the line between nature and nurture here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no source studying that specifically, but the research paper linked above states specifically that the moths from Earth couldn't fly, only the ones born in space.   </p>
<p>So while the instinct to fly in moths may be somewhat pre-programmed, it clearly isn't <em>entirely</em> or all the moths would be similarly impaired by zero gravity. So some part of the flying process would appear to rely on experience. Even if it's something as simple as moths having to learn how hard to flap to counteract gravity, I just think it's interesting that it's apparently not <em>completely</em> hardwired. We often assume insects are just instinctual automatons, so the idea that a moth is figuring out flying as he goes along is, damn, really exciting to me.</p></div>		</li>
