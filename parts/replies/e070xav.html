			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a gap of latent heat between the increase of temperature of water and its change of state, the water will continue absorbing heat until eventually it vaporizes but the surface of the object will also be siphoning heat from the water so it won't prevent the object from warming up. It'll actually increase the rate of energy transfer to the object because water is highly conductive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water + fabric has more capacity to hold/transfer energy than just fabric alone.  While things like daylight may only increase temperature slightly, it's very important in other instances, such as to use dry materials taking things out of the oven, since wet oven mitts will burn you very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would guess the extra heat gained by a wet object absorbing more light would be insignificant compared to the heat lost by evaporation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily, remember sweat, the evaporation of our sweat is the natural form of human bodies of cooling.</p>
<p>Now that the &quot;cloth&quot; is wet, it will absorb certain amount of heat and evaporating, but if the object had more heat than what the water can absorb, the water would just &quot;flash&quot; away into steam, and that is not the case, the clothing keeps wet, therefore, only a fraction of the water absorbs latent heat (which converts it into steam) and the rest of the water absorbs the sensible heat (increasing the water temperature) but remaining liquid.</p></div>		</li>
