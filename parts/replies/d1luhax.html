			<div class="markdown"><p>Jumping in to add a lottery-specific note: while each combination is equally likely to win, combinations with more low numbers than high numbers are likely to pay less. Why? Simple: people pick the lower numbers more often (e.g. birthdays, etc), so if you win, you're more likely to share.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sometimes has hilarious side-effects.</p>
<p>People are drawn to the idea of a 'lucky number', and what could be more lucky than the numbers that won some other lottery in the past few days?  People take the winning number from the midweek Lotto (or whatever) and submit them for the weekend Powerball lottery.  Every so often those numbers win, and the winners have to split the winnings with the other few hundred people that had the same bright idea.</p>
<p>Tutoring college math, I spoke with many people who had questions about their ideas for increasing the probability of a lottery win.  They could rarely be talked out of whatever it was they felt would give them an edge.  Any time they matched a couple of numbers they interpreted that to mean they were &quot;close&quot;.</p>
<p>I naively thought that once I graduated and was working with other engineers, all of whom had a strong background in math, I'd hear less of this stuff.  My first week at my first post-graduation job, my new manager told me he hoped I was sufficiently 'self-driven' because he was busy spending all of his time looking for patterns in the list of all previous Powerball winning numbers.  I asked a few polite questions; he answered a couple (&quot;if the numbers are painted on pingpong balls, different numbers use different amounts of paint and will therefore have different weights&quot;) then apparently grew concerned about giving away too much info.  (This was something I saw in a lot of people who had been promoted from engineering to management: the fear that someone else given the same information would figure it out faster than them.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gamblers fallacy. It's also to do with misunderstanding that each event is completely independent of any that came before and any that will come after which is why such a combination is statistically just as likely as any other. Our intuitive understanding of chance is such that, once something has occurred, it is then less likely to reoccur. Obviously this cannot be true when each lottery event is essentially like having a clean slate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also relates to a lot of real world examples of statistics and entropy in action.  While each individual lottery pick probability is equivalent, there are far more lottery picks with numbers that <em>aren't obviously ordered</em> than are.  Our brain takes a shortcut and says &quot;there are more unordered collections than ordered ones so I should pick an unordered one&quot;, but the game isn't to guess whether or not the result will be obviously ordered... but to pick exactly one and only one sequence.</p>
<p>Here's an analogy:</p>
<p>If you throw a ball into a big room, and it lands in a random spot, chances are it will end up somewhere &quot;in the middle&quot; rather than touching a wall.    In reality, it ends up in one very specific configuration (10.7283 meters from the west wall and 5.27839 meters from the north wall, for example), and predicting that exact spot is way harder than simply guessing &quot;somewhere in the middle of the room&quot;. </p>
<p>But we categorize the room as having &quot;walls&quot; and &quot;central area&quot;, and it turns out there are a lot of places to land that are in the &quot;central area&quot; compared to areas that are &quot;touching a wall&quot;.   So we extrapolate this to the lottery problem and assume we're more likely to get it right if we pick some random-looking jumble of numbers distributed evenly around the number selection board, than if we pick an ordered sequence - because a thrown ball will tend to end up &quot;somewhere in the middle of the room&quot;.  This is fallacious because to win a lottery you aren't picking a big area (like the center of a room, or &quot;any random collection of numbers that isn't a sequence near 0 or 49&quot;),  but one specific collection of numbers among many.</p>
<p>In the case of the ball, if you were guessing where the ball lands and you had to get it <em>exactly right</em>, your chance of getting the coordinate 10.7283 meters from west &amp; 5.27839 meters from north would be just as unlikely as getting some specific coordinate beside a wall (e.g. 0.000001 meters from west and 7.283784 meters from north).</p>
<p>This relates a lot to entropy and the behaviour of thing we can see and feel like air and water, so there's a very strong physical reason that we make this kind of assumption.    </p>
<p>That said, <strong>I can think of one good reason to avoid an ordered set</strong> for your lottery pick, which is that you're probably less likely to have to share in the event that you do win.  There are probably a couple of lunatics out there playing 1,2,3,4,5,6 ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, but I'll simplify it. Your brain thinks, &quot;It's far more likely for a bunch of unconnected, or 'random', numbers to win than a set of sequential ones,&quot; which is correct. But it doesn't account for the fact that the odds of each individual set within that group</p>
<p>Another way to phrase it is it say, &quot;The odds of sequential numbers coming up is so rare that if I choose one of those sets, I'm choosing from the pool with terrible odds. I should pick something that's more likely to happen, like a random jumble of numbers.&quot; Again, makes sense on the surface, but fails to account for the fact that there's a vast difference in the numbers available in each category. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think part of the problem with this particular example is that people consider &quot;random&quot; and &quot;shuffle&quot; to be synonymous. </p>
<p>But, in reality, music listeners don't actually want a truly random track selection when they choose shuffle. Rather, they want something that specifically does not form a pattern.</p>
<p>An example would be a random playlist that just so happens to play a song two times in a row. That would immediately jump out to a listener as &quot;non-random&quot; even though it is a perfectly valid result of a random selection.</p>
<p>So really a shuffle algorithm would be something like... Play a random song, if song is not a repeat, and if song is not a consecutive album track, etc., etc...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Random and shuffle <em>are</em> different. If you shuffle a deck of cards, you're not going to flip two of the same cards in a row. Shuffling a deck doesn't duplicate the cards in it.</p>
<p>Drawing randomly from a deck will, if you select with replacement. Which is usually how random song is implemented.</p></div>		</li>
