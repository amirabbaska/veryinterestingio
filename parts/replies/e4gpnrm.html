<p>Ten million time older is 140 quadrillion years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The universe (likely) has far more stars in it then we can currently see. Past a certain point, light from distant stars simply haven't reached us yet, because they haven't existed long enough. So although an older universe would have stars more spaced out, this spacing would be moot due to the shear number of stars visible.   </p>
<p>Oh, and nebula a giving birth to new stars all the time, so not only would more stars be visible, but there would be more stars existing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This messes with my head. So you're saying we're discovering new stars, and the light we're seeing is from when the universe was born?</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is not true. For stars sufficiently far away, the space between us and the star expands faster than the speed of light, and the expansion of the universe is accelerating, so that cut-off distance is getting shorter over time. As time goes on, we see <em>fewer</em> stars, not more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is not true at all from what I understood.</p>
<p>First you have to take into account that the the longer greater the distance to a sun the smaller is the energy that you get from it with a 1m^2 solar panel. it is not because the light gets absorbed. very little gets absorbed in space. It is because the light has to &quot;fill&quot; a larger area. I think that there is a inverse cubic (or square?) relationship between distance to star and light the solar panel will absorb.</p>
<p>This means that the light from the very distant stars is very very weak. But there might be so many of them (I think there also is a cubic relationship between time passed and amount of stars you can see) So these two factors might cancel each other out.</p>
<p>But I think when you take into account that the universe is expanding then this will break the logic of the light from stars always beeing the same. I think that the light from stars will slowly get weaker as we move forward.</p>
<p>Your second point assumes that there is an unlimited amount of materials in those nebulars but there is not. Material gets lost whenever a white dwarf or something simular is created. From what I heard the amount of suns that gets produced will decrease over time from now. I think we will slowly have fewer and fewer stars.</p>
<p>Please correct me if I am wrong, which is possible. I just remembered these things from random things on the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps it means &quot;if our universe, in its current state of expansion, had achieved that state of expansion at time <code>t=(10^8)x</code> rather than <code>t=x</code>&quot;—meaning that expansion had occurred far more slowly.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it is referring to the fact that gradually entropy will even out and the whole universe will become a haze of hot, glowing hydrogen. Enough to power a plant that for some reason survives until then? Maybe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To address the subquestion as well: even if the light produced by stars was recognizable by the plant, it probably wouldn't produce and distinct phototropic effects because it doesn't focus on any particular part of the plant, certainly not enough so to cause any auxin gradient. The most you would (in theory) get is a slight upward phototropism, but at this point you're getting orders of magnitude more effect from the moon than stars.</p></div>		</li>
