			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it was really old tech that wasn't common for a long while until it became viable again with new bulb designs. Used to be the filaments were separate and within the socket would be a different set of contacts that would touch as you rotate the knob. Then bulbs went more energy efficient and dimming became commonplace with a single filament and better control of light. So socket design changed to accommodate this and were cheaper to produce. Even now though, sockets for 3 way bulbs are far less common as it's just not necessary. Why buy a more expensive socket and bulb when for the same price i can get a wifi controlled dimmer?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a major hardware retailer for several years(not the orange one). I remember when people were freaking about about us getting rid of the old incandescent bulbs. &quot;I want some of them non-Obama light bulbs.&quot; Lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was resistant at first, but not because of Obama. The first round of bulbs were horrible as far as the light they emitted. So hard, made the room look like a warehouse. I like the soft light of the incans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked in a hardware store when I was in high school. Probably one of the most helpful experiences of my life. I can still walk into any hardware store and pretty quickly find exactly what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>And I know all of the products (really hasn't changed much in 20 years) they sell, so I know what I have available when I'm working on a project. I kind of miss working there, tbh.</p>
<p>++ for the hardware store employees!</p></div>		</li>
