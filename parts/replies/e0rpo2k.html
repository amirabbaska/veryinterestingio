			<div class="markdown"><p>Moon pulling the water more or less is not the cause of tides. It's a common misconception that it is. The difference in the moons gravitational pull is only 1/10 000 000 of 1G on opposite sides of Earth.</p>
<p>Here's a good explanation of how tides really form:</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was coming to share this link, so take my upvote. Most of the other explanations given outide this one are baloney. The moon doesn't 'pull' the Earth closer and leave the water on the far side behind. :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I like to explain this as the &quot;second&quot; tide being &quot;low Earth&quot; rather than &quot;high water&quot;.</p>
<p>You'd be surprised how many physics students get stumped on this, because they never considered it, and I have never heard of any young students question their teacher when taught about the tide in school.</p>
<p>I've started encouraging middle school kids to ask their teachers this question, and apparently it's very rare for the teacher to realize it's the case, let alone be able to explain it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This concept of “low earth” causing high tide on the opposite side of the earth from the moon is being described in several comments. My understanding is the moon pulls water away from the earth causing high tide and low tide elsewhere, the moon also pulls the earth. What I’m having trouble grasping is how the water on the low earth side stays in the same place. Like how is the earth pulled away from the water and the water doesn’t just follow it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the moon pulling the water away from earth isn't really what happens. Or, it does happen, but it's so microscopic in effect that you can't notice it (which is why there's no tides in lakes, only in the ocean). But to answer your question let's pretend for a second that it <em>was</em> noticeable.</p>
<p>The important part about the moon's gravity isn't that it pulls on the water, but that that there's a <em>difference</em>. Consider this diagram of three points of the earth and the gravity it's experiencing from the moon:</p>
<pre><code>moon        &lt;---(  &lt;--*   &lt;-)</code></pre>
<p>The side closest to the moon is pulled more than the center, which is again pulled more than the far side. Now consider what this looks like from the point of reference of the center of the earth:</p>
<pre><code>moon          &lt;-(     *     )-&gt;</code></pre>
<p>It looks like there's a force pushing both sides of the earth away from the middle.</p>
<p>And this is what would cause the bulging if the difference in gravity was strong enough. However, gravity affects all objects the same way, so if this was the case we would see tides not just in the ocean, but in everything; lakes, dirt, sand, rocks etc. However, the moon's tides aren't anywhere strong enough to make this noticeable. The real reason we get tides in the ocean is because of the points not on the moon-earth line. They all get pushed towards that line to some degree; the north pole gets pushed south, the south pole get pushed north, the sides of the earth not on the line get pushed inwards etc. It's all this pushing inwards on all of the ocean <em>except</em> the points on the earth-moon line that causes the tides. All the tiny tidal forces get combined to &quot;squeeze&quot; the water out on that line. This only happens in the ocean because water is liquid and allows those forces to be transferred, which is why you don't see it anywhere else on earth.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It does, just like the Earth follows the water which is being pulled. What matters is the <em>net pull difference</em>, and that's roughly the same on either side of the Earth: On one side the water is being pulled less towards the Earth because the moon is pulling the water more, on the other side the water <em>isn't being</em> pulled as much as the Earth is.</p>
<p>The Earth itself is in accelerated motion, remember.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earth itself flexes a tiny amount (~30 cm) compared to the change in water level on the opposite side of the moon. As I understand it, you've been explaining it wrong (flashback to my HS science teachers claiming the sky is blue because of light reflected from the ocean).</p>
<p>The simple (probably not quite correct) way to explain it is that both bulges result from the same thing - <em>differences</em> in gravitational force depending on distance from the moon. On the &quot;first&quot; side, near water is pulled more strongly than far water. On the opposite side, far water is pulled less strongly than near water.</p>
