			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever flown through heavy clouds during the day, you'll see that clouds that appear gray from the ground look as fluffy and white as any other cloud from above. This is especially evident when flying past cumulonimbus clouds, since the sunlit side is shiny white, and the shaded side is dark gray.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably due to the fact that when you're flying above the cloud, you're seeing it from the same side as the light source. From the ground, the light has to pass through the cloud. Some of the light is absorbed, lost, refracted or whatever while passing through the cloud, which would explain the difference in apparent colour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this also why dark matter has more gravity? The greater the mass, the more light it absorbs?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark matter doesn't have more gravity, it has exactly as much gravity as you would expect, given it's mass. And it doesn't absorb light either, it's actually completely transparent. (The name is something of a misnomer.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of the light is scattered back into space, while only a tiny amount is absorbed. Clouds are opaque because of their random structure, which causes multiple scattering. If you take all of the water molecules in a cloud and condense them into a cohesive liquid, it's clear.</p></div>		</li>
