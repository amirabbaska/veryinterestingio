changed as showing there's been no biological change.  As other have pointed out, there have been changes to human physiology, especially around digestion of foodstuffs from out change from hunter gatherer to pastoral lifestyles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I clicked on this reddit article hoping to read something about what I suspect in retrospect is flat impossible to know: given that during the time period human beings started congregating in increasingly denser cities and were therefore also implicitly subject increasingly to the rule of law, were there significant changes in the brain during the period? Since the changes I am thinking of could have been more about chemistry than anything else, I can't say I expected much, but I'm still curious. Other than the things already written in the thread about farming, and the lower jaw, diet, etc, which I expected to see, it's the one other thing I think would likely have significantly changed during the time period.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer your question because, as you mention, we have practically no evidence regarding brain chemistry and structure in our ancestors. In fact we have only begun understanding the human brain in its current form.</p>
<p>However, let me point out the following observations. Firstly, the human brain is incredibly plastic. Even with identical genetics, we know that the brain remodels extensively to cope with its environment (life experiences, toxins, trauma, etc.). This phenomenon has such intense repercussions on brain structure and function that it likely trumps any change caused by societal norms. In other words, the brains of individuals from two different upbringings today probably differ just as much as the brains of individuals from two different eras.</p>
<p>As for brain chemistry, it is interesting to speculate that durable change has occurred. Perhaps it has, and the people of today have slightly more sensitive Acetylcholine receptors, just to cite an example. However, small changes in brain chemistry can have disastrous effects on a person's function. Why would there be evolutionary pressure to change brain chemistry when the brain is sufficiently flexible thanks to its structural remodeling?</p>
<p>The line of questioning you brought up is very interesting and deserves to be addressed. I am in no way an expert in evolutionary neuroscience but I hope these ideas can stimulate your questioning.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well, so are dogs. That doesn't mean that a German Shepherd and a dachshund haven't diverged in any meaningful ways. </p></div>		</li>

<p>... are certainly the same species. After hundreds of thousands of years of them no longer breeding with each other, and the accompanying genetic shifts, you could call them difference species. Humans are not even close to as differentiated and haven't been around long enough to speciate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my point. Divergent evolution can occur within a species and still be sexually compatible (aka the same species). </p></div>		</li>
