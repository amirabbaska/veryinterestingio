			<div class="markdown"><p>So, one vote per person can only be placed on election day? There are States in the US that allow people to submit their weeks ahead of time. It doesn't seem right to me. We talk about an &quot;October Surprise&quot; in the US where some damaging revelation is made public right before the election. If someone already placed their vote early then they can't change. On the other hand, politics are so polarized along 2 party lines here, I'm not sure that very many people would actually change their mind.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Formally correct, but the person that has a procuration for someone else (this is my case, voting for a friend) basically votes twice - once signs his name for himself, and a second time for the other voter.</p>
<p>Some notes : one voter can only have ONE procuration, except when the person giving the vote is outside of France. In this case you can have 2 procurations at maximum : one for someone in France, the other for someone outside the country. You can't have more. </p>
<p>The person that has the procuration HAS to vote in the electoral bureau of the person that was supposed to vote. If person A gave person B his/her vote, person B is supposed to go to person A's bureau to be able to vote. </p>
<p>There, he will vote normally (anouncing he has the &quot;procuration&quot;, from latin btw), and sign his name in the register that indicates he has the right to vote for said person. Obviously they check before you vote.</p>
<p>Some highlight about the procedure : </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>enter the bureau, show ID and voter card and then take at least 2 &quot;bulletins&quot; and one enveloppe (normalized paper slips on which there is the name of the person you vote for) so that the voting is still secret - if you were to take less than two, we could deduce your preference trivially obviously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>get to the voting booth and insert one slip in the enveloppe. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>get out of the voting booth and head for the voting box (no idea, lazy to search). Show ID, voter card. They take both. They check you on the register. They hold it while you put your vote above the box ready to drop it. On confirming you are a legit voter (3 people manage this part, one handling the box, one the credentials, one the register). The box guys opens the slits with a mechanical switch, you drop your enveloppe, and he says &quot;a vot√©&quot; (&quot;has voted&quot;).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>THEN you sign the register under your name (controlled with a mechanical thing so that you can't mess up the section, usually a transparent plastic thingy to protect other rows), you are given your voter card that is now stamped for this round, and your ID.</p>
</li>
<li>you exit the polling station.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any enveloppe that has defects : two slips, any markings, writing, etc is deemed &quot;void&quot; (&quot;nul&quot;, like &quot;null&quot; in IT) and counts nothing. </p>
<p>Blank votes (empty enveloppe) count for nothing.</p>
<p>The result is simply the number of valid, expressed votes.</p>
<p>EDIT : in total, AFAIK, a minimum of 4 staff is needed to manage a bureau. 1 up front, and 3 for the box and voting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The method of voting is also different. You get slips of paper, each with the name of a candidate, and an envelope. You put the slip of paper with the name of the person you want to vote for in the envelope, and then you have to sign your name in the registry and drop the envelope in the voting box. The votes are then counted by hand. </p>
<p>Everyone also receives by mail instructions on when, where, and how to vote; extra copies of the slips; and a pamphlet from each candidate explaining their views. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Early voting disrupts and minimizes the kind of fraudulent and disingenuous activities that are the subject if this thread. It large measure accomplishes through practical means that which the French attempt to do through legislated prohibition. The inability to sway an election at the last minute with an &quot;October Surprise&quot; is a positive for democracy, not a negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US state of Oregon has 100% vote by mail. It not only increases participation but has proven extremely resistant to corruption and other negative influences. It is probably the most fair, and least corruptable system of any of the US States. It does however rely on an impeccable and unimpeachable mail system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The state of Washington does as well. I've only ever lived in both Oregon and Washington in my life and have not once ever physically gone out and voted. I just moved to California though, so maybe I will.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>France has proxy vote: you can name someone who will then be allowed to vote for you. They have to be from the same city and must show their ID. The polling station must have a record of it for the proxy vote to be accepted (ie. if done at the last minute, it might not work).</p></div>		</li>
