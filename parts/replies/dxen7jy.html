			<div class="markdown"><p>I should have realized that was counter-intuitive and explained more, good question!</p>
<p>At lower regions I suspect that corresponds to a lower density, I'm not sure (the alternative is that air is moving in from other locations at the same altitude as much as it's pushing up into higher altitudes) but whatever is happening down below the effect at upper levels (as in, the area we classify as &quot;space&quot;) is that the air pushing upwards increases the density at that region.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you saying that since it's heated, the atmosphere expands, so at a given point P high up in altitude, where there might have been no air previously, there is now some air, hence we can say it's now denser at that particular point P, relatively speaking?</p></div>		</li>
