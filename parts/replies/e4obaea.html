			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just involved in characterising them. They grow in seawater, especially on plastics and polymers in seawater. Strange little beasties. I think the genome is released (or will be soon), and they have dozens of duplicate enzymes for some simple tasks (like cleaving sulphur bonds) but will only have a couple copies of each, because they need them to break down the complex polymers. Needless to say, metabolism and growth are slow.</p></div>		</li>
