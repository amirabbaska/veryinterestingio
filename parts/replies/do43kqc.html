<p>Essentially, this is because English spelling rules are a mess. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd add that there's a distinction to be made here between two different ideas of &quot;rules.&quot;</p>
<p>There are the &quot;rules&quot; baked into the language. In English these are complicated because of how different languages (and languages from different families) are combined within English - caused by the waves of invaders over hundreds of years, who each brought their own language that got combined with everybody on the island - rather than a gradual ebb and flow of population through overland migration. People who come by boat can come more abruptly and come from farther away than people who walk over.</p>
<p>And it's also because of how much the language of origin of words matters in English. We have more plurality of language of origin in our history than most other languages. And English continues to carries shades of meaning from this - people learn it without knowing they learn it.</p>
<p>Then there are the &quot;rules&quot; of institutions - like national academies or printers' associations looking to conduct spelling reform. </p>
<p>The job of these bodies is harder or easier depending on how much people would be asked to depart from what they are used to in order to adopt consistent rules. It's not just a simple matter of authority - it's about who listens.</p>
<p>A big part of why the English attempt at a national language academy concurrent with the French and Italian language academies failed is that they did not understand the English language well enough to make rules for it that matched the information it was carrying out - and so people rejected and did not use a lot of their suggestions. And, missing the opportunity to get in on literacy on the ground floor, there's a lot of inertia to fight.</p>
<p>If the contention is that no governing body has launched a major spelling reform in English since the onset of printing, that would be false.</p>
<p>If the contention is that no governing body has sorted out a comprehensive spelling reform that English-speaking people at large have actually adopted, that would be more accurate.</p>
<p>And it also follows that there is no single nationalistic central political entity in the English-speaking world with the authority to tell people how to spell things. That's why we are more dependent on coming up with changes that people adopt voluntarily. And so spelling improvements happen, but it is piecemeal and slow.</p>
<p>This is not true of places like France or Italy which have longstanding language academies and more history with absolute, centralized forms of government.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, this is an oft-repeated myth, but the truth is a lot more subtle. English is not much more of a &quot;mongrel tongue&quot; than other European languages (even French, which likes to consider itself pure, is full of Celtic and Germanic influences).</p>
<p>There are a few rare cases where spelling was tweaked to reflect its etymology -- an example is &quot;debt&quot;, which was originally spelled &quot;dette&quot; until some well-meaning academics decided to add a &quot;b&quot; to reflect the Latin &quot;debitum&quot; -- but this isn't the norm.</p>
<p>The influence of non-Germanic languages on English is surprisingly limited. Norman French in particular only really added some vocabulary relating to the things the Norman French were in charge of: jurisprudence, the military, government and royalty for the most part. And those words have been, for the most part, fully anglicised (e.g. Old French &quot;jugier&quot; became English &quot;to judge&quot;) as far as both spelling and pronunciation go, because they were introduced into the language long before printing.</p>
<p>The myth that English has &quot;more plurality of language of origin&quot;, as you put it, than most other languages is usually supported by statistics that show that, for example, considerably more than 50% (some say as high as 75%) of our words are not Germanic in origin. This number is arrived at by simply counting the words in the dictionary, but this gives a false impression. Most of the non-Germanic words are recent borrowings from Latin or Greek (or even, in the case of Frankenstein words like &quot;television&quot;, both) coined in modern times, especially technical jargon used in fields like medicine, chemistry, technology, etc. And those words exist in other European languages as well, for example:</p>

<p>In fact, if you look at the way we talk <em>normally</em>, English is overwhelmingly <em>Germanic</em>. (I have italicised all the non-Germanic words in that sentence.)</p>
<p>On the subject of a language academy, that's not what I meant at all. Bodies like the Académie Française actually have much less influence than they like to think, and actually they try to act as a brake on language evolution. This is one reason French spelling is also a horrible mess.</p>
<p>I don't actually know of any body that made a serious attempt to regulate the language as such, but there are authorities that have had an influence. Noah Webster is one, which is why American spellings sometimes differ from British spellings.</p>
<p>An example would be the German language. In this case, it's really just a style guide drawn up and occasionally revised on behalf of the state Culture Ministries (because they are in charge of school curricula) and used by central government. Media outlets and publishing houses then usually base their style guides heavily on that one, but they don't have to. In fact, the last spelling reform in 1996 has had to be revised a couple of times, in part because publishers refused to adopt some of the more obscure new rules.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>It's simply too late for a reasonable spelling reform because English is so widespread and has so many different variants, it would be virtually impossible. For example, although most people rhyme &quot;shone&quot; with &quot;gone&quot;, there are many who rhyme it with &quot;bone&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, I get your points, but I think you're overselling your case. Yes, I know that &quot;normal&quot; speech in English leans more Germanic, but that carries with it a pretty charged idea about what &quot;normal&quot; is that is pegged to certain times and places.</p>
<p>It definitely wouldn't say it's an &quot;oft-repeated myth&quot; that the invasions and conquests transformed English with large and disruptive infusions of new words and usage that continue to cause trouble today. It's absolutely true - you just have specific priorities you are judging more important than others - namely, you prioritize the words used often every day. More than a hundred or so years ago, that isn't the way writers would have thought about it at all (which as I mentioned is I think why past bodies like this have had trouble - but you go into that even more anyway). </p>
<p>One thing that is true in America is that the use of German-origin versus French/Latinate-origin words in common parlance - rather than the former being dominant and the latter being nigh-non-existent0 - is that they are historically used as signifiers of level of education and social class.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Origin - French</p>
<p>Versus - Latinate</p>
<p>Common - Latinate</p>
<p>Parlance - French</p>
<p>Historically - Latinate</p>
<p>Use - French</p>
<p>Signifier - French</p>
<p>Level - French</p>
<p>Education - French</p>
<p>Social - French</p>
<p>Class - French</p>
<p>Once you get comfortable with it, you can switch back and forth between writing, at least, in relatively more French/Latinate or relatively more Anglo-Saxon/Germanic pretty easily. They trained us in it before we started our Freshmen year at college. We all got an intro booklet and were expected to study it before writing our first papers.</p>
<p>Now, might there be a case for killing all the intelligentsia, reverting to the language of the people (&quot;people&quot; of course, being French, so &quot;folk&quot; would be more appropriate), and recognizing the French influence in English as minor and illegitimate corruption to our pure German origin? I've definitely heard it, but it tends to get tied up in ethnocentric arguments about Germany that exploit this kind of conversation for political ends and aren't really strictly considering the language as observed and read. And I think going as far as to see the French roots in the language as insignificant might be getting caught up a bit in the gravity well of that way of thinking - muscular, masculine, working class, kind of fascist.</p>
<p>I mean, just the words for food that people use every day show that the influence of French on the language isn't nearly as narrow as you say it is.</p>
<p>Now, is that <em>Norman</em> French, that precedes the conquest? I don't know - a word like &quot;beef&quot; wasn't used in English until 200 years after the William the Conqueror. But that's more thinking like the Old Norse words on law - where if it came in it came in at the beginning, and not from a sustained interaction between the two languages in the same place. The French influence is broader, I think. But here my study is getting a little rusty.</p>
<p>The difference is that in English speaking with too many French origin words tends to sound pretentious and inauthentic. German origin words are seen as popular and punchy and real. </p>
<p>So, there is both a class distinction and a fashion distinction to add to the historical distinction.</p>
<p>But this goes back to the idea of what you think of as <em>normal</em>, which tends to carry with it a lot of editorializing regardless of who is saying it, rather than what would be comprehensive or schematic.</p></div>		</li>
