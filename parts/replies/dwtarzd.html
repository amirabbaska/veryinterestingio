			<div class="markdown"><p>No... none of that. Metals are electropositive, that is, they want to give up electrons. Metal ions are positive, but the container is not made out of ions, it's made out of neutral metal. The electrons in the metal would be attracted to the water, not the other way around. The oxygen in water is far more electronegative, or electron withdrawing, than any metal.</p>
<p>Further, water is already very polar and would not have a partial overall charge, but a dipole with charge separation between two different sides. What you're describing is an induced dipole, which happens with non-polar molecules and not ones with existing dipoles. And an induced dipole would mean two poles, i.e. a positive side and a negative side, not an overall positive charge. Also, any water that was interacting with the container would cease to be affected by it once the water is removed by someone drinking it. </p>
<p>The only way the taste would be affected would be if some contaminant becomes dissolved in the water. Water doesn't have any memory of what happened in the container, and no &quot;positive water&quot; is being produced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What if Oxygen really is frustrated with Electron, and feel that Electron has gotten really negative lately, and that is really time for Oxygen to move on, and maybe find someone else, someone more like her.  Why can't Oxygen be happy?  Oxygen deserves to be O2.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some contaminant. I couldn't tell you what that is without testing the water, but I would imagine it's either leeched from the container (metal most likely, or possibly some kind of coating) or a byproduct of bottling from the company who sells it. Water is good at leeching materials, especially the more pure it is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect. Water doesn’t just lose electrons to the metal of the container.</p>
<p>What OP is most likely tasting is actual trace iron or copper in the water. A lot of drinking water travels through steel pipes before it reaches someone’s house and often goes through copper pipes inside the house (although some new houses don’t use metal pipes anymore). Iron and copper ions leach into the water as it flows through the pipes, which you can taste when compared to distilled water. This is where the vast majority of the metallic taste would come from.</p>
<p>A minor source of metal ions in the water is the container itself. Most drinking water has chloride ions in it for taste. These react with the iron in stainless steel to yield ferric chloride in trace amounts, which is soluble in water. This mixes with the water and exists in equilibrium as an ionic compound and as separate ions. When the iron exists as its own ion, that will contribute (although barely, by several orders of magnitude) to the total metal ions you can taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, I don't buy that either.</p>
<p>I used to have some metal cups where this was quite noticeable if you drank out of them.  But if you put a straw in them and drank out of that, it tasted normal. </p>
<p>There is some sort of reaction between the metal in the cup and your mouth that's going on, possibly using the water as a conduit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take the same water, put half in a plastic cup and half in a stainless steel cup and drink them both, the water in the stainless steel cup tastes metallic.  If trace iron or copper is causing the metallic taste, both cups would taste metallic, but they don't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, I was drinking from a refrigerated mason jar filled with water. The condensation that accumulated from the metal lid trickled a bit into the jar, so when I tasted that it was strongly metallic, and there was a trace taste of metal in the jar full of water itself. Otherwise, The water came from a dispenser that gives out gallons of treated Reverse Osmosis water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is still the same. You're tasting some metallic salt. I don't know exactly which one, but ferric chloride makes sense.</p></div>		</li>
