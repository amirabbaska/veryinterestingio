			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much the cell death by itself, but the inflammation reaction in response to that, that hurts.</p>
<p>That inflammation causes the swelling and redness by increasing blood flow, and it causes defensive cells to release chemicals to activate other defensive cells and make the pain nerves fire.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Inflammation, in addition to the burn is as bad as the burn itself.  Swelling, pain, more heat, impaired functioning are just a few of the issues. Excessive inflammation is like if you called 911 for a stovetop fire and then 19 fire trucks quickly piled up outside. It makes everything worse.  This is also why NSAIDS help sunburn pain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Partly, but that area of skin also loses its ability to keep your heat in, as well as water. It's just like a burn from a fire, if a sunburn is over a large enough area dehydration becomes a very serious issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The timing of radiation dermatitis (both UV and ionizing radiotherapy) is based on the physiological characteristics of skin. Skin reaction is delayed by a few hours after a radiation exposure, and may not reach its peak for days-to-weeks, so you don't know how badly burned you are until well after the initial radiation dose.</p>
<p>The exact etiology of radiation dermatitis depends on the severity of the radiation exposure.</p>
<hr />
<p>A grade-1 (&quot;first degree&quot;) sunburn / radiation dermatitis has skin redness but no skin peeling. This is an inflammatory effect and not a cytotoxic effect. Cells don't necessarily have to die, they merely have to take enough damage to provoke a DNA damage response.</p>
<p>As part of their response to DNA damage, endothelial cells and immune cells secrete inflammatory molecules such as nitric oxide, histamine, and prostaglandins. It's these inflammatory signaling molecules that are responsible for redness and pain.</p>
<p>It takes a few hours for irradiated cells to trigger the inflammatory response, and that is why you don't feel a sunburn right away.</p>
<hr />
<p>A grade-2 or grade-3 sunburn / radiation dermatitis includes early erythema and delayed skin peeling. Skin peeling (desquamation) is caused by depopulation of the epidermal keratinized epithelium, and typically peaks around 14 days after the radiation dose.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that much of your skin is fully keratinized, dead skin cells. Radiation exposure cannot kill the already-dead cells in the outer layers of epidermis. It can only kill the living cells in the basal layer of the epidermis. The keratinized layers of skin will remain intact for its normal duration of approximately 14 days, after which they are naturally shed.</p>
<p>Smaller radiation doses don't produce skin peeling because the basal layer fully recovers in less than 14 days. By the time the old keratinized cells fall off, you've already re-started production of new keratinized cells.</p>
<p>Larger radiation doses kill enough of the basal cells that they cannot fully recover in 14 days. So the old keratinized cells fall off and there is nothing to replace them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would you explain when you can feel the sunburn as it happens? Or would that just be pain from the heat itself?  </p>
<p>Just curious as I have felt it when I'm in the sun too much and when I'll end up with a visible sunburn later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't feel radiation exposure at all. When you feel &quot;burnt&quot; during an acute sun exposure there are one of two things happening,</p>
<p>1) you're feeling actual warmth (temperature) from the sun
2) you've been out in the sun for greater than an hour, so it's long enough for <em>some</em> inflammatory changes to occur</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been told that you can tell how severe the sunburn is by pressing a finger on the effected area. If the skin returns to redness almost immediately the burn is not severe, and if it stays skin-colored then the burn is severe. Is there any truth to this and what is the cause of this phenomenon? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gotten sunburnt a few times and experienced peeling, but it never occurred as long as 14 days after the incident. I almost always had peeling within two or three days of getting the sunburn and was fully healed by the time 7-9 days had passed. Would this be indicative of a high rate of skin production? Just how unusual is this? Or is this still within the normal range?</p></div>		</li>
