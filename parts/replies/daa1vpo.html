			<div class="markdown"><p>Good explanation and pretty forthcoming about 'points of contention'</p>
<p>Only thing I'll add is that we know that, in males (and presumably in females) arousal is associated with the parasympathetic nervous system, whereas orgasm is associated with sympathetic stimulation. Hence, sex and orgasm are a complex chemical interplay between two systems which are in competition by definition. This is a big part of why we don't know exactly what triggers it, and why it is easier or quicker for some rather than others. Lots of chemicals have to be released in exactly the right proportions or it simply doesn't happen.</p>
<p>This is why lots of drugs have 'sexual side effects' - and those side effects are almost always difficulty obtaining an erection <em>or</em> having a proper orgasm (there are drugs which cause, for example, ejaculation into the bladder, along with tons of drugs that make achieving orgasm difficult, or achieving erection difficult)</p>
<p>To <em>directly</em> answer the OPs question - orgasm is preceded directly by a release of sympathetic neurotransmitters, which send signals to the associated muscles, producing rhythmic contraction, pleasure, and ejaculation. However this answer is like giving you a list of all the parts that go in a car and expecting you to understand how they fit together.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure the autonomic nervous system can be explained to a literal five year old, however, that's not the directive of this subreddit. Rather, we are asked to simplify our explanations and limit the use of esoteric terminology - which I can attempt.</p>
<p>Our bodies are made up of chemicals, and most / all chemicals in our body act, among other things, as 'signals' - they are what fundamentally tells our bodies what to do, where, when, and for how long.</p>
<p>There are a handful of these chemicals that are utilized by our body to operate things we are not consciously in control of, like our heart rate, our blood pressure, etc - this is our autonomic nervous system. We divide it up into sympathetic signals, and parasympathetic signals. Commonly, sympathetic events are grouped under 'fight or flight' type reflexes, whereas parasympathetic reflexes are 'rest and digest' - Though these systems are <em>always</em> present and active in your body regardless of your external state. They remain in a critical and complex balance. Shifts in the balance are what earn the nicknames of rest and digest / fight or flight. The signaling molecules have some familiar names like epinephrine (adrenaline), and some that may be less familiar like acetylcholine. </p></div>		</li>
