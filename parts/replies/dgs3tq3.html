			<div class="markdown"><p>Very few people say humans don't impact the climate.  There is just a gray area of people who do not believe the issue is as severe as others. This is true across all political spectrums.  It also doesn't explain the alarmists/scare mongers who claim obscene results if things don't change drastically and quickly.   Both sides exist in government and in the debate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is just one <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/04/public-views-on-climate-change-and-climate-scientists/" target="_blank">source</a>, but it's about 40%. ~17% don't think it's happening at all.</p>
<p>I'm not sure i would consider those very few.</p>

This from above, but:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would have crushed our economy while favoring exempt nations like China and India further advancing their economic status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure this is a fair example. The Kyoto protocol is one of the few that actually got passed, but it's not a representative example of climate agreements.</p>
<p>The China/India being exempt line in particular is misleading, considering China has been doing quite a bit in terms to combat climate change- it's not at all obvious that china would just take advantage of things.</p>
<p>And &quot;crushing&quot; our economy is an extremely loaded term (especially with no numbers). There are a lot of economists who believe it would be possible to fight climate change without a large negative impact on the economy, although i wouldn't call it a consensus. The devastating to our economy piece is considered common wisdom, but it's not as trivially obvious as it looks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Functional solution&quot; what does that even look like if you think the whole thing is overblown crying wolf to begin with? </p>
<p>As to the latter part I would say that claiming it doesn't exist is the laymans way of saying it doesn't exist to a sufficient extent. Most people don't deal with numbers and stats, they just want yes or no positions without the gray.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Bill Clinton signed the protocol, but the President doesn't have the authority to force the nation to do such things, it required a vote in Congress. After Clinton left office there was a movement in the Senate to refuse the Kyto Protocol from taking place. A resolution passed in the Senate unanimously to prevent it citing major economic harm if the United States actually went through with it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Correction: your timing is off. The Senate <strong>unanimously</strong> passed a resolution <em>before</em> signing, stating that they wouldn't approve Kyoto. It had nothing to do with Clinton leaving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I take issue with in your comment is that, &quot;costly changes... harm businesses, jobs, employment and global trade.&quot;</p>
<p>By definition costly changes become <em>part of the economy</em>. Costly changes <em>are</em> businesses, jobs, employment and global trade.  </p></div>		</li>
