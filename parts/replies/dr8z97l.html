			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, two reasons. First you can’t get a complete coat of water to create a circuit when the insulator has groves like that because the shape doesn’t allow it. With a straight rod a coat of water could exist enough to create a short.</p>
<p>The groves also add to what is called creepage distance. Creepage is the distance from one end of the insulator to the other following the grooves in and out. The greater the creepage distance the more dirt buildup will need to occur before there is enough to create a problem. If you used a straight section there would be no grooves to follow and the creepage distance would simply be the distance from one end of the insulator to the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gentlemen who responded to you is correct. An example of the problems with “straight rods” are actually the non conductive sticks lineman use to work on energized lines. Too much rain can lead to a minor zap from lines. It’s not fun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the insulator was somehow covered by a continuous film of water, the shortest path the electricity has to travel through the water is many times larger with the groves than without them. This means more resistance and less probability of short circuit.</p></div>		</li>
