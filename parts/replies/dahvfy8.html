			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, in safety engineering the human factor is an important influence. See <a href="http://ehstoday.com/human-factor-safety" target="_blank">http://ehstoday.com/human-factor-safety</a> or also the books of Nancy Leveson regarding human behaviour in safety critical systems. Human errors and unsafe behaviour are reality and have to be considered in safety analysis and design of safety critical systems. Performance of staff and correct reactions and following of procedures have to be monitored and corrected if deviations are rising.</p>
<p>In fact in safety engineering errors are sometimes divided in &quot;systematic&quot; and &quot;random&quot; errors. Random errors are hardware failures based on aging or environmental factors. Systematic errors are design, manufacturing or maintenance errors, e.g. also based on unsafe human behaviour.</p>
<p>Based on this observation and considering that a hazard like in Chernobyl would cause 6% of Switzerland to be a restricted exclusion zone I can understand such discussions.</p>
<p>This is not meant as an argument for or against nuclear energy, but failures can and will happen. Currently in many domains the rate of acceptable risks is decided by domain experts. I'm in favour of including &quot;normal&quot; humans in the discussion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK, so where do you draw the line on human behaviour? From what I can see the Chernobyl experimenters were acting outside the plant procedures. They went rogue, doing things they had no authority to do.  The explosion was caused because of a failure to correctly manage staff rather than a problem with the reactor design. Having said that I am aware the reactors were not well-designed but that in itself did not cause the explosion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why there is a huge push in operator training to be hands off as long as possible after the transient begins. The vast majority of screwups are people trying to jump in and be a hero. The plant is designed to automatically take care of itself for a fair chunk of time, let it do its thing and take the time to watch it and evaluate what the problem is so you can get in the right procedures for dealing with it.</p>
<p>The only two things in nuclear power that require a &quot;fast&quot; response, are if a reactor scram is needed and failed to occur, or if core thermal-hydraulic instabilities are in progress. Those two things need a single immediate operator action (manual scram or boron injection). </p>
<p>But for everything else, we don't let anyone touch any reactor controls until a full scram report is complete. It takes a few minutes and slows everyone down, but you don't need to jump on it and make a mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My metalwork lecturer basically says all accidents are caused by someone, just because they didn't mean for the result doesn't mean they aren't to blame. So if I am making something and the machine I am using explodes, either I used it wrong in someway or it wasn't maintained or built properly. At some point someone fucked up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>People always ignore the cost factor, it cost my company 14 billion to build a nuclear plant.  It only cost 1 billion for the equivalent generation from a natural gas plant.  They had to shut down the nuclear project due to cost and build the gas plant.  </p>
<p>They couldn't justify spending 14x the amount to the state board.  As a regulated monopoly we have to go with the cheaper option for our rate payers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct.  Nuclear power generates more power at reduced costs.  It's very reliable, day and night, and very safe.</p>
<p>You seem to be confused as to why I'm offering more perspective on a subreddit for the sake of offering it.  His question is fairly unbiased, whereas your take seems to be rooted deeper.  Which is fine.  Just remember where you are.</p></div>		</li>
