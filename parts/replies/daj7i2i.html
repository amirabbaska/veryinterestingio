			<div class="markdown"><p>All you said is correct, it is however not the primary mechanism that causes random changes in the data rate. The primary mechanism behind changes in the data rate is congestion. When there is a lot of traffic by other internet users going through the same link as your connection, there is packet loss, and the TCP algorithm running on both ends of a connection will reduce the data rate. When there is no packet loss the algorithm increases the data rate again. The traffic along the link you are using is randomly varying, since people go to different webpages, hosted at different locations, at random times.
Failure of links and misconfigurations happen sometimes, but this does not explain why the data rate is changing all the time.</p></div>		</li>
