			<div class="markdown"><p>I loved cereal box toys.  I saved up UPC codes from several months worth of cereal boxes then waited 6 weeks for a Dick Tracy watch radio (<a href="http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luegpsHYCt1qd3fj1o1_500.jpg" target="_blank">http://40.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luegpsHYCt1qd3fj1o1_500.jpg</a>).  Riding my bike listening to the radio from my watch seemed like the most awesome thing on earth to me in 1990.</p></div>		</li>

She told me it had a arrived and a few days later I went over. SHE HAD LOST IT IN THE SPAN OF A FEW DAYS. I STILL WANT THAT DAMN BALL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wish they would put a stop to the Box Tops for Education program. My kid is in kindergarten and the teachers and the principal encourage the kids to bring the Box Tops in, and they get rewards if they bring them, so essentially, General Foods has the teachers working as corporate shills to train kids to eat their crappy cereal. The school gets ten cents per coupon, so in order for the school to get ten dollars, General Foods gets to sell one hundred boxes of cereal. Why the fuck do they get to do this? The dime per box is a pittance.</p>
<p>What I really don't like about it is that I have to tell my kid that the teacher is wrong about something and that Box Tops for Education is bullshit marketing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Campbell's did the same thing with soup labels when I was a kid. I don't know of anyone who went out of their way to do this as there were already plenty of school charity events going on. A lot of people buy and eat cereal. Most people aren't dumb enough to buy a hundred boxes of cereal for this, but conscientious parents might not simply throw the box in the trash before grabbing that box top. Motivations be damned, our schools need all the help they can get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Healthy&quot; is defined by how the food you eat balances out with the rest of the foods you eat. Most foods, when incentivized, could be eaten in unhealthy quantities. Additionally, things like refined sugar and trans fat should probably never (rarely) be consumed in a healthy diet. If you really want to incentivize children to eat healthier, include toys with frozen vegetable bags. At least vegetables are difficult to over consume, have a healthy dose of fiber, and provide the body with some nutrition that isn't a candy in disguise.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They'll relentlessly plead and assure you they'll eat the vegetables, and 6 months later the vegetable bag will still be in the freezer untouched minus the few peas that fell out when the kid went to remove the toy.</p></div>		</li>
