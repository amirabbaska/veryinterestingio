			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Itâ€™s a job where planning is all based off of guesses, you have to have trust and faith in suppliers and subs, and still end up herding cats and doing adult daycare.
I remember a MGM cartoon (IIRC) that showed a construction project being like an orchestra.  Most jobs are like that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which only seems like a waste to an outsider. They're all working, it's just that most of their jobs aren't physical. </p>
<p>The Project Manager is there so when his fifteen micro-bosses ask him what the fuck happened, he can speak to it directly and not bother his foreman every twelve seconds. </p>
<p>The foreman is there because they know the game plan, and something either has gone wrong or could go wrong, for which their ass is on the line. They have the skills and experience to make on the fly adjustments should things go sideways. </p>
<p>The tradesmen are there to either learn, advise, or be aware of when their own part is going to happen. They may step in to help physically if Junior gets in over his head. </p>
<p>The inspector, or locator is there to liaise with other companies who also own things in the ground. Their job is to make sure things are being done by the book so that if something goes wrong, like hitting a power conduit, or some other unidentified structure, he can verify that everything was done according to standard, and his company is not legally liable for any mishaps that may occur. </p>
<p>Junior, bless his heart, is pretty good at digging holes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is another reason as well that isn't in this answer nor others I've seen. It is very rare for a road to be completely shut down while crews work. This means that often crews have to build temporary roads and paths that they will only be ripping up when they are done. They will also be taking extra care to not burden traffic anymore than they have to. Both of these factors, including the ones above and elsewhere in the thread contribute to the amount of time it takes to finish road work.</p>
<p>When I was a kid there was a big project on an interstate interchange. I was with a group that met with the engineering firm that was running the project. The project was going to take 2.5 years and someone asked why so long. The project manager said if he could shut down the entire interchange, they'd be done in 9 months but that was impractical. So to keep traffic flowing they had to do it in small sections and build a lot of temporary roads all of which takes time</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can I ask you a question that frustrates me substantially?</p>
<p>Is there any justifiable reason why CalTrans decides to shut down large stretches of highway to do their construction work during peak traffic hours, instead of simply doing the construction overnight? </p>
<p>I get that not everyone wants to be working in the middle of the night, but I would think it to be a hell of a lot better than working in 100+ degree temperature, <strong><em>AND</em></strong> it wouldn't completely fuck up the traffic for months at a time.</p>
<p>I've traveled across about a third of the country, and I've seen many other states do this, but I never see CalTrans do this for large projects; I only ever see them do it to send a street-cleaner along the shoulder, which... I mean, sure, do that at night, but if you have to pick one or the other to do during the day I would think that the one that is over in about 5 minutes per mile would be the lesser of the impediment to traffic. </p>
<p>Is this just some stupid bureaucratic bullshit or is there a good reason for this?</p></div>		</li>

<p>They crushed it in under 2 years, where as in IL it would have EASILY taken 5+. People here in CA don't know how good they got it!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly &quot;beauracratic&quot;. I know in SC we have restrictions on the interstate. Can't start to block the road until 7pm and have to be completely off the road at 7am. Sometimes there are variations depending on the necessity of the work. My biggest guess if they are on there during peak hours is that it is an emergency that must be worked on.</p>
<p>Also keep in mind that while nighttime is cooler, it's still hot and you lose a lot of visibility. Even with light plants it is low compared to daylight. Night work is also expensive as you increase equipment brought out, have higher risks and quality costs, and usually have to pay more for labor (Crews to work, supervisors to make sure it is done right, trucks to haul material to and from, and someplace operating to make the material).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Years back when everyone panicked over the state of our bridges, in St Louis our DoT gave us two choices for the highway that ringed the city. Either we do it on a bridge by bridge basis over several years and you have no idea what sections are closed when, or they do it over four years and they shut down a quarter of the ring per year to rip everything up and redo it right.</p>
<p>We voted the smart way, a quarter shut down a year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup and frequently stuff will happen out of your control such as oh a part on one machine broke now have to wait around 2+ hours for it to be fixed or maybe not even for a day. A lot of stuff can't be worked around simply because stuff has to be done in a certain order so any step being stopped or delayed means the next steps have to wait to be started.</p></div>		</li>
