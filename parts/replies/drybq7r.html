			<div class="markdown"><p>As an English tutor (working towards my PhD), I've had to simplify a lot of poetry over the years.  I've found that avoiding the key phrases and explaining the context of them helps more people understand the poet, rather than trying to give exact translations and meanings. Foreign language poems, especially.</p>
<p>Congratulations on your BA; language is awesome!</p></div>		</li>

For example, in Jamaican Patois, &quot;the  higher monkey climb, the more he makes pose&quot;. To the initiate, the words are unintelligible at first. Once the words are heard, then the meaning can be got.</p></div>		</li>
