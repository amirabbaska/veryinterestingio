			<div class="markdown"><p>Well bees for example have 4 wings, as do dragonflies, and they are not always in phase. I just looked around and found this:<br />

<p>It mentions that many insects with 4 wings (forewings and hindwings) have a phase-shift between the fore and hind wings, where it often stays fixed, but dragonflies appear to alter the phase relationship.<br />
There's a little more detail here:<br />

<p>Of course I've jumped the gun a little in my response, because I mainly study the dynamics of human locomotion, and there are certain phase transitions of interest there. Also one of the first kinematic studies of locomotion, in the early 20th century, was done on the many phase transitions that occur in horse gaits. For insects, the phase transitions appear to be far simpler.</p></div>		</li>
