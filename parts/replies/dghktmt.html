			<div class="markdown"><p>And also that a stab wound to the chest definitely doesn't need to hit your heart to be a massively serious thing that will probably kill you in a short time. Like seriously you see it in movies where the characters are like &quot;the shot missed the heart, he'll live&quot; when in reality there's a whole lot of other really sensitive stuff in the chest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reminds me of the movie Ninja Assassin. Old guy in the beginning told a story how he'd survived any attack because they (Ninjas) stabbed him where his heart should be. They are them immediately attacked and the old guy didn't fare as well this time around. Love that movie. Awesome fight sequences. </p></div>		</li>
