			<div class="markdown"><p>At the company I work at they always bring up our cash reserves at sales meetings (usually to send some kind of message about &quot;how well we're doing.&quot;) When they discuss plans for the excess cash, acquisition is always at the top of their list of priorities, usually followed by some type of investment. I'm in the biotech field, so it's not really an equivalent comparison. It seems like highly publicized companies carry much more risk, so their cash on hand has to be proportionally higher. Think of how much money Samsung lost on their exploding battery ordeal. That said, even a Samsung level problem couldn't touch the amount of cash that apple has sitting in reserve (~$18 billion). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a related question: when they say cash reserve, is there actually billions of dollars of cash sitting around somewhere, or is it just assets liquid enough to count as cash?</p></div>		</li>
