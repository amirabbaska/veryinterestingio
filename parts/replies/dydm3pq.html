			<div class="markdown"><p>The elements go by number of protons. 1 is hydrogen, 2 is helium and so on - we discovered all up to 118 and there is no possible gap in between. All of them either exist on Earth or have lifetimes too short to exist on any other planet. Elements beyond 118 should all decay quickly as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, could there be another element somewhere in the universe with, say, 5 protons that is different somehow from... Googling... Boron? Like a different melting point or something? Not sure if this makes sense or not...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We understand nuclear physics. The atomic number increases by 1 at a time in the periodic table. So in that sense, we know them all. </p>
</li>
<li>From which, we know the structures of the electrons and their energy levels. So we can observe them in the lab and also through spectroscopy of astrophysical objects. </li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, there are theoretical elements that have not been observed. Look up island of stability in Wikipedia. Sorry I'm on my phone and cannot link it right now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All light elements have already been discovered here on Earth. We know because an element is defined as the number of protons in the nucleus. So if you've discovered oxygen (atomic number 8) and flourine (9) for example, you can know that nowhere in the universe is there an element between oxygen and flourine because you can't have fractions of a proton.</p>
<p>OK, so all light and stable elements have been found.</p>
<p>Heavy elements have been found to be unstable (radioactive) and the heavier you get, the more energetic events you need to make them in the first place, so the more rare they are <em>besides</em> being radioactive so that they soon enough turn into lighter, discovered elements by themselves. For very heavy elements, &quot;soon&quot; is on the order of microseconds or so.</p>
<p>Uranium is the heaviest naturally occuring element because it has such a long half life for being radioactive. Uranium-238 for example has a half life of 4.5 billion years. Plutonium is even heavier and also occurs naturally in trace amounts of Uranium ore, but from spontaneous neutron absorption from the decaying Uranium.</p>
<p>The heaviest element discovered that have been found to be produced in the universe is Berkelium with atomic number 97. It can only exist for up to around 1000 years though, after which it has decayed. This is the major problem for finding exotic elements on other planets. They won't be there because they decay long before the planet can even form. And even if they wouldn't we'd probably already have discovered them anyway because humans have produced elements probably pretty far beyond what can be produced in supernovas in labs (existing for a fraction of a second).</p>
<p>Unless two things!</p>
<ol>
<li>The planet has sentient beings which can create super heavy elements in labs, like we have done.</li>
<li>They may reside on some super-heavy element <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_of_stability" target="_blank">island of stability</a>, a theorized &quot;island&quot; of extremely heavy elements that theories predict may exist. However even in that case &quot;stability&quot; is relative, and likely not very stable in the common sense, just compared to very short lived radioactive elements.</li>

<p>The total mass was just 2.7 solar masses, it couldn't produce &quot;solar masses of gold&quot;. &quot;Earth masses&quot;?</p></div>		</li>
