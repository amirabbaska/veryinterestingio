<p>Ok. We pay taxes to have those services available to us.</p>

<p>I'd never thought of that. Makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's just hyperbole though. I could say the same about the people inheriting the money. &quot;It's not right for them to profit off the death of a family member&quot;. Inheritance are death profits!</p>
<p>It's not a penalty for dying, not to mention the dead person isn't alive to feel punished in the first place. It's also a drop in the bucket in terms of tax revenue. It makes up something like 1% of Federal revenue.</p>
<p>It's just a tax on money changing hands. That's how lots of taxes work. Inheritance isn't taxed as income so the estate tax is how it's done, and it's incredibly lenient compared to income tax. If inheritance was taxed as income it'd be hitting people much harder.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it's only affecting a small number of people who inherit in the million dollar range, or about 2/1000 households, and there are countless ways around it such as disbursing funds before you die. </p>
<p>The rich, particularly in public service, just like to complain about estate taxes because they would greatly benefit their socioeconomic class by getting rid of it. I don't blame them honestly, because you want what's best for your kids, but at the same time the Estate tax serves as downward pressure on us developing an entrenched aristocracy and reclaims a bit of capital so it can go back into the system and be utilized for good by others with merit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept of a government &quot;profiting&quot; fundamentally doesn't make any sense, particularly when they're not running a surplus anyway. Why should a government not be able to &quot;profit&quot; from someone inheriting money, yet they can &quot;profit&quot; from people working?</p>
<p>When you call taxes &quot;profit&quot;, you're at a very fundamental level claiming that government should not tax at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always thought inheritance tax was slimy.  Why should you work your whole life to build a fortune and not be able to pass it on to your progeny?  You had to pay taxes on the accumulation of wealth and now you're getting taxed again on whatever you had left after you die.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US it only applies to estates worth millions of dollars. I think the cut-off is $5 million.</p>
<p>98% of people don't qualify and never have to pay it. The inheritance tax is intended to be a workaround for some people's habits of hiding large fortunes from taxing authorities and not paying their fair share while they're alive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A useful historical sidebar about how these taxes originated in Common Law countries.  The U.S. legal system (and other Common Law legal systems) were derived from the English legal system.  Property and inheritance taxes were established in England as part of the feudal system.  </p>
<p>Specifically, all land was, notionally, owned by the Crown in perpetuity.  What we conventionally think of as &quot;ownership&quot; of land was in fact a grant of the <em>use</em> of the land from the Crown to the &quot;owner&quot; called a &quot;fief.&quot;  Because land &quot;ownership&quot; was a grant of the use of the land from the Crown, land owners were expected to pay the Crown for that use, which is the origin of the property tax.  Similarly, when the landholder died, because he did not really &quot;own&quot; the land, his inheritors were required to pay an additional tax to the Crown to transfer the grant to a new person (the heir).  Those are the origins, but obviously land ownership gradually became more vested in the &quot;owner&quot; and less contingent over time.</p>
<p>This feudal custom remained in place because people were accustomed to paying taxes in this way, despite the fact that the underlying principle of governmental land ownership does not exist in most modern Common Law countries.  The term &quot;fief&quot; also survives into the modern day in modified form.  For example, full ownership of land is commonly called ownership in &quot;fee simple,&quot; the &quot;fee&quot; in &quot;fee simple&quot; was originally &quot;fief&quot; but contracted to fee over the intervening centuries.  See e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee_simple" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fee_simple</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Not really. If that really were the purpose, both inheritance and estate taxes would be a <em>lot</em> bigger than they are. In practical terms, neither state nor federal taxation does much of <em>anything</em> to accomplish this goal. </p></div>		</li>
