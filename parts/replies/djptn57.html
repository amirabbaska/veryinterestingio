<p>You can do it using the special machine you have which is designed for that specific purpose.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lemon juice. Fresh or from the bottle in the pantry. A good splash onto the palm of your hand and rub into the sweating area after showering and drying off. Works 100%. Google it first to read about slight possibility of stinging or burning, then you have to water it down a bit until you find your sweet spot.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Baking soda works just as well! Mix a half table spoon with a few drops of water. Will leave a clumpy product. Rub that in and off you go. I use it everyday. Bf was so grossed out when I first told him, but since he's seen the results he's a fan! Just make sure to moisturize at night and be cautious when applying just after you've shaved as it can burn a little </p></div>		</li>

Electricity is a luxury in many first world countries as well. Really helped me realize what I take for granted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's fecal matter floating in the air and water everywhere, even in the  soda dispenser in your mall.</p>
<p>Heck, a study a while back said that when you flush your toilet, fecal matter goes airborne and falls on everything around you, even your toothbrush and other toiletries. Terrible news if you share your bathroom with others...</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's exactly why I have the rule in my home that you close the lid before you flush. I'm sure that doesn't make it 100% free, but it sure cuts down on the amount of fecal matter in the air. All the toothbrushes have their own covers for that same reason.
