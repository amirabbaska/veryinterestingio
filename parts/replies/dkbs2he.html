			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading OP's comment I was wondering what electricity and lightning smells like. I have no idea. Where would I usually smell something like that? I know the smell of sparks when they burn something, but that's can't possibly be it, can it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once upon a time I would say hold your hand up to a CRT TV after it's been on for a while. You'll feel some light static shocks. Immediately smell your hand. That's ozone.</p>
<p>Nowadays though... I can't even remember the last time I saw a CRT monitor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember that electricity smell of the old wood-framed box tv my family had. I would touch the screen every time it was turned on because there was so much static, and I'd get my face real close to it sometimes to feel it shock my nose; I'll never forget the way it smelled... I have no idea how to describe it, though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The smell of ozone is pretty nostalgic for me. Every time I smell it, I'm teleported back to the late 90's, when my friends and I would have Lan parties over the weekends.  Five or six crt monitors in a tiny room would fill it with ozone pretty quickly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait what? Isn't it the ozone that reacts with the UV rays and absorbs the Ray and breaks back down to oxygen? Because saying oxygen reacts with UV to creat ozone implies that it's the oxygen in our atmosphere that blocks out the harmful rays and thus the molecule that protects us? I'm confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short version is that different molecules absorb different kinds of UV. </p>
<p>There's a spectrum of ultraviolet light, just like there's a spectrum of visible light. Your red shirt is really good at absorbing not-red light and really bad at absorbing red light, which gets reflected for you to see. O2 is good at absorbing certain UV light, and that light energy is used to form O3. O3 is good at absorbing different, more dangerous kinds of UV light (UV-B, UV-C) which causes it to go back to O2. If there's no ozone layer, none of this is happening at a large enough scale for O3 to build up, so more dangerous UV light gets through to the surface.  </p></div>		</li>
