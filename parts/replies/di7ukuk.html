			<div class="markdown"><p>Id also like to add to this great comment.
I worked in a engineering team for a material supplier and can tell you there is a huge difference when it comes to seam durability and performance. Your name brands will send the materials to tested. We'd  rip wash and stress the seams.  We'd check for  leaks or abrasion.
As a premium supplier we had no requests from your  Wal-Mart target or other savers brands.
So even if your fabric is the same or just an older model the cheaper companies don't get the high grade seam materials or decorative tapes that last.
These brands also secure the supply chain and won't change materials during production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is my expectation when I buy premium brands, that it will wash well. I have a small wardrobe and just try to buy high quality that will last for years.</p>
<p>But I've had some let-downs. With Amour Vert, for example. They really sell themselves as &quot;sustainable fashion&quot;...but you know what? Those $60 knit shirts didn't last a full season, let alone a full year. What a rip off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a little confusing, but I think when companies claim they are &quot;sustainable,&quot; they are referring to their impact on the environment and their employment practices. I don't think they mean their pieces will last longer and/or survive the test of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you can help me understand why premium brands are using 100% acrylic fabric. In my experience, acrylic pills horribly. Is more expensive acrylic less likely to pill? Pilling makes a garment instantly look worn out, so I don't imagine customers being happy about spending $$$ on something that pills. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty spot on from my experience too.</p>
<p>I find clothing a particularly interesting market, in so many cases there is such a large disparity between price and product, but the nature of the business means it will never be any different.</p>
<p>Clothing has become more than just function, so inevitably subjectivity plays such a huge part in what is perceived as quality, that is on top of how every body is different and how everyone wears clothes is different.</p>
<p>There will almost never be complete harmony in opinion on any product because none of it (or so little of it) is really quantifiable. Only in extreme circumstances and niches are there statistics that show what you might call a certain betterness in one product over another.</p>
<p>For example, the lazer racer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZR_Racer" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZR_Racer</a> is a piece of performance clothing that eventually was banned from the olympics for being so functionally successful.</p>
<p>On the flipside, you can buy a garment from a luxury designer, and find that you're not able to wear it more than a few times, and it must be cleaned in very specific ways, but their customers will equally argue that their garments are of utmost quality - of design, creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>In general though I would say if the quality of durability is your main priority, there is a low but steady increase of durability to price. For most people, cheaper supermarket tshirts will last proportionally longer than more expensive products. - The confusion comes when people have preferred fits, or preferences in fabric, then it becomes a matter of personal trying, testing and taste.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have to add my two cents. So, men's white undershirts. I've been looking for nice quality, nice fitting undershirts for years and I've come to the conclusion that the brand is NO indicator whatsoever of the quality you will get.
I wear a size small, I'm not excessively hard on them, some big name companies just make a SHIT product.
Like emporio Armani. The quality used to be good but the shirts were too short and always came untucked. NOW they are a bit longer I've noticed but the cotton is woven SO thin it's almost fragile. After washing just a few times there are holes developing. Seriously?
Calvin Klein undershirts are maybe a little better but they are woven thin as hell too.
I have the feeling that a lot of companies are almost going for a disposable model when it comes to basic stuff like undershirts and socks. No one likes having to bleach armpit stains or the inevitable dirt that gets ground into white socks, so they figure that after a few months of regular use and washing you'd be more likely to throw a cheaper product out and just buy new product.
Now if only the price would drop as much as the quality. </p>
<p>On a side note, can anyone recommend good quality cotton undershirts? I've heard that Costco's store brand is actually surprisingly good but I haven't gotten around to picking any up yet. </p></div>		</li>

<p>r/frugalmalefashion seems to love the undershirts at Target (Mossimo, I think?). I can't speak on this as I haven't been to Target in years but they come highly recommended, in terms of quality for the price. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just got a Mossimo tank top from a thrift store a little while back, and it's quickly become my favorite undershirt. I can wear it on its own since the fabric is sturdy and opaque, but I can also wear it under cardigans and sweaters, <em>and</em> the length makes it perfect for layering. Good to know I can get more of them at Target... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would not recommend Costco brand. I have a hell of a time with white undershirts (too short, neckline too low, neckline too high, too tight in the midsection, etc). Costco's Kirkland brand used to fit well, by somewhere in the last year or so they changed their supplier or their design and now the neck is too high, almost like a turtleneck, and they shrink up in the wash and are uncomfortable...I actually wore them for a month or so and took them back (excellent return policy). The guy at the service desk said he sees a lot of them come back these days. If you're interested, check out the reviews on their website, you'll get a pretty good idea of what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Also Costco sells a Calvin Klein pack of undershirts, which were perfect about 5 years ago. Now the CK shirts are too short, too thin, the lettering on the &quot;tagless&quot; tag falls off after a few washes. I tried to see if it was dependent on whether they were made in Bangledesh, Haiti, or elsewhere but seems like no matter which of their factories makes them, they're horrible. I STILL have not found a good t shirt. Just bought a pack of Hanes yesterday, and the neckline is sooooo bad. Ugh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to understand that Armani and Calvin Klein have a number of diffusion brands that use cheaper materials. Look at these Calvin Klein T shirts: <a href="https://www.ssense.com/en-us/men/product/calvin-klein-collection/white-pelzman-t-shirt/1796823" target="_blank">One</a>, <a href="http://www.pacsun.com/calvin-klein/logo-boxy-t-shirt-0097509390003.html?cgid=calvin-klein-mens&amp;dwvar_0097509390003_color=010&amp;dwvar_0097509390003_size=9300&amp;start=1" target="_blank">Two</a>. The first is going to be made of better materials and construction than the second. The second is essentially just paying for the branding. </p></div>		</li>
