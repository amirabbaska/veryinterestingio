			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't the 1m distance let us stick this pretty solidly in &quot;classical E&amp;M gives us a damn fine approximation to the kinematics of the situation&quot;? So they'd start moving towards each other to start, and it's only once they got closer that QM would poke its head in? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that only for calculating it with a high precision? You're able to say we have a proton and an electron separated by 1m ±1cm with a veloctiy of 0m/s ± 0.01 aren't you? Which fits perfectly within Heisenberg's uncertainty principle ΔxΔp ≥ h. I don't think OP's initial conditions were that strict but given for the sake of an example. If it's an issue say you know the momentum as almost exactly zero with high uncertainty in position and I believe their question remains the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you could know it to within less than a ppm of position and (probably, I didn't do the math) less than 1 ppm of the final momentum they'll achieve as they approach each other.</p></div>		</li>
