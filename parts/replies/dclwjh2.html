			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this excellent example. I have a follow-up question. </p>
<p>Does this expansion apply to matter as well or is it only to space-time? i.e. are atoms, molecules, etc expanding as well (even if it is infinitesimally small) and gradually becoming larger?</p>
<p>Edit: The reason i ask this is because atoms are mostly empty space and that space is part of an expanding universe. This means distance between nucleus and electrons must be increasing thus expanding atoms as well.
I hope the question makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've thought about this before, I think there are two key points as to why the expansion of the universe has no effect on bound states such as atoms and molecules. First, the effects are <em>very</em> small at the scale of atoms. I can't put enough emphasis on the word very. It's almost like asking if you can run faster if you wear a black shirt on a sunny day because the photons bouncing off your back will give you extra momentum. In theory, there should be some contribution, but the scale difference is just too big.</p>
<p>Second, atoms and molecules are bound states. Bound states have quantized energies. If you change try to modify the distance scale, you likely modify the bound state energy which is impossible because energy states are quantized and discrete, not on a continuum. Before quantum mechanics people were puzzled as to why the electron didn't spiral into the nucleus of an atom as the electron was thought to be accelerating around the nucleus, and charged particles accelerating radiate away energy. The answer to this, too, is that energy states are quantized, and an electron must occupy discrete orbitals, and in a naive classical sense this means the distance between a nucleus and electron is fixed, it cannot change. So even if the space expands between the components of atoms and nuclei, bound states remain bound states, energy is quantized; the distance of bonds and orbits them must be fixed, saving all chemistry and biology from the perils of the expansion of the expansion of the universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Only at cosmological scale. It isn't very much even then. I'm not sure of the real numbers, but imagine (for e.g.) it's like 1 kilometer per light year. Something 10 light years away travels an extra 10 km... At some distance away the total added distance is a light year so things that far away will always be too far away to travel that far even at light speed. This is the Hubble bubble and the limit of the knowable universe (even though there is plenty out past it.)</p>
<p>At some time trillions of years from now the Sol system will be the entire knowable universe as the expansion of space compounds on itself..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of the theory of dark energy and an ever accelerating universe expansion is that one of the possible ways that it will end is in what's called the Big Rip. This is where space has expanded so much that atoms and even eventually atomic particles get further apart than their binding forces can overcome, and everything sort of drifts apart.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because everything is moving away from us, and the rate at which this is happening scale with the distance. This is consistent with an expanding universe</p>
<p>This is a simplification, of course, but it gives you the general idea </p></div>		</li>
