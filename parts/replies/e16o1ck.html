			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing you might want to make a note of is how long it takes them to hear you from the time you say something (or vice-versa) if you tend to interrupt eachother. To measure this, you can ask them to make a, say, <em>beep</em> noise when they hear you make one first. Estimate the time it takes for you to hear theirs after you say yours, and divide by two, and that's about how long it takes for them to hear you. Even a small amount can add up: imagine talking to someone in the same room and needing to wait nearly a second before you can respond without interrupting them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happenes all the time when I'm on a conference call in my office and the people sitting next to me are also on the call. There's about a half second delay between the person talking and me hearing them in my headset.</p>
<p>It's pretty damn distracting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone probably already said this but they take the sound waves that are made in both and removes it generally by producing  the same wave with with reversed polarity. (upside down) upward waves are compression waves, while the ones that go downward are rarefaction waves. When you flip the compressions with the rarefactions and play both clips at the same time it'll remove the sound about 95% roughly, usually with some very mild, quiet distortion. It's called active noise canceling. They also have acoustic noise canceling which is about the same process except its removed before it plays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats when the echo cancellation either isn't very good, or when its getting echos of the sound from other places that don't match what its putting out. Either way a very good system should still cancel it no matter the volume, but most leave it at a certain level for delay purposes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>iirc yes, that’s how most active noise cancellation works, in addition to some other processing to the signal </p></div>		</li>
