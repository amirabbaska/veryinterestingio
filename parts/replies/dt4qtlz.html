			<div class="markdown"><p>And let's not forget that dental works in a similar fashion to how you described vision. Except dental usually has a few tiers ranging from &quot;only covers two exams per year but not x rays or fluoride,&quot; and &quot;covers two exams, x rays and fluoride, 75-80% discount on things like cavities and fillings, and some percentage discount on more intensive things like root canals.&quot; But when it comes to crowns, implants, or orthodontia, that's usually not covered. Some policies cover a certain dollar amount if you have dependents under 18. I now see why my parents were adamant about going all out on orthodontia when I was a kid. It was covered up to a certain point, and wanted to make sure it was taken care of before I finished high school. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former &quot;dental hygienist&quot; in the military I'd like to plug that if you regularly floss and brush you will significantly reduce the risk of cavities. Further, if parents have their children's teeth sealed immediately following eruption, and then teach their kids to floss and brush that'll further reduce cavity risk. That will go a long way towards reducing your costs and improving your health (holistic health too, as the mouth/dental health can dramatically improve full body health).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>is flossing even really required? i've heard so much debate about this. as a 30 year old, i could count on one hand the number of times i floss a year (counting on fingers in binary). i've never had a cavity, but i also don't eat a lot of junk food. i brush once a day (normally morning while i shower) and just had a dental checkup doctor mentioned something about 2-0 for my lower (i do have an issue with a tooth that isn't aligned, so it is harder to brush) and 0-0 for my top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same in Canada. If you're getting cavities filled, braces put on, etc. it has to be paid by your private insurance or out of pocket. </p>
<p>However serious things such as emergencies are covered by provincial health care. </p>
<p>It's similar with vision. Want laser surgery? You gotta pay. Want cataract surgery? Don't gotta pay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™m Lucky to have 99% of dental covered without paying a dime. I had to pay full pop to get eye surgery to be allowed to drive though, but I was given a yearly benefit of up to $300 for glasses. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that private insurance or through work/military/aarp that's not publicly available? I ask because I'm about to clear my 2018 policy limits by the end of January on one tooth and I pay about 3k on top of that. I need to do something different next year, but my job only offers this one plan.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Starting with dental, dentistry was not something that doctors used to perform. Teeth pulling was actually performed by barbers! And there was no other options than pulling. So once we got dentists, medical insurance didn't want to touch them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When barbers were pulling teeth they were also amputating limbs and performing surgery.</p></div>		</li>
