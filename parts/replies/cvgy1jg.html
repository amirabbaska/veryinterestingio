			<p>In a sentence, satellites saw salty lines streak downhill on Mars during the warm summer months, which means they could be deposited by seasonal water flows. <br><br>-------<br><br><br>I've just skimmed <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2546.html" target="_blank">the paper</a>, and to say the same thing I said above in more technical detail, the authors analyzed the spectra of recurring slope linnae. The paper describes RSL by saying that they &quot;extend incrementally downslope on steep, warm slopes, fade when inactive, and reappear annually over multiple Mars years.&quot; They used a spectrometer aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to study the composition  of RSLs in four locations, and to directly quote the momentous result from the horse's mouth:<br><br>&gt; We find evidence for hydrated salts at all four locations in the seasons when recurring slope lineae are most extensive, which suggests that the source of hydration is recurring slope lineae activity. The hydrated salts most consistent with the spectral absorption features we detect are magnesium perchlorate, magnesium chlorate and sodium perchlorate. Our findings strongly support the hypothesis that recurring slope lineae form as a result of contemporary water activity on Mars.<br><br>The salts are particularly interesting because they lower the freezing temperature and evaporation rate of water considerably, and can thus allow liquid water to exist on Mars. A technical difficulty they discuss is that even the large RSLs are only a few meters wide while the resolution of the spectrometer is about 18 meters, so the RSLs are &quot;barely occupying a pixel&quot; of their spectrometer. The paper discusses which spectral lines are associated with which salts, which is honestly quite dry (hah! salts! dry! get it?) and is sufficiently out of my area that I won't comment on it. <br><br>Either way, this means there is now very good evidence of contemporary, seasonal, briny water flows on Mars.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Thank you for answering this question, it's what I mainly came to ask.<br><br>&gt;Either way, this means there is now very good evidence of contemporary, seasonal, briny water flows on Mars.<br><br>So if I understand the press release, and what you've said, correctly, scientists believe this is still an active process (or at least recent from a geological perspective)? Does the paper mention what form they think this precipitation takes (not sure if this word applies in these circumstances but I can't think of better)? Are we talking rain, fog, or just condensation that builds up over a period of time?<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to answer questions for everyone as well, much appreciated.</p>		</li>

			<p>The paper suggests that this is actively occurring on Mars today, during the summer months each and every year, from what I understand. <br><br>And as for the source of the water, the paper suggests a few theories, but the main goal now seems to be pin pointing exactly where the water is coming from. NASA seems to favor the theory that porous rock beneath the surface might soak up moisture from the atmosphere over time, then as the surface warms during the summer the brine would melt and flow down hill at the surface, before evaporating during the fall months. Apparently this happens in several places in Earth's deserts as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's really interesting, hard to imagine the kind of life that could live in that</p>		</li>

			<p>From what I understand, the salts make it tough for microbes to survive, however if you use Earth as an example there are countless examples of &quot;inhospitable&quot; locales that still somehow sustain life, when too high or low of a pH, lack or excess of oxygen/nitrogen/chlorine, etc. would preclude the existence of life from a theoretical standpoint. <br><br>Basically its the Jeff Goldblum scenario...Life, uh, finds a way</p>		</li>

			<p>This was covered during the press conference by the researcher from the AMES research centre. In summary;<br><br>The belief at the moment (and I stress at the moment) is that the perchlorate salts absorb water from the atmosphere. The salts then deliquesce and this becomes a highly concentrated salt solution.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Thank you again. I'm having trouble finding the link to the press conference video, but I'm at work so I'll have to watch it later anyway.</p>		</li>
