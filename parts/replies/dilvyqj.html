<p>Eastern Christians have complex beliefs about how God became human (Jesus) to sanctify every stage of human life. He had to die because death is a part of life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's actually a really nice belief. One of the biggest things that always bothered me about Christianity was the idea that a supposedly loving God would consider eternal torture a valid punishment for anything, much less think everything he created deserved it until his own <em>son</em> decided to take the punishment for them. And even then it wasn't out of love for his son, but because his son was able to sate his blood lust. This sidesteps that nicely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is one of the flaws a lot of people point out with substitution. The idea of a loving God punishing people before being &quot;merciful&quot; and sending his own son to his death in our place is weird to understand. While it can make sense with an understanding of a wrathful God from the OT many still arent happy.</p>
<p>One of the main Eastern theories of atonement is divinization. That our ling goal is to become one with God. Christ in living a full life allows us to better connect with him who is both human and God. His life through to his death and resurrection is like a bridge for us.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Christus Victor&quot; - In the grand battle between God and evil, evil holds humans as slaves. Jesus steps in and by dying and rising defeats evil and opens eternal life.</p>

<p>How is that not a manichean heresy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm probably in over my head philosophically but in an attempt to ELI5 I way over simplified that theory. The idea isn't that God isn't omnipotent, but that God tricks the devil in some way. Somewhat like Aslan and the white witch in the Narnia series, if that's familiar to you. Aslan lets the witch think she's winning but it was all in his power all along. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the Christus Victor atonement theory isn't even close to a heresy. It's just hard to explain to people who are hardcore substitutionary atonement believers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not saying no to anything, just an honest question -- OP's &quot;ELI5&quot; is &quot;According to the Bible...&quot; I think it's very hard to read any bit of the Bible that we are familiar with today and see any view point differently than Substitutiary Atonement. You have all of Paul's letters explaining this at the beginning of every one of them. I've never seen anything in the Bible mentioning the other 3 theories. </p>
<p>Do you think those are &quot;According to the Bible&quot;? Or do you think they're more &quot;according to these groups who reference small portions of the Bible?&quot;</p>
<p>I'd be interested to see how Theories 2, 3, and 4 come from a holistic reading of the Bible that we read today if so!</p></div>		</li>
