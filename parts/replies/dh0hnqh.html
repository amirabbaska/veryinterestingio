			<div class="markdown"><p>There have also been studies that show that individuals with schizophrenia who were born deaf hear non-auditory voices in the form of seeing hands signing or lips moving (<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0707/07070303" target="_blank">https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0707/07070303</a>). So it could be that schizophrenia is not inherently linked to the auditory part of the brain but rather preferred method of communication .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neurology/bioimaging student here. It makes me sad that this is why there's not much of a connection between our science and the public. We don't have the answers they're looking for yet. We have a lot of answers for questions people would never think to ask, and a lot of questions for things people think should be answered already. </p>
<p>This isn't chemistry or physics. The only way to learn more about the brain is to experiment and record data from the brain, which obviously isn't like experimenting on solutions and molecules. </p>
<p>We know so much more than we'd known about the central nervous system even a decade ago, but it often seems like the advancement of every other science makes people believe that we should have figured out the whole brain thing by now. We can put sophisticated robots on Mars, but we can't predict how exactly your brain in particular will respond to something? Yes. But are we trying to figure out how to make these predictions? Absolutely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep up the good work. I feel the public needs, far more often, to be told that we don't know something yet, so they can't have answers until that work is done. Public too often treats science like a utility and we need to appreciate that it's hard, messy work.</p></div>		</li>
