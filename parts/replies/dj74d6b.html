			<div class="markdown"><p>I initially typed fidget spinner and realised &quot;wont they just truncate the two motions together?&quot; for fidget and spinner. So i had to add others.</p>
<p>Im very surprised that your friend has her own 'slang' for it rather than signing fidget then spinner!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You actually just made me think of something. Are there signs that deal with conjugation? Like is there a sign for the &quot;ed&quot; we tack onto words to make them past tense etc. Or is it something that you derive from context?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding making new signs...</p>
<p>If you're ever having trouble communicating with a deaf person and you can't write anything down for some reason, try making up gestures for what you mean.</p>
<p>The fidget spinner gesture should be obvious to anyone who has seen one before. Deaf people are great at figuring out things like that. You don't need to know the actual sign for hamburger when you can pretend to eat an invisible one. You don't need to know how to say &quot;plane&quot; when you can zoom your hand around in the air. Feeling bad from a hangover? Act like you're drinking an invisible bottle and then pat your head while shaking it 'no'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, body language and facial expressions are half the conversation. </p>
<p>I may &quot;forget&quot; plane sometime and go full kid-mode, arms extended and circle them a couple times. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha I love that! It's such a natural sign she came up with, since her hand makes the letter F's finger shape. I'm definitely stealing that for my own use.</p></div>		</li>
