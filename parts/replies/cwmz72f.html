			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a piece of information we don't have which could skew the results-  what is the distribution of incorrect results between false positives and false negatives?  The test could be 99% accurate, but never produce a false positive; only false negatives.  Of course, that would almost certainly put the error rate above 99.9%, but without knowing the distribution of error types , there's some wiggle in the calculation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I presume the intention in the question is that the test is 99% accurate to make a correct diagnosis whether a diseased individual or a non-diseased individual is presented. So 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity.</p>
<p>The bigger piece of information missing is - who is taking the tests? If the 99% number is based on the general population, but then the only people taking the test are those who are already suspected to have the disease, then the false positive rate will drop substantially.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, thanks!  Sensitivity and Specificity- those are terms I didn't know! Your assumption of 99% for each is a good assumption to make in the case of a test question.   I was looking at it from a purely mathematical perspective, so I used different terms.  Thanks for teaching me something new :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In medicine we'd say sensitivity and specificity, which are characteristics of the test and don't vary (usually*) based on the disease prevalence.  When applied to a population with a known prevalence, you can then calculate positive and negative predictive value by creating a (sometimes dreaded) 4 x 4 table .  This relatively simple concept will still not be fully understood by many MDs, but is quite critical to interpreting tests.</p>
<p>*sensitivity and specificity sometimes vary when the disease is very different in a high prevalence population vs a low prevalence.  An example is TB testing with sputum smears; this test behaves different in late severe disease vs early disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is correct. The explanation is given by Bayes Theorom. You can watch a good explanation <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Df1sDAyRvQ" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Thus the test is 99% accurate meaning that it makes 1 mistake per 100 tests. If you are using it 10000 times it will make a 100 mistakes. If the test is positive for you, it could thus be the case that you have the disease OR that you are one of the 100 false positives. You thus have less than 1% chance that you actually DO have the disease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, there's no real way to adjust math curriculum to make probability easier to understand. It's an entire societal issue imho. As a species we try to make assumptions and simplify complex issues with easy to reckon rules. For instance.. Look at video games. </p>
<p>If a monster has a 1% drop rate and I kill 100 of them I should get the item. This is a common assumption =/ sadly it's way off. The person has like a 67% of seeing it at that point if I remember. On the flip side someone will kill 1000 of them and still not see it. Probability is just one of those things that takes advantage of our desire to simplify the way we see the world. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. This is why you must look at both the sensitivity (chances that the positive result is correct), and specificity (chances that the negative result is correct) of any test.</p>
<p>When you looks at these for many (most?) common cancer screening tests, you'd be amazed at how many false positives and negatives there are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they're important but not as important. In real life applications you'd have to consider probability of false positive vs probability of false negative, whereas this just looks at probability of being wrong.</p>
<p>But here you would have an expected number of false negatives of 0.01 out of 10,000 tested. Not totally negligible, but not &quot;just as important&quot; as the expected 99.99 false positives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is essentially the reasoning behind the answer given by the readiness test, but I'm not convinced that the question as quoted is really asking this question.  It might be - but whatever skill I may have had in dealing with word problems back when I took probability has long since dissipated.  </p>
<p>I'd like to see an explanation for why the question as phrased needs to take into account the chance of the disease being in the general population.</p>
<p>I'm upvoting you anyway, in spite of my reservations, because you've identified the core issue.  </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Because that is the critical factor: you only see things like this happen when the chance of a false positive is higher than the chance of actually having the disease.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a disease that 1% of the population has; and a test that is wrong 1% of the time, then out of 10000 people, 100 have the disease and 9900 don't; meaning that 99 will test positive with the disease, and 99 will test positive without the disease: leading to a 50% chance that you have the disease if you test positive.</p>
<p>But in your problem, the rate is 1 in 10000 for having the disease: a similar run through 1 million people (enough to have one false negative) will show that out of 1 million people, 9 999 people will get false positives, while only 99 people will get true positives: meaning you are about .98% likely to have the disease.</p>
<p>And as a general case, the odds of actually having a disease given a positive result is about (Chance of having the disease)/(Change of having the disease + chance of wrong result).</p></div>		</li>

<p>That right there sets off alarms for me. Which is correct, <del>false</del> true positive or <del>false</del> true negative? The question completely ignores that &quot;correct 99% of the time&quot; conflates specificity and sensitivity, which don't have to be the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The precise probability is 1 / N, where = </p>
<p>1/N = expected-number-of-correct-positive-results-in-10000-peope / expected-n-people-in-10000-with-positive-results, which equals:</p>
<p>N = (true number of negatives)false-positive-rate + (true number of positives)correct-positive-rate</p>
<p>N = 9,999(.01) + 1(.99) = 100.98,
so the exact answer is:1/100.98 = 0.00990295107.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an application of Bayes' Rule. Let A be disease, and B be positive test result. Rephrasing your question, you're looking for P(A | B). According to the rule, it's the following: </p>
<p>P(A | B) =  P(B | A) P(A) / P(B)</p>
<p>so plugging in numbers we have
P(A | B) = (0.99 <em> 1/10000)/(0.99 </em> 1/10000 + .01 * 9999/10000)</p>
<p>intuitively this is the probability of a true positive, normalized by the probability of a false positive or true positive (both of these are really small, since the disease is rare). So you end up with a ratio: probability of a true positive to probability of true or false positive. </p>
<p>These tests often (as far as I can remember) face a tradeoff between false positive and false negative rates. False positives suck, but for the truly awful diseases, a false positive might be better than a false negative for a first screen. </p>
<p>Edit 1: See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity" target="_blank">See Wikipedia for more</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: for the record though, most tests are more sensitive, often 99.9% or greater. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 99% number represents the chance of testing positive if you have the disease. This is not the chance of having the disease if you test positive (which is what the question is asking). </p>
<p>In order to get this latter probability, you need to compare the chance of a correct positive (having the disease) to the chance of a false positive (not having the disease). This probability is clearly affected by the likelihood of having the disease to begin with (as shown above).</p></div>		</li>
