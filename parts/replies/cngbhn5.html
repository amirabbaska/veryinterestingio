			<div class="markdown"><p>It has nothing to do with human perception. It's well known that the appearance of birds, for example, plays a huge role in mate selection. Symmetry, colors and shapes are important for many animals, not just humans.</p>
<p>When you take away light like in the deep sea or underground, appearance becomes meaningless, and animals would have no reason to evolve such traits.</p>
<p>Being &quot;ugly&quot; is not just a subjective human analysis, but rather something that takes into account the basic principles used by many species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm way late for this thread, but I'll add this anyway:</p>
<p>Yep, this is actually the very first paragraph in Jonathan Balcombe's book &quot;Second Nature: The inner lives of animals&quot;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2004 a study in the journal <em>Human Nature</em> tested the aesthetic preferences of chickens versus those of humans. On first blush, it might sound silly to attribute chickens with a capacity for aesthetic taste that we associate with humans. But there it was, a group of chickens who were trained to make choices by pressing a button with their beaks, lined up in a laboratory presented with digitized photos of thirty-five young men and women. In another room were seven female undergraduates instructed to choose the most attractive male face, and seven male students who were to choose the most attractive female face. When the chickens cast their votes, their preferences were almost identical to those of the students. The preference overlap was an uncanny 98 percent.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But its interesting how almost archatypically ugly they are. A wolf's snarl, a spider, an insane grin, and many other classically scary things can be explained through human evolution. Big teeth on a wolf is scary, but we also have some down right evolution helping us find that extra scary.</p>
<p>Deep water sea creatures take that to such an almost specifically horrifying degree that you can't help but wonder. No one is saying that other, visible, animals evolved to be attractive to us. I'm not suggesting that there was a time when we dealt with enough deep sea, unseen, creatures that we would evolve to fear them.</p>
<p>But you just can't help but wonder why almost everything down there (before you get to the tinier animals) looks down right like the spawn of Satan. There are other weird factors to effect their morphology, like the lack of food, cold and pressure. But its almost like if you took the creepiest artist in the world, and told him to draw all the evil fish from below that exist in the dark, he would come up with something like this. My reaction to their hideousness seems to strong for it to be a sheer difference of morphology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps the whole idea of what is &quot;scary&quot; is some instinctive trait handed down from our distant ancestors. Before we were top of the food chain it probably behooved us to avoid anything with large teeth that looked like it could eat us.</p>
<p><em>edit</em> Similar to how we quite often perceive cuteness across species.</p></div>		</li>
