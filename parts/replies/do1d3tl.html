			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought a helicopter without a tail rotor would be impossible to fly but there is actually a way to still fly it. The pilot will rock the helicopter as it spins, let's say north. Everytime the nose points north he rocks it forward more, this causes the helicopter to start moving north and eventually has enough airspeed that the air flowing past the body of the helicopter provides enough resistance to keep it pointing straight. It can then be flown relatively normally so long as you maintain your speed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrWvtuUaM1c" target="_blank">this video</a> is from ARMA 3 it shows the procedure I am talking about. I have read multiple sources saying that although not all helicopters are capable of doing this some are. There have been military helicopters that had their tail rotors blown clean off and they were still able to fly more than 15 minutes away to land. It might not be as common as I thought, but it does seem to work in some cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That only works if the vertical stabilizer on the tail is still in place. That's actually what it's for. Once the helicopter gets moving fast enough, the tail rotor flattens out and is no longer in use and the tail control surfaces take over. If the whole tail falls off, then there's not enough resistance for that to work. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading in one autobiography a comment that one of the big old Sikorsky/Westland Whirlwinds needed to be doing something like 70kts for the airframe to be able to counteract the torque reaction if the tail rotor failed in any way. Basically they could continue flying above that speed but below it meant autorotation, landings must have been fun!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have never flown a helicopter so the only experience I have with it is in flight simulators. I am sure it is difficult in real life but it is a known procedure used in case the tail rotor stop working for whatever reason. Just like how they use auto rotation to land safely if the main engine dies. It's not something you ever want to do but knowing how could save your life. </p></div>		</li>
