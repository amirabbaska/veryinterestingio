			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my professors had a proof that all numbers have interesting properties.   </p>
<p>Proof: Consider the set of all numbers that do NOT have any interesting properties. Select the smallest number in the set. That number is the smallest number with no interesting properties. That, in itself, is interesting. Hence the set must be empty.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually doesnâ€™t work for the real numbers, since there need not be a least element in the set (the simplest example being the open unit interval). You need a well-founded ordering to guarantee a least element.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so while this is correct, the proof still works (with minor adjustments) as long as there is some selection mechanism X that can select a single specific element from within a set of arbitrary reals; any selected number from our uninteresting set will have the interesting property &quot;this is an uninteresting number that is selected by mechanism X.&quot; that said, does this selection mechanism exist?</p>
<p>so long story short, all numbers are interesting, provided we take the axiom of choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that a contradiction? If the smallest number in the set of uninteresting numbers is now interesting, isn't it no longer part of the set? But then by no longer being part of the set, it now has no interesting properties. Which puts it back in the set and repeats the process infinitely</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The contradiction is in assuming that the set is nonempty (and well-founded) in the first place. </p></div>		</li>
