			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that the #$dTs@[j48t's Bakery on 91WVg%A_iq0C Avenue or the #$dTs@[j48t's Bakery on 2uWOH*k#$BcT Street?
My Aunt Wnn_7D^gBOOO used to take me to the one on 91WVg%A_iq0C Avenue. They had the most fantastic 5NvLSb#I$%nB's with just a hint of 5l@DO$oaQlOv.</p>
<p>Note - I took this reply seriously enough that I actually used the password generator to get these strings unlike my initial post. I feel so lame for cheating that first time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>91WVg%A_iq0C Avenue! Small world.  If you like the 5NvLSb#I$%nB, you should try the DS5a^G0NHZOvpX7, it's made the same way they do it in the old country - so good!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You open your password manager, find the answer, and read it out to them. Banks aren't stupid. They know many people don't give serious answers to security questions. It doesn't matter if users give serious answers or not, since the questions are simply a (weak) form of verifying the user's identity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I use password managers and have random usernames/passwords/and security questions for all websites.  It can sometimes lead to... interesting... conversations when I have to call in and end up having to read out &quot;my mother's maiden name&quot;, haha.</p></div>		</li>
