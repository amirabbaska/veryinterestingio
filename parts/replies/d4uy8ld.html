			<div class="markdown"><p>Little pro tip, if you do buy benadryl for allergies, buy Sleep Aid. The active ingredient is Diphenhydramine HCI 25 or 50mg. I've seen a box of 6 benadryl go for 3 to 4 dollars, you can get 96 tablets for about 10 bucks. You're just paying for the benadryl name! Hope this helps someone!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I don't take them daily or even weekly. I also haven't slept for 7 days because that would be too long.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always thought the circadian thing was strange. I'm at my most tired around the time I wake up till around mid-day, after that I'm hyper-energetic until I next wake up. I've heard people say that stormy days make them feel tired, but I feel I have the opposite reaction, I get restless. I can go to work all day, get home, go to the gym, go home and do some 'activities' with the girlfriend and then go to bed and I'll still be restless and may take a few hours to get to sleep- then when I wake up I'm tired as shit and feel awful until midday again.</p>
<p>Am I just fucked up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been meaning to ask an ELI5 question about this very thing, but I don't think it's any more than &quot;this is your biological clock&quot;</p>
<p>Ok, so for me, I am fucking worthless until about noon, then I finally &quot;wake up&quot;, but because of my work schedule, I'm up at 5am and at work by 6am. You would think because of this I would be going to bed early. But no, I have the hardest fucking time trying to fall asleep before 11pm. </p>
<p>It's basically like this: Middle of the day, completely clothed, in a stale air office, sitting upright, I can pass out no problem. Laying on a comfy mattress, in a dark, cool room, with very little clothing, I just stare at the damn ceiling. Doesn't matter what I do, aside from drugs, I'm going to toss and turn for at least a half hour before I fall asleep.</p>
<p>And the people that say if you keep doing the same sleep pattern over and over you'll eventually get used to it, it's bullshit. I've been working this early shift for 5 years. Five years I've been waking up at 5am and every day is just as painful as the first day. My body refuses to get used to it and it refuses to compensate for it by making me tired at the end of the day so I can be in bed by 9pm.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The first place I'd look is at what activities you are doing before bed.  If you're primarily using a computer or looking at your phone or some other bright screen, it can be causing problems.  I'd suggest f.lux or some similar software.  For the longest time, I would describe myself the same way as you, but I started using f.lux on my home computer and found it much easier to go to sleep after use.  As a disclaimer, using f.lux or similar software can require a bit of adjustment.  At first, the difference is quite noticeable and it might annoy you a bit, but if you give it some time it doesn't take long before you don't even notice anything different other than the fact that it is easier to go to sleep after use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty much the same, though I used to consider 30minutes to get to sleep a victory. I ended up buying an e-book with a backlight, (so I could read in the dark, with backlight on very low setting), because without it my mind just goes racing, I think about totally random things.. Without my ebook, it takes me between 1-3 hours to fall asleep while in darkness - no TV on or anything. Sometimes I'd get sore from laying there for so long, and end up getting up and going on the computer - going to work without sleep. With the e-book takes me around 30-45 minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, there isn't just one circadian rhythm. various processes in the body have their own rhythms that match, are entangled with circadian rhythm, or are their own thing. it's a complex question, imo. </p>
<p>in particular i was mocking the top comment that said &quot;it's a survival mechanism&quot;. that's kind of weak. isn't most every physiological process a &quot;survival mechanism&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The rhythm changes and adjusts. That's why people who move around the planet eventually catch up to local time and why &quot;jet lag&quot; is a thing.</p>
<p>It's not a particular time of day because that is going to vary between individuals and what they work / when they sleep. </p>
<p>My old schedule for instance:</p>
<p>Wake up around 8pm
Work at midnight
Lowest point (tired) around 4am
Rebound around 6-7am (energy)
Off at 8am
Energized for most of morning
Settle down for sleep around 1pm</p>
<p>This rhythm was the closest I had to a &quot;typical&quot; night but it varied wildly because of the nature of night work and how your body fights the impulse to stay awake after a certain hour.</p>
<p>As for 24hour plus, just cut that sleep out at the end. So we go:</p>
<p>Roll in bed until 11pm
Come into work exhausted (12am)
Lowest point around 3-4am (Dying)
Strange energy (Rebound) at 6-7am
Get off at 8am
Body gives up, crash at 9am</p>
<p>And waking up around 5-6pm, I've successfully messed my sleep up now. The rhythm is a suggestion for those who have to work, otherwise we would be hard pressed to even have a night shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any truth to the comments about adrenaline? Its usually harder for me to sleep well when I'm extremely tired and sleepy - my heart and head starts racing so much that I can't relax enough to sleep. I figured the extra adrenaline my body produced throughout the day makes it harder for me to sleep. I'm jealous of people who can crash after a long day...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert in this field, but I have had some exposure to it. Many physio systems have clocks. I wouldn't be surprised that adrenaline release might too. I know, for example, that it's easier for people to breathe during certain times of the day, due to some sort of clocked release of endocrine juice. Perhaps the adrenal gland does something similar? (or is even involved with what I describe). Maybe your's is &quot;off&quot;? All of this is possible. Or not. I'm not up-to-date on this stuff, but it's worth investigating if you have sleep problems. I'd imagine a sleep specialist/doctor would be able to help you answer these questions. Definitely worth checking if it is impacting your life.</p></div>		</li>
