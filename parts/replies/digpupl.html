			<div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen those enabled for cards anywhere. We do have contactless payments with mobile phones, but chips were just semi-required as of October 2015 (there's still plenty of places without chip support, they just face increased liability in the event of fraudulent transactions). I have heard good things about contactless cards and I don't understand why we didn't go straight to those given how late we were to the chip party.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is strange that contactless hasn't become standard yet for credit/debit cards in the US. It's extremely common in the EU. When I visited the Netherlands last time, one supermarket I was in had express tills that would only accept contactless payments instead of cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is it strange? The US still isn't doing proper chip and pin which has been standard in the UK and most of Europe for best part of a decade. I'm not surprised they're not behind on new payment tech.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Australia here. We have 'tap and go' or 'paypass' (same thing, MasterCard and visa just have their own names for it). It's pretty much instant and we're covered up to $100 without a PIN. </p>
<p>I use my phone (Apple Pay) most of the time now though since they activated that about a year ago. Hold my finger against the home button and put the top of the phone near the machine and off we go. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There may be different technology now but I remember at some point basically all my cards had contactless payment in them before having chips. Over time, that feature has been removed.</p>
<p>I haven't followed it but when the contactless payment was being rolled out there were many security concerns that people could walk by and scan people's cards without anyone being the wiser. </p>
<p>More and more places have or are adding the ability to pay via contactless primarily due to ApplePay, Android Pay, or the stores's own app to provide rewards and payment at the same time. </p>
<p>I would think the banks are going to support the phone based contactless payments and chips on cards only. The contactless payment on a phone has the security benefit of the device having to be on and unlocked in order to be scanned. A card with contactless payment can be scanned at anytime if in range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chip &amp; Pin cards have been mandatory in the UK since mag strips stopped being accepted 15 years ago. </p>
<p>Contactless payment cards came much later, but now virtually every store in Europe accepts them. </p>
<p>You could theoretically scan the cards by tapping someone's wallet, but since most wallets will have 4 or 5 cards in it they'll interfere with the scan. Still not impossible, but that's why they can only be used for small transactions, in the UK it's £30 or less, in most of Europe it's €100 or less. So there can't be any major fraud. </p>
<p>If you use contactless too many times in one day it'll ask you to revert to chip &amp; pin. </p>
<p>All contactless payments are insured and automatically refunded if fraudulent. </p>
<p>Mag strip is the least secure, then contactless, then chip &amp; pin. </p></div>		</li>

<p>100 Euros?  Hang out in a a busy area, and you could scan 1000 people a day.  I'm... concerned... you don't consider €100,000 per day &quot;major fraud&quot;.</p>

<p>You need to have my card in your hand in order to swipe the strip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apple pay takes a lot longer to process than contactless cards in many places. Depends on the stores set up, but for example the vending machine in my office will take 3 minutes to process an apple payment, but less than a second for a contactless card.</p>
<p>Possibly because contactless cards guarantee payment but apple pay doesn't, so it has to contact the bank and confirm funds with Apple pay. Which may be faster or slower depending on the stores connection. Just a theory. </p></div>		</li>
