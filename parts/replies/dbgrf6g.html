			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This is the real answer. Amazon is willingly losing money with their online store for the sake of establishing themselves as a household name that everyone will trust for the rest of their lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have no problem with a monopoly as long as it can constantly provide a better service than its competitors. It's not exactly hard for entrepreneurs to start new online retail websites, and it's not hard for consumers to switch. If Amazon doesn't maintain the quality of their service, it won't take long for there to be a dozen websites competing to become the &quot;new Amazon.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should also note that most items eligible for free shipping via Prime cost more than the items you pay for shipping for; and they mostly come straight from the Amazon store, not independent sellers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't explain why they offer customers Prime subscriptions instead of simply offering free 2-Day (and same day/2-hour) to everyone without requiring the $99 fee. Prime only makes sense if the act of paying the $99 actually increases per customer average orders (and it does...See my earlier answer). It's all about a quirk of psychology related to cognitive dissonance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw your response and I think explains the why pretty well. Personally, I probably spend a lot more with Amazon because I have Prime and I live in an area that has same day Prime shipping on most items I purchase. </p>
<p>I guess I was more getting at the how, which was OP's inquiry. Ultimately the more I spend ordering from Amazon, the more larger their market share is but the less of my annual membership goes to offsetting each shipping cost. Prime operates at a loss, and that money is coming from AWS. </p>
<p>I don't think we're in disagreement here. I think we can both agree they're playing the long game. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The CPA is right.</p>
<p>It seems you are incorrectly characterizing Amazon's retail business and Prime as a sort of loss leader, which it likely is not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will say that being a Prime member convinced me to ditch my cable as soon as HBO was available through Amazon.  And I have definitely bought things on Amazon without doing any research as to whether it was cheaper at another website, or if I could get it at a local store.</p></div>		</li>
