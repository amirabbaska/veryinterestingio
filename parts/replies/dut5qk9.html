			<div class="markdown"><p>Radio waves aren't ones and zeros. In fact it's helpful to realise that nothing in reality is a one or a zero - those are abstract concepts made up by people which don't exist in real life.</p>
<p>It's easiest to explain how a monochrome TV signal is sent over radio waves. First you set up a carrier wave - that's a radio wave that oscillates at a fixed frequency, like 500 MHz. That's what you had to tune the TV to in the old days when they'd not come tuned or go out of tune.</p>
<p>Then you get the signal you want to send. For monochrome TV, that's the brightness of each pixel, with each line of pixels stacked back to back (and then this data is inverted but that doesn't matter). Now where you have a low signal value you transmit the carrier wave at low amplitude, and where you have a high signal value you transmit a high amplitude carrier wave, and vary it for intermediate values. That's what you actual transmit through the air. There are of course other bits of data - colour for one, also sound, synchronisation  information and other stuff that doesn't matter.</p>
<p>So that's what you transmit - a carrier wave whose amplitude varies proportionally to your signal.</p>
<p>Remember I said that there are no ones and zeroes? It's worth thinking about what a digital signal transmits. Digital television broadcast over radio waves is more complicated than my explanation above, but it still boils down to varying a carrier wave (actually several carrier waves!) according to the data you want to transmit (probably you're not varying the amplitude but another property). What's transmitted is a radio wave which varies in some complicated way, but which you can decode into ones and zeroes.</p>
<p>Of course, it never actually gets decoded into ones and zeros - it gets decoded into high and low voltages in an electronic circuit, which are then interpreted further to produce pixel intensities on a screen ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Digital setups don't literally send ones and zeroes. They alternate some property of their signal to be extremely high then extremely low, kind of like morse code.</p>
<p>Analog signals work the same, but instead of going bang-bang to each extreme, they send the actual thing they want to send using gradual variations.  Think of, say, sending the actual sound wave, or the actual brightness profile.</p>
<p>You can also think of vinyl records vs. CDs. CDs don't physically store sound waves, they store bumps on a surface. But vinyl record grooves contain the actual literal sound wave that you want to store and hear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You send the actual waveform itself using something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation#Analog_modulation_methods" target="_blank">modulation</a>.</p>
<p>The two you are probably most familiar with are frequency modulation (FM) and amplitude modulation (AM) which form the basis for terrestrial radio.</p></div>		</li>
