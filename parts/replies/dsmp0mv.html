			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, both SR an GR must be accounted for. Though for interplanetary probes, the low level of precision necessary means that relativistic effects can basically be ignored. </p>
<p>However, GPS requires very exact timing to work correctly, and relativistic time dilation must be taken into account. Because the satellites are further from the center of the earthâ€™s gravity well, GR says their clocks will be faster than those on earth. However, because they are in motion relative to an earthbound observer, SR says their clocks will run slower.  The net effect must be accounted for in order for the system to work.  </p></div>		</li>
