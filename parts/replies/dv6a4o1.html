<p>Not so much. UV and IR contribute to cataract, not bright visible light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, while normally afterimages are caused by the eye, in some cases the the brain itself which maintains the image.  Unfortunately very little is known about this aspect to it.  But it most likely has something to do with a decrease in the brains natural auto-correct function allowing for stimuli which is normally erased from the visual perception to continue to exist</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add that you can experience the effects of afterimage in a safe way by taking a piece of florescent pink paper and holding it up your face so it covers your entire field of vision. Stare at it for a few minutes, then put the paper down. Everything will be green tinted, because the pink paper exhausted the light receptors ability to absorb and transmit red light to the optic nerve. After a few minutes spent not staring at the pink paper, your vision will return to normal. This also works with other brightly colored paper.</p></div>		</li>
