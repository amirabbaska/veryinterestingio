			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of plasticizers... I didn't know this term until two nights ago when DEET (bug spray, I was using a 98% formulation)fucked up my phone case. It made the plastic start crumbling away on it. Through Google I learned that it is a plasticizer. I never heard the term in  my life, but sure enough, I'm running into it again now :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>98% Deet?</p>
<p>I thought there no point in any higher than 40-50?</p>
<p>I once went rock climbing in Laos, the instructor started the session by asking us to remove any DEET as it keeps melting the ropes. </p>
<p>Great confidence builder at the start for us!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I normally use a 45% formulation but found this Coleman 98% stuff and tried it out. I don't think it's worth the side effects though. It's so much easier to get in your eyes or numb your lips with stuff this strong lol. I didn't know it was pointless to go above 40ish though. It makes sense, DEET is already pretty damn effective in itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can go down to the chemist and pick up 80% DEET at the moment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And furthermore, companies would probably have to stop using aluminum if there was a chance their drinks could react with it, because if aluminum starts getting into beverages it could result in heavy metal poisoning. (This is also why you're not supposed to mix tomatoes in a metal bowl.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it is actually likely that some alumium would react as i think cola is slightly acidic so if it is stored in a hot enough area it might corrode the oxidation layer assuming its pure aluminium which I doubt.</p></div>		</li>
