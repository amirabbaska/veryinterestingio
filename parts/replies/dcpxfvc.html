			<div class="markdown"><p>There's gas trapped in the bottle as well. When the beer freezes, it expands and compresses the gas to a higher pressure. Since gas is relatively compressible, the pressure is not high enough to cause the bottle to break.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But why didn't the bottle break? Because the pressure from the gas wasn't enough to break the bottle? Or was it because the frozen water applied pressure against the bottle from the outside and acted against the pressure from the inside?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gas is mostly distrubuted through the liquid, so the freezing liquid kept the gases trapped and compressed little tiny bubbles. The important thing here is that the air is easier to push against than the glass, so the bubbles just kept getting smaller as more liquid froze</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gas between liquid and cap acts like a spring, a suspension of a car, by being compressed while liquid expands freezing. It doesn't break until the pressure put by the expanding freezing liquid on that small volume of gas is not enough to break the glass or pop the cap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The beer would be dangerous.  Gas under tremendous pressure can explode.  I read about a frozen can of soda that was fine until it hit the counter and then it exploded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you opened the bottle it would pour out and freeze like a slushy.</p>
<p>If the bottle was going to crack the pop would break first.</p>
<p>If the beer in the bottle was frozen they either need to consider checking their freezer temp (to avoid wasting energy), or the cap popped a little.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Beer and soda freeze differently. I've never had beer in any container explode but coca cola... everytime. Someone explained to me it had to do with the sugar or alcohol content of the liquid but I have not confirmed that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you mean by explosion, but technically not even gasoline vapor mixed with oxygen is capable of explosion. Explosion is when a shockwave exceeds the speed the fuel's burning spreads. Slower than this is conflagration.</p>
<p>I don't know off hand what the term is for your scenario.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the bottle is strong enough it can reorient the crystal structure so that the ice compresses the air at the top. </p>
<p>Additionally the ethanol in beer decreases the freezing temperature, meaning less ice forms, and the ice that does form is prevented from forming one large crystal of ice by both the alcohol and other dissolved solids. </p>
<p>The ethanol is the important part if I had to guess. It prevents the ice from forming one big block and instead it forms a slush with inclusions of high ethanol / low water content. </p>
<p>This is actually how they make some enriched alcohol beverages--freeze it in a block, then strain out the liquid. The liquid is high in flavor and alcohol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. It's called freeze distillation (technically a misnomer) and it's a common method for producing high abv beers where regular distillation is not allowed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The glass made the bottle resist all pressures from expansion. It was much easier for the water to expand outward when it froze, so that's what it did. </p></div>		</li>
