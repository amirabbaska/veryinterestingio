			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you made a lot of assumptions before recommending that I go see a doctor. I would love it if I could get any advice from a fashion magazine but everything in revolves around losing weight. I can't even participate in my employers health perks programming because there are not programs where gaining weight isn't frowned upon. That advice did come from a doctor, more than one actually. While I admit that it is a simplistic way of putting something that gets a lot more complicated when you start drilling down into nutrition, it is the easiest way to explain it that people can grasp without going into lots of biology. If you have any serious recommendations for me I would love to hear them, I'm always looking for better ways to gain weight aside from adding protein powder to every meal.</p></div>		</li>
