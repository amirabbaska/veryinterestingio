			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great rundown to a very complicated question. The success of Sub-pop probably should have a line somewhere. As an indie label, they signed many of the Seattle grunge bands first, like Nirvana before they moved to a larger label. They sold half stake to large label and then signed many of the big alt/indie bands of the 2000's. So they are sorta in between a huge label and indie label, but have a gigantic roster of the most popular 'indie' bands in the last 20 years. Nowadays I tend to think of Alt as more of a sound (distinguished by the alt sound of the 90s) and Indie as more of a type of band that doesn't fit most of the molds (where this was Alt in the 90s).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note, alternative came out of college rock, which now one might either call college rock or alternative, but I think more commonly college rock. This was before the 90s alt rock you mention, served as its prototype, and is generally typified by The Pixies and early REM. I believe it would've been used regardless of label, as it existed prior to the indie/alt designation and has overlap with garage rock, which originated I have no idea when.  I'm winging this so please correct me if necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>REM was on an independent label (IRS) through Document (1987).  Green (1988) was on Warner.</p>
<p>The Replacements were on Twin/Tone through Let It Be (1984).  They switched to Sire for Tim (1985), though they kept an edge for a couple of more albums.</p>
<p>Husker Du was indie through Flip Your Wig (1985) and switched the Warner for Candy Apple Grey (1986)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, so classically &quot;college rock&quot; bands have at different times fit the technical label of &quot;indie&quot; bands, as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true though college rock was also called alternative rock! Arguably college rock was essentially the alternative rock that was frequently played on college rock radio stations, so it was a smaller category than the whole alternative. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The Chili Peppers, though I actually think they may have had a major label deal before Nirvana hit the mainstream</p>

<p>They put out a record in 1984 on EMI.</p></div>		</li>
