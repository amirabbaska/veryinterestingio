<p>You are exactly right about the claims about fundamental principles of how brain works, in particular that specialized structures of the brain are not so specialized after all. This is also what caught my attention because I recall a study in which they managed to attach some &quot;foreign&quot; receptors to animal's brain which were then successfully integrated into the brain processing despite the brain obviously not having any dedicated neurons for those receptors. This resonated with me and I decided to ask you guys here.</p>

<p>Yes he is. However, this is very common in Russia and generally doesn't itself indicate a bad researcher if he's of older age. This is a hard Soviet legacy. Sad but true. He likely doesn't speak English at all as well.</p>
<p>The way I understood the theory is not that brain is either processing 100% of internal or 100% of external stimuli, but that during the sleep resources not required for consciousness and full visual/sound/etc. processing are used to observe and regulate internal organs. This way it sounds sane to non-scientist like myself. Some other his claims are indeed outrageous.</p>
<p>I am now too inclined to think that he might indeed be a science freak. I'll try to read the works from this thread and some of his works to make a more complete impression.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not sure what precisely are 'resources not required for consciousness'. Since organs function in a subconscious manner when one is not sleeping, they do so when one is sleeping. Therefore, and obviously, these subconscious mechanisms play a very significant role during sleep. At that time, consciousness is highly diminished, but stimuli of visual parts of the brain is very common, just like muscular involvement (REM sleep). Does this relate to organs at all? No, these areas of the brain react to external clues and make a part of consciousness. To me at least, a racing heart or empty lungs are still external stimuli, they're located in the body but <em>conscious</em> thought or action is the product of a reaction to an external clue. Visual stimuli during sleep is a reaction. This should make it clear that there is <strong>no conscious involvement whatsoever to organ regulation during sleep</strong>. Unconscious action or thought or even feeling is called instinct. Thing is, instinctive and conscious doing suppose stimuli of very different brain surface. From reading Walter Mischel's The Marshmallow Test, which differentiate the 'hot' system (reactive, reflective, instinctive) from the 'cool' system (reflexive, thought through) of the brain, I understand that the more one is active, the less the other is. At least, when one is drastically demanded, the other becomes incapacitated (so 'hot' temptations or feelings can be blinding).</p>
<p>By nature, the 'cool' system (what you call external stimuli) doesn't play a significant active role during sleep, it plays a passive role because it is less active.</p></div>		</li>
