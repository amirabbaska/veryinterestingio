<p>Don't underestimate the time they needed, and it was more than getting food and firewood. In addition, their living conditions were really bad by modern standards, and the population that could be sustained that way was very small as well.</p>

<p>Of course dieing to a sabre-tooth tiger, dispite its cool name, or to a simple infection sucks...</p></div>		</li>

<p>First of all, 2-3 hours per day is 15-20 hours per week. Lots of people live on that. </p>
<p>Secondly, Neanderthals would have been well suited to their jobs. This isn't a minimum wage parallel. 8 year old kids would be working minimum wage. By the time they're a parent, they'd be making junior management wages, and soon thereafter, consultant fees. So it's fair to say this person would be making $15 per hour, or more. </p>
<p>Thirdly, Neanderthals lived in large households, with everyone pitching in. Shared rooms, even shared beds, eating whatever's on sale, with sticks and rocks for the kids to play with. In the summer, no A/C, and in the winter, minimal heat. </p>
<p>So it's not one person, living on their own, making $15 000 per year, it's 8 people, with the kids doing housework and all 5 adults working together to pay the bills to make $50 000 for the household, living in a 2-bedroom house with minimal amenities. </p>
<p>I think there's a good reason people want to work more than that. </p></div>		</li>
