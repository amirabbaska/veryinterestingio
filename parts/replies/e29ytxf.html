<p>That's not really true, while your toothbrush contains a ton of bacteria, so does pretty much everything else.  It's not harmful bacteria so it's not really a biohazard.  </p>
<p>Or more colloquially: your face is a biohazard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's a massive assumption.  What if it was just used by someone who was sick?  What if fecal bacteria are on it from being kept in the bathroom and getting sprayed?</p></div>		</li>
