			<p>Most people I know who are doing well got help from their parents. That's not a bad thing, parents should help their kids.<br><br>It's just that now parents can't help out like they used to, I think. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yea, I wasn't saying it was a bad thing. I am saying all of these early 20s, late teens people saying omg everybody else had it so great its so hard for our generation is laughable. No generation has ever had it better. </p>		</li>
