			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty cool. I always figured the immune system was programmed purely by genetics and therefore would reject anything foreign to its native genetic code, regardless of how it developed. Humans have enough autoimmune diseases that reject genetically native organs that I just figured doing something this radical would upset the animal's immune system, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You may be right about some of this; scientists are ALSO creating genetically modified pigs that produce pig organs (without that telltale sugar) that humans can potentially use without triggering rejection. </p></div>		</li>
