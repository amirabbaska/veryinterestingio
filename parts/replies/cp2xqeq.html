			<div class="markdown"><p>If anyone is interested, search up new and old written Arabic alphabet. It was (compared to the current one) insanely ambiguous and readers had to rely entirely on the context to understand the writing. [Just to get an idea of what I mean, here is the (relatively) new arabic alphabet]( <a href="http://www.joaoleitao.com/names-arabic/images/arabic-alphabet.png" target="_blank">http://www.joaoleitao.com/names-arabic/images/arabic-alphabet.png</a>). The old one was the same, but minus the dots... Minus the bloody dots lol, imagine that. </p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;Sire, our scribes have consulted the sacred prophecies... and... well... either this year will be fortunate and you should seek to deepen our trade relationships the foreigners, or 'kill all infidels' or... well we're pretty sure it's not this one, but it might be 'LOL KITTY BACON BACON BACON'.  Probably one of the first two...&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reading Semitic texts is tricky as <em>fuck</em>. Some, ie Bible - cannot be read with full comprehension by someone who doesn't already know what it's about. Most &quot;manuscripts&quot; making up Bible we have, are in Greek, or in Hebrew with diacritic system (the dots) already in. But it wasn't always like that. Ancient Semitic languages can only be read by people who already know the context and taboos and just weird shit you did. </p>
<p>That's why I always crack up when I see Jehova witnesses. Poor chaps, their whole thing is being the sect that claims to be getting back to root of Bible, to be amending transcription, translation and tradition errors of other Christian sects. And then BOOM, error in the fucking NAME of their God. Hilarious.</p>
<p>God has a name, that cannot be spoken outside of Temple of Jerusalem (like, if only anyone told those guys how their cult would take off...), but CAN and HAS been written. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragrammaton" target="_blank">Click this</a> to learn all about this, but a tl:dr is: while we're not clear on a whole bunch of stuff about name of God as written down originally, and it's a <em>fascinating</em> subject that has been hatched away from Bible by stupid, narrow minded translators (like, if you do this - at least put more pressure on priests explaining this whole abridged fucking part), what we ARE clear is that writing it as &quot;Jehova&quot; is a fucking transcription error. Someone didn't get the memo on context of adding diacritic symbols to ancient hebrew manuscripts, and they done goofed and took a wrong fucking <em>name</em>. Makes you question the judgment of people in charge of re-evaluating The Bible, when they failed at such an elementary part.</p>
<p>Actually, I wonder if they mentioned the fact that it is a sin to say name of the God before they mention it in Bible. </p>
<p>Edit: nope, mentioned twice in Genesis. So, if you took The Bible, in original - if you didn't know it in it's entirety, you'd commit 2 Deadly Sins before you got through the first chapter. Because <em>fuck you</em>, that's why. Keep reading, bitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't read Arabic, but I <em>think</em> its not quite that bad. The dots represent vowels, I believe, so without them, you might get a message like this:</p>
<p>Mustur Prusudunt, thu Russuns ur uttuckung us! Shuld wu lunch thu nuculur mussuls?</p>
<p>It sounds silly when you use the wrong vowels, but its still somewhat intelligable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hebrew also has dots, for letter differentiation and also vowels so though some vowels use bars. When you read Hebrew in the paper or on the internet though, no dots no vowels. Makes life really hard if you're trying to learn Hebrew as a second language.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And the complexity of making dots in paper is a lot less than embossing letterforms in paper.  There are Braille &quot;typewriters&quot;, called braillers, and braille tape printers for computers, called embossers.  These simple devices would need to be much more complex to put letterforms into paper, almost like Gutenberg printing presses with moveable type.</p>
<p>The dots are much more efficient, both to read and make.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slower to read than text to speech, bulky and difficult to send as it can't be bent, takes up a lot of space. (My mum has 40ish ringbinders of braille from her teenage diary years) It's fallen heavily out of fashion among the blind community because audiobooks are so popular, and the speech programs on phones and PCs are far easier to use overall.
Also, braille embossers are slow and FUCKING LOUD AS HELL. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, anything you print using the alphabet, numbers, and punctuation can be rendered in braille. There's even a braille notation system for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_music" target="_blank">musical notes</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Braille has a character for every letter of the alphabet, so in it's most basic form Braille can be used as a 1 to 1 substitution with no loss and represent everything that we read using the latin alphabet. </p>
<p>There are some issues with using Braille in non-latin alphabets, but the international associations are resolving those issues. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille#International_uniformity" target="_blank">Wikipedia explanation</a></p>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/[deleted]" target="_blank">[deleted]</a>
			<div class="markdown"><p>So, my impression of California braille was that it's all the same symbols; it's just that California has specific standards for the spacing and shape of the dots on their signage. You could use those standards anywhere in the country and braille users would have any trouble understanding them. </p>
<p>ETA: I worked my way through the official braille certification process as a teenager but haven't had much interaction with braille since, other than having some friends who are visually impaired or who work as educators for the blind and visually impaired, so I'm by no means an expert.</p></div>		</li>
