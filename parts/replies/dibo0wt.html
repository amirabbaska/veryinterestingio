			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also an artifact of drawing new borders from scratch in an era when you have the luxury of using latitude and longitude on a paper map to do so. Many (almost certainly 'most') of the world's natural borders are inherited from a time when mapmaking wasn't accurate enough for straight lines to be practical.</p>
<p>There would have been endless disputes about exactly where the border was. Maps drawn by different cartographers would be shaped differently and there was no concrete way to accurately mark a specific border across open terrain beyond actually building fences and walls. Which is kinda prohibitive for an entire border; it took China centuries to build the Great Wall and even then it wasn't to mark the border, but to defend against attack.</p>
<p>Much easier to just set your borders at rivers and mountain ranges instead, and tell your army to defend everything within those divides. Takes the ambiguity out of the equation. And those geographical features constituted barriers for primitive armies that couldn't easily cross large rivers or tall mountains, so you could use them to control vectors for invasion and safeguard your territory.</p>
<p>By the time colonization became a big thing, mapmaking was more accurate and it had become feasible to draw an arbitrary straight line and actually have a sense for where the border was without geographical features to mark it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my first classes in college was History of the Middle East, in 2001.  On Iraq day, the professor started the lecture by drawing a rectangle, then drew another two lines through it to make 3 distinct areas in the rectangle.  He labeled the top one Kurds, the middle one Sunni, and the bottom one Shiia.  Then he said &quot;this map was drawn by the British.  These groups have been fighting with each other more or less since Mohammed died.  Try governing this without an oppressive dictator.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The lines were just general geographic locations of the 3 major ethnic groups and how they are pretty well separated.  It's a simplification of this:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Iraq#/media/File:Iraq_ethno_2003.jpg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Iraq#/media/File:Iraq_ethno_2003.jpg</a></p>
<p>Or this:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Iraq#/media/File:Ethnoreligious_Iraq.svg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Iraq#/media/File:Ethnoreligious_Iraq.svg</a></p>
<p>The idea is that colonial powers didn't really pay much attention to historical problems between distinct ethnic groups, because they were all being ruled oppressively.  Democracy in a place like that is pretty difficult.  Which the US learned again after we removed Saddam, struggled to set up a government, saw a bunch of instability, and now ISIS runs half the place.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Another example is the Radcliffe line between India and Pakistan. Left millions of people on the wrong side of the border and led to a huge amount of bloodshed. At least 500,000 people killed. Here the problem was splitting the land between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. </p>
<p>This was a problem only in two states: Punjab and Bengal which did not have a dominant religion. Radcliffe was also given only five weeks to complete the line. After the ensuing mayhem Radcliffe even refused a salary for the job. </p>
<p>Both the Muslim league and the Indian national congress were not in favour of the line. Add to that the slipshod job by the British and it was a recipe for disaster. </p></div>		</li>
