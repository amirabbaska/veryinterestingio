			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for the reduced stability is because as the element number increases there's more electron screening (inner electrons preventing outer electrons from feeling as much attraction from the nucleus). Because of this the bonds aren't as strong. So even though the valence electron number is the same, they're further out from the nucleus and less tightly bound. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silanes tend to be very hydrophobic, so they can be used for water-repellent coatings etc.</p>
<p>Probably the place you'll find the most silane is as an intermediate in production of high-purity crystalline silicon though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Silanes are used in many applications from surface treatment to organic synthesis to semiconductor manufacturing. Polysilanes are most relevant for chemical vapor deposition for semiconductors. Check out the Gelest catalog to see the variety available and applications. </p></div>		</li>
