<p>This is the important bit. Even though they passed through a very high-radiation environment, the missions themselves weren't particularly long. Astronauts on long-term low-Earth orbit missions (Skylab, Mir) received as much as 10 times the radiation dose that the Apollo astronauts did simply because they spent months in space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are accounts of the astronauts being able to close their eyes and see &quot;sparkles&quot; as charged particles zapped through their retinas while they were going through the belts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This wasn't just on the Apollo missions passing through the belts - most astronauts on more or less all missions out of the atmosphere report seeing these <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_visual_phenomena" target="_blank">&quot;LF&quot; (light flashes)</a>, often preventing sleep. It's no coincidence that of the 39 astronauts that flew on high-radiation missions, 36 of them later developed early-onset cataracts.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Even though the field intensity is high, it is not that high. I once did a back of the envelope calculation on this and concluded that even if they passed directly through them, they would at worst, have gotten a total dose for the trip of about 50 rads. Enough to maybe make them sick, but not kill anyone. This is assuming no solar flares while they were out there. </p>

<p>The most on one mission they got was 1.14 rads.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_visual_phenomena" target="_blank">&quot;sparkles&quot;</a> are primarily from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray#Types" target="_blank">intergalactic heavy ion cosmic rays</a>. Not from the protons and electrons of the Van Allen belts. </p>
<p>The The GCR's are much higher energy than solar particles and easily pass through the space craft walls with little loss of energy. During the Apollo era, some volunteers were irradiated with low levels of heavy ions from a cyclotron and reported the flashes. The Poly-carbonate helmets were also used as dosimeters on the astronauts return. They would etch them in Lye solution and it would etch along the tracks of the particles through the plastic. They could then count the number and see the paths they took.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Then you can research how the human body responds to and repairs mutations on the cellular level.</p>
<p>I worked at a research reactor and this number they threw out and was what was used as a guideline.  </p>
<p>With Radiation you want to minimize time around it, move away from it as a fast as you can and use appropriate shielding depending on the type of radiation.  We are bombarded with radiation every second of every day and our bodies have adapted to deal with that.  </p>
<p>That being said you want to minimize your exposure as much as you can.   The Van Allen belts are something that is no joke.  </p></div>		</li>
