			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, the main thing was that they couldn't buy property, obtain wages, have a bank account, invest, etc... At least not most women, some exceptions to be found.</p>
<p>Some women who lived single worked as servants / maids simply because it was largely the same type of work as they did for their husbands, and they got the same benefits (housing, food, etc), except for the security of marriage.</p>
<p>Edit, I should add that working as a servant or maid was really the last choice... at least during the Elizabethan period and earlier...</p>
<p>If you worked as a servant, the man of the house could do with you as he pleased.  If you refused, you would be thrown out into the cold.  If you didn't refuse him, and you got pregnant, <em>you</em>, the woman, would be in deep trouble.  The man of the house wouldn't, he could say anything about you the woman, and his word was accepted as truth... the woman didn't really have the right to argue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Single women COULD ALWAYS own property. Married women were stripped of this right in England during the enlightenment, NOT the Middle Ages. </p>
<p>The man of the house didn't get free reign to rape whoever he wanted. In the Middle Ages, virtually every child in a parish had a recognized father. Otherwise, the parish was responsible for paying for the baby. Married men had to pay for their bastards--and they would get caught cheating that way, too. It was her word against his, and when taking his side meant public money had to be spent, the magistrates believed her!  Also, marriage required no witnesses--only a promise between couples. If a girl turned up pregnant and tells the magistrate that you said you were married and even one witness saw the two of you sneaking into the woods...guess what?  You're married. </p>
<p>Don't conflate standards many centuries apart. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Women could work as servants though, that would usually have been acceptable I believe. Though that depends on the woman having some knowledge of how to behave in a nice house and of the work she'll be asked to do, and that there are people actually hiring servants in the area. Also, serving maids were usually strictly single. If they did find a husband they'd be expected to leave. </p>
<p>Teachers and governesses were also usually (single) women but that would have depended on some education, so they would have to be from a family with the money to educate them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes - I also have an ancestor (and probably more that I don't know about) who was very much in the same situation.</p>
<p>But I don't think it's quite right to say that women could not work. Women (and men) were stuck in rigid gender roles, with only men allowed to participate in financial transactions. But women could and did work - they just did so inside the home. A wife was expected to cook, clean and raise the children (not to mention endure the rigors of frequent pregnancy and childbirth). In an era before washing machines, restaurants and one-stop supermarkets, &quot;women's work&quot; was both labor-intensive and very necessary.</p></div>		</li>
