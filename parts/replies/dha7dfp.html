<p>Retailers that take credit cards from your mom and pop shop all the way to Walmart pay about 2.9% per transaction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's actually fairly high - many businesses pay less for processing, and companies Walmart's size definitely aren't paying that much.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If they didn't have to pay the cc transaction fees, they could double their profit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an oversimplification. A lot of people spend more money when they use cards, so that would change, and cash still has costs associated, including armored car pickup, or else employee time for depositing. Plus there's greater employee theft with more cash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Exactly. </p>
<p>Micro businesses, sure, its cheaper for cash. Businesses of any scale (ie, have employees or enough money to be worth a felony) do not process cash or checks for free.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Add in that corporations that size can also have their own banks (see Walmart Canada Bank) and offer credit accounts to their customers, they are not paying anywhere near that amount in fees. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am one who pays off my CC in full every month.  If Vendor A decided to stop taking credit cards, and Vendor B had similar prices and products/services (but still takes CC transactions); then I go to vendor B.  I don't like carrying cash, only saving money would motivate me to do so.  If retailers push back, they better do so in unison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a debit card you're taking cash out of your account at the point of purchase, and losing the ability to make interest off that amount. With a credit card you're earning interest on your money until you pay off the balance. Personally I prefer credit cards because I have an itemized list of all the things I've spent money on which comes in handy as a self employed person for doing taxes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is inaccurate. Cash is not free to process, but it is generally a fixed cost (slippage and transport), versus credit cards which scale.</p>
<p>Ideally, companies could stop accepting cash altogether and lower their processing fees (no more armored cars, less slippage).</p></div>		</li>
