			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I remember reading that those soldiers were put their on purpose to test the effects of radiation without them knowing. Its not to far fetched considering all the shady shit the us government have done, like testing anthrax in a subway on civilians. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was not anthrax. The test was done with bacillus globigi (BG). It is a simulant for anthrax that forms spores like anthrax but is generally considered safe. However, it can be a problem with the very young, very old, or the imune compromised. So not purely without risk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. My wife’s grandfather was there for one(maybe more?) of these tests. He says, looking back, that they were probably testing effects of radiation in them, but they were just following orders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In one of my radiation biology classes, I remember my professor saying that they were also testing the psychological effects of a nuclear blast on soldiers and how it effects their cohesion. Obviously a nuclear war was a risk after the Soviets developed their own bombs, so the US wanted to make sure their soldiers were still capable of fighting effectively. Of course they were also studying radiation effects on a variety of things as well, including the soldiers.</p></div>		</li>
