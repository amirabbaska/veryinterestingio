			<div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter, being comprised mostly of gas and liquid, will likely see some pretty drastic changes from the sun's expansion, even if it isn't consumed. It is possible that Jupiter will be completely destroyed by changes in temperature, gravity, and general solar activity, when the sun expands.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How certain are you of that?  With modern precision instruments, both terrestrial and space bound, occultation events can be measured with an insane amount of accuracy.</p></div>		</li>
