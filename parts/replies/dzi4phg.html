			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto this: </p>
<p>Pigeons are our oldest domesticated bird. It isn't surprising that the escaped pigeons that became feral pigeons and menace our cities have retained their lack of fear of humans.</p>
<p>Dogs: 15-40+ thousand years. Tame. Fully domesticated.</p>
<p>Cats: ~10000 years. Tame. Semi-domesticated.</p>
<p>domestic/feral Pigeons: ~10000 years. diverse (plummage, messenger, pet) domestication. Pet variety is tame.</p>
<p>Cows/pigs: 10,000 years. Not Tame.</p>
<p>Domestication is a long process, and we generally breed for tame, docile, predicable, friendly behaviour (though we sometimes choose other things instead, like chickens producing eggs more often, or cows/pigs being bigger and able to live in higher density without fighting, or guard animals with selective/trainable aggression). The lack of fear of humans isn't just because dogs and pigeons and cats grow up around us, it is also that they have been specially bred for thousands of years that way. Their genes have slowly been altered in ways we can't yet pin down to be more &quot;tame&quot;.</p>
<p>Domestication is a genetic process that changes the animal, they are diverging from the wild species (often purposefully by humans) to select for things like friendliness to humans, lack of fear of new places, and reduced aggression.</p>
<p>Sparrows and the like are slowly domesticating themselves to some degree by living in the city, but it pales in comparison to the effects of the dedicated breeding of pigeons and other animals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Domestication doesn't necesarily have to be a long process, for instance the [A Russian Zoologist Tried to Re-enact the domestication of dogs with foxes] (<a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/mans-new-best-friend-a-forgotten-russian-experiment-in-fox-domestication/" target="_blank">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/mans-new-best-friend-a-forgotten-russian-experiment-in-fox-domestication/</a>) in which they were tested once a month and only the most friendly 5% or so were bred further. Within a couple of generations the foxes started behaving more &quot;Dog-Like&quot; and even started wagging their tail at handlers, being almost completely tame. The line has been continuesly bred over the last 60 years or so, and you can even purchase these tame russian foxes. A Nevada based company called Sibfox [will handle the paperwork and fly the purchased fox over] (<a href="https://domesticatedsilverfox.weebly.com/aquiring-a-tame-fox.html" target="_blank">https://domesticatedsilverfox.weebly.com/aquiring-a-tame-fox.html</a>)  for about $7000. Evolution works at the speed of selection, so heavy bottlenecks and artificial selection can make this process relatively fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm ignoring the process of &quot;wild&quot; domestication, AKA an animal adapts to live close to humans. That is pretty limited as they never become &quot;tame&quot;, but just lose SOME fear towards humans (not enough fear of humans = bad survival, too much fear of humans = bad survival).</p>
<p>Real domestication starts when humans (or some other animal) take charge of how/which animals get to reproduce. The genes/traits that get selected for start being about what do humans want rather than just what lets you survive. So long as the animal can still reliably survive to a reproductive age and bear children, we can aggressively select for any trait we want, even if those traits are incredibly unhelpful and unhealthy (we could select for blindness, breathing problems, and missing limbs for example)</p>
<p>Lets take an example of real domestication:</p>
<p>Chickens.</p>
<p>The common feature in domestication is that there is a wild animal that we want to live with and can use for some function (food, pets, messenger animals, guard animals, milk, pack/transportation).</p>
<p>The initial domestication phase is repeatedly selecting each generation for that wild animal that lets it live near us and do its job better.</p>
<p>So we go from a wild animal (red junglefowl) to an initial domesticated near carbon copy (domestic chicken) that is less aggressive, reproduce faster, and rarely fear or attack humans. If we originally domesticate it for food, maybe it reproduces faster and more often, if we domesticate it for guarding/herding, maybe it also is less aggressive to other domestic animals and MORE aggressive to predators (mules/dogs for example). If it is load carrying, maybe it is also less fearful of weight being put on it, and new environments, and being ridden. </p>
<p>Then we continue domestication, refining the purpose of the animal. We might start selecting the chickens that are actually MORE aggressive towards other chickens, because we want to produce a variety that works for cock fights. Or we might select ones that don't care for their eggs as long, and produce eggs more often, so that we can eventually get to the ones that lay daily eggs. Or we might select ones that grow faster and bigger and stronger, and use them for meat.</p>
<p>That is the second stage of domestication, which is as far as we have gotten.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say there is a &quot;finished&quot;, or end point to domestication. You keep trying to refine the breed to reduce the things you don't like, and increase the things you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Google domesticated silver foxes and read about that project. Researchers in Russia took the silver fox, and attempted to both domesticate it, and see if they could do the opposite. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>!They succeeded, you can even buy domesticated silver foxes as pets now.!&lt;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;tame&quot; here: most cats are nervous of humans they don't know, and feral cats -- and particularly their offspring -- definitely don't regard humans as their friends. It's true that domestic cats have diverged enough to be regarded as a subspecies, but if you want to keep a pet cat or even dog, you'll really need one that has been used to being around humans from a very early age.</p></div>		</li>
