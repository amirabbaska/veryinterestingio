<p>I don't know much about ocean currents, but i'm sure there would be changes. It's not going to sit still.<br />
How does the shark know where the blood originated from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most animals follow concentration gradients. As the blood spreads out in the water, it becomes more diffuse the further away it goes. It's like playing the &quot;warmer/colder&quot; game with a friend when you're trying to find something: if the shark picks a direction to move and the smell grows stronger, it keeps moving that way. </p>
<p>However, you are right. There are currents in the water and there is turbulence that kind of breaks up the nice, even diffusion of the smell. This is where stuff gets really complicated, and scientists don't fully understand it yet. Lots of animals, like bees!, have weird ways of getting smell data from odor plumes. In fact, male manduca moths will be unable to fly towards the source of an attractive female smell unless the smell is already broken up into these fragments called odor plumes. It's weird and super cool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tracking dogs play off the &quot;scent cone&quot;. A vee formation forms as the scent cone spreads further from the source; the dog meanders back n forth to the edges of the cone and can determine how close they are to the source as the cone narrows. Neat stuff.</p></div>		</li>

<p>edit: My thinking: If you're in a large backyard and you smell dogshit, what would you do? Sniff it out. However, It's becoming apparent my comment is causing everyone to draw different analogies in which you use your nose and I'm not sure what the point of all this is. This has officially become a pointless, hypothetical clusterfuck and I'm going to extend an apology to everyone whose time I've wasted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except, I don't do that now.  I smell cookies, and make a series of educated guesses as to where they might be, like the kitchen.  But if someone were to move the cookies to a different room, I'd just be wandering from room to room trying to determine in which room the scent was strongest.</p>
<p>This appears to be a fundamentally different behaviour than a tracking dog, out shark.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its more like a shark can smell one drop of blood in a million drops of water(25 gallons or so). so if you mixed one drop blood in 25 gallons of water, a shark could still tell there was blood in the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>would you be so kind to elaborate how they &quot;locate the source&quot;? by following the trail? is there always a trail? or is it more like certain aspects about the particles? like: this little concentration must mean it's about this far away? </p></div>		</li>
