			<div class="markdown"><p>Each iOS device has a unique public/private key - with the public keys being stored on Apple's servers. Say you have 3 iOS devices which will receive the same message from someone....what happens is that Apple sends the 3 public keys of each of your devices to the sender. The sender's iOS device then duplicates/encrypts the message 3 times using each public key - this means 3 separate messages will be stored/sent to Apple's servers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah! That makes sense but seems like a grossly inefficient especially with some users having an endless collection of Apple Devices. Thank you so much for explaining!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not only possible, it's straightforward. There's nothing &quot;Apple specific&quot; about public key cryptography.</p>
<p>That said, if not porting the app keeps people buying iPhones, do you really think Apple will do it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, the communication protocol Apple uses is proprietary. With that, supporting other platforms would require a significant amount of development time....even for Apple. However, their choice to use a proprietary protocol only shows how keen they are to limiting this service to their ecosystem of products. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would definitely be possible for Apple to do. However, Apple has gone every which way to ensure their iMessage services are limited to a subset of devices. Since the protocol Apple uses is proprietary....reverse engineering it outside of Apple is a difficult task to say the least. <a href="https://neosmart.net/blog/2018/imessage-for-windows/" target="_blank">https://neosmart.net/blog/2018/imessage-for-windows/</a></p></div>		</li>
