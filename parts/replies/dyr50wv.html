<p>You cannot avoid harvesting the energy the alpha particles carry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, I was confused with the Q&gt;1 part.</p>
<p>Yes, ignition is &quot;infinite Q&quot; but you reach it by getting the Q value above a certain point where the energy from alpha particles can replace the auxiliary power.</p>
<p>You still harvest alpha particle energy, but a lot of it heats the plasma and the rest goes to the first wall, while the neutrons are all harvested in the blanket. I was just simplifying.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm guessing this is more of a physics term than an energy industry term right? It's possible something could reach &quot;infinite Q&quot; (which sounds like a great TNG episode title BTW) but still be useless because the &quot;well-to-wheel&quot; math still sucks, right? </p>
<p>Are there estimates for how much power it would have to produce to cover the material gathering and refinement, maintenance, infrastructure, and other indirect energy inputs and put out a cost competitive amount of usable electrical/thermal energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The remaining power infrastructure wouldn't need much power.</p>
<p>Cost competitiveness is a different thing. Construction of the power plant should be the largest cost, but it is unclear how much a power plant would cost. ITER and DEMO will figure that out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The past ones had relatively poor ones, but that wasn't their main purpose.  <a href="http://www.anthropoceneinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PWfus6_03-06-2.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.anthropoceneinstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/PWfus6_03-06-2.jpg</a><br />
ITER and DEMO aim at 10 (in pure heat) and 25 (in electricity) respectively.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have a read of <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/03/03/a-star-in-a-bottle" target="_blank">this article</a>. It’s long, and a few years old now, but gives an excellent insight into the challenges they’re facing. Well worth it if you have the time to read.</p>
<p>The original design for ITER could have meant it was the last experimental reactor required, but it was scaled back pretty significantly for financial reasons.  If it was receiving ‘Apollo’ level funding, fusion would be much closer to the horizon.  Unfortunately, people don’t care that much (yet), so politicians can’t justify the expenditure. </p></div>		</li>
