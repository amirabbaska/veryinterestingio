<p>The factorial function only strictly works for natural numbers ({0, 1, 2, ... })</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a key point. For a function to be differentiable (meaning its derivative exists) in a point, it must also be continuous in that point. Since x! only works for {0, 1, 2, ... }, the result of the factorial can also only be a natural number. So the graph for x! is made of dots, which means it's not continuous and therefore non-differentiable.</p>
<p>I learned that natural numbers don't include 0 but apparently that isn't universally true. TIL</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure it makes sense to talk about continuity... N is a subset of R and inherits a topology (it's just the discrete topology), and you can talk about continuous functions between arbitrary topological spaces. In this case the gamma function is a function between the space N (with the discrete topology) to itself, and it's continuous... as are all functions defined on a discrete set.</p>
<p>However for differentiability you do need an open subset of R (or R^(n)) somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's completely untrue. Continuity is a topological notion that's independent of the real numbers entirely. Also, the factorial function being continuous depends on what topology you're considering on the natural numbers. Addressing the differentiability aspect as I did elsewhere: You can do differential geometry on any scheme. The real numbers are completely unrelated to defining an appropriate notion of differentiability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's convention. Some people decide its more useful in their writing for 0 to be considered a 'natural number' and some people decided that it would be cleaner to have the 'natural numbers' mean the positive whole numbers 1,2,3,...</p>
<p>It's just a matter of definitions, as there is no good reason to decide if 0 is a natural number or not.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) Just because it is defined for positive integers.</p>
<p>2) The typical meaning of the function is &quot;how many ways can one re-order n items&quot;, and the both the input (how many items) and answer (how many ways) will be integers. E.g. we can re-order the letters A,B, and C  3•2•1=6 ways, to wit: ABC, ACB, BCA, BAC, CBA, CAB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a stupid clash of conventions. Schools usually say that zero isn't natural because they want to sound scientific with fancy words like &quot;natural&quot;, but zero isn't introduced until something like 4-5th grade, depending on your living place. On the other hand, in mathematics it makes literally no sense to exclude zero from naturals, 0,1,2,3 etc is literally the most natural notion of numbers you can define (see: cardinality). Besides, if you exclude zero that you are left without a name for this 0,1,2,3,... set, you would need extra confusing terminology for a sinple case... it would be a mess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Erm, no it doesn't. That's just the recurrence n! = n (n-1)! and it does not provide a clean way to calculate n! for any n other than the positive integers. It provides a way to extend results, for example once you know that (-1/2)! = √(π) you can know that (1/2)! = √(π)/2 and (3/2)! = 3√(π)/4, but there's no clean way to get the square root of pi out of that recurrence in the first place.</p></div>		</li>
