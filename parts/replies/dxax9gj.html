<p>In conductive material, any acquired charge is spread out over the surface of the mass, with more charge density around sharp corners and some other geometry.  More surface area means more room for charge to occupy, and more sharp corners, of which some are designed for this purpose on aircraft and spacecraft, will dissipate charge faster.  </p>
<p>The frame of a vehicle like this ( or even a regular car for that matter ) provides a good proxy for the ground since their physical properties can allow enough static charge to bleed off safely so as to not damage the on-board systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add some too!  When the two floating grounds come in contact there is an equilibration that causes a large rush of current from the higher potential floating ground to the lower one.  That's actually what happens when you arc across air from touching a door knob on a dry winter day!  Same thing happens with planes when they land (grounding through the tires) and space ships when they dock.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The mass of the earth is significant because it is an insulator.  Unlike conductors, insulate materials can hold charges within their volume, not just on the surface.  Due to the relative size of the earth, it can soak up more charge than we would ever need it to.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ever look at the trailing edges of aircraft wings, especially the ailerons (which roll the plane), you’ll see ~6 inch protrusions that look like antennae. They’re called static wicks and use this principle to dissipate static charge. In some planes they’re made of a hard material. In smaller ones they actually end in tiny hairs. Bigger airplanes may have many of these all over the plane.</p></div>		</li>
