			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't really class of something is a &quot;new&quot; flame. It's like hooking a hose up to a water tank (candle wax in this analogy&quot; and asking if the stream coming out is the same stream or a new one. The answer is basically, it's the same thing made up of new stuff, constantly changing but with the properties staying more or less the same. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One constant flame in most situations, but you can contrive all sorts of exceptions if you like.  The main thing fire requires is that heat can get from the products to the reactants.  You can play tricks like cutting off the air supply but returning it before things cool off too much.</p></div>		</li>
