			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't think of blood flow like a single loop from arteries to veins. Think of it like a ladder where it flows up one side, across the rungs, then down the other side. If you cut off the top few feet of the ladder, you still have the rest of the rungs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a stroke when I was a kid and angiograms showed the carotid artery thin over time as my body gave up on trying to use it. It's because of these ladders/branches that my body was able to route blood around the blockage, so I have no lasting effects. Now I am fine but have no back up so if I lose another artery to my head I'm screwed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is an ELI5 version of OP's main points.  </p>
<p>Your blood hits all sorts of dead ends as it reaches the tips of your fingers or toes etc. When you lose a hand for example it just means that the same thing that used to happen at the tips of your fingers now happens at the stump. </p>
<p>It's not a big loop of veins and arteries that gets messed up if you cut off a section. Dead ends are common.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>RIP your inbox and I'm too lazy to read the entire thread. </p>
<p>Think of your arteries as a hose. Now imagine if that hose had thousands of tiny hoses connected to that main hose that spread out over an area. So if a part of the hose gets cut, and sealed, the water still flows throughout all the other tiny hoses. </p>
<p>The water still gets moved, but it's now being forced inside of smaller hoses at a faster rate. The tiny hoses will expand to accept the larger flow of water they are receiving. If it's too much, they might burst (aneurysm). Overall though, the pressure should normalize once the body adjusts to the change. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Always wondered and maybe it's a stupid question but does someone who has an amputation have the same amount of blood in their body as someone with a full body? Or does their body regulate for the loss of the limb/muscle etc </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, they'll have a bit less. But not that much less.</p>
<p>Blood volume and content is mostly under the control of your kidneys (and that is a vast simplification, but...) Kidneys feel blood pressure too low? They release hormones to increase blood pressure. Kidneys feel like they're not getting enough oxygen? They release hormones to tell your body to make more red blood cells. </p>
<p>In the very short term, you can make significant changes. In the long term, not so much (if the kidneys work - very different if someone is on dialysis).</p></div>		</li>
