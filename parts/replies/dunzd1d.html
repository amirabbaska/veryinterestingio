			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess you are assuming that homeopathic users also don't use actual medicine, which may not be true. I know people who would try a homeopathic remedy first and then go for the medication after if the symptoms didn't go away, all in an attempt to not over medicate over something minor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, what I meant is that a person who's willing to believe and use homeopathic treatment does not know how the scientific method works and why is effective, in standard medicine, to produce efficient treatments. Many may use both,but they don't really understand the difference between the two; if they did, they would see homeopathy for what it really yes (water and sugar pills) and would not use it.</p></div>		</li>
