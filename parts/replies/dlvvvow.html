			<div class="markdown"><p>I have celiac disease! That's an interesting thought, maybe I got accidental gluten exposure and that is related... It's not an allergy, but it does cause an immune response. Hmm. </p>
<p>Thanks for the input! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My sister also has celiac disease and when she eats gluten she gets the darkest circles under her eyes! They usually last for a while, at least a week, sometimes two. It's definitely a celiac symptom</p>
<p>Make sure you check EVERYTHING even beauty or health products for gluten. It sucks how much stuff it's in but there're alternatives to 99% of products</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am gluten intolerant as well, and have had dark circles my entire life. My doctor has chalked it up to a mixture of gluten intolerance, seasonal allergies, and terrible sinuses via genetics. I've also had iron deficiency issues before, so that adds to it as well. </p>
<p>If you continue to avoid gluten and make sure you're eating enough nutrients, it should go away eventually! Especially because your intestines will heal as you continue to be gluten free, which I'm sure you know means you'll be able to absorb nutrients. However, it'd be a good idea to take supplements like iron, B12, and vitamin D since your body is gonna have a hard time for a bit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had dark circles under my eyes all my life due to some pretty insane childhood allergies. I've lost count of how many times people have asked me if I'm high because of them. :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Just asked my girlfriend yesterday why I have these dark patches and she said its because I never take my allergy pills. She's an MD</p>
<p>Edit: they're called allergic shiners</p></div>		</li>
