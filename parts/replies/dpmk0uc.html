			<div class="markdown"><p>when I was a kid my dad let me touch a long piece of grass to the electric fence.  of course that is specifically designed not to kill but I learned a little something. I mean I didn't learn enough not to put a 9v battery on my tongue or similar with a 9v power supply.  I guess I did a lot of dumb stuff huh?</p>
<p>but yeah, if you're not sure if you should touch it, don't touch it (phrasing)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While youre correct in that fucking up your heartbeat is how electricity kills, that is merely the direct way... A more frequent way people die as a result of electricity is for someone to receive a minor shock, spasm, and fall from a ladder or work platform to their death... Shit even falling from standing height can kill you if you land wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fuck! During moving last summer I managed to get shocked not once but twice. By a full 230v powerline. First time I was working on the light which I thought was turned off. Launched my screwdriver across the room leaving it impaled into the floor. Got stuck with my hand clamped on the line but falling off the minor step pulled me loose. I swore very loudly. Didn’t feel right all day. I googled it though and results didn’t show me anything. I was all alone in both the house and for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>Merely two weeks later I’m putting up wallpaper in the new house and had taken off the covers of the plugs and switches. As I’m trailing the corner with a knife to cut the paper straight my other hand blindly trails the wall. Right into the exposed wires. Didn’t throw the knife that time but my reaction was so strong my SO thought I cut off my finger or something.</p>
<p>Ever since then I’m afraid of anything that has (exposed) wires. It makes me feel horrid again thinking about it. Didn’t go to the doctor either time tho. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(edited to clarify some things for people who are whining) At one of my old jobsites, an electrician was <del>fishing some wire in</del> feeding a metal &quot;fish tape&quot; into a conduit that opened up to a room with a live 600v panel.. elevator machinery or a fire pump or something. The fish made contact and shocked him but he was good enough to get back up and walk around. He drove himself to the hospital and after a CT scan, they found that the shock had done irreparable damage to him (<strong>I AM NOT A DOCTOR, I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA WHAT KIND OF INJURY HE SUSTAINED</strong>) and he would die in less than a week. (<strong>THIS IS WHAT HE TOLD EVERYBODY WHEN HE CAME BACK THAT DAY</strong>)</p>
<p>He went back to the jobsite the next day and said his goodbyes to everybody. It was the saddest day ever... He was like pleading with people to work carefully and stuff. Lot of onions were cut that day. He died a few days later :(</p>
<p>More clarification: I'm not an electrician, I just get subcontracted by them to install some of the low-voltage fire equipment, and program/VI fire panels. This guy wasn't a friend of mine, just an acquaintance on this particular jobsite. My company doesn't work with that electrical company any more. On the day of the accident, I heard about it from other electricians, and I saw the guy on the day he came back, but didn't talk to him. All the subsequent info about him, I heard through his (then) coworkers, who are still friends of mine.</p>
<p>You don't have to believe me, and I don't care if you do, or not. It's like third-hand info at this point.</p>
<p>To everybody saying &quot;that would never happen to a licensed electrician&quot; think again... not to tarnish this guy's memory, but there are a lot of dumbasses out there. Any number of factors can cause people to cut corners, get sloppy and make mistakes. Spend some time in the field, and you'll realize this pretty quick.</p>
<p>Some people are suggesting, the shock might have caused the trip to the hospital and the need for a CT scan, which revealed some pre-existing problem. That sounds pretty plausible, as this guy was in his 50s. Again, I don't know what it was, but I was told he was going to die (and subsequently did die, a few days later) as a result of the shock he received.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Was fixing some electric appliance, hit something live,got a big shock but got it working. Later that evening, in cinema with girlfriend, my heart started to go funny - went to hospital and they kept me in with a monitor attached until the rhythm settled back to normal.
Much more careful now.</p></div>		</li>
