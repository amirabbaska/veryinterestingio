			<div class="markdown"><p>In some industries, the presence of a middle-man is a regulatory issue. In my state, for instance, alcohol sales have to go through a very arcane system of distributorships. It's literally illegal for a manufacturer to sell directly to a retail outlet. There's an exemption for on-premises consumption sold BY the manufacturer (so we can still do brew pubs, for instance). But the bar down the street can't go to the brew pub directly for a keg, they have to have a distributor between them.</p>
<p>I'm not certain what public good that law is supposed to be ensuring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not for the public good. 3 Tier laws were originally put in place as a way of separating the producer, distributor, and retailer in an effort to keep the mafia from taking over (or at least make it tougher), and also to prevent &quot;tied houses&quot; like in the UK that only serve one brand of beer.</p>
<p>Now days, the distributors are often the largest players in a given state, and they use their lobbyists to keep the laws the same because if the brewery can sell directly to the bar down the road the distributor is losing out on their 30% cut for being the middleman.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In your country. The three tier system you describe is the liberal system, as compared to states that decided they were gonna do it directly themselves.</p>

<p>It was the sugar-coating to the end of prohibition for the mob to get them to go along. They became distributors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more how much work does the manufacturer want to do to sell their wares. They can sell to 15 accounts who will then re-sell their product to 500-5000 different stores, or they can do it themselves. To do it themselves, they need a larger sales staff that is trained to deal with smaller amounts, that are either located regionally or travel regularly. </p>
<p>Yeah in time it might get to the point where it's cheap enough not to have a dedicated business to sell for you, but not yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add in general terms, manufacturers in various markets will also have contracts with wholesalers/distributors that prohibit them from selling to end users, or even anyone that isn't an authorized dealer. </p>
<p>They do this to protect their dealers, so they aren't undercut by a wholesaler buying in bulk and selling direct at low markup.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do get that, but if I was going to make a $5,000 purchase of 4 kinds of ammo, used the catalogue and itemized it, there's no reason why I would ever want to go to Walmart. Sure, it wouldn't be worth the phone call to Winchester, but to a mid level distributor it should be moderately attractive.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I've been &quot;working the industrial sector&quot; for years because when need a 3-inch quick connect air coupler, home depot won't stock it, and will refuse to order it, so where exactly am I supposed to go?</p>
<p>Lots of places I deal with have minimum order and that's fine, I can buy $300 in metric cap screws, but places that refuse me just piss me right off.</p>
<p>Edit: You know, I was just thinking of it in terms of illegal drug trade, and it makes way more sense. Sure, you're not going to deal directly with the cartels, but if you're trying to buy 3 kilos of cocaine, are you going to buy from a street level dealer? Every time you go up the ladder, you get a better deal, more pure (and arguably safer) product, with less handing damage and risk of capture.</p></div>		</li>
