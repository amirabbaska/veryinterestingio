			<div class="markdown"><p>probably about 5% or more. Anything less and it would be hard to discern from the differences we have in water weight throughout the day. It would also depend on how its compared. For example, if its a gradual increase (such as when taking off in an airplane), it might be easier to detect than if you were asked every morning 'Do you feel heavier or lighter than the last time your woke up?'</p></div>		</li>

<p>Perception of gravity is complicated and I haven't found any studies of perception of small changes in gravity. (There are a lot of studies on transitions into and out of microgravity.)</p>
<p>I think I would notice a 2-3% change in my weight, but it's hard to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your weight fluctuates due to hydration throughout the day. A 2-4 pound variation due to water weight throughout the day is pretty typical. For that 180 pound person, that is equivalent to 1-2%. Do you feel noticeably heavier at night compared to morning? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might notice it if it was a sudden change.  In this case it would be a gradual change over many hours or days.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I could not find any information on what the minimum g force is that can be perceived by humans. Considering how easily you can detect acceleration of an elevator or driving over a hill in a car I would imagine it doesn't take much. Even so I doubt you would ever be able to notice a difference in gravity from one point on earth to another because of how long you would have to travel between them. At less than 1% difference between the most extreme points as mentioned above, that's got to feel roughly the same as your difference in weight before and after displacing a modestly sized turd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I climbed to the summit of Chimbo and also Denali, (relatively close to the North Pole) and now I wish I'd done some experiments. Thanks for the info. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a friend who lived in Ecuador for some time and he told me of his hike up Chimborazo.  At least it's my recollection that his story made it sound more like a hike than a climb.    The same can not be said of Denali, of course.  That one makes you earn it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Denali is a little bit more technical and way harder to get to but Chimbo is definitely a mountaineering peak requiring gear. You can bring noobs up - but they have a lot to learn on the way - it's an axe and crampons kind of trip for sure, rope too. It also presents a decent acclimatization challenge as it's pretty tall - the only higher ones I've summited are all Himalayan peaks.  The whole hike/trek/climb nomenclature isn't very well defined though... some of the 'trekking peaks' in Nepal are legit technical climbs. Over there it's actually determined by political designation which has to do with permitting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is part of the reason that NASA does a lot of launches (or at least used to) from Cape Canaveral (the other part being the ocean is there in case anything starts falling down)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and it's why the ESA does their launches from French Guyana in South America.  1000 mph of orbital velocity for free is a beautiful thing.</p></div>		</li>
