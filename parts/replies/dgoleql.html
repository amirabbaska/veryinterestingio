			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;...somehow irritated the cilia&quot; is the response I've always had medical professionals give to me. (I used to be REALLY bad at swallowing pills)</p>
<p>Cilia are like tiny hairs that line your throat, they arent quite hairs because they are living cells if im not mistaken. I don't exactly know their purpose, but they are sensory organelles, so they're very sensitive to touch... most of the time a sore throat is due to irritated cilia.</p>
<p>Basically if anything gets stuck on them and your throat mucus cant wash it away, they puff up and do weird things in order to get that thing off. They also get irritated if they aren't lubricated with mucus.</p>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>when you swallow a pill, it could scratch away the mucus lining and cause the cilia to get upset because cilia are bourgeoisie lil shits that need their mucus. Under normal circumstances (not being sick) the cilia will usually get covered with mucus again within a few minutes or hours. I'm guessing this is the most common cause of discomfort from swallowing pills.</p>
</li>
<li>Or a little speck of the coating could've gotten stuck on the cilia and caused the cilia to wage a war on said speck, which could take hours or even a day or two to resolve.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not trying to piss on your chips or anything but cillia are only found within the trachea and bronchi, not in the throat/oesophagus, so your explanation doesn't make sense unless you somehow aspirated the pill which would cause far more issues than irritating the cillia</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, i looked it up and you're right... atleast for the kind
of cilia i was talking about that needs mucus lubrication (motile cilia)</p>
<p>Primary non-motile cilia is a part of every cell in the body, and is longer in the generally more pronounced in the wet parts of the body like throat, nose, and mouth (especially if you're a smoker). So i think my explanation still makes some sense, but not nearly as much as i thought...</p>
<p>I've got like 3 nurses to yell at now for misinforming me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously some confirmation bias regarding #1, but there are message boards filled with people that have had problems with lodged pills.</p>
<p>Certain antibiotic capsules get lodged and then the contents get released, damaging the esophageal lining.</p>
<p>My wife had an esophageal ulcer and it was not the first time the doctor had seen that due to an antibiotic capsule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happened to me in college with a dose of tetracycline.  They're horse pill sized anyway, and if you don't take a decent drink of water to wash it down it can get lodged.  The first and last time I'll let that happen.  It felt like the back of my throat was on fire for a good two weeks after.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>She said swallowing food was agony and she got some codeine syrup prescribed to numb her throat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Now i remembered thet time that i felt a (kinda big) amino supplement pill stuck behind my throat while i was in the toilet, and i felt like burping which was a big mistake. Powder came out of my nose and mouth and my throat was full of it.
After that i can't afford to think it's psychosomatic. :/</p></div>		</li>
