			<div class="markdown"><p>Differently put;  the problem is political will.  If Israel (in cooperation with Jordan and the Palestinian Authority) can afford the finances, so can California.  Israeli experts who have consulted with California are baffled at the lack of emphasis on this in California.  Communitarian societies like Israel make it a priority to invest in common goods, like infrastructure, while individualist societies, like California, are allowing their infrastructure to crumble.  It’s just a question of priority.  The California attitude is “we’ll worry about it tomorrow”.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that's a bit simplistic. It's true that California has been eager to kick the can down the road, but there are other reasons for that, at least that they give publicly. CA environmental regulations are some of the stiffest in the world. Any coastal desalination facility needs to jump through dozens of hoops to get even preliminary approval. The environmental impact studies alone can take 5-10 years.....and when they state the obvious (that any desalination plant on the coast will inevitably produce pollution) the hippies in CA go ballistic and protest it. They only want their water to come from melting snow capsnin the Sierra Nevadas, but aren't willing to even think about the fact that that water is not a sustainable source. </p>
<p>CA needed to be doing the desalination due diligence back in 1990. Their entire water management system is predicated on a study that measured three straight years of higher than average rainfall, too. The whole thing is a mess. </p></div>		</li>
