			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yes, but that arbitrary number would represent the same speed as ours.  That still doesn't answer the fundamental question of why the speed of light isn't much faster or slower (and it will probably be a long time before anything can).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm struggling to understand what conflation you're making - where do x and y factor into it, and how does that relate to c?</p>
<p>Time dilation effects don't say &quot;you move slower through time&quot; - relative to the observer, you're still moving through time at the same rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/qpwoy is obviously drawing an analogy as if spacetime were a two dimensional plane. In reality there are four dimensions (x, y, z, and t) that our velocity can be in.</p>
<p>And yes, for the observer traveling c time still appears to be passing at the same rate, but then from their frame of reference they are moving through an infinitely foreshortened space (i.e. they are not moving through space at all). On the other hand, an observer stationary relative to the first sees them moving entirely through space with time dilated infinitely (i.e. they are not moving through time).</p>
<p>I would like to see more comments on this way of understanding c and the movement through spacetime because so far it's the explanation here that makes the most sense to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As far as why it's the specific number? That's just Humans defining things. Every measurement is arbitrarily. The speed of light could have been defined as 747,636,194,395 insert-some-made-up-unit-here.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't think that was the question. The question is what causes the speed at which things move to be limited by that speed. Why not faster or slower. And the the person you responded to correctly pointed out the answer is that we do not know.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Because the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle in Euclidean space is provably a constant with that decimal expansion.</p></div>		</li>
