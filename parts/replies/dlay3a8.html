			<div class="markdown"><p>The Jordan aquifer in the Midwest usually is drinkable unfiltered since the sandstone filters the water quite well. Where I live now is river pulled water and chemically treated, so yeah, it depends on where you live. I remember having a non-potable and potable water source in Arizona and California, so it isn't unheard of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AZ resident (and previous CA resident). All of my water sources have been potable. No non-potable sources unless you live in an area that irrigates, and even then you wouldn't be able to run it to your bathrooms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Come to think of it, I was probably in wine country in California when I saw the &quot;do not drink water from the hoses.&quot; I don't remember anything like that in LA or Silicon Valley (I kind of lived in both places, but urban apartments in both cases, but the LA one had a courtyard that was like a small park).</p>
<p>As for Arizona, same warning signs in a resort I stayed at, meaning it was Sedona or outside of Phoenix. I asked why and they said they had an ordinance that required it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in a city with old sewer lines that are being replaced. As a result our wastewater bill is 2x that of our water usage (broken out on our bill) in order to pay for the replacements. But they calculate it based on our water consumption.  A grey water system will not only reduce our water bill but our sewage bill too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly what's stopping people from doing it is the cost of installing and maintaining such a system. In most places it is legal to use grey water for this purpose.    </p></div>		</li>
