			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming they stole thousands of dollars worth of stuff from random stores. I'm sure my banks (Especially Chase, I love them!) would immediately credit me back while they do their mini investigation if someone were to steal like $10 in candy bars lol.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would not be concerned. Your credit card company will take care of all of that  with the merchants with little issues, they do this every single day and have vast departments of people to work these fraud issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know I mean I'm a good customer. I have a very good relationship with all of my credit card/banking companies. </p>
<p>But I see a lot of posts on reddit on how their &quot;credit was ruined&quot; and stuff. I just wonder what happens in the majority of these instances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not always true, I had my card stolen and had to pay it off. I sirens over a year fighting it but it was running my credit and they said they wouldn't do anything.</p>
<p>They usually cover it, but not always.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>2 weeks ago someone stole my card info and used an app they created to pull $230 from my account via in app purchases, basically to cash out my account. Chase stopped the charges at $120 and called me. They refunded all of the charges and issued me a new card same day in a branch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They wouldn't credit you back, the charges would just be gone and you'd get a new card.</p></div>		</li>

<p>depends on the whole situation</p>

<p>Lol</p>
<p>I guess what matters is they stole your ID and used it, doesn't matter if they bought candy bars or RDX. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see how that depends at all. The first scenario isn't going to ruin your credit, so there wouldn't be anything to fix.</p></div>		</li>
