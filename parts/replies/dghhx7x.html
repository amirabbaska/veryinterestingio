			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. The thing with me is I remain completely functional, most people don't even know I've blacked out. It's like my body takes over before I get sloppy lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this same way if I drink a six pack too quickly. After 4 beers I'm buzzed and good. Two later and I don't remember the other four or the strange conversation with my next door neighbor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup pretty much this exactly. I would be able to keep on drinking all night, more or less functionally. That was most of the time, but there were also plenty of not-so-functional days mixed in there. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can totally relate to this. Was a co-organiser of a pool party, told myself not to drink too much because I had to coordinate the staff and make sure nothing goes wrong. I drank like half of what my usual max tolerance was, then I blacked out from 12am till 3am. I asked the others the day after, they all said I was acting normal and even helped move some heavy stuffs around.</p></div>		</li>
