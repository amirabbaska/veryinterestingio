			<p>How fragile is obsidian? Hypothetically, if you made a katana blade fully out of obsidian, how long would it last? How much force would it take before breaking? Would a carbon fiber or titanium blade with an obsidian edge fair better?</p>		</li>

			<p>One hit and it would shatter. Imagine if you had a sword made out of glass, that's basically what would happen. Obsidian was used most commonly in arrow heads<br><br>The Aztecs had a sort of obsidian sword called a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macuahuitl" target="_blank">macuahuitl</a> which was basically just a hardwood club with several obsidian blades embedded inside it. Unfortunately the last original Macuahuitl was destroyed in a fire</p>		</li>

			<p>It's similar to glass.<br><br>Mesoamerican weapons using obsidian and other ceramics functioned because they used relatively small pieces, and also because Mesoamericans did not use metal armor and most enemies were relatively soft targets (though it is a mistake to think they were just shirtless barbarians. mesoamericans DID have forms of armor which were well adapted to their battlefield conditions and local resources).</p>		</li>

			<p>It's extremely hard and, like most materials with &quot;normal&quot; properties, is thus extremely brittle. That's why nobody uses obsidian knives or scalpels. It's volcanic glass that'll shatter into very very sharp bits with too much pressure.</p>		</li>

			<p>What makes diamond able to be very sharp <em>and</em> hard enough to not shatter like glass, while obsidian can't?</p>		</li>

			<p>Even diamond is brittle compared to metal. You could break a large diamond. Consider that you've never actually held a large diamond, nor hit one with a hammer. <br><br>Also diamonds don't have ionic bonds. Carbon forms covalent bonds.</p>		</li>

			<p>Then what does it mean when people refer to diamond as being the hardest substance on earth?</p>		</li>

			<p>There are different meanings of the word &quot;hard.&quot; Some people assume that it means &quot;toughness.&quot; That's not what it means in this case. <br><br>When people say that diamond is the hardest substance, they are saying that it is extremely difficult to <em>scratch</em> or <em>indent</em>. Most materials would deform before being able to deform the surface of a diamond. In fact, if you tried to use talc to cut a diamond, you'd just end up cutting the talc instead. The edge would immediately be lost and all mechanical advantage disappears. This is a good example because you can generate enough force to see this easily with your hand. If you used corundum (sapphire/ruby, which is a 9 on the Mohs hardness scale to diamond's 10), you would need to impart a much larger amount of force to deform the corundum with the diamond.<br><br>However, think of taking a diamond-coated sawblade and slicing through a door-sized block of diamond until you had a thin sheet, say half an inch thick. I know this is an extremely hypothetical situation, but do you really think you couldn't break that sheet of diamond with a normal claw hammer? Now what about a sheet of steel half an inch thick? Could you destroy that with a hammer? I don't think you could.<br><br>No material is magically impenetrable or invulnerable. Every material has its advantages and disadvantages and you need the right material for the right situation. You would never make a cannon out of bamboo and you would never make a longbow out of iron.</p>		</li>

			<p>Firstly, hard things are (generally) brittle. Hardness is how much force it requires to make something bend.<br><br>If one thing can scratch something else, it is harder (I think).</p>		</li>

			<p>Bending, scratching, and bouncing are three different responses to three different types of trauma a material could experience. All three are tracked separately.<br><br>Diamond is very hard in all three of those senses. Any edge you use to cut diamond will, before the sufficient force you need to cut a diamond, deform and lose its edge. That's why it has a 10 in the mohs hardness scale.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, obsidian is a 5-6 on the Mohs scale, diamond is a 10. Based on that, and the way the scale works, obsidian trying to cut diamond would be like gypsum trying to cut Quartz.</p>		</li>

			<p>No. It doesn't matter how sharp you make somethkng if the edge breaks or deforms before you can cut anything.<br><br>It takes s tremendous amount of force to cut a diamond and separate those bonds. The obsididan will break before you can impart that force.</p>		</li>

			<p>What!!! I'm amazed that razor blades are that sharp. If my understanding is right, an angstrom is approximately the diameter of a hydrogen atom right? Does that mean that there are ONLY 300-600 atoms stacked across the width of a razor?<br><br>Either I din't realize atoms were that big or the razor edge can indeed be that sharp!!</p>		</li>

			<p>This is just my interpretation so I'm not sure, but I think that's the width at the absolute edge, basically the thinnest the material is able to get</p>		</li>
