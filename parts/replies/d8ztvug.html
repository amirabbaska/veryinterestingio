			<div class="markdown"><p>What!!! I'm amazed that razor blades are that sharp. If my understanding is right, an angstrom is approximately the diameter of a hydrogen atom right? Does that mean that there are ONLY 300-600 atoms stacked across the width of a razor?</p>
<p>Either I din't realize atoms were that big or the razor edge can indeed be that sharp!!</p></div>		</li>

<p>only if its made of hydrogen. </p>
<p>if an atom is say twice as wide as a hydrogen atom it would only be 150-300 across. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One hit and it would shatter. Imagine if you had a sword made out of glass, that's basically what would happen. Obsidian was used most commonly in arrow heads</p>
<p>The Aztecs had a sort of obsidian sword called a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macuahuitl" target="_blank">macuahuitl</a> which was basically just a hardwood club with several obsidian blades embedded inside it. Unfortunately the last original Macuahuitl was destroyed in a fire</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's similar to glass.</p>
<p>Mesoamerican weapons using obsidian and other ceramics functioned because they used relatively small pieces, and also because Mesoamericans did not use metal armor and most enemies were relatively soft targets (though it is a mistake to think they were just shirtless barbarians. mesoamericans DID have forms of armor which were well adapted to their battlefield conditions and local resources).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's extremely hard and, like most materials with &quot;normal&quot; properties, is thus extremely brittle. That's why nobody uses obsidian knives or scalpels. It's volcanic glass that'll shatter into very very sharp bits with too much pressure.</p></div>		</li>
