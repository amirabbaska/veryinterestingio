			<div class="markdown"><p>I really enjoyed the specific answer you've provided to this. I asked my Anatomy instructor about this and he couldn't really answer the question. This made a lot more sense with the examples and comparison of organs such as the heart and lungs. You've made me have the &quot;Ooh yeah!&quot; moment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I often wonder why the prefix &quot;hep(at?)&quot; is used for all things liver, when they are (pretty much) hexagons. I always presumed that hepatocytes had seven sides hence the name. Though 7 sided shapes wouldn't be a very efficient way of arranging into a close pattern, without gaps.</p>
<p>Do you suppose when first discovered the magnification power was not good enough so it looked like seven? Or is it because having 'x' in a word so close to a soft sounding 'c' was just a mouthful to pronounce. Hexacytis, hexatocytes, hexatotoxic... maybe superstition was to blame? They sound like evil curses.</p>
<p>Google has not helped me with this query of nomenclature; the mystery continues...</p>
<p>Or perhaps I should pose my own separate question as opposed to commandeering this one.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>That's very presumptuous of you.</p>
<p>Perhaps his teacher and him just have different ways of expressing themselves. He didn't actually say that the teacher was wrong , but rather that he was able to understand better the way it was presented here. Some people have an easier time understanding with different methods, that's not much of an argument against the teacher in question.</p>
<p>[That being said, I tend to agree with you, being a professor myself I understand both sides but it is important to never take a side without having the full information]</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would just add that while loss of lung tissue, or an entire lung is serious your body can physiologically compensate over time. For instance angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels) will occur in the lung(s) until there is sufficient oxygen available to feed the body based on it's typical oxygen needs. There are people that function perfectly fine with only one lung or parts of one or both missing. </p>
<p>I believe there is fairly new evidence of lung tissue rapidly regenerating after injury too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean the diaphragm contracts unevenly when he breathes? Or is it such that the existing lung has expanded to cover the surface area of the diaphragm that was previously covered by the removed lung?</p>
<p>Also, isn't one lung three lobes and the other lung two lobes? Which of the two lungs was removed? How would either affect the way the other lung compensates when breathing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very accurate. A friend of mine I met in high school only has half a lung (literally one half of one lung is left in his body) due to childhood sickness, and he played the clarinet in both concert band and marching band all throughout high school. His breathing is basically normal, he just can’t take very deep breaths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good answer!</p>
<p>I thought I'd add some by just pointing out that the reason our bodies and organs are shaped the way they are is because of a &quot;scaffold&quot; made of collagen.  It's like a spiderweb of tiny strands that, when stretched out, forms the shape of a human body and/or the organs inside.  Our cells don't just grow in a specific shape and specific locations by accident, they actually grow <em>on</em> the scaffold and follow it where it takes them.  The scaffold helps them determine which cells should grow where.  If the scaffold is damaged, for example if your arm is cut off, then the cells at your shoulder don't know where to grow so they just follow what's left of the scaffold which results in a &quot;cap&quot; closing the wound instead of a new arm.  If you can re-attach the arm before it dies then the two parts of scaffold can be put back together and that's how sometimes an arm or leg can be saved.  Similarly, if you cut a hole in a heart, the cells around the hole won't know how to grow over the hole because the scaffold is gone, so the hole will never close unless a doctor grafts a piece of heart over the hole that has a scaffold already in it.</p>
<p>In humans, the scaffold can't be regrown, it is grown once in the tiny fetus and never again.  There has been research on trying to make it regrow but so far there has been little progress.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nature.com/news/tissue-engineering-how-to-build-a-heart-1.13327" target="_blank">This article covers some of the challenges of engineering new tissues and may answer some of your questions</a></p>
<p>As PrionBacon explained though, the liver has a special internal structure that it will grow even without the scaffold.  It's not entirely understood how the liver knows when to stop growing though.  Without a scaffold, other tissues would just keep growing in a big mess forever.  The liver appears (this is not well understood) to grow to a size that corresponds to the amount of blood flow through your body.  That is, the size and number of veins that feed your liver and the amount of blood that your heart is trying to pump through your liver, help the liver to determine how big it should be before it stops growing.</p>
