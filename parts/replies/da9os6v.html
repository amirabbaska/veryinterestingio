			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for this! So does this mean that my conscious mind is able to perceive and interpret information much faster and more efficiently than I tend to believe? If that's the case and it's simply a lack of stimuli that create a different perception of time, how can my mind possibly process that much information in such a short period, and how can my conscious mind actually comprehend it when I can barely read a page in a book in under a minute? </p></div>		</li>

<p>In the time it took you to read that word, your mind has processed and recalled lot of information about the ship, the movie, actors, scenes, etc. Mind is fast. Human brain can process large volume of data in fraction of a second. Input mechanisms for the brain like eye sight and hearing are comparatively slower.</p>
<p>When you are dreaming, all the information required for the dream are contained within the brain, thus making it much quicker to process and comprehend the information.</p>
<p>Even in your conscious mind, when you try to recall your favourite movie or book, you can recall most of the information in under a minute, while it might have taken hours to read or watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying is that the brain operates like using the internet as opposed to a local network. Outside stimuli equate to connecting to a movie streaming website since there is greater input lag. Dreaming is equivalent to streaming a movie from a media server on my gigabit network. Did I get that right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you <em>can</em> process more (e.g. speed reading is a learned skill).  However, what you have to process when dreaming is actually <em>much less</em> than you process in real life.  Your brain is ignoring a shit-ton of information all the time coming - all the stuff that doesn't add up to the narrative of how you'd describe that moment.  E.G. you're always ignoring a million things and making sense from it.  In the dream state you're brain just has to recreate it.  It's a bit like in dream you only get the melody, and only have to process just that bit.  </p>
<p>So...a little bit of both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you're in danger, your brain will actually cause time to 'slow down'. Most of us who have been in a car accident have experienced this. Although, when this happens, you get a heavy dose of adrenalin and your frontal lobe while faster is pretty much useless. The slowdown is almost entirely to give your reflexes more time to perceive what's going on. You're brain kind of always works this quick, it's just the more conscious part of you doesn't move that fast and your sensory information is kind of tuned to what the more conscious part of your brain can handle. </p>
<p>Also, keep in mind, our massive, insanely developed brains also have a massive calorie cost. Making it work quicker costs calories, so we simply evolved to an equilibrium where we were quick enough that we could mostly stay alive long enough to reproduce. </p>
<p>To be fair, our brains actually do work insanely fast, we have amazing reflexes, the actual bottleneck to our reflexes is the fact it takes a certain amount of time for signals to travel up and down our spinal cord and into our nerves and make us move. If you notice, someone will put their hands up and /then/ take a step back because this stuff is happening as the signal gets to various body parts. Also, we never evolved to drive two-thousand pound boxes of metal at seventy plus miles per hour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;We don't actually have the capacity to perceive time very well.&quot; This is simply not true at all. Our  prefrontal cortex is responsible for perceiving time and when we sleep it is turned off. Thus we lose time perception. It's called a flow state and it is believed to be happening when the brain is between beta/theta waves ( instead of alpha waves that are given off when we are wide awake ) the information you are giving seems opinion based and not from sources. I just finished listening to a podcast featuring a guy who has been studying this exact phenomenon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really though.  It is responsible, yes. It sleeps...yes.  It is, however, not very reliable.  Thats the point.  The failures are well researched and well documented within neuroscience and psych.  In fact, it is such a widely researched topic, and so thoroughly well documented that I don't think it requires a citation.  Rather than rely on a podcast, just find whatever wikipedia article covers perception of time and I'm sure you'll find a wealth of information on how it is affected by everything from psychological stimuli to body temperature to age.  Even in very short term time horizons interval reproduction tests show that we are far from a &quot;clock&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
