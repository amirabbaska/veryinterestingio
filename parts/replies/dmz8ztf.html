			<div class="markdown"><p>Smoked for 17 years. Stopped with a nice vape kit. Started at 24mg. Lowered every couple months. 18mg, 12mg, 9mg, 6mg, 3mg. Got down to 0mg after about 11 months. Stopped completely after 13 months.</p>
<p>That was almost 3 years ago. </p>
<p>Vaping was one of the best things to ever happen for me. Total savings is around $8000.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for sharing. I smoked cigs for about 13 years, just switched to a vape 2.5 weeks ago, started on 12mg. My goal is to continually decrease until I'm off entirely. Nice to hear it can work out so easily - I hope it does for me as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do it. Mad respect for taking the first step towards bettering your health. Soon enough you will be off the vape completely and it will feel like only yesterday you quit cigs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. I've been clean for almost two years. Nicotine leaves your system in days. I went through one tough weekend and Vaped 0 nicotine for the physical habit for months. It took a while to break that, but the nicotine part was easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smoked for 18 years. Switched to the vape a year and half ago and haven't had the urge to smoke a cigarette in a long time. Started at 18mg, still at 8. But this next 6 months is where i'm kicking it down to near zero before I give this up too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By backup kit, you just mean backup batteries and coils. If you can buy cigarettes nowadays, you can generally buy juice, because most gas stations now sell at least a small bottle of eliquid.</p>
<p>Don't mix up your batteries. If your vape requires 2, then charge those 2 together and have a backup 2. Make sure each set consists of 2 basically identical batteries. Don't ever use a mechanical-only vape, because that's how you accidentally blow up your purse or desk or something. Make sure it has failsafes, like where it will shutoff if it reaches a certain temp.</p>
<p>Keep a few backup coils/coil sets, not just one. If you only do one, then you'll forget to buy another backup next time you buy any.</p>
<p>If you fuckup and can't vape for some reason, buy a vuse or mark10 or some shit, that's better than smoking and will hold you over anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I think he means a whole backup kit. If your mod died (won't turn on, dropped and shattered, water damage, etc) then you're more likely to go buy cigarettes to get your nicotine fix. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I say backup kit, I mean an entire backup kit.  The easiest thing is to just find a vape setup that you like, and then buy two of them.</p>
<p>When I started I had a Innokin MVP 2.0 and an Aspire Nautilus and it was awesome.  I bought another MVP and Aspire right away.  That way, I had interchangeable parts/coils and could keep one MVP charging while using the other (that battery lasted forever though, thing only put out 11W).</p>
<p>Totally agree on charging batteries together - and not fucking with a mechanical.  There's zero reason to mess with mechanical.</p>
<p>If you're really into it, learn to mix your own juice, it's really easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think dropping an extra $200 or so is worth it on a backup like that. A shitty ecig from a gas station that costs $10 will hold you over until you can get set back up. My girlfriend used to vape and she had her setup go down like 3 times in 2 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I tried vape and it just made me cough constantly. Do I need to try it again and just zero in on what would be best for me? My wife quit smoking the first day of vaping 3 years ago.</p>
<p>She has cancer now and I would like to avoid that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a similiar problem. The coughing can be a few things. Quitting smoking actually causes coughing so if you're significantly reducing your smoking by vaping then you will get a cough. If you're talking about coughing from the vape, it took me quite a while to adjust to the vape over smoking. Apparently some people don't tolerate PG very well. You could try getting juices with less or no PG and see if that helps. For me, it was actually technique on the exhale. Don't go crazy on the inhale and exhale slowly. I adjusted after a bit of time and after a couple of weeks off cigarettes you'll realise how awesome a vape is compared to smokes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost two years ago I got my dad to start vaping instead of smoking. Like the other person said, it just takes a little time to get used to it. It can be a result of quitting smoking, and also some flavors hit harder than others. Most likely, it's a combination of both. Most people that I know that started vaping after smoking experienced coughing for the first week or so. It takes a little time to get used to it, but usually by the end of week 1 or week 2, they all stopped coughing when doing it. Highly recommend starting vaping to quit, and if you need any advice, recommendations, or anything else related to vaping, just send me a PM. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was it inhaling the vapor that made you cough?  What was your vaporizer setup, and what were the specifications of your e-liquid?</p>
<p>Some people are really sensitive to the propylene glycol (PG) portion of the eliquid.  Making sure you have the right liquid and the right settings on your vaporizer is super important.  I'll be glad to help.</p></div>		</li>
