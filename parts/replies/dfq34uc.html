<p>The brain is made up of modules that perform different tasks (visual cortex, auditory cortex, hypothalamus, cerebellum, etc). This is why you can damage large parts of your brain (such as in hemispherectomies) and only lose some functions. The neurotransmitters you mentioned are not used uniformly throughout your brain. Different parts of your brain can rely more on one type of neurotransmitter than another.</p>
<p>The neurotransmitters you mentioned are produced/used even in unicellular organisms (note, no nervous system) and plants. Therefore, they did not evolve as happiness-molecules to start with. Speculative: In some organisms, other molecules (and not dopamine, serotonin) may regulate happiness.</p>
<p>You mentioned serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins, but other neurotransmitters/chemicals regulate your (human) happiness. For instance, glutamate and its signaling system are affected by the club drug ketamine, which is actively being investigated as an antidepressant. Endocannabinoids likely also regulate happiness. This is to say that happiness is a complex physiological state and not well understood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really how neurotransmitters work. Each neurotransmitter doesn't correspond to a different feeling. Rather they exist to allow the brain to have different ways of transmitting information. A neurotransmitter is released by one neuron to affect one other neuron (or sometimes a few.). And different neurotransmitters have different effects. For example, Glutamate usually excites neurons, as in it makes them fire. GABA is almost always inhibitory, it prevents neurons from firing. Dopamine can be either excitation or inhibitory depending on the receptors on the neuron it's trying to send a signal onto. And it get's even more complex from there.</p>
<p>They are also not isolated to specific 'feelings.' Dopamine for example, is important in reward circuits, but it's also important in muscle control. And a whole bunch of other things. </p>
<p>These different ways of modulating neural activation allow the brain to form more complex circuits which can process information better.</p></div>		</li>
