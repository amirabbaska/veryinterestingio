			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kinda misinformation. Local anaesthetic can block all kinds of nerves, sensoric and motor neurons.</p>
<p>Now these nerves have different thickness of insulation and the pain fibers, also called c-fibers, are completely naked.</p>
<p>So a normal dose for pain reduction will not be sufficient to block the thicker nerves and thus kinda preventing total loss of sensory and motor function.</p>
<p>It is however, possible to just use a more potent anaesthetic, or just more of it and block every nerve in the area resulting in a blockage of nerves of all qualities.</p>
<p>It's not a matter of affinity, but a matter of dose.</p></div>		</li>
