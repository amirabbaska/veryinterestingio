			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in biostatistics. Before my formal training I thought that the situation that you are describing was a double-blind test because you give them two things and they pick which is better, but this test had to have been a single-blind test.</p>
<p>Single-blind tests are when only the subject is blind to the test they get.  Double-blind tests are when both the subject and the administrator of the test are blind to the test they get.  Double-blind test are often used in drug trials to prevent doctors from giving tending to give sicker patients the experimental treatment and giving healthier patients a placebo, which might make the drug seem less effective.</p>
<p>In this situation, the bar tender is obviously not blinded to the cup they are using because they made the drink but the drinker was blinded.  Making it a single blind test.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd always heard it that a guy ordered too many cases of ginger beer. The Smirnoff rep offered to buy 500 copper mugs for the bar if the owner ordered a certain number of cases of Smirnoff.
They made up the drink and had the mules etched on the mugs</p></div>		</li>
