</blockquote>
<p>From what I understand, it would always be the latter. The farther you go from where it probably is, the lower the probability of it being there gets, but that probability will never reach absolutely zero, no matter <em>how</em> far you go.</p>
<p>There is an absurdly tiny chance that the electron you're measuring in your lab is actually somewhere halfway around the world.</p>
<p>That's how quantum tunneling works. You can put up a barrier to stop a particle from crossing a certain line, but there's a tiny chance that the particle will just appear on the other side of the line. The thinner your line is, the more likely this is to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good idea, but a blind spot won't help. In fact this would still count as a measurement, and all interpretations of quantum mechanics predict the same thing about this experiment. Let me say why in the language of the two most popular interpretations:</p>
<p>Copenhagen: You measure a particle any time you find out information about it. When the particle hits the blind spot, you find out where it is as surely as if you stared it dead in the eye - it's in the blind spot. You measure it, the wave function collapses, then you can use certain equations to see how the wave function changes until your next measurement. </p>
<p>Many-Worlds: Measurement is a red herring. What's really going on is that worlds are constantly being created and interfering with each other. When you &quot;measure&quot; a particle, you just cause it to interact with a larger system, separating the worlds where it was in one position from the worlds where it wasn't, preventing them from interfering with each other. Here, you separate the worlds where the particle was in your blind spot from the worlds where it wasn't - the same as if you had measured it the normal way.</p>
<p>Importantly, the next measurement is not a certainty - the wave function spreads out, so we can never guess the next position, only guess the probabilities of different outcomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if you could do a measurement without transferring energy would result in an unbound electron just by collapsing the wave function. The bound orbital is a superposition of infinitly many localised states. Only in this special superposition it is bound. Even with a noninterfering measurement you would collapse wave function of the electron onto one localised state. This localised state is not a bound state anymore.<br />
Don't try to think about it too ard unless you are ready for the mindfuck that is quantum mechanics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An orbital is an energy eigenstate. The energy and position operators don't commute, so an atomic electron with a definite energy doesn't have a definite position, and vice versa. You can write the state of an energy eigenstate in the position basis (this is what the wavefunction is), and you'll find that it's in a superposition of infinitely many positions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are wrong. There is no hidden information missing. There is a series of experiments called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_test_experiments" target="_blank">Bell test</a> which established that. The quantum mechanical world really behaves that unintuitively, strange, ridiculous, paradoxical,...<br />
The observation does not need to be done by a sentient beeing. Nor does the particle need to be sentient. The important fact is, that each interaction will change the state of the particle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your understanding is lacking here. When we say behavior changes when we observe it, you have to break down what observing means. In order to transfer information from anything, we have to interact with it. Vision, for example, works by photons bouncing off things, then traveling to our eyes and the information being processed. The information is transferred when the photon bounces off an object, and is then captured by our retina and interpreted by our brain. </p>
<p>Now, how do we observe an electron. It's tiny. A photon bouncing off a tree is an insignificant amount of energy. However, at the scale of subatomic particles, photons have enough energy to move particles. To &quot;observe&quot; an electron, we necessarily have to interact with it by doing something like bouncing a photon off it. However, bouncing a photon off an electron will change the trajectory of the electron. </p>
<p>Think of it this way, you have a basketball (electron) and a baseball (photon). To observe the basketball, you have to hit it with the baseball. The basketball isn't just going to sit there when you throw a baseball at it. The baseball is going to transfer its energy to the basketball and the basketball is going to roll. Now apply this if the basketball is already moving. We don't know where it is, so we spray baseballs at it. As soon as some of those baseballs hit the basketball, it's going to change direction. We will discover the location of the basketball because we know where the baseballs hit something. However, we don't know the direction it was going because as soon as the first baseball hit it the direction changed. </p>
<p>Basically, observation requires interaction, and at that scale there's no way to interact with the electron without changing it. That includes all of nature as well. A person doesn't have to be watching to change the particle's behavior. &quot;Observation&quot; in this sense just means the transfer of information. That can be a person hitting an electron with something to measure it, or any other interaction between the electron and literally anything. </p></div>		</li>
