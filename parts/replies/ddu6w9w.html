			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep seeing people sort of demonize the media but the media isn't any one thing. For example, are you asserting that all newspapers have stopped reporting what we consider news? I feel like the Wall Street journal gives a fairly accurate depiction of what the national news is. Unless we disagree on what news is to begin with, but my understanding is that it's the basic who, what, when and where of legislation, politics, war, business, etc. Now if people don't bother actually reading the news because they're intellectually lazy and want their news presented in some sort of meme or cable news format, then it's the consumer themselves who aren't performing their own civic duty in a democracy to simply stay informed on what their elected officials are doing and saying and voting on. As far as I can tell it's easy to find all of those things and make a pretty straightforward decision about who to vote for. I reject the premise that &quot;the media&quot; should come to my house, massage my feet, suck my cock and read me the newspaper so I can tolerate learning about the world. On the contrary, if I want to engage and participate in a democracy, then I better do my job and read about what's happening, locally and federally and cast votes in every election for people that do tell the truth, and care about the issues I care about. The reason politicians get away with lying is because the public is currently too lazy to read anything more complicated than a dank meme and doesn't even understand the basic functions of their government or who is involved in it. Most people can't even name their congressman, let alone call or write them and then they complain why that same congressman gets away with lying. It's completely disingenuous, when it is literally the easiest time in history to find the facts or news. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My issue with media is when they stop just reporting what happened, what someone said, etc., and decide to also include their spin on what happened that day.</p>
<p>It happens all the time with everything from Fox News to CNN.  Personally, I cant stand any of them.  Just tell me what happened, and maybe some context.  Dont tell me what to think about what happened, I can make up my own mind.  24/7 news channels seem to be the worst at this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of newspapers and news sources give just the facts. The associated press, Reuters, and the Wall Street journal are excellent sources of just the news. Again there is no shortage of accurate facts and the people who do the work of finding them and reporting them can only do just that. If you can't be bothered to seek the facts out for your own good then you really just can't be helped. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The papers, stations, sites, whoever, prefer to not &quot;burn the bridge&quot; with both individual politicians and larger organizations like state and national parties. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, it's important to point out: they do not want to burn bridges with <em>advertisers</em>.</p>
<p>Historically the media got the lion's share of their funding from newspaper subscriptions.  Yes, advertising revenue was important, but the key was that the readers were the core customer base.  Therefore, newspapers had a vested interest in producing the highest quality news because that sold more copies of the newspaper, which also had the added benefit of increasing the advertiser interest in the paper since more people would read it.</p>
<p>Now, however, that's not the case.  Most people don't pay for news stories.  The reader has stopped being a customer, and has become a <em>consumer</em>.  Instead, the newspaper's customers are <em>the advertisers</em>, and the reader is the produce they sell.  Well, what do advertisers want?  More readers <em>regardless</em> of the reason.  They don't care <em>why</em> someone is reading the newspaper, they just want the eyeballs on their ads.  So, news quality is suddenly less important.  It's more important to have stories that get people reading repeatedly, regardless of the quality -- or, indeed, the truth -- of the news stories published.  We see a shift from the primary focus of a newspaper from providing accurate news to the reader, to providing the best vehicle for ads to the advertisers.  It was journalistic integrity and marketplace competition that kept the news accurate and informative.  Today?  Well, you're marketing to advertisers, and journalistic integrity is too expensive to bother with, especially when it just upsets your customers!</p>
<p>You might ask, &quot;What about television news?  Weren't they always reliant on advertising?&quot;  And, yes, that's true.  However, before the mid 80s the FCC required that all broadcast services employ the Fairness Doctrine, which meant equal time for opposing viewpoints.  Under this system, even if advertisers don't like it you were required to fairly show both sides of the issues.  The system was abandoned in the 80s mostly because the original reason for the Fairness Doctrine was because there were so few broadcasters and the barrier to entry was so high compared to a newspaper (many locations only had one affiliate station for ABC, CBS, and NBC, plus public broadcasting).  Once cable TV took off, the argument was that broadcasting was much more available since most people had access to dozens of stations.  Unfortunately, it meant that advertising and corporate interests could freely spend money to control the content of a news station.</p>
<p>So, we have two changes that have undermined the news media, whose intended interests should be creating a public informed about the truth.  Instead, we have a news industry whose actual interest is in creating a public informed about <em>the products and opinions of others</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was so much accurate information and fact checking about the American political campaign, but the Americans still elected Donald Trump, despite being a blatant liar and likely some sort of sociopathic manipulator. </p>
<p>People need to stop looking to other things and other people to blame. people need to take responsibility for their ability to think and make decisions.<em>that</em> is what will change things. an accurate media will help with that, but if people have  questionable values and can't think clearly, the media isn't going to help much. </p>
