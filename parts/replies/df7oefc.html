			<div class="markdown"><p>Must be. I work in a huge level one trauma center, teaching hospital. I can look at Epic and see what peoples' chief complaint is and every one that enters with any bump to the head gets a CT. I'm not a physician. I was only making a little joke about the other guy's comment. I know I'm not qualified to judge what the docs order. </p></div>		</li>
