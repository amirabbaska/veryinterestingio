<p>Look at rich countries and you'll see they have mechanised agriculture (meaning a small percentage of the population can grow loads of food) and most of the population engaged in much higher income activities.</p>
<p>The first signs of a developing country is a massive migration from agricultural rural areas to factory and office jobs in urban areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an interantional studies major, this is a part of my focus. We are studying Jamaica currently. After independence the country went backrupt, due to mismanagement. The country needed loans. After exhausting the private sector, they asked the IMF and World Bank. Apart of the conditions were to open the Jamaican market entirely to the world market. Jamaican produce cannot compete with American or South American produce producers because they harvest by hand. The farmers cannot get the technology because no one wants to invest in a bankrupt country. They cannot export goods because they are now being forced to compete with the US and other more technologically advanced countries.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Clearing vast tracts of land on a small island nation to plant cash crops  is also pretty bad for the local ecosystem and food supply.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When the Spanish empire started to unravel those islands found themselves suddenly self-governing with little experience or resources.</p>
<p>Since then they've struggled with corrupt governments, meddling from cold war superpowers, and the simple lack of resources on an island.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And not just the former Spanish colonies.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turks_and_Caicos_Islands" target="_blank">Turks and Caicos</a> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Overseas_Territories" target="_blank">British Overseas Territory</a> (which means they're self-governing but are not sovereign or technically independent).</p>
<p>As recently as 2009 the UK Government had to suspend the TCI government due to corruption and incompetence (in particular, government officials were selling off government-owned land for personal gain).</p>
<p>Direct rule from Westminster was imposed until 2012 when they had fresh elections and introduced a new Constitution.</p>
<p>The other way you can go is governments <em>trying</em> to be accountable (or give the appearance of accountability) and trying to emulate European governance models and then drowning under bureaucracy or the cost of trying to implement big, flashy, flagship projects that a nation of 30-100k people don't need!</p>
<p>As others have said, they're now under a form of economic Imperialism. Agriculture can't compete with LatAm industrial scale producers. In terms of tourism, multi-national resort groups cut deals to build resorts, with the result that a lot of tourist money disappears back out of the country to the owners or to the American/European management brought in to run them, or to the American/European carrier you'll fly in on. If you're not in the upper-class community that manages those service sectors then you're pushing a broom for a pittance or waiting-on in the restaurants, and that's the limit to how much they benefit the local economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer is they were slave holding areas. The native people exterminated and people trafficked from Africa and left on the islands to use up resources. America has not helped these countries prosper because they are still populated by people the government sees as less than human. Black &amp; indigenous. </p></div>		</li>
