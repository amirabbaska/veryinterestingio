			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, &quot;breeze&quot; here is very low speed. Refreshing the dry air next to the surface would only require a bit of agitation, whereas the speed required to significantly increase the heat transfer coefficient of dry air is really high. (The heat transfer coefficient of air is approximately 10.45 - v + 10 v^1/2 in W/ m^2 K.)<br />
As for sunlight, <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/map_csp_us_july_may2004.jpg" target="_blank">here's a map of the solar flux</a> in kWh/m^2 / day. In some locations, the solar power significantly dominates in modelling the evaporation rate of water from a surface, especially considering those areas are also usually places of low relative humidity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weird, right?<br />
It's a sum of the kWh/m^2 one can gather over the course of a day. The normal vector to the sun is maintained by assuming two-axis tracking, but it's summed over a day's sun exposure.<br />
It tends to be used for calculation of PV requirements for small-scale home solar installations with a bit of battery backup, so people just want to know what kind of power they can generally expect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it were just kW it is hard to tell exactly what it means. Is that instantaneous? Over 1 second? Over an hour? (Because Power is Work applied over a period of time. P = W/t. There are many other formulas but this one helps us explain what you are asking about)</p>
<p>These units tell us what the change in time and space is, so we understand that this is how much power occurs over a square meter in the timespan of a day</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd guess the map was probably made to show where solar panels would be most viable, so it weights cloudiness and other factors (which is why California and Nevada are much redder than the misnamed sunshine state).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it would, and that little bit should be more than sufficient to bring in fresh air, especially if it's indoors where the air is cool and sunlit objects are significantly hotter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Clothes dry faster on my balcony now than when it's a hot summer's day. It's still usually quite dry in summer, but very dry in winter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is, but more water fits in warm air, so the relative humidity goes down if you heat air, and the relative humidity is what matters.</p></div>		</li>
