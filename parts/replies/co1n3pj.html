			<p>To be fair, &quot;breeze&quot; here is very low speed. Refreshing the dry air next to the surface would only require a bit of agitation, whereas the speed required to significantly increase the heat transfer coefficient of dry air is really high. (The heat transfer coefficient of air is approximately 10.45 - v + 10 v^1/2 in W/ m^2 K.)  <br>As for sunlight, <a href="http://www.nrel.gov/gis/images/map_csp_us_july_may2004.jpg" target="_blank">here's a map of the solar flux</a> in kWh/m^2 / day. In some locations, the solar power significantly dominates in modelling the evaporation rate of water from a surface, especially considering those areas are also usually places of low relative humidity. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>kWh/day. There's a good unit. Why not just kW?</p>		</li>

			<p>Weird, right?  <br>It's a sum of the kWh/m^2 one can gather over the course of a day. The normal vector to the sun is maintained by assuming two-axis tracking, but it's summed over a day's sun exposure.  <br>It tends to be used for calculation of PV requirements for small-scale home solar installations with a bit of battery backup, so people just want to know what kind of power they can generally expect.</p>		</li>

			<p>Generally comes, as mentioned, from solar power. Systems are sold in &quot;kW&quot; meaning &quot;if you get exactly standard power under standard conditions&quot; [1000 W/m^2, 20 deg. C, practically never happens] but the average kW is more like 20% of that [depending considerably on many minor details.] Combined with &quot;my electric bill is in kWh&quot; these units are actually LESS confusing when figuring out what you'll get for your money. <br><br>Ed. to attempt to clarify: if you buy a 10 kW system you will not get 240 kWh in a day. Because night happens, among other things. You'll get more like 40 kWh in an average day. More in summer, less in winter. </p>		</li>

			<p>If it were just kW it is hard to tell exactly what it means. Is that instantaneous? Over 1 second? Over an hour? (Because Power is Work applied over a period of time. P = W/t. There are many other formulas but this one helps us explain what you are asking about)<br><br>These units tell us what the change in time and space is, so we understand that this is how much power occurs over a square meter in the timespan of a day</p>		</li>

			<p>Right... But you can choose and work with any time period if you're given the average wattage. And there's two time units. You can give just the average wattage and the relevant time period, which is a day, and have a workable measure for energy. The reason it's given in kWh/day is because it's the standard units when talking about energy production.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sure we can go all the way back to just voltage and get up to Work and then to Power and we can talk about Pav and whatever other things you like. I was just trying to explain to someone who seemed to not know how it worked where the per day would have come from. </p>		</li>

			<p>No, kW is easier to tell because it always means kJ/s. If you divide 10 000 Joules/1hour you don't get directly the answer in Watts. If it's in Watts it means Joules/one second.<br><br>Though I always wonder why we use kWh instead of Joules. One might say Joule is a small unit but so is a byte and everyone is comfortable using it in large quantities.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not sure what you're trying to say here. Watt is just a unit for rate of energy transfer, the time is irrelevant. It measures exactly the same thing as kwh/day. However, most people have a pretty good idea how much 1W is, much less so for 1kwh/day.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;However, most people have a pretty good idea how much 1W is, much less so for 1kWh/day.<br><br>Depends what you're used to working with. Average household demand is about 8000kWh a year. That's pretty easy to convert to kWh/day. Less easy to convert to W.<br><br>Most power bills come with kWh used in a certain time period (e.g. kWh/month). If you're looking at how much energy you need to generate from solar panels then kWh/day is a useful unit.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'd guess the map was probably made to show where solar panels would be most viable, so it weights cloudiness and other factors (which is why California and Nevada are much redder than the misnamed sunshine state).</p>		</li>

			<p>Also wouldn't the sunlight increase the temperature of the air surrounding the surface, causing it to rise and creating a minor air flow cycle?</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes it would, and that little bit should be more than sufficient to bring in fresh air, especially if it's indoors where the air is cool and sunlit objects are significantly hotter.</p>		</li>

			<p>The drying effect of room temperature air does not come from the fact that it's warming the clothes (in fact, you can dry clothes in air that's <em>colder</em> than the wet fabric).</p>		</li>

			<p>Isn't evaporation different from boiling? </p>		</li>

			<p>It is, but more water fits in warm air, so the relative humidity goes down if you heat air, and the relative humidity is what matters.</p>		</li>

			<p>Boiling means that the average temperature of every molecule is 100c. Evaporation means some molecules are over 100c and can break the surface tension and escape.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;Definitely a breeze, hands-down<br><br>It's really not 'hands-down'. It depends on all sorts of factors. On a hot summers where the sun is intense day here I can try clothes in the sun in an hour or so. No breeze needed</p>		</li>
