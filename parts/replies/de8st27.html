			<div class="markdown"><p>Although not for stealing, recent trick in my city is to amplify the detect key signal from the car for keyless entry vehicles.</p>
<p>It will detect the key with cars parked on the city street if the keys are just inside the door. Free to steal anything inside without breaking in.</p>
<p>Although you could just start the car and drive off right to a garage too, this has only been used for snatching things as far as I've heard</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never understood keyless vehicles.  You still need to have the key with you, so what have you saved?  Are you too lazy to put it in the keyhole?  I don't buy keyless or remote door-lock cars.  It costs a fortune to replace the key and leaves you open to the type of theft you describe.  It also makes it easier for police to disable cars remotely.</p></div>		</li>
