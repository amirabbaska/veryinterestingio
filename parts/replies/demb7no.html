			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation. Is this why Verizon Wireless (CDMA) had much better cell reception than the networks using GSM (AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, etc.) in the mid-2000's, or did they just have a better cell infrastructure than the other networks' ones?</p>
<p>I remember my GSM-using classmates having to call several times before their calls would go through at times, whereas the ones with VZW would have their call always go through. Is it because they had to wait their &quot;turn&quot; as far as having an available time slot? Things have improved greatly now, but the difference was pretty ridiculous back then.</p></div>		</li>

<p>3g and 4g are an evolution to the gsm technology incorporating cdma's coding. It's different from old verizon cdma</p>
<p>Cdma is basicaly a very clever math trick based on spread spectrum and xor using a mutually agreed unique code between device and tower</p></div>		</li>

<p>No. Reception is based mostly on what frequency is used (lower frequencies travel farther and penetrate structures better), the density of the towers and what power levels they transmit at. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is most likely related to infrastructure at that particular point and amount of users there. A small and cheap carrier might have a tower next to you while big and expensive one doesn't. Some carriers have more users in a given area than others, its fun in some areas to be barely able to call at peak times while friends have LTE available.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The actress/inventor Hedy Lamarr helped invent CDMA</p>
<p>&quot;Lamarr and Antheil (a composer and piano player realized that radio-controlled torpedoes, which could be important in the naval war, could easily be jammed, thereby causing the torpedo to go off course. With the knowledge Lamarr had gained about torpedoes from her first husband, and using a method similar to the way piano rolls work, they designed a frequency-hopping system that would continually change the radio signals sent to the torpedo.</p>
<p>Their invention was granted a patent on 11 August 1942 (filed using her married name Hedy Kiesler Markey).However, it was technologically difficult to implement, and at that time the U.S. Navy was not receptive to considering inventions coming from outside the military. Only in 1962 (at the time of the Cuban missile crisis) did an updated version of their design appear on Navy ships.</p>
<p>The design is one of the important elements behind today's spread-spectrum communication technology, such as modern CDMA, Wi-Fi networks, and Bluetooth technology.&quot;</p>
