			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience, for small values of n, n<em>t is sufficient, but as n increases I find the total time increases more slowly than n</em>t. Personally, rather than n, I scale with Mw = Mass of water, since that's what the literal microwaves interact most strongly with, and so that's what you're really using when you compute t in the first place. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding one more chicken nugget doesn't increase Mw very much, adding one corn dog does, but they both increase n by one. If the curve were a perfectly linear nt it wouldn't matter but if you want to do the undershoot, it matters a bit.</p></div>		</li>
