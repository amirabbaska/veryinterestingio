			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a bummer to hear. Math and stats are essential for all scientific research, and I might also add that programming is another key skill- it is routine for geologists to use R, Matlab, python, and more. I use a lot of statistics in my work- basic t-tests, regressions, and anova, but also multivariate methods like ordination, cluster analyses, rarefaction, and more. Mathematical modeling is also becoming more important. I'm currently taking a colleague's course on ecological modeling to learn more!</p>
<p>And I would say I'm one of the least quantitative in the geology department. Our sedimentologist recently made the switch to Bayesian statistics. Our geophysicists and hydrogeologists do tons of math!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off if this comment - even if your students don't plan on going into a quantitatively intensive field, mathematics will be important. A PhD or, at a minimum, a master's is almost required to work in research intensive fields such as paleontology. There is zero percent chance of making it through a graduate course without a working knowledge of at least statistics. </p>
<p>I wasn't a fan of math either but I use it as well as R/programming in every single project I am currently pursuing. The struggle is real and analysis can be mind numbingly boring but they are a heavy part of natural sciences. Source: I am a paleontology PhD student. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the response. We teach a very modelling heavy course, rather than just statistical testing, using R so that they've got some practical skills that can easily be extended rather than constraining them to a point and click menu system like Excel or Minitab. When they hit later units in the degree there's definitely more maths, and one of the lecturers wants them to learn transport equations and other partial differential equations.</p>
<p>Certainly science in Australia feels like we are trying to teach science without scaring students off with maths, which makes it more of a STE revolution than a STEM one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a geologist we used to joke (in undergrad) that geology is the science for people who don't like maths. There's so much trigonometry and algebra involved that it's not actually true. As a tectonics nerd myself there's a lot of physics and 3D modelling to be done, and I've come to love (and even evangelise about) maths. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's so cool that you've developed that love of maths in geophysics. Do you use MATLAB for your modelling work? How far did you go with maths education in your degree? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't use modelling software anymore, when I did it was for mine modelling and the maths was geosatistics. Interesting field that, resource modelling. I only did a couple of units, didn't do anything further than undergrad maths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like tectonics and geophysics. Can't stand calculus and had to take 3 semesters of it for my geology degree, passed each one with a lower grade than the last and never used it again. </p></div>		</li>
