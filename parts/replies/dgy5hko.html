			<div class="markdown"><p>You are completely right. I feel silly for asking my question now... the sexual selection that has influenced humans is different than in species such as ants. Thank-you for your answer :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also the matter of cultural norms. Individuality is far more present/influential in western cultures like the U.S. at a psychological level. In other cultures, such as in Japan, there is far more emphasis on community identity and a more altruistic pattern is common. </p>
<p>Obviously it's not that cut and dry, and I don't have any citations off hand, but I've taken a few psychology courses throughout college and it's a fairly well documented phenomenon. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I am not sure if this is correct. It appears that men do not have very high bar when it comes to sex while women are somewhat pickier. Can someone with relevant expertise (evolutionary biology) clarify?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will not claim to be an expert, but I enjoy reading about this and hence have read quite a few things.</p>
<p>A key aspect scienists look at is the sexual dimorphism between the sexes. Low sexual dimorphism usually indicates a more monogamous species and a higher instance of mutual selection. The explanation is quite long, but is linked to the investment each parent makes in reproduction. Mammals take a higher investment due to both gestation and a period of lactation. Humans take a very high investment on the mother's part - nine months gestation, many months of lactation and years before the offspring is independent. She will therefore choose a mate who will support her and the child through that. And that entails a bigger investment on the part of the male, which results in him being more selective than males in species of lower investment. And humans have a low sexual dimorphism.</p>
<p>This has also had a biological impact as human females are among the few species to have full breast also when not lactating. The enlarged buttocks of human females is another physical display caused by intra-female competition / male sexual selection.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>oddly enough, the idea that all ants work together equally within a hive is kind of false. though they do all still work towards a common goal there are actually lazy ants that hardly work at all! bloody freeloaders!</p></div>		</li>
