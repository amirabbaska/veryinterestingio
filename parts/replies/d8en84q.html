			<div class="markdown"><p>Small correction. Ponzi schemes don't always start that way. In fact, many start out as fully legitimate operations until investments go bad and the directors are choiced with either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Admitting they failed</li>
<li>Pretending they didn't. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my experience/knowledge it is a free product.
So the first person to sell 20 DVD's gets put first on the list and the second goes second and so forth. In places you can pay to go further up the ladder. Once 20 people sell 20 DVD's the first person gets a free TV., but bear in mind all these people selling are added onto the bottom of the list. Then when the next 20 people sell 20 DVD's the second on the list gets a free TV. So you will have added 40 people to the list but removed 2. To remove the first 20 people from the list, 400 in total would be added to the list. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So where, if at all, would those sales things like being a seller for make-up or that HerbaLife fit? Is that it's own type of thing? Where the company is essentially recruiting others to their product for them... If that has a name. </p>
<p>I remember World Ventures or whatever hit my college town hard. That toxic pyramid scheme snagged a good portion of people I knew. A couple years later, are they driving that BMW, or banking serious cash from it? No. They look back and regret the couple hundred dollar &quot;buy-in&quot; membership fee. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You buy the small object, and your name goes on a list. If you encourage enough other people to buy the small product (each of their names going on the list), then the name at the top of the list gets a big object (car, TV, etc), and is remived from the list. Now the second-from-the-top is at the top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This sounds familiar. When I was a kid my dad got these mailed letters that were basically just a list of names, and it said 'mail $5 to the top name and then add your name to the list' or something like that.</p>
<p>An old school matrix scheme?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation. Doesn't cover multilevel marketing, the technique many of these businesses have changed into. Take Avon, Tupperware or Market America. Very close to a hybrid of a Pyramid or Matrix. The idea is you are recruited to sell products, then you can also refer others. For each person you refer, they start to sell and recruit and you have your own network. For each person under you, you get a portion of their sales, and so do they. Each company makes their own plan. Market America limits you to two legs, so if you refer a third, you actually send that referral to one of your legs to grow your tree. They also do 100% of 100%, so you make the same amount for a sale from one of your legs as you'd make if you made that sale, so you are more encouraged to refer sellers and grow your network than sell.</p>
<p>This is seen in some ways by simple invite referral systems, you grow a network. Just lacks the kickbacks.</p>
<p>Multilevel marketing is completely legal, although sometimes the kickbacks are for virtual currency, gold bullion, entries for prizes which makes them closer to you selling for someone else to get no benefit...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is an important correction.  Although I hate all things MLM, they are technically not pyramid schemes even though they are similar.  It Works! is a MLM.</p>
