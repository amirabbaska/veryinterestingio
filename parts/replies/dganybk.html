			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Bastille Day&quot; actually commemorates July 14th 1790, the Fête de la Fédération, a big festival organized on the first anniversary of the fall of the Bastille. To my knowledge, that festival was not particularly military-oriented, there was an altar of the nation and a parade of workers from different professions, including soldiers.</p></div>		</li>
