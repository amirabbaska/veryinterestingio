			<div class="markdown"><p>Can I try to help your situation? I am not sure it is the right thing to do but I have decided to try to help.</p>
<p>I am a data scientist. Part of what data scientists do is to find (or use) algrotihms to cluster data. What does clustering data mean? It means finding meaningful groups of data and labeling it. Why is it hard? It is hard because data is not naturally ordered. Raw Data itself is in a meaningless chaotic state. It is our job to analyze that data, find groups of data that make sense together. </p>
<p>When you do this job enough, you realize how hard it really is. I am not talking about the hardship of being a data scientist. I am talking about the very mechanics of finding meaningful groups of data. It is naturally difficult. Lots of problems occur, and it is very common occurence for algrotihms to conclude that some part of that data is very meaningful, while it is not. In fact, when you do this job long enough you come to the real lesson of data analysis: no matter how good you are, sometimes the very processes you rely on will give you incorrect conclusions. </p>
<p>Our brain analyzes data streams from our nervous system. If you read a bit about that, you realize the reality that our brain constructs from those streams is, in fact, an interpretation. The nerves themselves give very limited information. From this information, our brain utilizes algorithms like Data Scientists do, and construct notions. What we perceive as reality is in fact the top layer of a huge pyramid of information. Underneath it, there are only electrical signals, and those signals are meaningless on their own. They get a meaning only when our brain interprets them, layer upon layer of interpretation. </p>
<p>I want to give an example of what I am describing so it becomes clear what I mean. </p>
<p>Billions of photons arrive to your eyes every millisecond. They come from every direction, in varying features. It is a bombardment of information. Some of them are captured by your eyes, and they activate neurons. Those neurons just pass on information, using electrical signals. These signals arrive to your brain. It is a bombardment of signals, and the signals themselves have no meaning. Your brain analyzes them, in real-time, and finds shapes. One such shape are eyes. Whose eyes? It doesn't know yet. It just knows that some of the electrical signals, when interpreted together, form a shape, and that shape is an eye. One other shape are lips. Thousands of shapes are similar, and they are most likely to be hair. They may also be a bird's nest, made out of tiny pieces of wood, since the two shapes are somewhat similar, but since you have already seen eyes and lips, and you are much more likely to see hair, they don't need further inspection, they are hair. </p>
<p>Now that it has some objects you are pretty much sure of, it goes on upwards to another data analysis algrotihm. It concludes what you are looking at must be a face, since you have seen lips and eyes, and some hair is around it. It passes the information to another algorithm. This one compares the shapes of those objects (data clusters, in fact) to the shapes of familiar eyes and lips. It finds a match. These belong to your father. You recognize your father. He is here. Your brain uses associative memory. What do you associate with seeing your father the most? Happiness. You feel happy. Your own reality is meaningful because of you. Because of that network of information, and because you exist, and you give it meaning. </p>
<p>This is a very simplified version of how our brain works. I would have gone into more detail but this post is already very long and I don't want to take any more of your time, in case you decide to pay attention and read it.</p>
<p>Now, about pain, or other negative sensations. I suffer from a condition called Cluster Headaches. I know what pain is. </p>
<p>But, everything you feel is in fact an interpretation of your brain, built over an insanely complex pyramid network of information, and it makes a lot of assumptions to solve these incredibly complex data problems. Those assumptions may sometimes be wrong, but once analysed a certain way, they will keep getting analyzed a certain way. Because as part of reducing the load of making those analysis, your brain usually resorts to your last conclusions about data. It is my conclusion, and only my own, subjective conclusion, that this is the reason you can have psychological conditions that relate to pain and other discomforts may persist. Because it is very hard to analyze data. </p>
<p>Now if you are convinced the way I am convinced, you know why you can feel there is something in your throat when there isn't. The neurons in your muscles fire signals non stop, and your brain knows a certain way of analyzing them, and while there is nothing wrong with it, it will continue analyzing them in that same way, because of the way it is used to analyzing that same stream of information. I believe that's why we have psychological pain, and other chronic pain or discomfort that lingers. </p>
<p>How does that help you? Well, it helps you in a certain way of looking at things. First and foremost, you are not responsible for it. It's your very tools that delude you. You are as much free of blame as you are for being unable to reach something five meters away. Your tools are perfect for what they do. Sometimes they just malfunction. This happens to everyone, everyday, countless times. It just happened that your case of malfunction happened on an analysis that brings you discomfort.</p>
<p>And another way it will help you is this: it will tell you how to proceed from here to find a solution to your lingering problem, which I know you will find, because you have already established it was linked to anxiety. You typed it here. While you are anonymous on reddit, you had the courage to read people's responses to your situation. You took control of it. That is the hardest step with chronic pain. Now it is only a matter of time. </p>
<p>How do you find a solution then? You ask yourself this question: Why did your brain misinterpret the situation of your throat while you were dealing with anxiety? Did it need to misinterpret it? Did it help you to have a painful condition in anyway? Even in ways, were you aware of it, you would stop it, you would not need this kind of help consciously, but it helped anyway. Did your condition help you in any way, aside from the discomfort it brings you? Were people less demanding on you when you had this condition? Were you less demanding of yourself since you had this condition? Maybe you were pushing yourself too hard, and the way you are, you WANT to push yourself too hard. You wouldn't have it any other way, except when you literally couldn't because of the pain. Or maybe people expected too much of you, be it your parents, your partners, your significant other, your children. Now that you are REALLY in pain, maybe they are more understanding. Maybe now that you are REALLY in pain, you are more understanding of yourself. </p>
<p>If any of what I just typed is the case, then push them away. Create your own space. You can deal with disappointment. You can deal with being disappointed in yourself. You still need your own space, your own timing. Maybe what you can't accomplish today, you will accomplish later. In your own timing, in your own way. Push the expectations away, and you will find your solution. Then when you have your own space, you will deal with the problems. You will be stronger then, and the problems will just crumble under your strenght. Now, to get stronger, you need your space. Be nice and kind. Do not burn bridges. But you need to push the pressure away. If you know that is your problem, then know that you will do what you must do, to have your space.  </p>
<p>I am just a guy on the internet. I suffered from a very specific case of chronic pain, called Cluster Headaches. I also suffered from other types of headaches regularly. They also started in a time of anxiety. I sought professional help. And along with it, I found my own answers and understanding. What I typed here is the way I found my solution. I found my answers this way. </p>
<p>Do not take my own answers, to my own life, as a guide to yourself. Take professional help, as professionals are MUCH better than myself. If a professional tells you what I type is wrong, they are right. But I typed all of this JUST IN CASE they might be a little help, or may be somewhat relatable. I know you will deal with this, in your own time, in your own way. I wish you good luck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a different kind of chronic pain and this did so much sense that it's embarrasing</p>
<p>As an architect and artist, I've been suffering from upper back pain AND tennis elbow AND severe sleep disorders to the point I would turn off the phone in the mornings when the alarm rings and wake up at 2pm without remembering ever being awake, sometimes making that into 12 or more hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Looking back, the pains and problems first started, and have felt the worst, whenever I've felt very anxious about my performance (feeling I'm behind schedule and/or working with less than my full potential, whenever I overpromise and underdeliver, whenever I'm showing off way more than I'm showing up... Eventually, finding myself under massively unrealistic expectations). Then the only escape (since I wouln't accept my limits and mistakes) would be to find myself in these situations of slight victimization  (&quot;oops, sorry I fucked up, I COULDN'T wake up in time, something must be wrong with me&quot;, &quot;oops I guess I need a medical license because I CAN'T work with this pain&quot;)..</p>
<p>Of course there's a physical side to these problems. I used to rely too much on coffee, hence the sleep disorder, and my anxiety (made worse by my coffee abuse) would create constant tension on my neck and shoulders, shortening my muscles overtime, forming painful trigger points. Eventually I have learned to cut coffee intake (I still use it for for the creativity and focus boost but only in very special ocassions, no more than once a week) and studied my body enough to come up with my own &quot;maintenance&quot; ritual of stretching and self massage, which I do daily, to fight back my lifelong &quot;physical tension tendencies&quot; of flexing my neck. Meditation and awareness pauses during work has reduced this constant flexing too.</p>
<p>But, guess what: before I started fixing myself like this, the pains and problems would go away (or diminish substantially to the point where they would be no more than slight annoyaces) whenever I did get control over my projects and my overpromising mouth!</p>
<p>... And if I kept doing things right long enough, they would start creeping back in whenever I started stumbling into success, as if I unconsciously was chickening out (that's another issue altogether).</p>
<p>Tl,dr: yes this is all true. I'm no scientific-data-something, but I know for a fact how much power our mental tendencies have over our physical anomalies. It could be a way of your body of coping with something that's even more uncomfortable, whether your realize it or not. The only real fix is to make peace with yourself, read the signs of your body, pinpoint the situations that spark it... And use this information to improve yourself overall</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suffered from severe depression for about five months, and along with it came medical conditions I quite literally made up in my head. It took me awhile to figure out that all I needed to do was to calm down... And realize that it was all in my head. But as anyone who has had depression or anxiety knows, it just doesn't work that way. I am glad that I got everything straightened out in my head, I am in a much better place now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have health anxiety when depressed also. Most apparent when I am so depressed that I am off work, and need to frequently attend medical centres to get the doctor certificates.</p>
<p>I obsessed on how the other patients were contagious and how my medications were killing me. So I sat there in the waiting room profiling the other patients. Have they been travelling and contagious? Or have a superbug? I was reassured by the obese, figuring they were more likely to be there for non contagious diseases like diabetes.</p>
<p>My doctor referred me to a psychiatrist when I instructed him to have seperate clinic days to attend only to the non infectious patients, so I would be safe to attend. </p>
<p>Then I moved on to obsessing over medication side effects.</p>
<p>I later found an online university based intervention program (sorry, can't remember which) that explained the preoccupation is a method to absorb your attention away from the actual source of your misery. It certainly is easy to spend hours investigating and researching health disasters and your symptoms. The solution was therapy, or to get a new absorbing activity. I settled on adult colouring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I think I had this or a bit of it.  Last year when I was going through some things, I was very anxious, depressed, etc...I developed this lump feeling in my throat that would not go away.  This caused more panic cause I was sure it was a tumor.  I did kinda get used to it and then it went away.   I never gave it much thought but as the situation passed so did that lump.  </p></div>		</li>
