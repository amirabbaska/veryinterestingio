			<div class="markdown"><p>Because you cant observe it while it does this, you can observe it before, or after. Observing changes the outcome otherwise. Remember, at these scales you need to absorb the thing you want to observe in a detector in order to excite and electron to know that it was there in the first place. Theres no where to 'capture' a particle and have it switch between 45 and horizontal and use that as a proxy for 0 and 1 etc. Its a bit unintuitive, but you cant transfer information this way. </p></div>		</li>
