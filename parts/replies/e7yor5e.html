			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a question which is very specific to the implementation. Uncertainties from different sources can be added/multiplied/exponentiated/etc in <a href="https://www.nde-ed.org/GeneralResources/Uncertainty/Combined.htm" target="_blank">well-defined mathematical ways</a>. The final uncertainty value for an experiment like this (and in fact, most reported uncertainties in science) is a combination of uncertainties from various aspects of the experiment (for example, in the PRL paper, ion temperature uncertainties, quantum projection noise, timing uncertainties for the free evolution period, etc.) If you're curious about this specific experiment, it's described in pages 2-4 of the paper, which is mirrored on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.03908.pdf" target="_blank">arXiv</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I'm really glad to have someone as knowledgeable as you answering questions here. Is there a large field of physics research on this topic (atomic clocks)? If so, is there a good literature review for more beginner type people who want to familiarize themselves to it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned how to do the partial uncertainties using partial derivatives; i.e. the partial uncertainty with respect to a variable is the partial derivative of the function with respect to that variable times the uncertainty in the measurement in that variable. (And of course the combined standard uncertainty in terms of the partials is the same.) I can't tell if that's what this method is based off. Is it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm piggy-backing off this to clarify. Is there a physical standard by which we measure time? What is the most accurate scientific definition of a second? Originally, the second was 1/86400 of a day which I would assume was derived by the location of the sun returning to a defined spot. As we got more precise with measurements, I'm sure we got the actual rotation of the Earth down. But then we realized that the rotation of the Earth wasn't actually constant.</p>
<p>It looks like now the official definition of a &quot;second&quot; is 9,192,631,770 cycles of a Caesium atomic clock. So wouldn't that mean that a Caesium atomic clock is exactly accurate in terms of keeping time? In order to determine a variance we would need a different definition of time, wouldn't we?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The definition of the second went through an interesting history.</p>
<p>First, i was a fraction (1/86400) of the Solar day. But the rotation of the Earth around it's axis isn't all that constant, and our clocks were keeping better time than the Earth was.</p>
<p>The next step up was a fraction of the ephemeris year, and then the tropical year.</p>
<p>After that, an atomic standard was chosen, and caesium came out as the best candidate. The exact definition of the second became 9,192,631,770 cycles of a particular transition in the Caesium atomic clock.</p>
<p>But even that definition got refined slightly more over time, by adding (in 1997) 'at a temperature of 0K and at rest' to take care of any uncertainties caused by the temperature (black body) shift and any relativistic effects.</p>
<p>And finally, the definition of TIA also includes that the clock has to be corrected for its height above (or below) the geoid, as we know that changes in gravity alter the rate of a clock.</p>
<p>A caesium clock with all these corrections carried out is by definition accurate as it realizes the definition of the second. Still, if you put a bunch of caesium clocks together, they will have show small differences over time, due to noise and very subtle effects.</p>
<p>Physicists are looking for the successor to the caesium clock, which is likely going to be something based on an optical transition in e.g. Ytterbium. The latest atomic clocks are actually much more precise than caesium clocks can achieve.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The details are very technical, but one key concept thatâ€™s not impossibly hard to understand is this one: build multiple, identical, independent clocks and compare their measurements to each other.  The idea then is this:</p>
<ul>
<li>High quality clocks agree with each other more closely than they do with worse clocks, or than worse clocks agree with each other.</li>
</ul>
<p>How accurate the clocks are is then a function of how closely they agree.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, if you build multiple identical clocks, there's the risk that they all have the same kind of systematic error. So they could all agree closely, but still be subtly wrong. Actually analyzing and understanding all the uncertainties and effects is still a requirement.</p></div>		</li>
