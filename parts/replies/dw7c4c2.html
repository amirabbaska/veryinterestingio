			<div class="markdown"><p>This pretty much exactly what I was looking for, I've been doing this for a couple years now but I still have a hard time explaining the difference to my friend And I tend to freeze up when I'm asked the very question that's in the title. I personally understand the differences I just needed help figuring out a way to word it</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey there, sorry for this off topic question but I read in this post that you got into filmmaking, and recently I’ve really been wanting to get involved and learn the process myself. I have a DSLR that does video and software for editing that I’m learning how to use (and actually trying to educate myself on the process, not just following online tutorials), and some ambitious roommates with hands that are willing to help.  </p>
<p>Basically my question is how do I properly start? I’ve written things, edited, and made random videos before.  However, now that I’m actually trying to learn the process/art I feel frozen and don’t really know where to begin.  Also, any books or resources you could recommend?  Is this a viable hobby for someone who simply loves the craft and wants to learn more about it?  Right now I’m simply working on learning how to write, learning about photography, and learning about editing.  Is this a good place to start or should I just take a class or something. </p>
<p>Also feel free to answer NONE of these things, again it was off topic</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not going to pretend I'm an expert, but I can tell you that learning to shoot stills or video with crappy lighting is just as instructional to anyone willing to review their own work with a very critical eye.  I learned more about lighting trying to shoot in low light environments that I thought I would.  Specifically, I tried to snap clubs and parties where hauling around flashes and lights completely destroyed opportunities for candid shots.  I learned quickly that lighting color completely changes the composition.  If you have the chance, shoot the same thing with different lights and really critically review the results.  I'd further suggest you have someone else look too, because you might learn something about your own biases in your resulting images or video.</p>
<p>And remember to have fun with it.  Try some extremes(lighting) that should make no sense... the extremes can make the best learning experiences.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lights for photography are expensive because they do things that other lights do not.</p>

<p>So, what are those things they do? </p></div>		</li>
