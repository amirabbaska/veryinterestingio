			<div class="markdown"><p>What does that mean and how do they do it? Also, do the dispatchers/police use GPS to track down every call they get? I'm asking because for those that call 911 as a prank or by accident or even people in actual need but have to hang up for whatever reason, they almost always (almost I it's an accident and the caller explains what happened when they call back) send a couple of units out to the location just in case the caller actually needs help or for pranking.</p></div>		</li>

<li>
<p>Spoofing is the concept of using a fake number in place of your own when making a call. It can be as simple as using a fake number, using the number of a specific contact, or by making the call show as unknown.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can spoof your number using different methods, the most common and disposable being VoIP services.  Most methods are traceable to some degree depending on the logs that are kept by the services used, but there are still untraceable methods that you have to be an employee in a telco to access</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A 911 call goes to a local public service answering point (PSAP).  The PSAP can directly contact wireless telco providers to get location history or they can access recent records thanks to enhanced 9-1-1 (E911).  Normally, they can only get the tower or interconnect you most recently used, however there are systems which can triangulate your location from multiple points of reference or directly access your phone's GPS records through third-party apps if you have permitted it.  </p>
</li>
<li>By default, most law enforcement will treat any accidental call that is instantly released as a real situation and send someone out to check and make sure everyone is okay. It is better to go out and not be needed than not to go out and be needed. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I just wanted to add some info on how dispatchers actually find a caller’s location if the address isn’t provided, and I’ll be going over how this works in the US, as I’m not sure how other countries work. </p>
<p>So, preface, how emergency calling works:
There’s several mobile service providers in the US, like Verizon, AT&amp;T, etc, and each company owns cellular towers in their service areas, and the towers are used <em>normally</em> only for phones in that service provider. So, a Verizon connected phone will go to the nearest Verizon owned tower for normal phone calls. </p>
<p>When someone calls 911, it will connect to <em>any</em> cell tower that is the closest available. That means, as close as possible that isn’t overloaded with traffic, and any service provider. The phone doesn’t even need a SIM card. </p>
<p>Now, how do dispatchers actually find the caller?</p>
<p>Well, they do what is called “pinging.”</p>
<p>Short answer:
They ping a bit of info to the towers, which goes to the phone, and the phone sends it back with location info. </p>
<p>Long answer:
The dispatcher pings the three nearest cellular towers to the caller’s area, and each tower gets an approximate location, judged by signal strength, and other various bits of data/info. With the three tower’s info, the dispatcher can get a damn good guess of the caller’s location. That’s called triangulation. </p>
<p>This isn’t done everywhere, but AFAIK it’s a pretty common method of finding location for dispatchers. </p>
<p>I missed quite a bit of info but this goes a lot more in depth than some of the answers I’ve seen on here. </p></div>		</li>

<p>That happened to me in high school in the 90s. My mom and I were home alone one night. My mom was already asleep. I had recently shut down the computer after a late night online at the local BBSs. About half an hour after I went to bed, a police officer knocked on the door. We called 911 to make sure that the police officer was supposed to be there, and they said it was ok to open the door. They told us they got a hang up call - from the data line that we used exclusively for the computer, and on which there were no voice phones. To this day, I'm still not sure how that line dialed 911.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone answered the spoofing part of your question better than I could.  So skipping that, dispatchers get a lot of information from your number when you call.  If it's from a landline they'll get the exact address, but if it's from a cell phone, right away the only information they'll have is what tower the call is from.  That could mean a pretty big area so it's not as useful.  If they get a phone call that hangs up, they'll keep trying to call back.  You'd be surprised how many people manage to accidentally call 911.  If it sounds like you're lying and somethings wrong or don't pick up, that's when the police are dispatched. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last part of that varies by agency. Accidental calls don’t always warrant a dispatch. If there’s no signs of distress, some agencies will only attempt a couple of callbacks on a dropped call and then move on. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A &quot;burner phone&quot;.  You can buy a cellphone and SIM card with cash and no ID.  At that point there's nothing to connect you with that phone.</p>
<p>So, you can call with a fake name, and throw out the phone.  At that point all they know is the general area the phone called from, and, in theory, they could look up any other ever calls made from that phone so you'd better not have used it to call your mom.</p>
<p>If you're caught with the phone on you, they could determine THAT phone made the illegal calls</p></div>		</li>
