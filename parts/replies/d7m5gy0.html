			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you see a double-v in a word, then you know it's a fairly recent borrowed word. If you turn to the W section in most French dictionaries it will be, at most, half of a page long. With words like 'wagon', 'Wallon', and 'whisky'. If you include all words containing the letter W, it'll only be a couple pages. </p>
<p>It comes from German and is pronounced like a V. The English W sound is made by the combination OU, like oui (yes), ouest (west; the pronounciation is the same which i think is awesome), etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how you write your Ws.  If they're loopy at the bottom, double u makes sense.  If they are sharp, double v does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The long s was used at the start of words, and regular modern s was used at the end of words, as in Greek where Sigma is different at the beginning and end of words. They stopped using it because people confused it with f.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>C used to be used for G and K, and once they introduced G, k became  pointless, except some fixed examples. <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DK" target="_blank">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DK</a></p>
<p>Edit: I'd also like to point out, K isn't used much in romance languages. According to my sources, K isn't listed as a letter in <a href="http://www.sttmedia.com/characterfrequency-italian" target="_blank">Italian</a>, <a href="http://www.sttmedia.com/characterfrequency-spanish" target="_blank">Third least used in Spainsh/Second if you exclude accented characters</a>, and <a href="http://www.sttmedia.com/characterfrequency-french" target="_blank">12 last used in French, but <strong>second if you don't include accented characters</strong></a></p>
<p>Super Edit: This just describes frequency, not just how many words have the letter K, so for something more anecdotal but in a way more applicable, my Spanish to English dictionary list 25 words that start with K, and I find it difficult to find words with K in them.  </p></div>		</li>
