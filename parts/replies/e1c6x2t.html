			<div class="markdown"><p>What about ketamine metabolites that exhibit the antidepressant effects and are not potent NMDA antagonists (and are free of the side effects)? I think the explanation OP deserves should include these.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I recall a friend being really upset and taking a dose.</p>
<p>45 minutes later, he was in the same depressing situation, but completely fine with it - even elated.</p>
<p>The way it works (completely basic explanation) is that it prevents parts of your brain from communicating with each other and it's much more difficult for your depressing thoughts to make their way across cohesively.</p>
<p>This disassociation makes the experience of consciousness much more comfortable and interesting.</p>
<p>The dopamine released makes you feel happy.</p>
<p>Put it all together and you have an interesting, happy trip - also music sounds amazing and if you close your eyes you can leave your body. At least that's what I, DarkTussin, have heard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many NMDA receptor antagonists are in the works and are being FDA fasttracked. I was in a study for rapastinel which binds to the glutamate receptor instead of the same spot as ketamine so it isnâ€™t shown to produce the dissociative effects like ketamine. Esketamine is another product in clinical trials. Unfortunately the trial did nothing for me :(</p></div>		</li>
