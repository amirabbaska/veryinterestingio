			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually don't; just a combination of strong personal interest in marginal ways of existing, interest in socialism, and social connections with punks and hippies. I also kinda dated a person who was homeless by choice, because she liked the freedom; she always migrated to British Columbia in winter, but she knew a thing or two.</p></div>		</li>

<p>it would be so much more affordable if we made some other sort of provision for them, like maybe bought them each a bus pass. Chances are, they'd lose or sell it though.... it is a pickle.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a cynical joke people make in Vancouver.  Part of the extremely high number of homeless people here comes from failed government policy, but a substantial part of it comes from the mild weather compared to Eastern Canada.  Also, Alberta police would pick up high maintenance homeless people and put them on a bus to Vancouver.    </p></div>		</li>
