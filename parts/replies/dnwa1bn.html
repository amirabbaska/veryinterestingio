			<div class="markdown"><p><strong>disclosure:</strong> This turned into a rant when it was just supposed to be a polite 2c, but oh well. I feel really strongly about rewarding young kids' curiosity instead of basically dismissing it with responses that teach them nothing.</p>
<p>This is a response, not an explanation. It's understandable to a 5-year-old's vocabulary and life experiences, but it's not any more of an explanation than &quot;because it can't&quot; would be. </p>
<p>&quot;Venom only works in your blood, so your stomach breaks it before it can get there&quot; would be a vastly less confusing response, and at least a marginal explanation, without all of the pointless and arguably misleading metaphor of shapes and holes. It would invite the 5-year-old to ask followup questions like &quot;how does venom work in your blood?&quot; or &quot;how does your stomach break venom?&quot; or &quot;are there times when the stomach cant break venom?&quot;.</p>
<p>The previous explanation's followup questions? &quot;Why is venom a square hole?&quot;. &quot;What if venom was a small square and the stomach was a big circle?&quot; &quot;If venom cant go through your stomach, where does it go? Does it stay in your stomach forever?&quot; Much more obtuse this way, and much more potential for misunderstanding due to misinterpretation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No disrespect to OP, but the problem is that this doesn't really <em>explain</em> why eating venom isn't so bad. </p>
<p>The reason eating venomous parts isn't as dangerous is because venom is made of peptides/proteins, the same stuff that meat is made of. Humans can digest meat therefore they can digest venom. </p>
<p>Now <em>poisons</em> on the other hand are where you eat it and get sick. An example is the stuff in blowfish/fugu (tetrodotoxin). It can't just e digested like venoms, and it causes you problems. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, kind of. I mean, venom passes harmlessly through the digestive track but not through the bloodstream. In your example, venom doesn't pass through the stomach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mm.. Honestly I think this answer is just confusing, both to your average adult as well as any literal five year old. It sounds like there would be a spatial mechanical component to it and that someone literally designed these things and how can blood<em>stream</em> even be a hole and actually the venom enters your stomach just fine anyway and .. it's just not really explaining anything.</p>
<p>Idk what you guys' experience with 5y olds is, but you could def be a wee bit more accurate with them than this (and really ELI5 doesn't even refer to literal 5y olds). All these boxes and holes are misleading.</p></div>		</li>
