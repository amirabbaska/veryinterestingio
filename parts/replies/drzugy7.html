			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless the law has changed in the last 10 years, I believe you can get an automatic only license. I knew some American kids that already had their license at 16 and turned 18 in Portugal, had to do the lessons and exam; they chose to do it in an automatic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>understand some people cant tune a radio station or use climate controls well driving .... or just wipe thier ass properly in daily life, so an extra pedal into the driving mix for some people is just out of the question.</p>
<p>As a mechanic i try to teach people stick... just for kicks, I've met plenty of people I wouldn't trust with driving a car without both of those hands on the wheel at all times. </p>
<p>Once i tossed in a shifter and clutch riding with those people to teach them was like the scene from &quot;planes, trains and automobiles&quot; when john candy turns into the devil and starts laughing his ass off at his passenger as his passenger is freaking out because they are driving into oncoming traffic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is well documented from manufacturers like BMW (M cars specifically)and Porsche that the popularity of manual transmissions in the American market is what keeps them available.</p>
<p>It’s interesting that the everyday cars have manuals but the enthusiast cars purchased in Europe have very low take rates on a manual while the US is the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Ireland the only automatics are rental cars or adapted vehicles for disabled people. I've never driven an automatic.</p>
<p>Also a big part of it is mechanics cant deal with them, the parts have to be imported and take ages meaning even if an automatic was a bit cheaper people would take one.</p></div>		</li>
