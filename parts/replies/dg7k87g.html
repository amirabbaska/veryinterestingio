			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know about percentages, but as of 2016/2017 about 3 times as many US soldiers were casualties in WW2 as in all the armed conflicts since combined. </p>
<p>128 000 of those were Korea. (36 000 dead) </p>
<p>211 000 from Vietnam. (58 000 dead)</p>
<p>57 000 from Iraq/Afganistan. (6 000 dead)</p>
<p>Compared to WW2's 1 000 000 casualties. (400 000 dead) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would highly disagree with the argument that the Korean War was an American (more correctly put, United Nations) loss. The UN/US did not act to conquer North Korea, they acted preserve the sovereignty of South Korea and kick out the invading North Korean communists. In this they undoubtedly succeeded as the DMZ ended up roughly at the same place as the 38th parallel (the original border) and South Korea was kept intact. The fact that UN/US forces crossed into the North during the war and attempted to take the whole peninsula and were repelled by Chinese and Soviet forces is a battlefield defeat of course, but conquering North Korea was never a primary war goal when the war started for the UN/US. So this should be taken into consideration. </p>
<p>The North Koreans on the other hand (with Stalin and Mao's approval) invaded South Korea with the primary war goal of conquering it. What they got in the end with basically no territorial gain, enormous casualties, and their country more heavily bombed than the Japanese Empire was during WWII.</p>
<p>North Korea failed in achieving its primary war goal of conquering the South. Its Soviet/Chinese allies expended a gargantuan amount of blood and treasure to bail North Korea's failed invasion out of total collapse and simply hold the line. How is that any sort of win for them?</p>
<p>At least for the US, as ugly and disappointing as the war became to some, in the end they saved South Korea which would become a key Asia-Pacific ally in time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would agree that the point is debatable. We can call it a stalemate. However, I would call it a strategic loss because it showed how far America would go to intervene. This led to the SEATO treaty which perpetuated our involvement in Vietnam. Sure, on the ground it wasn't a defeat, but if you look at the big picture it was a strategic loss</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm wouldn't call it that. The North Koreans started a war and achieved none of their goals. The UN Forces achieved their goal of defending South Korea.</p>
<p>The UN/US failed in their mid-war attempt to take all of Korea and eventually decided that that was a lost cause, but they accomplished what they had first set out to do in intervening in the war: Preserve a non-communist South Korea. </p>

<p>I see it the complete opposite way. The United States and its allies showed in Korea that it was willing to fight communism anywhere if it threatened those they viewed as friends, even in small or seemingly insignificant places such as Korea (at the time). Not a small development in the international order during the early-Cold War-period. The Americans and the United Nations showed they were willing to fight if the line was crossed in the post-WWII order--sending the message to Stalin and his allies that there wasn't another Munich ready for him or his allies. </p>
<p>Your connection to the war leading to Vietnam puzzles me. Would the US have been in a better security position at any time had South Korea been conquered by communism in the 1950s? Would that have been a better outcome? The entire Korean peninsula ruled by the Kim Dynasty and allied to America's enemies? </p>
<p>As it turned out strategically, since you mention it, South Korea eventually built itself into a powerhouse economically while North Korea sank into a seemingly bottomless pit of uselessness except for producing a vast amount of human misery. I wonder which Korea is more helpful to have on your side?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think butchered is the correct term, especially given the ratio of casualties inflicted on the Chinese to each Marine KIA or wounded.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on who you ask. US sources say around 17,000 US causalities. Chinese sources say 19,000 Chinese. In a hasty retreat, I don't the US stopped to count the dead Chinese. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Casualties covers dead and wounded. I don't think the Chinese published how many actual dead were inflicted on them in the battle, but the US dead was around 1,000 with a further ~5,000 missing, which could be dead/Captured/MIA. As reflected in the &quot;non-battle&quot; casualties, ie casualties from the cold and weather, a decent portion of those missing could have fallen out during the withdrawl and died as well.</p>
<p>The Chinese likely never released an official figure because they either 1) don't know or 2) propaganda. If you follow first-hand accounts from the 1st Marines, they were mowing them down like cord wood. It wasn't just a rout with 5th/7th Marines booking it out of there, it was a breakout. There were also phases of the battle in which the Marines dug in and fended off waves of assaults by Chinese elements that were many factors larger than the defenders, and the Marines held.</p>
<p>Yes, casualties were high, largely due to the weather. But using the term &quot;butchered&quot; seems to imply they took it lying down, and that they were decimated and no longer a fighting force.</p></div>		</li>
