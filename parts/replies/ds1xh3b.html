			<div class="markdown"><p>When I have done this, I had pre formed open ended chocolate cups.  The opening is narrower than the widest part of the hollow cup.   Think of it as a sphere with one end chopped off.  The ganache or other filling is piped into the open cups.  Then melted chocolate is used to cap the ends of the cups.  Once those are cooled the closed cups are dipped in melted chocolate to conceal the process.  It sounds a lot more involved and time consuming than it is.  It actually takes longer to make the fondant than it does to do the rest of the process.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They use a split mold in order to make a hollow core which is then filled with ganache. You can see when you buy them, they have a very faint line going all the way around.</p>

<p>They must make them different where you are. In the UK you can quite clearly see the hole where they fill them like a doughnut.</p></div>		</li>
