<p>The simplest explanation is that car companies are terrible at building infotainment units</p>

<p>I think this just may be it. I recently bought a Pilot (as my wife's car) and the entire electronics in that this is absolutely garbage. This is fucking Honda. It's a beautiful car and drives very well but everything about the electronics in that car is shit. It's slow, stupidly designed, lousy hardware. etc. There is not one good thing about it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a nice wrapper explanation to an issue that goes deeper. The trend to cars/phones/electronics is that you're not supposed to work on it yourself. The trend to everything is that you're not supposed to own anything you buy anymore. You have a license to use what you've already bought. It's less obvious in computers, a little less obvious in phones, and even less obvious in cars etc. If you gain root access to your phone, you've likely voided your warranty. If you attempt to root your car, you might be liable to be sued. They really want you to depend on their bullshit. There's nothing so &quot;advanced&quot; about your car's computer that only the people that built it can work on it. Collectively, people can figure that shit out. It just really doesn't figure into profits well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newer BMWs, Volvos, Porsches, and the newest Audi’s are all pretty impressive systems but the other points you make are all valid. Additionally these systems usually are tasked with running a bunch of auxiliary systems (digital gauge clusters, heads up displays, blind spot monitoring, and often the climate control too).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to say, I rented an X5 on vacation last year and it had a great multimedia head unit. I also remember liking the setup the Cadillac XTS had, especially the part where the head unit would list up and there was a space with a wireless phone charger behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reliability/safety is a huge part. They most often require redundancy in their circuits, if the primary circuit fails it needs to work but throw an error code. This makes them much more expensive and specialized/custom.</p>
<p>This means they can get boxed solutions for the common multimedia functions, but they have to code proprietary software for everything specific to the vehicle.</p>
<p>$25 Amazon tablet has very low reliability requirements and likely no redundancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a lot of cars, the head unit/infotainment system is more vital than you would think. Depending on how the CAN network is setup, losing the head unit can affect many other systems. I think the head unit in the Dodge Charger Hellcat (and I'm assuming other variants as well) plays a part with the smart key system. No head unit and the car won't start.</p></div>		</li>
