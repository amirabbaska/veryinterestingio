			<div class="markdown"><p>That photo looks not quite right, but the idea is the same. That photo shows giant sized &quot;baby teeth&quot; and it shows the 6 year molars fully erupted before any of the anteriors have exfoliated which is unusual for most kids. Google &quot;child's panoramic x-ray&quot; and you will see some good images of how things develop in the bone first. I would link some but idk how to do that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's unfortunate! Baby teeth tend to be weaker than adult teeth so he will probably end up spending a lot of money saving them, or getting dentures at some point. It's common enough for folks to retain one or two, but all of them is surprising. Plus his smile must look a little funny because his teeth must be itty bitty. Not to sound mean to your friend...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not totally unusual. Some people develop later or more slowly than others! Good way to freak out your friends though! I wonder if the tooth fairy still comes when you're in highschool? it only seems fair. </p></div>		</li>
