			<div class="markdown"><p>So it would be two hemispheres separated by a frozen wasteland at the equator? Think of the effect on animal and plant life! Once life leaves the oceans (assuming it remains passable) it might evolve separately. </p>
<p>Also civilization would be fun to imagine how it would adapt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I understand correctly it would be one hemisphere of summer / nearly perpetual daylight, and one of winter / nearly perpetual nighttime depending on the season or position of the planet's orbit around the star. </p>
<p>The rotational equator would experience seasonal shifts between having a day / night cycle and having perpetual twilight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit: Thanks to the many of you that brought up tidal locking, this is a good point to discuss. In the case where the orbiting body has a rotational axis orthogonal to an imaginary axis placed at the centre of the orbit, angular momentum would prevent this. Try taking the wheel off a bike and spinning it, then turn yourself around in a circle while holding it vertically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the sun would be rather interesting at the equator.  near the equinox you'd have regular day / night cycles, but near the solstice you'd see the sun in a very flat, twilight like orbit.  basically a more extreme version of what happens north of the arctic circle on earth now (obviously, since the new 'arctic circle' would be really close to the equator).</p>
<p>E: You'd also have two cold cycles a year, near the solstices.  Second Christmas!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would assume the planet is tidal locked with the sun, one face always pointing at the sun and it's rotation looking like a clock from the suns point of view. If not, from the point of view of the sun, at one point it would be clockwise. 1/4 year later it would be rotation from bottom to top. Then 1/4 year counter clockwise. Then 1/4 top to bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does not the equator get direct sunlight twice a year? Would not this melt the ice? </p>
<p>My assumption is north pole gets sunlight 1/4 of year, south pole does the same. Other 1/2 of the year sun is more oriented toward equator.</p>
<p>And when the sun hits equator, the plaent will have regular days. Except that the sun will rise from North (or South). </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You're right that the equator gets 12 hours of direct sunlight in spring and fall, but that's a lot less than &quot;real earth&quot;, where the equator gets 12 hours of direct sunlight all year long.  Atmosphere and ocean heat transport are very effective at keeping the temperature pretty constant.  In the paper I mentioned, the equator stays around 275-280 Kelvin all year round -- that's about 35-45 F.  It's a little warmer in spring and fall.  </p>

<p>That's right.</p>

<p>Nope, just regular days, with the sun rising in the east and setting in the west.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd assume that if the magnetic fields were to behave the same as they do now, they'd only be weaker in this respect near the poles, not everywhere.  So it would likely impact habitable zones a bit, but not make the planet life-averse.</p></div>		</li>
