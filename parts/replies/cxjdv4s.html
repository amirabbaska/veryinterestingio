As a punishment his teacher asked him to add all numbers from 1 to 100, and Gauss only took seconds to answer.<br />
He had noticed that you could add numbers by pairs : 1+100=101 ; 2+99=101 ; 3+98=101 and so on. So 1+2+..+100 = 101x50 = 5050</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this like the fly going back and forth between two bicycles approaching one another and figuring the distance flown?</p>
<p>(It was mentioned in A Beautiful Mind, the book.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Von Neumann was at a dinner when the hostess posed this old problem:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two bicyclists start 100 miles apart, and head towards each other, each
one going 10 mph. At the same instant, a fly leaves the first bike and
flies at 20 mph to the second. When it gets there, it immediately turns
around and heads back to the first. Then it repeats, going back and forth
between the two bikers. By the time they reach each other, how far will
the fly have travelled?</p>
<p>The easy way to solve this problem is to realize that the bikers are
approaching each other at a net speed of 20 mph, so it will take 5 hours
for them to meet. During that time the fly is travelling constantly,
back and forth, at 20 mph, so in 5 hours it will travel exactly 100 miles,
and that is the answer.</p>
<p>The harder way is to sum an infinite series. The first leg has the fly
meeting the biker at a net speed of 30 mph. They start off 100 miles
apart so it takes 3 1/3 hours to meet, during which the fly travels 66 2/3
miles. Now the fly will turn around. By this time the bikers have
drawn to 33 1/3 miles apart. So this second leg of the trip will take
1/3 as long. Similarly the third leg will take 1/3 of the second, or 1/9
of the first, and so in indefinitely, with each leg taking 1/3 as long
(and hence the fly going 1/3 as far) as the previous one. So the answer
will be 66 2/3 times (1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ...). The value of that
infinite series is exactly 1 1/2, so the answer is 66 2/3 times 1 1/2,
or 100 miles.</p>
<p>Von Neumann thought for a brief moment and gave the answer. The hostess
was disappointed and said, oh, you saw the trick, most people try to sum
the infinite series. Von Neumann looked surprised and said, but that's
how I did it. (Cue laughter/applause.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm afraid I don't understand the connection between the first bit and the second. Where do you get 101x50?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1+....(n-1)=n</p>
<p>2+.....(n-2)=n</p>
<p>These sums exist (n-1) times, because you can make them from (1+(n-1)) to ((n-1)+1)</p>
<p>So you get n*(n-1) </p>
<p>For the &quot;highest number&quot; you have to add n, so you get n*(n-1)+n</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was having a hard time figuring it out too, but it  looked at some answers below and I've got it. The first thing is to know the formula for the sum of consecutive integers: n(n+1)/2. In Abstractation's formula he noticed the first and last groups were sums of consecutive integers, and are simply the same sum twice. So to get the complete sum of only the first and last groups it's going to be 2 times the formula, or n(n+1). The problem is we have to include the &quot;middle&quot; number, and we want to define that one as n instead. This forces us to plug in n-1 in the formula instead of just n (both groups have 1 less number than our middle number, i.e. n-1 numbers). When we substitute it our first and last groups now sum to (n-1)n. Now we add this plus the leftover n from the middle and get n^2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent illustration of what mathematical brilliance is. It's not just solving the problem, it's coming up with a novel and elegant solution.</p>
<p>Similar problem, you have 10,000 coins, all heads up, you flip over every 2nd one, then go back and flip over every 3rd one, every 4th one, every 5th one etc until you flip over every 10,000th one. At the end, which ones are heads and which are tails?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Every coin is flipped as many times as there are divisors for its position, but one less because we started at «2», not «1».</p>
<p>The coins that are flipped an even number of times stay heads.</p>
<p>Of all natural numbers, only the perfect squares have an odd number of divisors (the middle pair of divisors collapses into one number).</p>
<p>So the perfect-square-numbered coins stay heads (odd number of divisors, «1» excluded = even number of divisors) and all others are tails.</p>
<p>1st, 4th, 9th, 16th, 25th, 36th, 49th, etc. are heads.</p></div>		</li>
