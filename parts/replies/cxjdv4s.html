			<p>Story time : Carl Friedrich Gauss figured that out by himself by the age of 8 in 1784.  <br>As a punishment his teacher asked him to add all numbers from 1 to 100, and Gauss only took seconds to answer.  <br>He had noticed that you could add numbers by pairs : 1+100=101 ; 2+99=101 ; 3+98=101 and so on. So 1+2+..+100 = 101x50 = 5050</p>		</li>

			<p>Is this like the fly going back and forth between two bicycles approaching one another and figuring the distance flown?<br><br>(It was mentioned in A Beautiful Mind, the book.)<br><br>&gt;Von Neumann was at a dinner when the hostess posed this old problem:<br><br>Two bicyclists start 100 miles apart, and head towards each other, each<br>one going 10 mph. At the same instant, a fly leaves the first bike and<br>flies at 20 mph to the second. When it gets there, it immediately turns<br>around and heads back to the first. Then it repeats, going back and forth<br>between the two bikers. By the time they reach each other, how far will<br>the fly have travelled?<br><br>The easy way to solve this problem is to realize that the bikers are<br>approaching each other at a net speed of 20 mph, so it will take 5 hours<br>for them to meet. During that time the fly is travelling constantly,<br>back and forth, at 20 mph, so in 5 hours it will travel exactly 100 miles,<br>and that is the answer.<br><br>The harder way is to sum an infinite series. The first leg has the fly<br>meeting the biker at a net speed of 30 mph. They start off 100 miles<br>apart so it takes 3 1/3 hours to meet, during which the fly travels 66 2/3<br>miles. Now the fly will turn around. By this time the bikers have<br>drawn to 33 1/3 miles apart. So this second leg of the trip will take<br>1/3 as long. Similarly the third leg will take 1/3 of the second, or 1/9<br>of the first, and so in indefinitely, with each leg taking 1/3 as long<br>(and hence the fly going 1/3 as far) as the previous one. So the answer<br>will be 66 2/3 times (1 + 1/3 + 1/9 + 1/27 + ...). The value of that<br>infinite series is exactly 1 1/2, so the answer is 66 2/3 times 1 1/2,<br>or 100 miles.<br><br>Von Neumann thought for a brief moment and gave the answer. The hostess<br>was disappointed and said, oh, you saw the trick, most people try to sum<br>the infinite series. Von Neumann looked surprised and said, but that's<br>how I did it. (Cue laughter/applause.)<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>This exact question came up in a job interview as a follow up &quot;take home&quot; question.  My friend was told, just call me when you have the answer.  Multiple hours later, he took the &quot;phone a friend&quot; option and read me the question.  I gave him the short, 100 mile answer, but could not convince him to give up his infinite sums approach.  (He did not get the job.)  I told him not to worry, that he had failed when he left the parking lot.  They simply wanted to know with all his knowledge, did he still have the ability to see the forest for the trees. - At least you could quickly see the error in your approach.</p>		</li>

			<p>The important thing to remember with job interviews is that, unless you're interviewing for something in the hard sciences, all questions have an &quot;easy&quot; answer.  It's OK to bang out a naive approach, but think about how long you have to answer the question and the context of your interview.  If you have 30 min left together, then your approach should only take a minute or two to get an answer.</p>		</li>

			<p>These questions are more about making the interviewers feel clever than testing anything about a prospective candidate.<br><br>Valve software have a rather nauseating 'employee handbook' where you see their narcissism and ego writ large to that extent when they talk about hiring.<br><br>The kids &quot;in the know&quot; of course all pass the answers to these common puzzle questions around to each other. The trick there is whether you can act out the &quot;I'm solving this riddle because I'm smart&quot; well enough to fool the interviewers that you didn't know the answer beforehand.<br><br>Another one is multiplying a big sequence of numbers, except the sequence goes from negative to positive, so the answer is trivially zero - if you see that it's instant, if not you spend minutes multiplying lots of numbers together before you reach zero and presumably twig at that point.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; These questions are more about making the interviewers feel clever than testing anything about a prospective candidate.<br><br>I've seen a lot of interview questions like this online, and I think that's where a lot of interviewers themselves have gotten them.  It does no good to ask the 'intelligent' interview question if you don't know how to interpret the answer.<br><br>That said, I'm still going to ask them if I'm ever in an interview situation.  What <em>I</em> want to see is whether or not the candidate looks at a question like &quot;how many piano tuners are there in England&quot; and gets frustrated, gives up, asks intelligent questions, etc.  How do they respond to situations where they have incomplete information and a lot of pressure.</p>		</li>

			<p>He should have been thinking about the problem in a big picture way, gaining a global understanding of the problem and coming up a mental estimate before diving in with pen and paper to hammer away on the fine details.  He immediately became engrossed in the details that were provided like, &quot;assume instantaneous acceleration&quot;, which instead of eliminating a possible factor that would inhibit quick mental math, only served to spur him on to solve the problem with precision mathematics.<br><br>His engrossment was so deep that he could not see the futility in trying to infinitely solve the solution.  He became increasingly concerned with how many decimal places out he would need to go.  (BTW: This method will never produce the desired result of exactly 100.)  He became so committed to his efforts that he was blinded to any other possible solutions.  Defensive and dismissive would be my description of where he was at mentally at that moment.  <br><br>Since the position he was applying for was a technical management position, it was more appropriate for him to be able see the big picture and quickly rate a series of solutions. â€“ My assertion was that it was possible for him to have solved the problem while he was copying it from the whiteboard, even though it was assigned as a take-home assignment.  And at a minimum, he should have had time to clear his head and see the solution by the time he walked to his car.</p>		</li>

			<p>We approximated the fly to be a point mass of 1g. So the fly won't necessarily die, but as it is a point of finite mass it is trivial that it's volume would be within it's Schwarzschild radius. So for all intents and purposes consider it to be a black hole. That should make your calculations easier. <br><br>You can consider the fly to be dead at the point that the black hole completely evaporates away. </p>		</li>

			<p>But how do we model the black hole evaporating? Are we to assume Hawking radiation is real?<br><br>And what about the black hole itself?

			<p>Basically if when you continue the pattern of 1+100, 2+99, ect. you get 50 pairs who's sum is all 101.  50 101's is 50*101=5050.<br><br>Hopefully that clears it up.</p>		</li>

Since we know there are fifty different sums we can say the result it 101x50.<br><br>In general, the sum of all number from 1 to n can be expressed as (n)(n+1)/2.   </p>		</li>

			<p>Speaking of visuals, picture each number as that many squares. And the numbers ascend, you get a triangle. As they descend, you get another triangle. Two triangles gets you a square. </p>		</li>

			<p>Imagine each number in the sequence as a stack of haybales that many high.  So 1 = a stack one bale high, 2 = a stack 2 bales high, etc.<br><br>Place all those stacks next to eachother, in order, and you get a set of steps going up that resemble a triangle.<br><br>Now do the same thing, but counting down.  So next to the stack of 8 bales is a stack of 7 bales, then six, etc.  This stack will also resemble a triangle.<br><br>Now take the second triangle, flip it upside-down, and put it on top of the first triangle you made.  You get a square, 8 bales on a side.<br><br>*Because usernames.</p>		</li>

			<p>Place down one block. Then, next to it, place down two. Continue like this, building a staircase up. When you get to the largest number (in OP's case, 8) you would have a staircase as tall as it is long. When you do the rest, you would be building a staircase back down. If ypu took the descending half and flipped it on top of the ascending half, it would fit together to make a square (in this case 8x8).</p>		</li>

			<p>1+....(n-1)=n<br><br>2+.....(n-2)=n<br><br>These sums exist (n-1) times, because you can make them from (1+(n-1)) to ((n-1)+1)<br><br>So you get n<em>(n-1) <br><br>For the &quot;highest number&quot; you have to add n, so you get n</em>(n-1)+n<br></p>		</li>

			<p>I was having a hard time figuring it out too, but it  looked at some answers below and I've got it. The first thing is to know the formula for the sum of consecutive integers: n(n+1)/2. In Abstractation's formula he noticed the first and last groups were sums of consecutive integers, and are simply the same sum twice. So to get the complete sum of only the first and last groups it's going to be 2 times the formula, or n(n+1). The problem is we have to include the &quot;middle&quot; number, and we want to define that one as n instead. This forces us to plug in n-1 in the formula instead of just n (both groups have 1 less number than our middle number, i.e. n-1 numbers). When we substitute it our first and last groups now sum to (n-1)n. Now we add this plus the leftover n from the middle and get n^2.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hmm, interesting, I like it! I actually thought of it a (possibly more dumb) different way:<br><br>Notice that:  <br>1 + n-1 = n  <br>2 + n-2 = n  <br>3 + n-3 = n  <br>.  <br>.  <br>.  <br>n-3 + 3 = n  <br>n-2 + 2 = n  <br>n-1 + 1 = n  <br><br>How many &quot;n&quot;s do we have here? (n-1)! [! as in excitement, not factorial]. So we have n, (n-1) times, so n(n-1). Then there's still an extra term of n, hence the second line.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ah, now I see what you did. That's actually more elegant since it doesn't require prior knowledge (or needing to derive) the sum of consecutive integers formula. Cool stuff!</p>		</li>

			<p>This is an excellent illustration of what mathematical brilliance is. It's not just solving the problem, it's coming up with a novel and elegant solution.<br><br>Similar problem, you have 10,000 coins, all heads up, you flip over every 2nd one, then go back and flip over every 3rd one, every 4th one, every 5th one etc until you flip over every 10,000th one. At the end, which ones are heads and which are tails?</p>		</li>

			<p>Every coin is flipped as many times as there are divisors for its position, but one less because we started at Â«2Â», not Â«1Â».<br><br>The coins that are flipped an even number of times stay heads.<br><br>Of all natural numbers, only the perfect squares have an odd number of divisors (the middle pair of divisors collapses into one number).<br><br>So the perfect-square-numbered coins stay heads (odd number of divisors, Â«1Â» excluded = even number of divisors) and all others are tails.<br><br>1st, 4th, 9th, 16th, 25th, 36th, 49th, etc. are heads.</p>		</li>

			<p>The prime numbered coins will be tails while the composite numbered coins will be heads.<br><br>This is because prime numbers have an odd number of factors while composite numbers have an even number of factors.</p>		</li>
