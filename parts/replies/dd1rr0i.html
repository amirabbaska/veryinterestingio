<p>You also notice CGI when it's unrealistic and absurd.</p>
<p>I'm not one of those guys who is all like 'practical effects are always better!' but I <em>do</em> think CGI lets directors get away with far too much over-the-top ridiculous stupidity, whereas practical effects would mandate they tone it down to something that won't, for example, kill all the actors by overlaying huge stupid explosions on everything.</p>
<p>Practical effects are slower, more costly, and more limited, and thus directors have to use them properly. They can't just Lucas it up and slap tons of shit in in post.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed there is a bit of noticing with expectation. The Star Wars prequels and Hobbit movies fall victim to this effect. People over the years have picked at various scene and bits for bad CGI, all the while not noticing they are often pointing out a singular flaw in an image that is a sea of CGI work.</p>
<p>As unlikable as the character is, Jar Jar actually came off pretty good animation wise. He just nails that uncanny valley because in the back of your mind you know full well that there is no puppet or body suit on the planet that can achieve that level of articulation. Yoda was the same way. CGI Yoda was not that bad, but he lacks the quirks of the puppet version, especially that slight forward lean and bounce all Muppets gained when &quot;walking around&quot; due to the way they were animated. As such, no matter how well he was done, CGI Yoda was going to be notifiable.  For years we knew Yoda to be a Muppet, and a rather stiff one at that, and thus a Yoda fluently articulating threw everyone for a loop.</p>
<p>Same with The Hobbit. Everyone bitches about bad CGI with various orcs or effects treatments in a movie where every frame on the film has some sort of CGI treatment on it.  And as much as I respect the guy, Ian McKellen's complaining about the filming techniques amounted to low level whining. One of the first things you do in a serious acting class is to learn how to hold convincing conversations with inanimate objects. It should have been no problem for him to rattle his lines off at some tennis balls, or whatever they had him talking to when they were filming the dinner in Bilbo's home. When an actor talks on a phone in a movie, there is no one on the other end. Quite a few one on one conversations (like at a table) in movies are filmed with the actors performing their lines separately as well as together to provide better close up shots and with more angles. In the very little acting experience I've had, monologue acting was the very first thing you learned. </p>
<p>Strangely, GCI that is dubbed into a finished image seems to work better than CGI from scratch. Forrest Gump pulls this off nearly perfectly despite the primitive CGI method used (I call it the photoshop movie), and the Mos Eisley background shots in the Star Wars reissue did well in adding life to previously dead shots.</p>
<p>In the end CGI becomes noticeable because you are already watching you know in your mind to be unnatural and unreal. CGI Yoda looks weird because we know there are no little green guys in existence and the only thing on earth that fights anywhere close to his style is an angry house cat. After two movies of watching him limp along like his cane should be a walker, Yoda's ninja mosquito routine is quite off-putting. The animation is awesome, the action itself just seems weird, though. Even being 20 years younger, we feel a 780 year old Yoda should not be quite so agile. I honestly think that if Yoda had done nothing but stand around displaying godlike powers and proving to be completely physically feeble the entire series no one would have noticed the CGI Yoda, even in long shots. </p>
<p>It just seems to me there is a lot of whining about seeing CGI exactly in places where you would expect to see CGI. </p>
<p>One note about Jurassic Park. They were concerned about shiny skin on dinosaurs who had DNA spliced with amphibians...who typically have shiny skin.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first time I really had an appreciation for what CG artists do was when a friend of mine who moonlighted at this job would work on his CG stuff, (the film was on Netflix. It's kinda cheesy but that's not his fault. Sinbad the Fifth Voyage. It actually still had a lot of stop motion scenes in homage Ray Harryhausen who recently died). I saw him take a green screen room with people in it and turn it into a medieval room with torches on all the pillars. He tried to explain what he is doing when I watch, and I try my best to understand and I do for some of it. But it's crazy and these people are underpaid and need more respect.</p></div>		</li>
