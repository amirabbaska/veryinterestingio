			<div class="markdown"><p>See, this was my train of thought too.. So just like I replied to someone else's comment, wouldn't it be beneficial for banks to stay open even just one hour later? Or is this just pointless because they know that the average 8-5 worker will find a way to get to the bank regardless?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At our bank, it took us 15 minutes to close up shop.  If a teller has a shortage, the longest it ever took to determine what happened was an hour.  If the bank branch is organized, it all just flows like any other business. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if they are taking hours, something isnt organized correctly or their tellers are horrible at keeping their drawers balanced.  Longest I saw was 90 mins and that was because they accidentally set the time locked safe on a 3 day weekend to 4 days, and had to call and schedule someone to drill it open on a Monday.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We all had a good laugh about it once the vault was open. Luckily we were able to get by most the day without too many issues</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at a bank as well and when he said &quot;but even now, closing and balancing a branch can take a lot of time.&quot; I started to laugh quite a bit. My bank closes at 4, but we keep the door open until 4:05. We start closing and getting everything done around 10 till and make sure we're going to balance when we do close. We're always out of the bank by 4:10.</p>
<p>Just like you, the longest it has ever really taken was an hour or so to find an outage if there ever is one, which is rare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Saved me having to explain all of that. As a bank worker I couldn't agree more with your 3rd point. With some customers even when you try to explain all the new electronic ways to bank, they just pretend it doesn't exist afterwards. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>As one of those annoying customers, let me explain our logic as well. I can speak for basically anybody who isn't over 80 that still goes into the branch for these personal banking tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Debit cards are <em>one more</em> card to keep in the wallet. Too many cards, trim the fat and the debit card has got to go. A lot of people use CC for just about everything and don't typically need to pull money. When we do, its easier to go to a branch located in a nice retail space you were going to be in anyways - and walk up to the teller with your drivers license (a card you generally need to keep in your wallet) to pull the cash. Most tellers in my experience fill out all the necessary information on the slip for me as well - an added bonus. I literally stand there and engage in the small talk they're trained to make with me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you use an ATM, you can't easily rob the bank. Every now and then, many people get these temptations to rob the bank. Breaking into an ATM is not easy (source: Breaking Bad s02e06). Slipping a note to the teller that you've got a gun is very simple (hint: you don't actually need to have a fun). I've personally never robbed a bank. But we like knowing we've got the option when we're going by to withdraw money anyways.</p>
</li>
<li>There are no lollipops/coffee at the ATM machines outside of the branch. You need to physically be in the branch to appease yourself of these amenities. At that point, you might as well just get to the teller if the line isn't looking like the DMV.</li>

<p>Some of the worst days of my childhood were when the bank teller at the drive-through would send a butterscotch-flavored Dum Dum lollipop. My sister and I fought over who had to take that one. Who even likes those?</p>
<p>First world problems. Drive through banks. Magic tubes to send stuff into the bank. Magic speakerboxes to talk to the teller. Free candy. And I'm complaining.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's pretty depressing. I guess they just wanted someone to spend time with...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i always have a fun when i rob banks; it's serious business. my family's been robbing banks at fun point for generations. these guys going around all willy nilly writing notes about having a fun and slipping that to tellers is very undignified. it's like when reality shows started becoming &quot;a thing&quot;. so yeah, i mean, whatever you don't necessarily need to have a fun, but i think it's trashy if you say you do, but you actually don't.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, There are some things that I can't do online, like closing a savings account that's been empty for years, simply because the bank has a chance to upsell me if they make me come in or call.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not because they want to up sell you. Not primarily anyway. As someone else has already bought up, it is a security matter. Although for empty accounts there is minimal risk involved, so really that comes down to the manager using common sense. Which I confess, they don't always do sadly.
Getting to speak to you before you close the account does give banks a chance to get some feed back as to why you're closing accounts. That feedback does matter to the bank, even though most wouldn't believe it.</p></div>		</li>
