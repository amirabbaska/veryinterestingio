<p>State vs. Federal supremacy is always tricky.  Who is right in this situation?  We'll most likely have to wait a few years for the courts to decide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do remember reading that the FCC did something that would prevent states from making their own net neutrality laws. This might not be the best example but marijuana is still illegal federally meaning in the usa its still technically illegal regardless of the laws states write but that hasnt stopped states from making their own laws on it. All i have to say is try and stop us.</p></div>		</li>
