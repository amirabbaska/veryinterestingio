<p>The ones I've observed (also orb weavers) often retain the same location over extended periods.</p></div>		</li>

It's so efficient because they lay there waiting for preys, and if they catch nothing they actually can recycle their trap and get a good proportion of proteins back. </p></div>		</li>
