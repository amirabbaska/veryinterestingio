			<div class="markdown"><p>When talking about radiation, we speak of something called Electromagnetic radiation most of the time. </p>
<p>Nuclear decay may also have alpha and beta particles &quot;radiate&quot; from it, but it's not really radiation in its case.  Alpha and beta particles high speed ions (atoms with charge. Meaning, they don't have electrons in case of alpha, making it strongly positive, whereas beta radiation is &quot;simply&quot; a positron (positive) or electron (negative).) They are very, very damaging but due to their particle nature, are stopped by as much as a sheet of paper for alpha, an aluminium plate for beta. Alpha can both ionise whatever it impacts with, causing chemical damage or initiate nuclear decay if it hits just right. Beta cannot initiate nuclear decay, but it can also cause severe chemical damage.</p>
<p>Chemical damage is caused by the ions described due to their charged nature messing with the chemical bonds in our bodies, and due to how delicate the shape of macromolecules are (proteins, DNA, RNA, Hormones, whathaveyou), even the slightest change in their shape due to ionisation can have devastating effects. Thankfully, our bodies have grown accustomed to such due to background radiation and we have natural defence mechanisms. </p>
<p>The defence mechanism is usually for the cell where the damaged molecules are contained to self-destruct, nullifying the effects. Some cells are also capable of actively repairing the damage without needing to self-destruct. As was mentioned, the greatest risk for cancer is in those cells that rapidly divide. This is my own conjecture, as I'm no biologist, but I believe it to be due to the cell not having the time to recognize the issue before dividing, letting the small error multiple at an exponentiation, run away way.</p>
<p>Nuclear decay has a third type of radiation, called Gamma Radiation. Gamma radiation is the least powerful of the Alpha, Beta Gamma triad of nuclear decay, but it's also the hardest to stop. It is practically a ray/wave of light, whose wavelength is so small that a water molecule is larger than its given width. The smaller the wavelength of light, the faster it has to vibrate. This is because the speed of light is constant, and for that to be true, wavelength and frequency are in an inverse relationship. The faster light vibrates, the more energy it has.</p>
<p>Your phone emits radio waves, a sort of invisible light that has large wavelength and slow frequency. This means it is very low in energy - lower than visible light in fact. For radiation to have a risk of cancer, it must be ionising. and for it to be ionising it must be ultraviolet.</p>
<p>Refer to this graph for various forms of light.</p>

<p>P.S.: I do concede that it is possible to use infrared light to destructive effect. See microwave ovens for reference. However, all this does is heat things up, and requires an incredible amount of targeted engineering to be used against humans outside of a special chamber.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed-energy_weapon" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed-energy_weapon</a> </p>
<p>You can increase the amount of energy light has by increasing its frequency (adjusting its ability to cause damage to be more severe) or by increasing its intensity (doesn't cause more severe type of damage, but is capable of causing more of what it might already be able to. Compare a light bulb to a laser. A light bulb dims quickly, as its density of light rays reduces at a square of the distance, whereas a laser remains focused for a long time.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand that the only difference between gamma Rays and x Ray's is their origin. Otherwise they are the same. But you just put out a huge response about radiation from the decay of isotopes. We are talking about the voltage differential between an anode and a cathode in a vacuum tube, hitting a Target that emits x-rays. But, they do have the same effect on tissue, so you're not wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer. In fact when using a collimated beam (as in an x-ray), using blankets or other shields can sometimes be <em>worse</em>, because the scattered radiation in your body will backscatter on the blanket from <em>within</em> and back into your body. It also increases the chances that the picture will be bad and have to be re-taken. For these reasons shields are not used as much as you might imagine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this is true. The lead in the blanket absorbs the x-ray radiation. It doesn't scatter or reflect it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea you're actually right, we should expect almost zero scattering since it's high Z and low keV.</p>
<p>We should expect some characteristic x-rays though.</p></div>		</li>
