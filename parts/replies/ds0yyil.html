			<div class="markdown"><p>In this instances, often the damage <em>hasn’t</em> been fixed. When the brain is damaged, it heals like a bad cut on your arm - with a scar forming. Unfortunately this scar can’t function like the original healthy brain it is replacing. </p>
<p>Patients with long term comas (or even other, less dramatic types of brain injury) basically have long-term irreparable brain damage.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m sure it is, particularly with regard to spinal cord injuries. Stem cell therapy would be one potential avenue to explore here.</p>
<p>At the moment, though, we don’t have a meaningful treatment which can reverse established brain injuries. </p>
<p>Our care for these patients is based around 1.) treating the cause as quickly as possible (like removing a blood clot causing a stroke), 2.) preventing additional brain injuries cascading from the initial problem (like big swings in blood pressure causing bleeds in the brain), and 3.) aggressive rehabilitation. </p>
<p>Although the brain can’t repair damaged tissue, it can find new pathways which allow function to be regained - like traffic taking a different route to the same destination when a road is closed. The younger you are, the more your brain is able to do this. Rehab helps push this on - this is the ‘learning to walk again’ process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not really my area of expertise, but these will be patients who have presumably demonstrated an unusual ability to repair damaged brain tissue, or re-route around it. This is clearly very uncommon, however, and we wouldn’t really see these patients on the ICU.</p></div>		</li>
