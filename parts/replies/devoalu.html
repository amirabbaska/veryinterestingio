			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to guess that you either take a prescribed dose of Adderall, or use it occasionally to help you study? That's not a heavy use profile, and paranoia/psychosis is what you'd expect from... say... taking Adderall all day, every day, for a week (recreationally, not per Rx, not in a small dose to study). </p>
<p>Note, I'm not suggesting that taking Adderall off label is a smart move either, but not because it's likely to cause paranoia or psychosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok that's fine, but calling it an amphetamine is misinformation. If you wanted a more general term you could just call it a stimulant.</p></div>		</li>
