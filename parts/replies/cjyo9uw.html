<blockquote>
<p>If the outer pane fails, it is important that it looks like it fails. The pressure supplied by the small hole makes sure of that, since it pressure equalizes and transfers the load from the middle pane to the outer. Without it, the middle pane would be taking all of the pressure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the outer pane fails, the air goes through inner and middle pane through the tiny hole, right? And I understand that the air compressors make up for the loss of air through this hole. But if the outer pane fails, how can it &quot;take pressure&quot;? If it fails, doesn't that mean that there's a (non-intended) hole or something, which means that the middle pane would be taking all the pressure? And I thought you said that because of the air compressor it's no problem if the middle pane becomes the main one (&quot;it's the spare&quot;), so why is it bad if it would be taking all the pressure?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way, I'm thinking <em>outer pane flies away or is completely loose</em> so then the middle pane takes over, and the hole is no problem because of the air compressor.</p>
<p>So</p>

<p>What does it look like when it fails?</p>
<p>Sorry about all the questions, just really confused, and now that I've spend all this time on it, I just really want to understand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the hole was not there, and the outer pane was damaged, there would be no way of knowing, because the middle pane would still be completely sealing off the cabin.  Because of the hole, there is a pressure differential if the outer pane is damaged.  Not enough to be dangerous in the short term, but enough to be noticeable so that it can be fixed.  The hole also actually makes it so that any damage to the outer pane is likely to be MORE catastrophic (due to the pressure difference) and thus more immediately noticeable as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hah, I wake up and immediately understand it now, maybe I was too tired. Thanks!</p>
<p>Though I still have the question of <em>what does it look like when the outer pane fails?</em> Does it fly away, does it get huge cracks, does it completely crack up (like holding ice under warm water), or does it just get really loose on the edges?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The goal is to have a backup line of defense. The outside pane holds all of the weight when it's working, and the middle pane serves as a backup then. </p>
<p>So, when there's a problem with the outer pane, you ABSOLUTELY want it to break away. If it didn't break away, the middle pane would hold all the pressure and in that scenario you would not have another backup. By putting a hole in the middle pane, if the outer cracks it will make a huge mess and alert you to say &quot;hey this window is really messed up we should fix it now&quot; so that you don't have on only the middle pane, which then would have no backup. </p>
<p>So, without the hole, if the outer pane cracks, the middle pane would hold all the weight. But, in this scenario you would not be able to see any damage and you would be flying without a backup, which would be really dangerous if the middle pane then broke because you would have no backup. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, what? If it 'breaks away', how can there be anything to provide support to the middle pane?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pure guess here. the hole allows the escape or drop in pressure, to seep through the failed panel, causing it to crack/fall off. If there was a small fracture, then it would be less likely to be spotted. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is required for various aviation safety reasons. The standard to fully evacuate an airliner is 90 seconds. Every second counts. Since takeoff and landing are the most critical parts of the flight, blinds are kept up so:</p>
<ul>
<li>The crew can see outside if needed. (e.g. Is either side safe/unsafe for evacuation?)</li>
<li>Ground personnel can see inside if needed.</li>
<li>Acclimate the passenger eyes to ambient light conditions, so they can act swiftly in case of evacuation. Cabin lights will also reflect outside lighting during takeoff, i.e. full on during day, dim at night.</li>
<li>Passengers will also be able to spot problems potentially.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Takeoff and landing are traditionally the most dangerous phases of flight. Leaving all the blinds up means it's quicker and easier to assess threats (fire, debris) blocking the emergency exits in the event of a crash landing.</p></div>		</li>
