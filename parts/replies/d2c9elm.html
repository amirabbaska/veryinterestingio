			<div class="markdown"><p>The anus itself? No. However if you look up the medical procedures ending in -ostomy, you'll find a wealth of information about how these kinds of things can be handled. Basically, if the anus were to get infected to the point it could no longer be used by the body correctly, a surgeon will connect part of the intestines to the abdomen. The anus would remain in place, and if the infection can be treated before irreversible damage is caused, the intestines can be reattached.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are alternatives apart from colostomies should the anal sphincters lose their functionality. If it's temporary, like to facilitate healing following major anal surgery, sure, but there are options for instances of permanent disability as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that very few ostomies are performed due to anal issues. They are generally performed due to issues affecting the colon and rectum (cancer, colitis, crohns, that fun stuff). Anus simply refers to the orifice and most issues affecting it (hemorrhoids mainly) can be treated with a simple outpatient procedure. Only if you lose control over your anal sphincters does it become necessary to perform an ostomy of some sort - we see this in certain paralyzed individuals and some folks with nerve disorders. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it is not necessarily safer.  There are two competing processes at work here.</p>
<p>1) Most pathogens can travel with the flow of your digestive system more easily than against the flow, if they are motile at all.  So for some pathogens, this means they would have a hard time colonizing you beyond the area you've... inserted... them.</p>
<p>2) Your body has a whole slew of safety measures for protecting you from pathogens you eat/drink.  Like stomach acid.  This also means that most pathogens are killed before they make it to your colon, and most of the bacteria there are harmless.  Inserting pathogens directly into your rectum robs your body of the chance to deal with them properly.  Also, your body <em>lacks</em> a convenient and easy way to intake fluids from the other end.  People who use enemas can suffer trauma and often bleed rectally (you can Google the topic if you really want to), and that means that pathogens get easy access to your blood stream and/or peritoneal cavity (which can kill you in a matter of hours).  </p>
<p>So while it's possible that, in limited circumstances, you might possibly prevent certain infections by hydrating rectally, it's probably not advisable to &quot;butt chug&quot; if you're stranded on a desert island.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely used only as a last resort. If you have to choose between dying from dehydration within a day or risk dying from infection within in a week but increase the chance of getting rescued  that's when you decide that an enema might be a good idea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hmm maybe not raw buttchugging, but i can see how one might surmise that perhaps even slightly disinfecting it before the buttchugging may benefit your health..</p></div>		</li>
