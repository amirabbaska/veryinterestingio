			<div class="markdown"><p>This breaks my heart. My mother has SMI. Her home is foreclosed, she spends 10-12 hours out of the day roaming the streets, and absolutely refuses treatment. Unfortunately, there is no way to help someone who is able to say no to it. The US is in dire need of mental health reform </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What should be done differently? If you want your mother to receive treatment against her will you'll have to fill out a petition at the courthouse. These are filled out in good faith based on your belief that the person needs to be evaluated for mental illness. The hospital can then force her to stay on their psych ward for treatment. </p></div>		</li>
