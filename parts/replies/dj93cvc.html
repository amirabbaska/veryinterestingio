			<div class="markdown"><p>Both kind of systems are used. For instance, latitude and longitude is a spherical coordinate system. Cartesian coordinates are easier when you have to add vectors (e.g. a delta-v that isn't parallel to the current velocity). And for some calculations you may even need both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not in astronomy, but I can think of tons of applications where you may need more than one. Its not trivial, but you can also easily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_coordinate_transformations#To_Cartesian_coordinates" target="_blank">convert between systems</a> Really useful when you need to integrate a spherical function (F(r, phi, theta)) over a plane (dx, dy, dz) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple (trigonometric) orbital models often define a polar coordinate system unique for each satellite, sometimes (bizarrely in my opinion) having the origin in the center of the elliptical orbit instead of at the barycenter of the two-body system.  Those models aren't particularly useful for engineering work though so you end up with Cartesian coordinates with some inertial origin (e.g. barycenter of the solar system) and differential equations defining movement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think generally East is defined as the direction the planet spins, and then North would be 90째 left of East -- this follows the right hand rule (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Right-hand_grip_rule.svg" target="_blank">curl your right hand as if into a fist; your thumb will point north</a> [where when you do the same curling with your left hand, that thumb will point south]). Whether or not this is how North/up-on-maps was defined historically I don't know, but mathematics and science has settled on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-hand_rule" target="_blank">right-handedness</a> so this is how any modern scientist would think of it. (Screws and knobs and caps and lids are also right handed! I never have to remember which way to turn a lid or screwdriver; instead I point my right thumb in the direction I want to move the lid, and the resulting curl of my fingers tells me how to twist it.)</p>
<p>As he said, <del>all the planets in our system</del> all but two planets in our system (except Uranus and Venus) rotate in the same manner in which they revolve around the sun, so rotational-planet-local East/North is the same as revolutions-around-the-Sun East/North, except for Uranus whose &quot;rotational north&quot; is tilted 97째 from its &quot;revolutional north&quot; (compared to the Earth's 23째 axial tilt, which is responsible for our seasons), and except for Venus which has undergone a strange mix of various effects including atmospheric, solar, and other-planetary-gravitational-perturbations which have combined to eradicate its &quot;original&quot; rotation so that it now rotates opposite to its revolutionary motion, albeit so very slowly that its year is actually longer than its day. Venus and Uranus are definitely strange outliers in weird circumstances though, and in the rest of the galaxy/universe we'd expect the very large majority of planets (though not all, like our own system) to have their rotational axis point in roughly the same direction as their revolutionary axis.</p>
<p>But in the absence of a revolutional-axis to compare to, rotational-axis definitions will always define &quot;East&quot; to be the direction of rotation and North on its left, in accordance with the now-ubiquitous right hand rule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both definitions exist.</p>
<p>Fortunately in most cases these two definitions are equivalent. Only Uranus is a problem. If you hold a technical discussion about Uranus' East you'll have to be clear on which definition you're using.</p></div>		</li>
