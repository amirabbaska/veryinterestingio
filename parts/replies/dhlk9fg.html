			<div class="markdown"><p>Great questions, but not so easily explained. Firstly, the principle of two surfaces 'touching' each other comes down to atomic/molecular repulsion when they come very close together (commonly modelled as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennard-Jones_potential" target="_blank">Lennard-Jones potential</a>) so things will generally repell when they get close to eachother, however, things like cold welding can occur where there is no atmosphere.</p>
<p>Now, there are different ways of looking at surfaces, usually involving a concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">quantum tunnelling</a> and, as you can tell, this is deeply in the realms of quantum mechanics and can be a little complicated. But in this case, we can apply it to surface where we say 'here is a flat surface, this is where the materials atoms end' and this isn't usually hard to visualise. But wait! Quantum tunnelling is a thing, and it basically means that electrons can exist outside of this 'boundary' we defined and it gives us a probability of electrons being outside of this surface. Taking this concept forward, you can even use a kind of probe that you can bring extremely close to a surface (like as close as even a few atoms-gap between the probe and the surface) and long-story-short, you can run a current between the probe and the surface due to this overlap of electron density going beyond our boundary. This concept is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanning_electron_microscope" target="_blank">scanning electron microscopy</a> and lets you 'see' what a surface looks like using all sorts of technological and engineering tricks. I hope this part didn't go too far off topic.</p>
<p>And finally, in theory, a photon can traverse and kind of gap between surfaces. Specific wavelengths of light (X-rays and other high energy, short wavelength photons) can penetrate most materials (think X-rays of a broken leg) and generally don't interact very strongly with matter, so it kind just passes through more than it would 'traverse'. In terms of a hydrogen atom, it's pretty likely since there is normally some kind of gas between surfaces that are not under vacuum, and hydrogen atoms are very small, so this isn't beyond the realm of reason.</p>
<p>You can go into the ideas of porous materials and all sorts, where you can consider the surface of the pores and how gasses can move through them, but this is a large subject on it's own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info.  Quantum physics is well beyond my understanding.  Some parts make sense, but then I was reading about the twin slit experiment and get all lost again.  I think I'm going to stick to being a professional computer nerd.</p></div>		</li>
