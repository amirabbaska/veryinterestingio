			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised Erwin's estimate was taken seriously at all.  Saying that a beetle isn't found on multiple tree species just because he tested a few, and claiming that the unknown number of beetles is equal to the unknown number of all otter animals in proportions, is kinda silly.   You'd expect it to be an overestimate given how beetles are so smol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Are they really, compared with the median species?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both marine and terrestrial environments are hugely undersampled, meaning there are many more species yet to be discovered. So, the fact that marine environments are perhaps more difficult to sample is not entirely relevant here. In both cases, we can't really use the number of described species to come up with an estimate for total species diversity. The important information for the example above from Mora et al. is to have good estimates for higher taxonomic levels above the species. Since we do have these, the 8.7 million figure does indeed include marine species.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That 8.7m figure then seems very small if aquatic life is included. We have absolutely no idea really what’s in the oceans. Even if we theorize that we’ve catalogued 10% of ocean life, using the train of thought here, how do we know where we’ve been looking is where life is? There are just too many variables to come up with a valid number. Does this include all the life underground too? Because we have no clue (yet) if there are things living near our planets core. </p></div>		</li>
