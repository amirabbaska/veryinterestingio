			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, they had cooling methods. Not <em>exactly</em> the same as air conditioning, because air conditioners both cool and dehumidify the air. More like swamp coolers.</p>
<p>Now, central heat and plumbing? Yes, they had that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They weren't exactly as smart as we are. The brain needs training to improve it's capabilities, and modern education and environments are better at training reason and analysis. You can see it in IQ scores: they keep scaling the scores down to keep the mean score at 100.</p></div>		</li>
