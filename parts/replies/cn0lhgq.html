			<p>I dont disagree. I hate spending the money I do on my smartphone, but I use it in almost every aspect of my life at this point I dont want to NOT have it. Seriously. I dont NEED it, but its not like Im using it only on frivolous things. coordinating bus times would be an absolute bitch without it. Not to mention a seasonal job I do in the summers has me going to obscure addresses all over the city, in which my GPS has been necessary to locate.<br><br>Same goes with my computer / internet connection. Finding jobs would be much harder without a constant access to the internet. Not to mention that many places wont even accept in person resumes anymore. <br><br>I dont even need to mention all the bonuses the internet provides beyond utilitarian work related stuff.</p>		</li>
