I have lots of things i'd consider asking as well! Thanks for your input here!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do have a bit of both, I have a dick. Dick works. Can confirm! And I do have a vagina but idk how internally developed it is. I do have periods although they aren’t exactly regular. I don’t know if either are like sexually fertile but they do the mechanical bits fine!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is absolutely fascinating! Do you identify with being a male? Do you feel sexual arousal with both organs? What do you think is the hardest part about the condition?</p>
<p>Don't mean to pry, but it's so rare and really cool of you to answer questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd get your fertility checked out. True hermaphroditism in humans has never been found, which would be both systems completely functioning. If you were the first then it would be good to get that documented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never look into it, it’s a secret nobody but my close friends know, so I don’t really associate with all the politics of it all, what I have found in the past tho is watching blue planet with my gfs family and there was a hermaphroditic fish and her fam who don’t know said it was sorta a gross concept which wound me up the wrong way a little.</p></div>		</li>
