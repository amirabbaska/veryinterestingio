<p>First, the &quot;signal strength&quot; bar on your phone is entirely the receiving signal from the tower to your phone.</p>

<p>This isn't true for CDMA or LTE. The phone knows the level of signal from the tower, but also the tower gives feedback of how well it can &quot;hear&quot; your phone. </p>
<p>Sidenote: Usually when you have low to no signal, the problem isn't that your phone can't &quot;hear&quot; the tower. It's that the tower can't &quot;hear&quot; your phone. </p></div>		</li>
