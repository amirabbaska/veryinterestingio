			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea that scientists in the '70s and '80s thought there would be an ice-age is a myth. Like any good myth there is some truth to it, and it had been perpetuated by climate deniers. Sulphur particles from coal-fired power stations were having a cooling effect on the globe, while the CO2 was warming. Scientists knew of both these effects. I believe most considered CO2 to be the stronger effect, but the most unpredictable factor was what society would do about it. The sulphur particles had a secondary effect of causing acid rain - a very visible problem - and laws were passed to scrub the sulphur from coal stations. Here's a good article about it: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/06/that-70s-myth-did-climate-science-really-call-for-a-coming-ice-age/" target="_blank">https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/06/that-70s-myth-did-climate-science-really-call-for-a-coming-ice-age/</a>
and here's a more comprehensive one <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1" target="_blank">http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/2008BAMS2370.1</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Not in my science classes in school.  It's an old memory, but I remember my grandfather complaining that this topic was in my science books.  I thought it was just a rant, but looking back, I understood the situation better.</p>
<p>However, you are correct in that it wasn't as strong as it was today.  I remember acid rain and sulphur emissions in general being the most talked-about issues.</p>
<p>But the greater issue is for older folks, who skew conservative, is that they have been pitched multiple crises since the 60's.  And global warming is just the latest story in a line of stories.  And the environmentalists are gradually losing credibility.</p>
<p>Think of it from their perspective:  we were going to die of an Ice Age, we were going to die of smog or acid rain, we were going to die of holes in the ozone layer.  Sure, these aren't major problems any more because we took some action.  But did we really do everything that the environmentalists said we had to?  Nope - not even close.  So there's a kind of anecdotal pattern that &quot;Ah, well, those folks just exaggerate everything to push their agenda.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this post and your previous one.  I'm older and well remember the cries of &quot;If we don't do something NOW we're headed for another ice age!&quot; and now we've come to &quot;If we don't do something NOW we're headed for another Venus!&quot;, not to mention acid rain and the hole in the ozone layer.</p>
<p>It's almost like each generation has their own global catastrophe that has to get fixed, and they get mad at the people that remember &quot;hey, we JUST HAD a huge global catastrophe fear a few years back and nothing happened&quot;.  I don't lean either way as both sides use hyperbole and I think it's stupid, but we're talking about untold trillions of dollars and the entire reworking of the global economy, even IF we can do something about it on a global scale (which I tend to doubt).</p>
<p>I think it's a non-starter, for many reasons.</p></div>		</li>
