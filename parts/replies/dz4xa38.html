			<div class="markdown"><p>Ive always wondered how this worked (especially sorting plastic from glass). Thanks for the clear answer!</p>
<p>Question: what do they do with things that're really small or have multiple types of material in them (like something that has both plastic and metal, metal and glass, etc.)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I don't actually do any of this stuff myself. I'm an attorney. The only reason I know any of this is because one of my clients is a plastic recycler. I can talk about the large-scale process with some authority, but when you get down to the level of how recovery facilities deal with small pieces, I got nuthin'. </p>
<p>Thinking practically about it though, anything too small to stay in a bale after compaction will probably end up getting disposed of. Not efficient to bother with it. </p>
<p>As to sorting, I do know that a lot of recyclers rely heavily on pre-collection sorting, where consumers themselves separate out glass/metal/plastic/cardboard, etc.</p>
<p>Those that don't use a series of sorting processes, each of which is intended to collect a single category of material from a mixed materials stream. Forced air (different pressures can pick out paper and plastic). Magnets. Rotating drums. Manual pickers. Etc.</p></div>		</li>
