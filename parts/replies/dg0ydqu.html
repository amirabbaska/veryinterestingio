			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't that the same as /u/RoaldTo's answer?<br />
If you take the log of 4 pi r^2 you basically get his path loss factor (there should be some floating &quot;2&quot;s, due perhaps to the fact that the power is the square of the intensity)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Did you mean to say frequency instead of wavelength? A higher frequency means it has a shorter wavelength, so based on what you said it should have better range. </p></div>		</li>
