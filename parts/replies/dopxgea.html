			<div class="markdown"><p>If that is true, how come almost all the novels and other books printed in one column format? I mean surely the publishers won’t mind making it easier for the readers if they can simply by switching the settings as to how the written text looks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Novels tend to be longer sentences and paragraphs that flow. Single column is nice easy reading.</p>
<p>Journals and religious texts tend to be lots of short statements and technical detail rich. They don't flow as nicely and breaking them down is nice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I may chime in, novels don’t contain scientific material and therefor easier to follow. Imagine reading about how the boy and girl were walking hand in hand in the park and compare it to how this new drug is extending 5-year survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.</p></div>		</li>
