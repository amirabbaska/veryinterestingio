			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. It's true that this effect is real, but it's not the cause of the non-blurry look. If you think about it, it makes no sense.</p>
<p>The eye basically sees the average light that came in during the last few milliseconds. This means that when something moves, it doesn't appear sharp, but instead gets blurred out into a line along the direction of movement.</p>
<p>The effect this post is talking about would mask what the person sees when the eyes are in motion and only show the fan before and after the eyes have moved, but in both those cases the person's eyes are stationary and see a blurry fan.</p>
<p>To be more accurate, your eyes aren't blind when you're moving them to look at something else. Rather, they filter out &quot;images&quot; that are completely motion blurred from the eye moving so we don't get confused and distracted by our entire field of view being blurry. If you think about it, you can see clearly when tracking a fast object with your eyes, so the motion itself isn't what sets of the masking. It's when your entire field of view is motion blurred. Since your eyes suddenly DO see a sharp view of part of the fan when you move them quickly, your brain doesn't mask it out and you do see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also interesting, if you look as far to the right as you can (with just your eyes), and then move your eyes to look to the other side as fast as you can, you might see a dark flash, similar to a conscious blink. That is this effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the average time the blindness occurs is 10 ms and you do so at an average rate of 40 times per minute for an average day of 16 hours the actual answer is closer to about 23 seconds per day.</p>
<p>times will vary wildy but even being generous and doubling blindness duration and increasing it from 40 to 400 times per minute still puts it at under 10 minutes.</p>
<p>highly doubt it will even be half of 40 minutes</p></div>		</li>
