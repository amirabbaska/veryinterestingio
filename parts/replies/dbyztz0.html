			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in product development for cosmetics and personal care. Some materials like petroleum jelly or butters (Shea, cocoa) do act as barriers and do not absorb into skin, they are a barrier that locks in existing moisture.</p>
<p>However certain ingredients can penetrate the skin but it depends on the particle size, what they are mixed with and how they are applied. </p>
<p>Nanoparticles have a better chance of permeating the skin but are more regulated on the chance that it presents a danger.</p>
<p>The marketing angle is that thinner formulas such as serums have a lighter texture that easily absorb and contain more expensive active ingredients to benefit the skin. Then you lay thicker creams and lotions on top to lock it in.</p></div>		</li>
