			<div class="markdown"><p>Your sense of smell works better in moist air, so shower/bath farts smell more strongly. This is also the reason for the smells right after it rains. It's (typically) not anything in the rain, it's just that you can smell better than normal </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This also goes for the same of a dog's nose being wet. The humidity increases the smell particles to stick to the receptors that sense the smell. <del>This is why rain smells. It's not the rain you're smelling but the increase in sensitivity to smells because of the rain.</del> I'm tired, hope this makes sense. </p>
<p>Edit: Forgot about petrichor. The oils and such released from soil from the rain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this one of the contributing factors to a dogs amazing sense of smell? Like, I know they have a hell of a lot more receptors than us in the nasal cavity but the wet nose also helps add to this. </p></div>		</li>
