			<div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here. I agree with the nurse but wanted to add one more element, the mind.i have a wild story as an example.  I believe and have seen it many times anecdotally the power of the mind to speed up or even cause sudden death. For example,  I was transporting someone back to their home that had 6-12 months left to live and had been in the hospital for a long time. On the way back he was telling me stories, was chipper and so excited to go home to his family. In fact, he said many times he was excited to just go back home. I had him hooked up on our hearts monitor just to record his heart rate during the transport and when we arrived at his house all of the family were waiting outside for our arrival. As we were backing the ambulance up to house the family saw him alive and talking to me. As soon as he saw he was home and saw the family he had this sigh of relief and went unresponsive. Our hearts monitor showed flat line with no ectopy. Usually people go into a fatal heart rhythm before asystole but not him straight fucking flat. This happened all in the time my driver came around to open the doors to find d him dead. He was alive when he put it in park. The family saw him alive and die in front of their eyes. They were so happy however it went fast and could at least see him. My point is how the mind once it reaches it's end goal has mysterious ways of shutting itself down. One of the wildest shit I've seen in my career of 1 5years. On phone so excise Grammar</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandmother was diagnosed with cancer last September. She's 72 and had a multitude of health problems. In June, I came to stay with her. She was so skinny and her legs were puffing up like crazy. I didnt know it at the time but, her kidneys were failing. Her hospice nurse told me in private that I needed to have the whole family (5) fly down to see her asap. We came on the 7th of this month and left on the 12th. She could barely stay awake to have conversations with us. She was restless and constantly wanting to do something even though her energy level was at 0. I got the call on Monday that she had passed in her sleep while getting a bed bath. Though I'm completely heartbroken, I'm so relieved that she isn't fighting her body tooth and nail to stay alive. I believe that she waited for us to leave to pass away. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a very similar story to yours. I grew up a small village somewhere in Eastern Europe. My grandma had cancer and there was nothing anyone could so to save her, so my parents were told to take her home from th3 hospital and that she will pass in a couple of days. They got home, and she wasn't feeling too well so, my grandpa said he will call the village doctor so he could come take a look at her, but she insisted that he goes over to the tiny village hospital to get the doctor instead of calling. The place was probably within 5 min of walking. So my grandpa left to get the doctor, and my mom stayed so she could watch over my grandma. The second my grandpa was gone my grandma had her last breath and she passed away. I don't think she was able to go knowing that my grandpa is there next to her, she needed him to leave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom was an ICU nurse and this story was so striking that I have remembered it through the years. Guy comes in with chest pains from another unit (he was already probably pretty sick) and then starts going into cardiac arrest and passes out. His heart is starting to go. His niece rushes in and screams out, &quot;Uncle Shamus!&quot; And he is revived for only a second and sits up. Then he goes back down and dies a few hours later after his last rites were given. Apparently he was Catholic and very religious so wanted to be surrounded by family at any cost before he went. </p>
<p>The human spirit. Damn. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to believe they have some mental control over death, delaying or progressing. My grandpa held out in a rehab center for weeks until I could make the drive home from school. He passed the same night a few hours after I saw him. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Happened with my father as well. He died, came back, I hadn't had the chance to see him in the hospital so I think he wanted to say goodbye to me. I had a two days with him just spending time in his room and saying how much I loved him and vice versa. </p>
<p>Then we all thought he was getting better so we went to get some food and he died. Within 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Doctors couldn't do anything it was so fast. I think he just wanted to be alone and not freak any of us out. </p>
<p>My dad is a badass. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same thing happened with my fiancee's brother who died of cancer a few years ago. His health deteriorated very quickly so family from all over the country tried to make it in to see him. When the last person saw him he died that same night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You hear this a lot between married couples. They survive bedridden near each other until one dies (sometimes for a long time). Once that happens the other one dies usually soon after (sometimes hours or less). It seems each one holds out for the other until one of them cannot anymore. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To everybody who's following this thread, here's what I saw that helped keep people happy and healthy in the nursing home.  Water is good for you, but these are the things that I saw really make a difference. </p>
<p>1) walk.  Seriously.  you don't have to ultra marathon or crossfit or taebo or any of that shit.  Just keep walking.  As much as you can every day.  Do as much normal daily stuff as you can.  Helps with all the issues of old age.  Constipation, blood flow, mobility, balance, all that.  I noticed that when I had patients who used to walk but became wheelchair bound, those patients usually started a steady downhill slide after they quit walking. </p>
<p>2) Have a purpose.   Some of us are really driven in general.  most of us aren't unless we have a purpose.  Doesn't matter what it is.  Little old ladies going out to get their hair done 3x a week.  Whatever.  Something that you have to look forward to, that you feel invested in.  I really believe that part of the reason that the good die young and pricks live forever is that every asshole you know is always outraged about something.  I'm not saying it's good for you, but it does give you something to stick with.  </p>
<p>3) stay engaged with real live people.  Talk to others.  Be part of a community of some kind. Church is good for that.  Atheist?  get together with other atheists and bitch about the fucking Christians.  Whatever, keep your mind stimulated with other people to the extent you can. </p>
<p>4) Intake and output.  Keep peeing and pooping. If you spend enough time around old people, you will realize a large percentage of the conversation will be about bowel habits.  This is not an accident. Bowels don't work as well as you get older, and constipation is a singularly miserable experience.  This brings us back to...</p>
<p>5)Water.  Drink a lot of it. Beer, coffee, liquor and tea do not count. They are all diuretics which will cause you to lose water overall.  (I'm not saying you can't drink those things, just drink water as well).  In addition to making pretty much everything else in your body work right, it also helps keep your bowel movements soft so you have time freed up to talk about other things, like how you'd really like to get a handy from that blue hair over there with Parkinson's, or like how Doris was making eyes at you while she was taking her teeth out and you know she wants the d (lower case d, because we both know it doesn't stand at full attention anymore)....</p>
<p>I seem to have wandered off the topic a bit...anyway, water.  </p>
<p>PS, if you think sexuality isn't a thing in old people, just ask any female CNA that has ever worked in a nursing home.  Especially once the dementia sets in, little old men are handsy as fuck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom is a nurse and has worked in many nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities, she works in the latter now and loves it. I just wanted to say that this reminded me of things my mom has told me about that have happened at work (leaving out identifying info of course, gotta follow HIPAA rules!!) and this stuff could not be more true! Also, do you prefer working in a nursing home or a hospital? My mom likes working in nursing homes more but when I'm a nurse (which I can't wait for!) I think I'd prefer a hospital- like working in the ER or the OR!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I prefer the hospital. I like the variety, the pace, the chance to use more of my skills.  That said, my cousin is also a nurse and she was born to do geriatric nursing.  Just loves it.  My advice is to keep an open mind in your clinical experiences. I have a friend who always wanted to do med surg nursing until he did an L+D rotation. He's now an L+D nurse.  You don't know what will take your fancy, just find a spot that makes you excited and go for it.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone, even if you're like 25, should give some thought to creating an Advance Directive, either to keep (and maybe share with family), or filing one with your insurance/state/managed care provider. It's like a living will that covers medical stuff, like DNR/DNI (Do Not Resuscitate/Intubate), and can go into detail about specific end-of-life treatments you want (resuscitation and/or palliative care) and stuff like power-of-attorney to make decisions if you are unable to.</p>
<p>From all these great (read: bleak) comments, you've probably realized old age is not a comfortable process, and to be frank, modern medicine's lifesaving interventions are actually violent and painful. CPR is not like in the movies where the hero gets chest compressions and a mouthy kiss. CPR breaks the ribs of a osteoporotic 95 year old and the bones may never heal. Intubation (airway tube) removes the ability for a patient to communicate well. Feeding tubes get infected. Skin falls off from lying in a bed for months.</p>
<p>My wife is a doctor who considered geriatric care as a specialization. When a doctor begins a conversation with a patient or family about end-of-life decisions, it's not necessarily because the hospital/provider wants to save money--it's just heartbreaking for the doctors to do these interventions on a patient whose 'systems' are failing, because they know exactly what's going to happen and what's in store afterwards. It's even worse when they see a family tear itself apart arguing over care in the absence of a directive without actually spending quality time with the confused or non-communicative patient. </p>
<p>Everyone will die someday and even if you're young, anything can happen between now and old age. I'm not saying anyone should or shouldn't refuse care, just saying that preparation and documentation is extremely important. Obviously you would update it as your life and family situations change. Give it some thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keeping someone alive is exactly as you described. We had to intubate my (77 year old) mother for most of last November, and it's taken her until about a month ago to get back to &quot;normal&quot;. She lost a lot under that intubation. She was confused, incontinent, too weak to walk, and miserable. If it happens again I don't think we should attempt it again. She's very frightened by the possibility of going back into that situation and she barely remembers any details from it. It wasn't like she was the same person for the longest time, and I feared we wouldn't have the mother I knew back again. I'm glad to have her back for however long she can live, but last winter was pure Hell and if it was up to me, I would let her pass if it happens again. My father (her husband of 50 years) wants her to live no matter what. I understand, but I feel he's being selfish. I would never tell him that, but it's how I feel privately.</p>
<p>She's always said her biggest fear is being trapped in a body she has no control over, hooked up to machines. I didn't know there was a specific directive you could get to not intubate. I might mention it to her when my father isn't around, just to see what she really wants before anything happens again. Thank you for your post. It's something I really needed to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks so much for your story. I'm so glad your mother is back in your lives and from my own experience with my mom passing at 59 from cancer, I think it's truly a valuable chance to have that conversation with her--maybe with your father together. That conversation, though hard, can really be comforting and also help immensely with the grieving and healing process after she's gone (hopefully with many happy days in between). Go easy on your father though, after 50 years she's part of everything he knows.</p>
<p>You can check with the hospital or her physician and see if they have resources to walk you through the process of creating the advance directive. Many hospitals have a team just to help families understand end-of-life care, though not all of them provide that service automatically. Best of luck!</p></div>		</li>
