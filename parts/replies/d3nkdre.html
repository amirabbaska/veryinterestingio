			<div class="markdown"><p>If maintained, and barring any catastrophic events, The Empire State Building could stand forever. So much of that building has been updated that it's almost a Ship of Theseus situation where more of the building is new than original. Given how famous it is, it'll likely be updated indefinitely. If they had to demolish is they would likely dismantle it piece by piece or explode each floor individuallly. Besides 9/11, no tower that large has ever been purposely demolished, so as of now there is no actual strategy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By dismantling it one floor at a time, so pretty much the opposite of how it was built. This was done with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsche_Bank_Building" target="_blank">Deutsche Bank Building</a> after it was damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center </p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically this is how it looks like, crammed with columns and having relatively small windows because it has a lot of small load-bearing beams in the wall. </p>
<p>A modern building like the old WTC towers had only the core and the outside wall as supporting elements, and those were tied together with beams to hold the floors up, so there weren't any supporting columns in the actual office space. </p>

<p>It is &quot;technically&quot; better built, since the load-bearing supports are just more evenly spread out, but really that only matters when you have something catastrophic occur, like a massive jet impacting the building. For it's function as a place to have a lot of office space it's detrimental. Really it's like saying that some X-Y bunker is better built than your house because it has 15 meter thick concrete walls and can survive a direct hit from a bunker buster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not as simple as other commentors or making it out to be.</p>
<p>There are a massive number of considerations in any design (even at the time of the Empire State Building), and, steel was a better choice for that particular building, in that area, at that time, etc.</p>
<p>Also, modern skyscrapers are taller, and with more length comes more swaying.  Concrete is far more rigid than structural steel, so it helps alleviate that.</p>
<p>Lastly, modern buildings don't <em>just</em> use concrete.  Composite materials (such as steel reinforced concrete likely used in modern skyscrapers) allow us tailor materials to our needs, making stronger buildings with less material usage.</p>
<p>I am not an expert (I'm a mechanical engineer, so I've taken  courses that cover some of this stuff, though), so correct me if I've made any mistakes, and add depth if you have more knowledge (I was intentionally vague in areas where I was unsure).</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Except in special cases dealing with foundation work, all concrete used in modern construction is steel reinforced. </p>
<p>Concrete is a fairly unique construction material. It has high compression capacity, but performs poorly in tension and shear (generally speaking).
Imagine a simply supported beam with a uniform load over the length. This beam has a positive moment in the middle of the span. This means that the top of the beam is in compression, and the bottom of the beam is in tension. Well, concrete sucks in tension, so we put steel (rebar) in the bottom of the beam so all the tensile force is taken by the steel. In fact, when doing concrete design, we assume that all concrete in the tension zone of a beam is cracked, so no tension can develop in the concrete and only in the steel. (strictly speaking, concrete does have tensile capacity, but it is so low that it is easier if we assume it is cracked)</p>
<p>From this you can bound the moment capacity of the beam in terms of the lower of either the tension developed in the steel with respect to the yield strength of the steel, or the total compressive force developed in the compression zone with respect to the capacity of the concrete to not be crushed. This is basically how we determine how much steel to put in a beam, and where to put it. There are some quite nice equations for this.</p>
<p>Standard, mild-reinforced concrete is what you see in typical concrete construction. Mild-steel (just basic deformed steel rebar, nothing fancy) is placed inside concrete formwork and filled up with concrete.  </p>
<p>There is also pre-stressing where the entire section is put into compression before any external loads are applied. There are many types of pre-stressing, but the most common are pre-tensioning and post tensioning. </p>
<p>Pre-tensioning is where you set up your formwork and run some steel cables (tendons) through the formwork. Before concrete is poured, the tendons are stressed. Then pour concrete. When the concrete hardens, you disconnect the tendons from the forms and now the concrete is fully in compression. This is useful for things like light poles. </p>
<p>Post tensioning is commonly used in building construction, mainly in floor slabs and beams. In this method we set up our formwork and layout these long tendons as specified. Pour concrete. When the concrete sets up, the tendons are hooked to a hydraulic jack and stressed (steel used in tendons is 270 ksi, ultimate!!). The way the cables are layed out through the depth of the slab is quite similar to the way a suspension bridge cables look. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A few things. Concrete being more rigid than steel is ... weird because a bunch of what we do is about prestressing reinforced concrete and stuff. Also being stiffer isn't always better. Stiffness increases the frequency of natural oscillations and doesn't always make them smaller oscillations. And concrete is brittle so bad stuff can happen when it's so stiff and the building is moving around.</p>
<p>Great comment, but you requested even more engineering knowledge and there's always more knowledge.</p>

<p>Yes. I'm a mechanical engineer (and not an expert in concrete) too, and if there's one thing that's true of all the internet discussions of engineering, it's not as simple as other commenters are making it out to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know all of the science behind it but concrete has a high strength when it comes to compression but breaks when bent. Steel can be flexed and bent quite a bit without breaking and it takes a lot of force to do so. Reinforce concrete with steel and you get something very hard to puncture and is able to support a lot of weight. Plus I think it might be cheaper but I don't know about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, steel become fairly malleable under high heat and intense stress, causing it to warp, bend, and tear (giving the appearance of melting). </p>
<p>The new WTC was designed as a monument, but also to hopefully withstand an attack like the one that brought down the Twin Towers. If a plane were to hit the new WTC, then there is less chance of collapse. </p>
<p>Edit: I put One WTC, I meant New WTC, One WTC was the building that collapsed and no one knew why. </p></div>		</li>
