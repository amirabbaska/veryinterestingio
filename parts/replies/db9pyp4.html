			<div class="markdown"><p>The Journal of Neuroscience is not exactly a medical journal, but I think the duties would be very similar. I work with the senior editorial board to identify the most effective reviewing editors, I develop and set policy for review and publication of articles in the journal, I oversee investigations of allegations of ethical problems, I work with the professional staff to make the review process as quick and seamless as possible, I monitor the general publishing space to see if there are things we could be doing better and I chase after late reviewers on a VERY regular basis.</p></div>		</li>
