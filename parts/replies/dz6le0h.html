			<div class="markdown"><p>Simply put, hair follicles respond to testosterone (or some related hormone) and body hair particularly respond by growing thicker and longer.</p>
<p>Hair follicles on the top of your head respond... the other way. They become &quot;saturated&quot; and enter this sort of &quot;baby&quot; stage and never grow past it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its DHT, Dihydrotestosterone. IIRC, men who suffer from a Male pattern baldness have hair not immune to DHT. Typically the hair on the sides is immune or resistant to it, while the hair on top isn't.</p>
<p>The top front area of my hair is 100% not immune. I held on as long as possible, but the area right behind the front of my hairline must be allergic to DHT. Ended up shaving it all off last week. Never turning back.</p>
<p>I believe Rogaine is a DHT blocker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of our differential hair length is simply a product of evolution. Our distant cousins the chimps have medium-length hair all over their bodies, and none on their faces. We have short hair on our bodies, long hair on our heads, and men have long hair on their faces.</p>
<p>Our even-more-distant cousins horses have long hair in a single line down their neck, and very long hair on their butts, and short everywhere else.</p>
<p>So hair-length in general is clearly very changeable over the generations, as it can get both longer and shorter in very localized places over millions of years.</p>
<p>As for <strong>why</strong> we have long head-hair, we don't really know. <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/13572" target="_blank">Here are some possible answers</a>. It could simply be sexual-selection, or it could have to do with blocking sunlight or regulating body temperature.</p></div>		</li>
