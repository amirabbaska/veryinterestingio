			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the hydraulophone, another example I can think of would be cell phone calling. Say you had a plan that charged you more the further out of the country you were. So they might charge you $1/minute if you were 1 mile out, $2/minute 2 miles out, $75/minute 75 miles out, etc. Then you would use absement to find out the cost of a phone call. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Self-driving devices might track it with regards to the desired route to detect tendencies to drift away. Say, if a ship is driving on auto-pilot and there's constant wind from the left, then it'll slowly drift off-course to the left. While actual position tracking might not spot that very quickly, absement grows fast for small errors that persist, so the boardcomputer can detect it and steer a bit to the right.</p></div>		</li>
