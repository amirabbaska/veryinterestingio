			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no test that says &quot;You have ALS.&quot; When it comes to degenerative nerve diseases, neurologists will look at <em>patterns.</em></p>
<p>Does it affect nerves or muscles? Does it affect upper motor neurons, lower motor neurons or both? Is it <em>demyelinating</em> or <em>denervating?</em>  Is it motor, sensory, autonomic, motor and autonomic, motor and sensory, etc. There is much more to this.</p>
<p>What we call &quot;ALS&quot; is a specific pattern of findings. This includes clinical findings (patterns of weakness, atrophy and derangement of reflexes), results of nerve conduction studies and electromyography, etc. On autopsy you would also expect to find specific patterns of damage to specific tracts of the nervous system.</p>
<p>We're not sure what causes &quot;ALS&quot; but here's a quote I stole from Medscape:</p>
<p>&quot;ALS should not be considered a single disease entity but rather a clinical diagnosis for different pathophysiologic cascades which share the common consequence of causing preferential progressive loss of motor neurons...&quot;</p>
<p>The way ALS presents, progresses and responds to various treatment is quite different than, say how Spinal Muscle Atrophy or Chronic Idiopathic Demyelinating Polyneuropathy or Multiple Sclerosis does. It's useful for physicians and scientists (and insurance companies, but mostly the former) to have this sort of classification scheme. </p>
<p>The fact is, we don't know what causes ALS and in fact it's likely there are multiple causes which may present as &quot;ALS&quot; which may explain <em>some</em> of the heterogeneity in patients with the diagnosis. It's certainly possible that in the future we may identify ALS type 1 (caused by X) and ALS type 2 (caused by Z)...etc. For now they are all lumped together because we don't know any better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hawking would claim it, because that's what the doctors said. He's not an MD. He's a theoretical physicist, basically. He doesn't know what's going on with his body anymore than his doctors and WebMD say. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that he's misdiagnosed it's just ALS is more heterogeneous than most people perceive it as and has multiple possible genetic/environmental causes with some being &quot;worse&quot; than others. ALS is just a description of a certain characteristic pattern of motor neuronal death. It's not always the exact same molecular pathway, or someone could have a protective factor the ameliorates a certain portion of the underlying molecular cause, etc. </p>
<p>ALS is complicated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He's not one of a kind. 10% of ALS patients are &quot;long term non-progressors&quot; and will live 10+ years past their diagnosis. You are correct it's typical that within 2-4 years from diagnosis most people will perish from the disease, so it is impressive but certainly not one of a kind. </p></div>		</li>
