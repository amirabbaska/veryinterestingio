			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just add that you can see the connection between a delta function and a Gaussian from a definition of the delta function. Put simply you can define a delta function as an infinitely sharp Gaussian ( mathematically delta (x) = lim x -&gt; inf of sqrt (a/pi)<em>e^(-a</em>x*x) iirc ).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be lim σ → 0 of (a/sqrt(2πσ^(2))) e^(-x^2 /(2σ^2 &#41;)</p>
<p>- but kinda. Note that this limit either does not converge or converges to a function with integral zero (using pointwise convergence on functions into the extended real numbers)[0]. But it can be used with a bit of syntactical abuse by having a usage of a delta function mean you replace it with the gaussian distribution and then take the limit of the whole expression, but with the caveat that you actually have a limit which may or may not exist.</p>
<p>[0]: Integration is generally not a continuous operation on functions under pointwise convergence, this is also the reason for <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/DiagonalParadox.html" target="_blank">the diagonal paradox</a> and <a href="https://qntm.org/files/trollpi/piequals4.png" target="_blank">variants thereof</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i have got hyperacusis(hyper sensitivity to sound) and only to speaker sound like music watching movies etc.. and i can tolerate white noise, pink noise and brown noise with headphones and without headphones and i don't have much knowledge about these white,pink and brown noises. so my question is is there any way by which i can change the sounds coming out of my laptop to the frequency of white noise etc if you don't have any knowledge about it can you please guide me or refer someone else that will be thankful and excuse my English it's a little bit weak.   </p></div>		</li>
