			<div class="markdown"><p>But don't these experiments assume that the entire body is equally exposed? In this scenario, only one end of the digestive tract is being exposed, which would create a huge pressure difference between our vacuum-exposed butt and our presumably pressurized helmet. I suppose you could also install a device that would seal off your mouth and nose, but wouldn't there still be some pressure left in the digestive tract? Would it blow out the--</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specifically exposing your intestinal track to such a change in pressure (especially with a large amount of gas within it) will do the same thing that taking a fountain pen on an airplane would: the rapidly lowering pressure would expand the gas incredibly quickly, possibly rupturing a portion of your colon if there were enough of it, otherwise it would simply bloat the inside of your digestive track causing massive amounts of flatulence and excretion. </p></div>		</li>
