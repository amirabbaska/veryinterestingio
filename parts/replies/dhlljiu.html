			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they could. There's nothing to stop nuclear fusion from going beyond stable elements. But because of the rapid decay of super heavy elements they can't accumulate to a detectable amount. So we can never really confirm them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't neutron stars and black holes like nucleus level of dense? What prevents a neutron star from being defined as a single atom of element 10^10^10^10 ?</p>
<p>EDIT: From wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A neutron star has some of the properties of an atomic nucleus, including density (within an order of magnitude) and being composed of nucleons. In popular scientific writing, neutron stars are therefore sometimes described as giant nuclei. However, in other respects, neutron stars and atomic nuclei are quite different. In particular, a nucleus is held together by the strong interaction, whereas a neutron star is held together by gravity, and thus the density and structure of neutron stars can be more variable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On further reflection, I feel like Element X has X protons, and neutron stars, in order to be so dense, are basically (but not provably?) all neutrons. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Well yes and no.</p>
<p>There's lots of limitations on what stars can and can't be like.  They can't have too much of elements iron or above, or else they collapse into a black hole.</p>
<p>Then there's limitations of the s-process itself. You can only really get up to about Bi-210, which then beta-decays to Po-210, which then alpha-decays to 206Pb (which then captures up to Bi-210).</p>
<p>Even in the offchance that Po-210 captures before decaying, Po-211 has a much much shorter half-life, as do elements beyond that.</p>
<p>To really create elements beyond Bi-210, you need the r-process (i.e. supernovae).</p>
<p>I don't want to speak too much without doing the exact math, but just using my intuition as a nuclear physicist, I'd say there's likely 0 atoms of much anything beyond plutonium in any given star.</p>
<p>So to really get those huge elements like uranium and above, you really need a supernova, and those only happen every so often for a given star/galaxy.</p>
<p>Even if they were produced in a supernova, they'd decay so fast that you wouldn't be able to detect them later.</p>
<p>However, they almost certainly <em>did</em> exist at some point in time in the history of the universe in supernovae.  Just that was for a very very brief time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With the fast decay rate, I wonder if there are telescopes standing by to capture light from a supernova and if they would be advanced enough to capture and sort through unknown spectral lines from these elements. Cool to think about. Maybe there would be some surprises.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The replies you get is missing an important part. Most of the natural production of heavy elements (heavier than nickel) is a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-process" target="_blank">r-process</a> in supernovae and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-process" target="_blank">s-process</a> in stars. Both of these rely on neutron capture to make the elements heavier and subsequent beta decays to increase the atomic number. However, neutron capture only works up to fermium (atomic number 100). After that,out have to directly fuse nuclei, and since appropriate nuclei are much less abundant than neutron in both stars and supernovae, anything above fermium is going to be really, really rare. It probably has happened, since the universe is a big place that have existed for a long time, but no anywhere near where we can detect it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm just guessing here from what I learnt in my first year of my degree but I'd guess that one of the forces that interact with the atom, such as the one holding the protons and neutrons together (strong nuclear force) isn't able to keep the atom stable, and there's - I think I'm right in saying this - no way that it can suddenly 'start being stable' again. </p>
<p>Also I think I'm right in saying that generally as elements get heavier, their half lives get shorter and as such as we go into the real heavy elements, such as 119 and 120, the half life is incredibly small and so the atom decays in a tiny amount of time.j</p>
<p>Like I say this is completely based on stuff I covered years ago, but it's my guess that we will not reach a new stable element. Someone will hopefully come along and explain it better/more factually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, there is a theory called &quot;The Island of Stability&quot; that is currently the holy grail of a lot of atomic physicists. Basically proponents of the theory say that there is theoretical evidence for a stable super-heavy element given the right amount of neutrons and protons. So it's not been ruled an impossibility quite yet I would say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they were stable enough to last more than a fraction of a second, we'd most likely have already detected them in some form either on Earth or in the Sun's spectra. Or we'd be seeing them occasionally turn up in nuclear experiments.</p>
<p>At this point, if there were any stable super-heavies, we should have seen some kind of evidence in the last several decades we've been looking, unless there's some kind of limit where entirely new physics takes over (or at least makes the super-heavies appear extremely different to what we'd expect).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if the half life was a year, how would we detect something like that? Even if there was a sizable amount to start in the sun when it formed, the concentration would have halved billions of times. Hell, the half life could be a thousand years and the concentration could have halved millions of times since it can't be replaced by the fusion going on in the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first part of your statement is not correct. The elements being stable beyond some seconds does not make them detectable on the earth or in the sun's spectra. Furthermore, I do not think we can determine with proper accuracy which elements were created by the supernova that made all our elements beyond iron.
It is true however, that stable elements would probably have turned up in nuclear explosions or heavy ion experiments. But you gotta believe!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is something similar called &quot;magic numbers&quot;. If the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is divisible by these numbers the atom is more stable. But as a general trend, atoms with higher mass tend to be less stable. It is suggested that maybe fore some very heavy elements there is an &quot;island of stability&quot; but we have no evidence for that yet. All of the heaviest elements we made are extremely unstable.</p></div>		</li>
