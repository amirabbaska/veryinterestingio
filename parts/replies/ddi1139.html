<p>The phrase “The customer is always right” was originally coined in 1909 by Harry Gordon Selfridge, the founder of Selfridge's department store in London, and is typically used by businesses to convince customers that they will get good service at this company and convince employees to give customers good service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Selfridge also &quot;promoted the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apple worked/works because Steve Jobs had such a strong design sensibility and personality to create products that engendered trust among buyers that the company knows what it's doing. I don't think any company without a tyrant can create the same coherence -- companies want to be all things to all people at the expense of their souls in many cases -- so my guess is that Apple will evolve to something more driven by what the customer says she/he wants and complexity will eventually reign.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the case of Apple, sell the customer what they really want, not what they say they want. </p>
<p>An NPR interview talked about customer surveys and how they can be misleading. The example they had was surveys about coffee. Customers said they liked dark, rich, bold, flavorful coffee but the sales showed that they really liked weak light coffee instead. They had other similar examples like with pasta sauce. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me tell you why &quot;Sell me this...&quot; is still a good practice when training or hiring.</p>
<p>This is an exercise to see how skilled someone is at selling. We're not looking at the item, we're looking at techniques. The truth is, it doesn't matter what you're asked to sell. I can hand you garbage and tell you to sell it to me. I'm checking your creativity as well (this part depends on the manager).</p>
<p>The only real way to sell is by what is known as &quot;Solutions Based Selling&quot;. Understand that customers buy to solve a need. If they're hungry, they buy food. If they're bored, they buy video games. Etc. Etc. </p>
<p>A salesman is the one who presents the solutions for the customer. In order to do that they need to know what the heck your problem is. So they need to ask questions and gather information. Certain situations don't allow for an interrogation, so we build rapport. Through building rapport, the salesman is using their listening skills and building a customer profile in their head. After 10min of what may seem to be a casual conversation, I may know where you work, how long you've been there, how many kids you have, what hobbies they do, where you grew up, etc. </p>
<p>Now that I'm armed with this information, I know a little about you and we can figure out what solutions I have for you. I tie them in with their life.</p>
<p>These are the techniques a manager is looking for when they ask you to &quot;sell me this pen&quot;. If the person starts telling me that it writes in blue, can fit in my pocket, etc. etc. They don't know how this solves whatever problem I have that makes me need that pen. This is a shitty salesman. If they talk to me and find out that I meet customers at their house to sign documents or whatever, then they can legitimately tell me that I'll be in a situation where the client doesn't have a working pen in their junk drawer and I should buy a whole package of these things.</p>
<p>Sometimes I give them some random crap to see how they work with what I've given them. I've had some interesting made up inventions that I bought from this exercise. Understanding the true nature of it and using it properly will help customers and help the company. </p>
<p>TL:DR Sell me this pen is about technique and not the product. Ask questions first, present the pen as a solution to what you found out. Customers buy based on why!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All about qualification of the sale. If you cannot produce a strong needs analysis you will dive into &quot;telling&quot; mode, talking much more than the client. Successfully practicing active listening will produce far better results. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I fully agree but I feel this is lost by the people who are asking this question often.  Part of that is because for solution based sales, it really begins to fall apart when both parties are aware that there is only one product to be sold such is the case with this pen.  That makes it very obvious to the customer in this situation that the questions aren't real questions and the answers don't really matter because all lines on the flowchart point back to the pen.  </p>
<p>The typical salesman Tactics really annoy me.  Things like always asking question that lead to choosing a product and never giving an out.  They don't show you a leather chair and ask if you like leather because the customer can say no to that, they ask if you like leather or fabric.  Now the customer is put in an awkward situation where it seems rude to not answer the innocent enough question, but answering that question it taken as a commitment that they want to be pushed further into a sale when they might genuinely be just browsing around.  </p>
<p>I understand why it is such a good method for making sales, but it makes me lose any interest in working with that person when their tactics are too pushy and visible.  Even when I bought a houseful of furniture 2 years ago, and had every intention of spending thousands that day, I couldn't stand this type of sales strategy and simply refused to talk to sales people who kept this up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in sales and have for a while at a few different companies and I've never seen that. Chatting with my bosses the subject has come up a few times, and the consensus is that when you're selling at a high level being able to bullshit about some random piece of crap isn't nearly as important as being able to establish a relationship with the client. A hundred thousand dollar sale doesn't usually happen in one day, you need to make the client enjoy the conversation in some capacity or another. More importantly, I don't know anything about that pen, I just saw it
If you want to deal with professionals in a field you need to know the product and come off as informed</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;This pen, what does it do? It puts ink on paper. That's it. Who cares about the pen? It's the ideas that flow from the pen that are important. Ideas you can hold in your hand, ideas printed on parchment led to the birth of the nation. Does anybody care about the quill? No, but people line up to see the piece of paper 200 hundred years later. The paper, the physical crucible of the idea, that's what's important. The pen? Keep the stupid pen. If you want to make an impact, it's the paper that matters.&quot;</p>
