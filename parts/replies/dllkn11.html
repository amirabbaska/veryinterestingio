			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who knows a fair amount about Lie algebras and a little about QFT: It's a good enough thing to call them, because you want three vectors summing to zero, and that corresponds to additive mixing of light. It's not supposed to be deeper than that, and it's probably easier to call them red, green, and blue instead of (1,0), (-1/2, sqrt{3}/2) and (-1/2, -sqrt{3}/2).</p>
<p>Both red*antired and red*antired + blue*antiblue + green*antigreen should be valid mesons, i.e. elements of the tensor product V tensor V^* (where V is the standard/quark representation and V^* its dual.) I think what's going on here is that one of those Vs is, say, a top quark, and the other is a bottom, and so it's important to symmetrize things that way. But that could be totally wrong and I'd appreciate a correction.</p>
<p>Counting the numbers of particles is weird because they all have no color, so the diagrams you're drawing look like weight diagrams of an SU(2) representation. But actually they're keeping track of which types of quark each tensor factor is. Is that your issue? Because it is annoying, but I could be misunderstanding something.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty confused by your post. Part of it is probably a lack of mathematical maturity/kowledge on my part, but I think your physics is off too. It seems you're confusing the flavour indices (and their approximate SU(2) or SU(3) chiral symmetry) with the SU(3) gauge indices. I'm going to flesh out how I interpret the colors assigned in the Wikipedia article I linked above.</p>
<p>So to simplify, let's just talk about SU(3) gauge theory coupled to a single quark in the fundamental representation. Gluons must be in the adjoint as usual. Let's first ignore all kinematic considerations, including confinement, and consider what possible irreducible representations a given composite state must have under the SU(3) charge.</p>
<p>A quark-antiquark composite:</p>
<p>[; 3 \otimes \bar{3} = 1 \oplus 8 ;]</p>
<p>A quark-quark composite:</p>
<p>[; 3 \otimes 3 = \bar{3} \oplus 6 ;]</p>
<p>A three-quark bound state:</p>
<p>[; 3 \otimes 3 \otimes 3 = 1 \oplus 8 \oplus 8 \oplus 10 ;]</p>
<p>A two-gluon bound state:</p>
<p>[; 8 \otimes 8 = 1 \oplus 8 \oplus 8 \oplus 10 \oplus 10 \oplus 27 ;]</p>
<p>So this is how you count &quot;how many&quot; of each particle there is. Even with just one quark, it has 3 indices for the SU(3) gauge, so there are three quarks, a red, a green, and a blue (to simply give names to the three indices; call the indices of the dual vectors anticolors). With this labelling of indices, I can reconstruct the colors given to the gluons in the Wikipedia article I linked above (the eight gluons are given by the eight Gell-Mann matrices, with the 3 rows/columns corresponding to the three colors/anticolors).</p>
<p>Now let's add in confinement, which tells you that only the singlet representation is in the spectrum. It tells you that, for example, that 8 of the 9 mesons cannot appear, and one can. If you keep track of the labelling of the indices, then what I wrote down in my first post is the singlet. Also, this leads me to disagree with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both red<em>antired and red</em>antired + blue<em>antiblue + green</em>antigreen should be valid mesons, i.e. elements of the tensor product V tensor V*</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because the element red*antired has a piece which mixes with the adjoint representation (it is not irreducible by itself). Note that the &quot;color&quot; language becomes very confusing because &quot;white&quot; refers to a particular representation, while the other three colors label SU(3) vector indices.</p>
<p>So perhaps that clarifies where I'm coming from. I think you're approaching this in a very different way though. For example, how do you represent baryons as three vectors summing to zero? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, yeah, I see what you're saying.  You're correct, red*antired is not a meson, because it's not invariant under the adjoint action (even though it lives in the zero weight space, that just tells you that's it's invariant under the diagonal matrices.) More generally nothing with less than three colors will be invariant.</p>
<p>My confusion about &quot;white&quot; describing both a representation and vector indices is related to the fact that the trivial representation (all SU(3) matrices act by zero) and the trivial weight space (elements for which all diagonal matrices act by zero) are different,  and only the former gives bound states.</p>
<p>You're also right that the colors don't tell you how to figure out the multiplicities; you need to do either linear algebra or draw some picture with lattices to do that. Although I don't think that is really a knock on calling them colors.</p>
<p>The thing about &quot;summing to zero&quot; I was referring to is that the natural spanning set for the (dual space to the) diagonal matrices of su(3) are the coordinate functionals on the diagonal entries. Since the matrices are traceless you get three vectors L_1, L_2, L_3 with L_1 + L_2 + L_3 = 0.</p>
<p>The reason we (or I/mathematicians) care about these is that the general way to understand Lie algebra (hence group) representations is to pick a maximal abelian subalgebra <strong>h</strong>, in this case the diagonal matrices. Its action on a given representation will be diagonalizable, and we can classify vectors by their <strong>h</strong>-eigenvalues, by which I mean elements \lambda of the dual space of <strong>h</strong>. These are called <em>weights</em>, and for a vector v of weight \lambda we have Hv = \lambda(H) v for all H in <strong>h</strong>. For su(3) <strong>h</strong> is two-dimensional and spanned by the L_i, and I believe the colors are just (poetic) names for them.</p>
<p>The baryons aren't three vectors summing to zero, and neither are the quarks, actually, The <em>colors</em> are those vectors, and they can be used to describe the action of the gauge group. It even makes sense that force carriers/gluons live in the adjoint representation, since that's the one that shifts between different weights, i.e. colors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose that the warning is not to think that you know more about it than you do! If you feel like your understanding is poor regardless, maybe it doesn't matter or even helps out. But I got to a very advanced knowledge of physics before I understood where it goes wrong, so I thought it was worth contributing to the thread for anyone else at that level.</p></div>		</li>
