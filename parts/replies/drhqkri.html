			<div class="markdown"><p>Bipolar 1. The most common trigger for me to go manic is a lack of sleep. I have bronchitis right now and didn't sleep last night, and I am definitely a bit elevated.</p>
<p>For depression, being off of work seems to do it. I'm a teacher, and I don't necessarily need to teach summer school, but I find it helps keep me more even.</p>
<p>Edit: 2 to 1. Didn't even know my own diagnosis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find lack of sleep makes me manic as well, and too much sleep caused by not having work or being depressed makes the depression ten times worse. It’s really important for me to keep a schedule to stay level. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the mania that keeps me from sleeping.  I do not have a terribly technical answer for the OP.  Triggers are different for everyone, I do not believe mine are unusual: Change, stress, death, love, spring.  The mania is a loss of grounding.  Staying solid on those things I know I need to do to sustain myself are an antidote.  Hygiene and working, paying the bills, all help to keep the ship steady.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Echoing this.  I can stay off medication as long as I can keep myself living a simple, healthy routine.   Too many vices or pushing the limits, boom I'm headed towards an unbalanced phase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the info! Do you mind if I ask another question?
Do you ever find a pattern in certain environments that cause you to &quot;trigger&quot; a less desired state? Certain lighting conditions, certain rooms in your house, a particular kind of noise?
Living with my own mental illness, often I find myself having to assess and reassess every day to help build strategies to keep control over how my brain chemicals are going to react. It's exhausting for me, I'm sure for you, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not OP,  but I can’t listen to music that’s too catchy or I won’t be able to ever get it out of my head, almost obsessively. I can’t sleep. Mania is preferred for me, but it’s because I’m depression heavy. But it still sucks to be in mania for too long where it starts for really effect me negatively.
Definitely low lighting is depressing for me and colored lights are more soothing for some reason. I can live on low sleep while manic and while I’m depressed I sleep upwards of 18 hours in a day.
Anxiety can be really exhausting because it makes me avoid a lot of things that really shouldn’t be all too difficult. Especially cleaning, dishes, and even self care. </p></div>		</li>
