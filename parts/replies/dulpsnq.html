			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got a follow up question. Beryllium has the lowest density of any structural metal. I know that it's sometimes used for x-ray tubes and other such equipment. How transparent to Beta electrons is Be by comparison? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the thickness of the material and the energy of the beta particles, but beryllium will generally be a less robust shield against primary beta particles than aluminum (although aluminum will likely produce more secondary x-rays, again because of its higher Z).</p>
<p>To figure out what materials would be appropriate for shielding in a particular situation, you would just do energy loss calculations using a computer program like SRIM. In some cases, it may not matter whether you use beryllium or aluminum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why shielding thickness is often considered in terms of density * thickness (g/cm^2), or areal density. In other words, a shielding material isn’t just about the required depth to stop a beta particle but it’s density as well. For example 10 g/cm^2 of beryllium and 10 g/cm^2 of aluminum have the same amount of mass, but the beryllium shield (since it is much less dense) will be much thicker. This must be taken into account when trying to design shielding materials on spacecraft, because ideally you’d want a lightweight but extremely effective shield without needing an extremely thick slab.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Beta decay Q-values tend to be on the order of 1 MeV, and the emitted beta particle can have any kinetic energy from 0 up to the Q-value</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the case of a beta particle with energy &lt; Q value, where does the rest of the energy go? Other particles, or transferred to momentum in the original nucleus? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if this is pedantic, but if that's the case then how can a beta particle ever equal the Q value? Wouldn't it always be substantially less due to the neutrino generation? Or is the neutrino energy just that small?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to be sure, since its been a while since I've been in chemistry, but you listed its energy values in MeV rather than meV, that seemed off to me, or is it really a 100 million times more energy than I thought?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't a typo: nuclear reactions occur at MeV scales, completely dwarfing chemical reactions at meV scales; it is a <em>lot</em> of energy. </p>
<p>This is why nuclear radiation is dangerous: the energy needed to knock electrons off molecules is tiny compared to the amount of energy these particles have.</p></div>		</li>
