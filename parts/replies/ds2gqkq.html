Does not work so well with plastic pipe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting, hadn't heard of that (not saying it isn't true, just that it's a new concept to me). I wonder how that works with the duty cycle of the welding machine especially putting out a few hundred amps as they have a limit to how long they can draw a certain amount of current before a cooling off period is required. This is <em>normally</em> calculated scaled on a 10 minute time period. Although I'm not real well informed on the big expensive welders. I don't have a functional MIG at the moment, I use my Miller TIG/SMAW briefcase welder the most anyway which has a max output of 160A at 240V, duty cycle of 20% meaning I can weld for 2min with 8min cooling period. I don't think I've ever reached the maximum.  </p>
<p>Perhaps in the scenario you describe the duty cycle isn't an issue since an electrical arc isn't actually being drawn. Also being cold enough to freeze underground pipes the ambient temperature may be enough to keep the machine cool for a longer period of time. Not sure on that, never used a welder for anything except welding!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>High end machines can be continuous duty (if designed as such), and duty cycle depends on amperage setting- you might be able to use it continuously at half power, and only 50% at full power. Just depends on your machine.</p>
<p>Vaguely related anecdote: I have a cheap 50/70A AC stick welder (120v) that I got for about $100. Duty cycle was like 10% at 70A, and 20% at 50A IIRC. Was really inconvenient because it would overheat every couple rods, so I cut a hole in the side and added a fan from an old microwave and have only overheated it once since. Even then, it was cooled off and ready to go in about 5 mins instead of the 15+ it used to take. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn’t matter if an arc is created or not. The completion of the circuit still means that 160A is flowing.  The arc doesn’t have anything to do with the heat of the coils themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And in some more extreme locations with permafrost the water is run as a continuous recirculation. So the pipeline is a “spoke and wheel” approach, instead of a “tree and branch”. The main pipeline is a loop, continuously circulating back to the reservoirs to make sure it is always moving and doesn’t freeze. Also pipes can be insulated to keep them warmer. </p>
