			<div class="markdown"><p>DMSO disposed into sewers can also cause odor problems in municipal effluents: waste water bacteria transform DMSO under hypoxic (anoxic) conditions into dimethyl sulfide (DMS) that has a strong disagreeable odor, similar to rotten cabbage.</p>
<p>From the Wikipedia article. Do you have a waste water bacteria problem? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup this is true, a certain company I may or may not have worked at accidentally let some into the sewers and once it hit the waste disposal plant, the bacteria caused an odor to emminate from the plant into the surrounding city for a few weeks or a month (iirc). Now they have signs <em>everywhere</em> in the labs warning not to let any DMSO or DMS into the sewers under any conditions. It wasn't intentional in the first place, but I understand them not wanting it to ever happen again. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Hypoxic is low oxygen, anoxic is no oxygen. </p></div>		</li>
