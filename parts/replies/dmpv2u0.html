But... but... doesn't integrating y=kx^2 dx gives you k/3x^3 = 1/3xy, leaving the other 2/3xy above it?
Or, if you want to cheat by using this fact, you would have better learn your integration properly?</p></div>		</li>

the area is always 2/3s the area of the rectangle that can encompass the shaded region. Essentially, you would get the answer without using integrals which defeat the purpose of learning it in highschool.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The issue is going to space the safest way possible for the least amount of $</p>
<p>The issue we have today is another type of issue because we no longer relying on mechanical system and prefers digital system. We introduce a new type of bug. </p>

<p>I have worked on Sil-4 level testing and I have seen bugs that could have resulted in catastrophic incidents.  The more code you write the more bugs you create. The old motto. Fix one create two is true.  </p>
<p>Now you can migrate a lot of the sw issues by planning ahead and doing correct risk assessments.  But we must remember it's &quot;rocket science&quot;. Have respect for its complexity.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>hence all that training on docking space craft. today computers do it automatically and better.</p>
<p>also note how all the crazy stuff about landing the stage 1 booster by space X is all trying to make flying into space VERY cheap. The problem is and has always been cost. The cost to build and inspect the capsules, boosters, etc.</p></div>		</li>
