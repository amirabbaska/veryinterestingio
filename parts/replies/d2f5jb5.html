<p>SSD with something like 100GB capacity are almost always actually 128GB units - this is due to over provisioning, which sacrifices storage space in favor of durability and performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we go, this is what I was looking for. I've actually been in the market for an SSD and was a little confused by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=samsung+evo&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enUS590US590&amp;hl=en-US&amp;biw=320&amp;bih=492&amp;prmd=sniv&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6kOL1rKfMAhWisYMKHZyxAGAQ_AUIBCgA" target="_blank">the Samsung EVO line's</a> capacities. I'm assuming the same thing is going on here? Either some level of redundancy or performance boosts? </p>
<p>Is knowingly selling memory with damaged sectors a thing? like with processors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, also, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_binning" target="_blank">binning</a>, if you're interested.</p>
<p>Many slower processors are exactly the same as their faster versions, but didn't come out quite as well. Dual-cores are often just quad-cores with two bad cores. And integrated circuits actually look more like a bowl of porridge than orderly rows of circuitry under a microscope ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk about the binning process for memory, but I doubt anyone intends faulty memory to hit the market. I suspect there is a yield test threshold for each individual chip ie &quot;how fast can this chip go before errors occur? OK, build drives from similarly rated modules.&quot;</p>
<p>It's also important to note that memory is organized in a way that lets it communicate almost directly with other memory and microprocessors. The technology makes use of (and requires) this uniform structure. One bad set of addresses would require an overhaul of how the data is handled to avoid losing it, and/or a lobotomy of large parts of the drive, neither of which is easy or worthwhile.</p>
<p>There are many reasons for over provisioning, but mainly it's to give your drive the room it needs to organize your files efficiently. One example is for large file operations: they will obviously go faster if spread evenly across every lane that can deliver data. During a write, if data is &quot;in the way,&quot; your drive should probably move it. Limited space might require a large number of poorly distributed reads and writes to &quot;shuffle&quot; this data out of the way. Both doing and not doing this result in decreased performance and drive life, all for want of space.</p>
