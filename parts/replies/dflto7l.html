			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean they had documented trade relations and eventually went to war with each other, so I think that qualifies as contact. The Vikings eventually left citing the reason as the hostile native population. Abandoning all settlement and farms they'd built. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand, but the scale was sooooo much smaller, and so much more isolated. Maybe they <em>did</em> kill off a tribe, but would we know? Maybe the natives turned hostile because they started to get sick, and thought the newcomers had brought a curse, or something else. Either way, it's the difference between extensive contact with people going back-and-forth between a homeland and new world, and a relatively isolated group of traders and homesteaders. </p>
<p>Again, the Europeans also came in <em>much</em> greater numbers, on larger ships, with livestock. They didn't just carry diseases on them, they brought animal and insect vectors too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible too that the Vikings <em>did</em> have an impact on native populations, but there isn't written record of what went on. Not likely anything that would collapse empires, but I wonder if there was any fall off of empire building following the Viking excursions? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They didn't really get sick, but some sources say the vikings brought domesticated animals with them and sold/traded the milk. The natives didn't have that in the New World and their bodies couldn't handle it. They got diarrhea or something and thus thought the vikings were trying to poison them. They attacked the vikings and the vikings fled back to Greenland.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The vikings who found North America came from Greenland, and probably in small numbers seeking better land. The only evidence I've seen is that they inhabited the island of Newfoundland. This would explain why there were no profound disease outbreaks as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I read, this is largely a myth. Their hair was likely black, but changed color during decomposition due to certain climate and soil conditions. Skeptoid did an episode on this actually.</p>
<p>Also, the area that these people lived was out in the American Southwest and they had apparently lived in that area for thousands of years, so most likely they weren't Vikings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup, just googled, trapped 'em in a cave, ordered them to come out, they refused, so the paiutes piled brush in the mouth of the cave and set it alight, asphyxiating or burning to death all inside</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tribes probably weren't that transient.  The Vikings didn't come with the intention of exploring and building infrastructure and all that.  If a tribe in newfoundland died from a disease, it probably wouldn't have spread across the continent because the people only moves as far as they were willing to walk or paddle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that it was likely the other way around and that the vikings abandoned because they were terrified of the Beothuk, who were hostile.  the Beothuk would later be hunted to extermination by settlers in Newfoundland. </p></div>		</li>

<p>it's also possible they were terrifying enough that the natives stayed the hell away.</p>

<p>nope, in fact it's the opposite. Vikings did have some peaceful dealings with them but the natives which they called Skr√¶ling would fight back when when the vikings attempted to raid them and cause enough damage to drive them off, even launch attacks against the vikings settlements themselves that the viking gave up on trying to settle Vineland( north America) since they themselves would be under constant attack. It was written about in the Greenland Saga. </p></div>		</li>
