<blockquote>
<p>Imagine a man wants to build a hill on a flat piece of land. The hill will represent the Universe. To make this hill, he digs a hole in the ground and uses that soil to build his hill. But, of course, he’s not just making a hill. He’s also making a hole – in effect, a negative version of the hill. That stuff that was in the hole has now become the hill. So it all perfectly balances out.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you're mocking religion, but how does this theory differ from saying, &quot;God did it&quot;?</p>
<p>This theory speculates that there <strong>must</strong> be negative energy to cancel out all the positive energy without a shred of evidence or observation to support its existence. Just saying it must exist in order to make my other theories work is not enough. </p>
<p>You can use &quot;God&quot; or &quot;negative energy&quot; to fill in the blank in the following sentence, &quot;There must be _____ to explain how something came about from nothing.&quot; Yet one is heralded as scientific and the other is disregarded as bullshit and inventing a God to explain the unexplained. And I'm not making the argument for God, just applying the same criticism to Creationism to this Zero-Energy theory brought up by OP.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it is literally the definition of the Jewish concept of God, also exactly why they are so hardcore about monotheism and not attributing <em>anything whatsoever</em> to God, doing otherwise is seen as heresy as one cannot know whatever it was that caused the universe (and the corresponding anti-universe). The Christians morphed it into something more human (and thus Roman) and added some parts to it (Jesus and the spirit) and made him mortal and thus gave him a place/time/entity. It is with this view that most fedoraness is born, but it is a limited view of what non-christian cultures try to denote by the idea of God.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>-1 represents the opposite of mass, and if it isn't mass, then we won't be able to see it, hell, us 3 dimensional beings won't even be able to detect it with our gravity lasers and whatnot. This -1 most likely exists on a dimension we can't even perceive, but it is still part of the universe. As for what started it all, I like to think a multidimensional puppy sneezed while it was sleeping and woke itself up, and along with it, a new universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, in a simplified manner. When it is usually discussed, it is about matter and antimatter that are subatomic particles that are made up of opposite charges (Not totally correct but is ELI5). </p>
<p>They release energy because they are also made up of even smaller particles that have opposite charges. When the antimatter and matter come together some of these even smaller particles cancel out. But these particles are what held the matter and antimatter together so there is a release of energy as particles go flying about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there are complications to this simple model because careful measurements of this &quot;1&quot; and &quot;-1&quot; that they're not exactly 1, but more like </p>
<p>0 = x + (-x)</p>
<p>and |x/(-x)| ~ 1.002</p>
<p>so its really weird</p>
<p>We assume antimatter and matter are mirror images, and every force in the universe agrees they are mirror images, except the weak force.</p>
<p>The amazing part is nobody has the last word on this yet, anyone of us could be the one to solve this mystery, science continues to provoke us to doubt our most basic assumptions even in the 21th ce</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not so sure if this is how we measure it, and this maybe more ELI13 than ELI5.</p>
<p>There are fundamental symmetries in particle physics. There is &quot;P&quot;, parity, which is almost literally like looking reality in a mirror. If an object is falling downwards and you &quot;apply P&quot; on it, you'll see it moving upwards. Then there is &quot;C&quot;, charge conjugation : if you take an electron with a negative charge and you apply C on it, you'll get an electron with a positive charge.</p>
<p>What we noticed is that if you take any particle and you apply both C and P at the same time on it (&quot;CP&quot;), we get the corresponding anti-matter particle. So, take a real object, apply CP on it and get another real object : CP is a natural symmetry. And it is actually the symmetry existing between matter and anti-matter.</p>
<p>If this was the end of the story, we'll get the ratio between matter and anti-matter to be 1.0000 because they are perfectly symmetric. But as we made some particle physics collider experiments (<a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/comics/20141125.png" target="_blank">smbc comic</a> ), we noticed that CP is actually not a perfect symmetry. And that 'deviation from symmetry' is roughly the 1.002 mentioned above.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken, the CP symmetry being broken is a part of the answer. Since CP is broken, matter and antimatter are not perfectly mirror images, you can make the difference between the two.</p></div>		</li>
