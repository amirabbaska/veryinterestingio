			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, that's ok.</p>
<p>I mean, if one somehow jumped out of our Universe and entered one where 4D space was &quot;normal&quot; our ape brains wouldn't be able to process it either.</p>
<p>Also, you'd probably be dead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd likely die of plenty of things before mental shock from not understanding your surroundings. Perhaps there's no air, perhaps time doesn't pass the same as here in ours, and you instantly age till death, there's loads of things that <em>could</em> get you beforehand sadly. </p>
<p>This is why I advocate to switching to lizard brains.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, when you get into higher dimensions, things can get pretty weird.</p>
<p>But there is nothing particularly special about a Tesseract among 4D shapes, other than the fact it is &quot;regular&quot;. All angles and lengths are the same, just like on a square or a cube.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, lines are 1 dimensional. You can connect 4 lines at 90 degree angles and make a 2 dimensional square. You can then take 6, 2 dimensional squares, assemble them with 90 degree angles, and get a 3 dimensional cube... so what if we put 8? cubes together at 90 degree angles and create a 4th dimensional object?</p>
<p>Triangles work well too. You fold a line 3 times, you get a triangle. You fold a triangle 3 times you get a tetrahedron/pyramid. So what if you could fold that 3 times?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get what's called a 4-simplex, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex</a>. Can generalise this (and hypercubes, and anything really) to however many dimensions you like. Part of my PhD deals with studying mathematical properties of such objects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought only points were 1-dimensional (and essentially only existed as thought experiments).</p>
<p>You drag that point to anywhere besides its original address, you get a line, and that was 2-dimensional? You can drag that line along the same plane, and it's still a 2-dimensional square/rectangle/plane, until you break the plane and it becomes 3-dimensional cube/other shape? It's been a few years since I've taken geometry...</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you found yourself inside a Tesseract, you could travel outside of your home plane and into another by using shortcuts between the coordinates, allowing two disparate locations to appear, to you, to be right next to each other.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, if we consider normal space to be three dimensional, moving between Realms would be moving in fourth dimension.</p>
