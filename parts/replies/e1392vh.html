			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read many sources that say hand sanitizer really isn't a great defense against stomach viruses (due to the way the stomach viruses are built), and hand washing is the preferred hand hygiene when it comes to the norovirus. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21411187" target="_blank">Here's one study</a>. Perhaps the information has changed since this study was published. I still wash my hands any time I'm coming home from being out in public, and I've taught my kids to do the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, hand sanitizers kill good bacterias as well. </p>
<p>Scrubbing with soap and water, and then drying off hands with paper is the most effective way.</p></div>		</li>
