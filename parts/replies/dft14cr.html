			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, some orca pods feed nearly entirely on seals, and are masters at washing them off icebergs, lying in wait in shallow inlets to the ocean to grab seal pups etc.</p>
<p>Orcas are ruthlessly efficient killing machine, much like humans. Do you think farm dogs wonder about why we don't kill and eat them, when they can witness us killing all the other animals?</p></div>		</li>

<p>We're in the same social order but not the same species. Dogs get that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well that was an unnerving explanation.  They just haven't discovered the deliciousness of human flesh yet.  One curious Orca is all that stands between us and the death of humanity.  All hail our Orca overlords!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read in other questions regarding &quot;why don't -animal- eat us&quot; or &quot;what would happen if -animal- ate us&quot; that since we don't fit their usual diet, they'd probably spit us out. I suspect food has less to do with pleasure, as we enjoy it, and more to do with survival. If something tastes different than usual, it may be &quot;poison&quot; and not worth the risk.</p></div>		</li>
