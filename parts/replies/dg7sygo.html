			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the reason gravitons are so infrequently talked about because we haven't got to the energies of GUT yet let alone a theory of everything which is expected to happen at around 10^19 GeV? At 10^19 GeV would we expect to see gravitons?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's partly because the energies are so high, as you say, which makes it hard to look for the effects. Gravity is generally a bit of a pain to consider as a quantum theory though as well... At least as we understand it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you expect to 'see' gravitons at any scale, because otherwise Newton would've never gotten bonked on the head by that apple. However, at those high energy scales we expect to see traces of higher-order interactions between gravity and the other fundamental fields of nature, i.e. we can no longer say 'this electron interacts with that graviton and we can neglect the rest of the fields. More correctly said, our current models predict that at those kind of energy scales the interaction between gravitons and other fields becomes infinite. The fact that we don't live in a black hole means those predictions are false but we don't know how or why they're false and we would very much like to find out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, but I guess my question is what defines those energy scales? As far as we know there's no particle with a mass-energy on the GUT scale or Planck scale, right? Is it simply saying, if you have two particles colliding in a system with 10^16 GeV this is what we expect/hope to see?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the GUT scale there is an energy scale (10^15GeV without supersymmetry, 10^16GeV with it) at which we expect (maybe) to see the three standard model forces united into one interaction. We also expect to see new bosons if this happens, which DO have masses related to the GUT scale. These are the X&amp;Y bosons for SU(5) GUTs</p></div>		</li>
