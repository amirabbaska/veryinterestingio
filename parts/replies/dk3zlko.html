			<div class="markdown"><p>I choose based on drink price and dollar food menu.  Usually get a McDonald's medium drink and a double hamburger no cheese.  That's my budget, and sticking to my budget is important.  I feel like $1.00 is a reasonable price for a medium drink.  Funny thing is, they always tell me I can get a larger one for the same price, and I always decline because the large ones don't fit in my drink holder.  </p></div>		</li>
