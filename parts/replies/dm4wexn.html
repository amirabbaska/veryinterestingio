<p>Smile at a baby, and the baby will almost definitely smile back.</p>

<p>I work pediatric front desk. I see roughly 250 kids of varying ages throughout a typical day. I'm also a 36 year old man with a beard and I have zero shame in making goofy faces or talking in singsongy babyvoice to babies. The best time is that sweet zone between 2-9 months where you get a truly genuine reaction because they haven't assimilated social cues on how to act yet. They go with their gut. I've roughly estimated that about 40% will just stare at me. about 5% will either start to cry or make the cryface babies do so well. I'll get  about 25% to smile at me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My 9 month old is <em>in love</em> with terrifying men with beards. The bigger, older, beardier or scarier, the more she will smile, laugh, and beg for them to pick her up. It is so much fun to watch scary &quot;tough guys&quot; melt while my baby flashes her huge smile and throws her arms up for snuggles and hugs. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, my husband is a very clean cut military guy that always looks happy and friendly. It's not a familiarity thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I generally hate kids. Once the stop walking like a t-rex and stop saying &quot;I wan to go sit daaaaoooowwwwwnn&quot; I stop caring about kids. but I lose my mind over babies. I have the best job. I can goo-goo with babies and ignore all the other ones and no one cares. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One of my earliest memories was before I could walk, I was sitting across from my bearded uncle.  I looked at him in fear because something evil was consuming his face.</p>
<p>Eventually Mum handed me to him to hold, cried for my life hahaha</p>
<p>This has no long lasting effect later in life, I love a bearded guy :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why my mother gets jealous of me, she put on a big smile or make a funny face to try to get a baby to smile at her but usually gets the results you've listed
And then the same baby will look at me, just standing there and usually not paying attention, and break into a big grin. Instant jealousy</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You must have a friendly face!  My sister is the same.  She's not even really a kid person (although she loves <em>my</em> kid, and spoils him rotten), but random babies always want her attention.  She's got big wide set blue eyes and I think that's what does it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on (2) here, a toddler wants to see what you will do with the object.  Maybe you tell a story with it.  Maybe it is a pencil and you draw something with it.  Boom, now they learned that a pencil can draw things.  Toddlers honestly don't know much.  They substantially rely on bigger kids and adults for ideas, how to play, what to do next, and directions like eat/sleep.  Plus of course they want to constantly maintain a relationship with that adult, to stay alive and be loved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is number 2 why I give people dumb things?</p>
<p>I like to grab random objects and hand them to people.   Even if it's in their own home.   (Salt shakers, newspapers, anything that is of no use to them).   </p>
<p>I also like to raise my eyebrows while I hand them the objects, like I expect a thank you or reward.    Then when they do, I point out how useful I am.   I mean, after all, what would they do if I wasn't there to hand them their own salt shaker?</p></div>		</li>
