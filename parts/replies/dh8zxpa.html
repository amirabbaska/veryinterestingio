			<div class="markdown"><p>glad to see an actual mechanism explained rather than other explanations essentially saying &quot;well, plants know which way is up because their cells can tell which way is up.&quot;  :P</p>
<p>I took a plant developmental biology course three years ago and we were also taught that the settling of amyloplasts in one general direction indicates the direction of gravity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as long as there is selection pressure and heritability, yeah.  given enough time, random mutations and variation come us with quite a lot of novel mechanisms.</p>
<p>nature's equivalent of &quot;it's not a bug, it's a feature&quot; right? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>from my perspective, &quot;which way is up&quot; is another way of saying &quot;which way is opposite to gravity.&quot;  So, saying that plants know which way is opposite to gravity because they know which direction gravity acts is a much less satisfying answer than outlining the tools a plant cell uses to measure gravity and the hormone response that then controls growth.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've learned phototropism and geotropism which I've read elsewhere in this thread. </p>
<p>I googled it and found &quot;taxis&quot; mostly in discussion of insects or other animals, and tropism mostly in discussion of plants, though the terms mean the same thing they seem to be different in different focus areas. :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What happens to seeds that germinate in zero-g?</p>
<p>I found this question very interesting so allow me to summarize what I read:</p>
<p>In 1880, Charles Darwin showed that gravity plays an important role in the root growth strategy as plants that grow on a slanted surface have roots that <em>skew</em> towards the direction of gravity. In addition to that, Darwin suggested that plants use roots as <em>sensitive fingertips</em> in order to explain the growth around obstacles.</p>
<p>In 2010, by planting Arabidopsis thaliana (a model plant for research) seeds in a nutrient gel and sending it to ISS, it was shown that even without gravity, the roots <em>skew</em> away from light. Hence, light is a second important cue for root growth. But what is even more interesting is that not any light will do! You need a gradient in the intensity of light to break the symmetry needed to determine the growth direction. Think of it being placed in a uniformly illuminated room and getting confused about where the light is coming from.</p>
<p>Humans and animals which are mobile adjust their external environment to suit their life, but plants can only adjust internally as a reaction to their environment. Which is what makes plants sensitive reporters of environmental change. For example, a recent study has shown that the full-blossom date for Kyoto’s cherry trees can predict March temperatures to within 0.1°C. So interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Thanks for that answer, it's really interesting! I thought of reading full articles, do you have the cherry trees and the 2010 Arabidopsis thaliana sources?
Thanks!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2012/121207-plants-grow-space-station-science/" target="_blank">this</a> article, apparently the phototaxis effect takes over, and the root grows the opposite direction of the light source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My high school science teacher did research on something similar in college (I forget if it was for his thesis or just a research position).  He was trying to find out if seeds could germinate with no magnetic field....because apparently that plays a hand in the processes.  In the end the answer was yes lol.  </p>
<p>This was building off the idea of germination in 0 gravity (which had already been proven could happen), and wanted to see if the seeds could germinate away from earths magnetic field.</p>
<p>Sorry I don't have any more info on it.</p></div>		</li>
