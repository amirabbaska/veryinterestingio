			<div class="markdown"><p>Not superior in all ways. Compressive strength of concrete now is extremely high. Also it cures much faster. Roman concrete had longer cure times which are not practical in the modern context.</p>
<p>Roman concrete (and engineering) was and still is amazing, but it is an apples and oranges comparison. Today, concrete is formulated to very specific needs based on many different criteria: ultimate strength; cure time; resistance to certain environmental conditions, flow rate. There is no one size fits all recipe. What is a great mix in one building may not be in it's neighbor, or in another country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point, in fact the Romans discovered the use of pozzolans completely by accident and it essentially adds more impurities to the mortar (alluminates and silicates) which increases the belite and ailite quantity therefore strengthening the lime to similar properties to that of a very early Portman cement. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the flip side of that is that the romans had to design around the weak tensile strength of concrete, and that modern day reinforced concrete construction is enabled by the use of rebar. </p>
<p>Rebar can and does fail, but concrete design without the use of rebar would be much more costly/massive/dangerous/etc. </p></div>		</li>
