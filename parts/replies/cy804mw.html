			<div class="markdown"><p>Really interesting, thanks.</p>
<p>The main problem with unions as I see it is, as technological process accelerates, there's more and more resistance to change. Unions protect workers' jobs, so when some new approach or tech comes along that eliminates jobs, unions naturally fight it.</p>
<p>So you get absolutely idiotic situations where the gas-pumpers union or whatever get their cronies to outlaw people pumping their own gas (NJ, OR). And claiming it's a safety issue, despite technology having eliminated the hazards and difficulties many decades ago, and literally the rest of the country (and world?) having no problem pumping their own gas. </p>
<p>Or you get the largest and busiest port in California protecting its union members' jobs by having them record every shipping container BY HAND in LOGBOOKS...because adopting a computer system would eliminate many jobs (I believe they finally computerized about 10 years ago).</p>
<p>Government unions (police, teachers, etc.) are great examples of how unions protect incompetence, corruption, and inefficiency at the expense of citizens footing the bill.</p>
<p>Corporate/management control and abuse are real and unions certainly help combat that, but unions create their own set of problems.</p></div>		</li>

<p>um, do you think these people are unionized or something? they're not. </p>
<p>i invite you to peruse /r/Portland and find threads detailing the whole &quot;can't pump your own gas&quot; thing. In lieu of that, though, I'll break it down for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>The law is, as you identify, a holdover from the days when pump technology sucked and car uptake was low, so it made sense to have trained people dispensing explosive chemicals. </li>
<li>Laws typically need inertia to change, and depending on the legislative climate, there's typically no inertia to change something like this, why?</li>
<li>Shockingly, a lot of drivers like not having to get out of their car to pump gas (I am not one of them and i fucking hate the law) so they still support it</li>
<li>It is, at this point, a jobs program for people who have literally nothing else. This isn't a union thing, but rather there is resonance with people (correctly or incorrectly) that you'd be killing a lot of jobs for something they don't really want (to pump their gas)</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost component is imperceptible to voters who would be the ones looking for a repeal - if one jockey can service 40 cars in an hour, and pump 400 gallons in that hour, his employment cost is something like 3 cents a gallon ($9.25/400, rounded up for added employer costs). This would be $18 a year in extra cost for a driver driving 12k miles at 20MPG. People don't give a shit about $18 a year. If they did, gas station prices would be very uniform. </p>
<p>Notably absent in any conversation I've ever read, is the notion that these are plum, unionized jobs that are being protected by corrupt legislators in the pockets of &quot;Big Union&quot;. Because they're not. They're shitty, minimum wage jobs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just Google London Underground Drivers, in the uk you get union leaders in other industries who will spit the name of Bob Crow</p>
<p>because theirs no direct entry I can't get a reliable source I'm happy to give as how there pay compares for age and qualification but there not 17 year old gas pumpers on minimum wage and more then a few people in England &amp; Wales will tell you that they are &quot;plum, unionized jobs&quot; that have no cause to strike as often as they do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gas pumpers union is the worst.  Story time: </p>
<p>I remember pulling into a filling station once upon a time; though I'll admit I cannot remember if it was NJ or OR.<br />
I'll preface the rest of the story by saying I am from a state that allows concealed carry and allows its citizens to pump their own gas. As a business owner, I travel a lot and this incident occurred early on in my travels.    </p>
<p>So I get out of my Ford Super Duty F-350 XL and step up to the pump.  Just as I was about to grab the nozzle, a young man briskly comes at me yelling &quot;What the hell do you think your doing?&quot;  Of course I was a taken aback by his approach and tone.  My reflexes forced my right hand to take grip of the concealed Glock pistol on my hip and underneath my jacket.  Know the Glock pistol remained holstered during this entire interaction.  </p>
<p>So the conversation goes something like this as best as I can remember:  </p>
<p>I'm Getting some gas, what's the problem?<br />
The problem is you are not allowed to operate a gas pump here.<br />
Huh?<br />
This is a gas pumpers union state and only union members can pump gas.<br />
Huh?  </p>
<p>At this point, I still don't really know the intentions of this kid. Is this a robbery? Is he a junkie? However, I did vaguely remember hearing a rumor back home of so called gas pumper unions in other states. So now my thoughts are either gas pumpers unions really exist or this kid wants to pump my gas with the expectation of a tip?  </p>
<p>No matter, I tell him sure go ahead and pump the gas as I make my way around to the tailgate of the Ford 350 for some protection. Hand still on holstered Glock pistol.  </p>
<p>Now here is where a worrisome situation turns into a bizarre one. This kid puts on safety googles and chemical resistant gloves. Next he places the pump nozzle into my Ford 350 and throws a hand into the air. WTF? He's just standing there and hasn't turned the pump on. A few moments later, and I shit you not, Santa Clause's twin appears at the front of the 350. Only he is in ratty bid overalls and devoid upper front teeth.  </p>
<p>&quot;On Cameron&quot; he bellowed with a twinkle in his eye...  </p>
<p>Actually I made that quote up, but damn if it wouldn't have worked. You'd just have to see how much this guy looked like a beat down twin of the real Santa Clause.  </p>
<p>So gas station &quot;Santa&quot; tells my little pump jockey to proceed with the pumping and he does. Meanwhile I'm standing there looking around and notice two other pump jockeys each with gloved hands in the air and apparently waiting on our &quot;Santa&quot; to come supervise.  </p>
<p>Now finally my Ford 350 is filled and I'm ready to roll. Santa moves on to the other waiting pumps...  </p>
<p>I approach my pump jockey to pay and guess what? He cannot handle cash. He tells me I can pay with credit at the pump (fuck that, I will never put a credit card in a gas station card reader) or pay cash inside.  </p>
<p>Well, off I go to pay cash. Now I don't know for sure if there is a cashiers union, but I can tell you that the cashier had a supervisor standing behind her.  </p>
<p>So to recap, the gas pumpers union forced gas pumpers to wear googles and gloves to pump gas and the pumping could only be done while observed by a union supervisor. And the union forbid the gas pumpers from handling cash, therefore forcing customers to go to the stores cashier to pay for cash transactions.  </p>
<p>tl;dr I made this up. There is no gas pumpers union. The other stories of four union people being required to plug in a lamp are as fake this story.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, the above may be true, but if the consensus is that Unions are bad because they are corrupt, inefficient, and don't encourage individual achievement, then that is the reason why they are considered taboo in America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question is, why don't people like unions?  You're saying some purely theoretical, academic-like description of why <em>other</em> people must not like unions is more informative than a whole page full of people describing their own personal experiences with unions and why they actually don't like them?</p>
<p>EDIT: I should also have said there are some really great personal experiences on why people <em>do</em> like unions too, which makes me even less impressed with the top comment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're overselling how much Americans &quot;hate&quot; unions. <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/12751/labor-unions.aspx" target="_blank">Gallup</a>'s trends show Americans are still mostly in favor of unions (popularity actually grew from 55% in '79 to 66% at its peak in 1999), with popularity remaining fairly constant in the late '70s until the mid 2000s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two kinds of people in any economy: the people who make their money by working (wages, sales) and the people who make their money by owning things (landlords, shareholders, lenders). The latter group has always hated unions. Always. They divert profits and rents to workers, and that's somehow bad. But since owners are outnumbered by workers, that has never been enough to make unions and worker protection laws unpopular -- they needed something to blame the unions for. And, fairly or not (I say unfairly), the 1970s gave it to them: stagflation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your narrative is also misleading - You're implying all workers want unions. Simply put, not all workers want to be in unions. In fact, this concept is why Right-to-Work laws have some popularity - Right-to-Work doesn't prohibit unionization; Right-to-Work gives a non-union option. <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/12/right-to-work-laws-myth-vs-fact#_ftn1" target="_blank">Heritage Foundation</a> actually has a good database of information regarding the relationship between Right-to-Work States and Unions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Without right-to-work laws, unions negotiate contracts that force workers to pay dues or get fired. Right-to-work laws protect workers’ freedom. The National Labor Relations Act also protects the right of workers in right-to-work states to unionize. Unions currently represent 4.4 million workers in 24 right-to-work states, including highly unionized Nevada, Iowa, and Michigan.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Recent Gallup polling finds Americans support right-to-work laws by a 71 percent to 22 percent margin—better than 3 to 1. Independents support right-to-work laws 77 percent to 17 percent, Republicans support them 74 percent to 18 percent, and Democrats support them 65 percent to 30 percent.&quot; ~ Heritage Foundation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short? Americans generally don't mind unions. Americans just dislike being <em>forced</em> into the unions.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Simple resolution here: don't work for a union shop. If you don't like unionization, and don't believe it will benefit you, why the fuck would anyone take a job with a shop where everyone else is unionized and working together for their common interests? Why would they assume they're not going to be looked down upon because they're reaping the benefits of everyone else's time, effort, and money... but aren't contributing shit to that?</p>
<p>No one is forced into working for a union. If your co-workers unionize, you're free to find a new job if you don't like unionization. If you apply for a job and find it's a union shop, you're free to work elsewhere.</p></div>		</li>
