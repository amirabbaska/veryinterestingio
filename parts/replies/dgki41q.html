<p>That is a big list of antonyms that sound the same which is the best i can find with a quick google search. There was a great dinosaur comics about it that was hilarious, but i can't find it now. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're actually called contronyms. Some more examples:</p>
<p>Bolt - You can bolt something down, which means to stop from moving, or you can bolt away, which means move very fast.</p>
<p>Fast - You can hold fast, which means to not move, or you can go fast, which means to move quickly.</p>
<p>Sanction - You can sanction something which means to approve of it, or you can sanction something which means you don't allow it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite is raise (lift up) and raze (tear down). </p>
<p>Edit: spelled differently, so maybe not exactly a contronym? But I was thinking more along the lines of sounding alike, not solely spelled alike.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This actually makes sense, because all these meanings are related to dust. English is really good at making verbs from nouns (without even altering them!), and this is where the ambiguity comes from: it's useful to have a verb both about creating dust and removing it, but they end up being the same word, because the word is unaltered in any case.</p></div>		</li>
