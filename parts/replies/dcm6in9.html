			<div class="markdown"><p>The Lifetime movie bit is the best. My Dad, a Vietnam vet, loves watching that crap because he loves happy endings. I often sit there and watch them. They look like they're filmed in 2 days. They're such shit. I can understand walking by and automatically be on the set of a bad film. It's fun watching ones where they have to go into the public. You can see people in the background seemingly confused and looking at the camera.</p></div>		</li>
