			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting. That non-optical neurological light processing sounds a lot like how human cultures describe the 3rd eye. Light sensing is also common among more primitive eukaryotes</p>
<p>Edit: quick update, it's the pineal gland that is speculated to be an atrophied photoprocessor, which in some animals is connected to a light sensing organ known as a parietal eye. This is what op refers to in ducks but more common in frogs and that ilk. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The circadian rhythm is driven by the brain</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was meant to say that it's a built in function of the brain, that even if we lived in an environment completely separate from the sun (e.g. underground) we would still adopt approx 24 hrs as a day. Living things have been on earth long enough that the earth's rotation time is hardwired into us. Blind people may be able to have their sleep/wake cycle start or stop independent of the time the sun is up but presumably it's somewhat set by surrounding activity (like, when they're a kid their family sets their time). But humans will always have a natural internal day of about 24 hours.</p>
<p>Now, if you have people or other animals in an environment with only artificial light and you would speed up the &quot;lights on/lights off&quot; cycle to 22 hrs or slow it down to 26 hours then we would pretty easily adjust to that. If you tried to do 15 hours or 30 hours, that might be too much to adjust and we wouldn't be able to adopt that length of a &quot;day&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Was going to mention this. The circadian rhythm is honed by light stimulus, but in the absence of that stimulus it can drift. There are 2 separate parts of the brain that process vision, only one of them actually joins the stream of consciousness. The other is for subconscious processing like knowing time and position. In rare cases of vision loss where this second processing center continues to receive information, a blind person can still understand their environment by sight, despite not being capable of seeing it.</p></div>		</li>
