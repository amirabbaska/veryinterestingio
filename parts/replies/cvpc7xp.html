<p>I guess it's no coincidence that the best thermal conductor (diamond) also has one of the highest speeds of sound 12000 m/s
edit: 12,000 m/s not 1200 for diamond.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, my education is useful!  </p>
<p>Molecular motion in solids, which you can think of as heat, is necessarily wave-like in nature.  One molecule moving exerts forces on the ones around or bonded to it, which in turn exerts forces on the ones it is bonded to, and so on, creating waves.  Heat in a dense solid (in insulators at least) is a whole bunch of different mechanical waves on top of each other.  Heat can't move faster than the top speed of a mechanical wave in the medium which is the speed of sound in that medium (at least in insulators; conduction band electrons change the game a bit).</p>
<p>And you are definitely right about diamond's high thermal conductivity and speed of sound not being a coincidence.  Phononic thermal conductivity (thermal conduction through mechanical waves) is directly proportional to the speed of sound of the material.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I just realized, is this why fourier series/transform is important to heat dissipation in solids?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you help me understand why an ocean wave travels much slower than the speed of sound in water?</p>
<p>Edit: Is it because the restoring force is buoyancy in one case, but pressure in the other case? Different forces resulting in different wave equations, therefore different values for c?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, the speed of sound is DEFINED as the speed at which low-energy waves propagate through a solid, which is equivalent to the actual speed of waves travelling through an analogous perfectly elastic medium. In principle there could be (and are) other channels of motion, but at the energy scale OP is talking about, the elasticity theory should be good enough.</p>
<p>The kinetic speed of heat isn't relevant here because this is a solid, so it has some crystalline structure. As such, there aren't any atoms flying around at the speed associated with the temperature of the material; that only works for ideal gases. Basically all of the heat energy is stored in vibrational degrees of freedom and almost none in the free movement of atoms.</p>
<p>There is a difference in the speed of sound for transverse vs. longitudinal waves. For the purposes of this question only the faster of the 2 matters. From elasticity theory you can derive that one is always faster than the other, but I can't remember which right now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the pole would simply break. But assuming an unbreakable pole etc, the pole would compress in the length and expand to the sides. How much it would compress and expand is impossible to say as this scenario is already defying the laws of physics, but it's certain that the length can never compress into nothing, the shortest possible length would be one layer of atoms.</p>
<p>For a more elastic object at a lower speed it'll look like <a href="https://youtu.be/aMqM13EUSKw9" target="_blank">this</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The compression of the object also changes it's density (for that portion of the object that has been compressed). So over one second, you'd be creating a shockwave that continually builds up at some point directly in front of you (but a nonzero distance away, since if you are moving at the speed of sound in the uncompressed material, the compressed material that you are in contact with will have a speed of sound greater than what you are travelling at).</p>
<p>Assuming a piece of metal that can be infinitely compressed (without pancaking, we're in spherical cow territory here) and will rebound to it's initial shape, It would appear to you that the pole is getting shorter up until the end of the 6100 meters, as the point of the shockwave passes the end of the pole, it will appear to expand again to it's original length.</p>
