			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Wound care experts currently recommend normal saline or other purpose-made, gentle solutions for open wounds. Antiseptics damage cells and should be saved for intact skin (e.g., pre-op skin preparation or prior to starting an IV).  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Albeit, this was almost ten years ago, so perhaps things have changed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, a couple of points:  adding iodine doesn't sterilize water, it does sanitize it enough to make it safe to drink. I'm sorry if that comes across as pedantic, but there is a big difference between irrigating a wound with sterile water vs potable water found in the wild. Iodine-treated wild water could still have plenty of viable spores of Clostridium in it , as an unfortunate example, which could lead to infections of a very serious nature.</p>
<p>Secondly, irrigating a wound is only necessary for debridement, I don't think current first aid recommends irrigation if there isn't gross debris included in the wound. Happy to be corrected on that, but that's my recollection.    </p>
<p>I guess if you find yourself with an open wound with chunks of debris in it, washing it out with iodine-treated water is the better course but I'd sure try to boil it if I could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting.  So iodine doesn't kill all the bugs it just kills enough that your body can take care of the rest?  Could you just put more iodine tablets in it (probably not great to drink but kills all the bugs?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would venture to say that water you find out in nature isn't &quot;clean&quot; so you should probably use an antiseptic in that case.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been using silver solution when I get a cut or something. I've found that it heals quicker and in far fewer cases it gets infected than if I just used a triple antibiotic or something along those lines. </p>
<p>People have told me silver solution is only for burns. Who is right and who is wrong? </p></div>		</li>
