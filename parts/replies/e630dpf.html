			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing that I'm not sure anybody has mentioned: for the item prizes, often times the contestants don't even end up taking the prize because they don't want to pay taxes on it. It isn't worth it to take the $100,000 RV, and pay $30,000 on taxes on it, if you aren't the type of guy that goes camping. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more difficult than you think. For example, often times you have to get to the warehouse / factory to pick it up, it isn't delivered to you. In order to sell it, it has to be registered in your name, which means you have to shell out ~30% of the list price before you even get plates for it. (And how many people have $30K+ lying around?) Then you have to drive the damn thing, which you actually need a special license for. And even after that, RVs are notorious for having terrible resale value.</p></div>		</li>
