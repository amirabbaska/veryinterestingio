			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting. I always assumed the opposite, since Verizon owns a Tier-2 network and T-Mobile is Tier-3. Strange how Verizon is slower then. I though I would pay more for Verizon to get the fastest speed possible, but looking at all the speedtests on YouTube, it looks like you're right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Verizon and T-mobile are actually both Tier-1 networks.</p>
<p>Tier-2 networks get some of their access from the Tier-1s, but do have some towers of their own. Tier-3s have no towers of their own and get all their access from Tier-1/2.</p>
<p>Tier-1 is the big 4, Verizon/T-mobile/Sprint/AT&amp;T. Tier-2 is regionals for the most part and Tier-3 is everyone else - lots of the prepaids fall into this category, although also includes companies like ting.</p>
<p>I think part of Verizon's problem (as i perceive it) is that they've been at the top for so long that there's less of a push to get things upgraded - other than in areas with the highest numbers of subscribers. T-mobile is still &quot;the new guy&quot; in a lot of minds and has to put in more effort to garner attention/customers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>T-mobile has great pricing and customer service, but zero coverage at my house (same with sprint) so they are a no go. I had major customer service issues with AT&amp;T back when they were Cellular One so I won't go back there. That pretty much leaves verizon. Honestly, I don't usually have any issues with them for speed (4G usually gets me between 10 and 20 mbps which is faster and more consistent than my home internet). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are confusing Tier 3 with MVNO's.  </p>
<p>Tier 3 are local carriers, like Bluegrass Cellular and East Kentucky network.  There are not many left.  But they have their own towers in their local region, but then roam elsewhere.</p>
<p>Tier 2 would be US Cellular.  Not many in this category either.</p>
<p>MVNO's would be like Project Fi and Republic wireless.  They rent out space on one or more big networks.</p>
<p>There is also a new category filled by former Tier 2s that were bought out by the big four- Cricket, MetroPCS, et cetera.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>T-mobile is either lacking coverage or bombed off of their ass in big cities.  So, it makes sense that their towers attempt to mitigate their spectrum problems using the newest technology.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, Verizon has defintelty got better coverage, but like the new Sprint commercials say, it's only like a 1% difference, the only time I didn't get signal was on my drive from Tampa to Atlanta &amp; Gatlinburg this week, and it was only in the middle of nowhere did I lose signal, whereas the phone on Verizon in our car had 2 bars.  </p>
<p>Multiple carries can use the same cell tower, it's just a matter of how much money the carrier wants to spend, Verizon has much more phone subscribers, so they can spend more to be supported on a lot of towers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 1% thing is for dropped calls within their respective coverage areas, not a comparison of coverage areas.  Verizon still has much greater coverage than Sprint.  Sprint is great for covering major corridors, but if you get out in the sticks, Verizon has a serious advantage in coverage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>but like the new Sprint commercials say...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the kicker right there.  We have both Verizon and Sprint in our household and if you notice small print the 1% refers to population and dropped calls not area of coverage.  In our state the population is 99% concentrated in dense metro areas and the remaining 1% is spread out in great expanses of land.  Sure if you're in the city, Sprint will be just very nearly good as Verizon maybe even indistinguishable, but when you venture out into outside the city limit it's not even close, not by a long shot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have the percentages wrong, and this isn't really true across all internet mediums.</p>
<p>America is big. We aren't talking Germany big. We are talking big as in almost all of Europe big. Almost an entire continent big. Most of the land isn't densely populated. A vast majority of that land is not densely populated. </p>
<p>It is extremely cost prohibitive to span fiber in such a mesh network like say South Korea in an area like america. It just doesn't work. Laying fiber is expensive. Trenching, land rental/purchase, right of ways, pole access, DSLAM like buildings. They all add up. </p></div>		</li>
