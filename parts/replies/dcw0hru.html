			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate how you highlighted the differences between subsidies and tax breaks, and it's also interesting to see the discussion on foreign tax credits in the comments here. </p>
<p>While a tax break is not technically 'income' it's functionally similar in that the company's bottom line value is higher.
So, we have taxpayers increasing the bottom lines of companies that are likely responsible for nearly doubling the atmospheric CO2 content. Of course, this is beyond the scope of my original question. </p>
<p>My original question was more of a 'black box' analysis of the system, with money being transferred between consumers, government, and petroleum industry as a whole (upstream, midstream, downstream). </p>
<p>I now see better why these cash flows can't 'cancel out,' thanks for answering!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is only a partially complete explanation.  The notion that oil companies get massive subsidies compared to other industries (particularly green energy*) is just plain incorrect.  The biggest (by an order of magnitude) tax break that oil companies get is that they don't have to pay taxes on money that they already gave to another country in taxes.  For example, if ExxonMobil drills an oil well in Kuwait and makes $1,000,000 profit from the well, the U.S. government would ordinarily tax Exxon based on the entire $1,000,000.  However, Kuwait also has tax laws.  As a result the $1,000,000 profit is taxed by Kuwait first, let's say by 20%.  So, after paying the local Kuwaiti tax, Exxon is only able to bring back $800,000 to the U.S.  The &quot;subsidy&quot; is that the U.S. only taxes the money that Exxon actually receives (the money that it can bring back into the country).  As a result, the U.S. only applies taxes to $800,000 instead of $1,000,000.  Large oil companies do billions of dollars of business overseas, so this &quot;loophole&quot; appears to be a giant subsidy to people who don't want to read tax laws.  This law applies to every U.S. company.</p>
<p>What is especially crazy about complaining about this tax break, is that oil companies are actually some of the rare major corporations that bring overseas profits back into the U.S.  Most other large corporations (e.g. Apple, Starbucks, Microsoft, GE, GM, McDonald's, Facebook) never bring foreign profits back into the U.S. and as a result pay no taxes on foreign earnings to the United States government.  </p>
<p>*The structure of U.S. subsidies to green energy companies is insane.  Basically, the more inefficient the production of energy, the more money you get for producing energy with that method.  This is why solar energy receives much larger subsidies per mW than geothermal or wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ExxonMobil is a far larger company than all of the other companies on that list with the exception of Apple (Apple is a bit bigger), and has way less overseas cash.  I'm not going to dig into the data (I doubt I could find good numbers), but at first glance it looks like XOM is repatriating more of their money than other companies.   I'm not sure if you are agreeing with my post or arguing against it, but you are sort of proving my point.  All international companies face this issue and it is not unique to oil companies.  Interestingly, the way to fix this problem would be to create a bigger tax incentive to bringing the money home to the U.S.- ie a bigger oil company &quot;subsidy&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I mentioned that, but the extra detail helps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, they get a foreign tax credit which allows them to deduct taxes paid in foreign countries from their profits that are returned to the US. The government allows that because it wants US companies to do business abroad while bringing money back into the US. Companies either wouldn't do business abroad or would keep their earnings outside of the US if they got double taxed on them. <em>It's also worth noting that this tax break is available to pretty much all US businesses, not just the petroleum industry.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do think it's good to mention that lots of other industries get subsidies as well, especially green energy.</p></div>		</li>

GE which makes wind turbines and solar panels effectively payed negative tax in some years because they have an extreme tax avoidance policy that involves never bringing back oversees income to the U.S ( <a href="http://www.taxjusticeblog.org/archive/2016/04/just_plain_wrong_ge_and_verizo.php#.WIjeUFUrJtQ" target="_blank">http://www.taxjusticeblog.org/archive/2016/04/just_plain_wrong_ge_and_verizo.php#.WIjeUFUrJtQ</a> ) .

			<div class="markdown"><p>The big one isn't their fixed assets but accelerated depreciation or depletion of exploration costs. It's expensive to dig wells and you don't always hit oil. So it gives them a way to offset the costs of the losers when trying to find winners in terms of producing wells.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, almost all of what people (in my opinion, dishonestly) call &quot;petroleum subsidies&quot; are matters of tax policy that apply to ALL industry and in fact parallel deductions available to private individuals.</p>
<p>Being able to deduct the cost of capital investments isn't a damn &quot;subsidy&quot; any more than deducting the cost of work millage is a subsidy for a salesman that drives a lot for his job.</p>
<p>About the only thing remotely questionable about the petroleum industry's tax breaks is the fact that they can deduct land depreciation on property from which they are extract the oil wealth. It is a bit odd that they get compensated for the activity that is their fundamental source of revenue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean they can depreciate the value of the land based on its reduced value due to extraction  (e.g. was worth 1M. 30% is intrinsic value. 70% is value of extractable resources. We extracted 50% of resources. Depreciation is 50% of 70%)?</p>
<p>Or do you mean they get to depreciate the improvements (wells, storage tanks, etc)?</p>
<p>If it's the first, I agree. That's kind of crazy. If the latter, that's another &quot;every business gets to do this&quot; issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I addressed those points:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of the subsidies for the fossil fuels industry in the US comes in the form of tax breaks. Some economists would be upset at using the term subsidy to mean tax break,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's also worth noting that this tax break is available to pretty much all US businesses, not just the petroleum industry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;petroleum subsidies&quot; are matters of tax policy that apply to ALL industry </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many specific tax breaks for oil companies. For example, oil companies are allowed to subtract intangible drilling costs as expenses rather than depreciate them. They also get royalty breaks for wells on federal lands and some producers get depletion allowances on oil reserves.</p>
<p>You are correct that many of the subsidies calculated in the total number that gets tossed around apply to all businesses, but not all of the subsidies do. Pretending like they all apply equally to all industries is just as bad as pretending they're all unique to oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depletion allowances on oil reserves are part of a tax law that applies to the activities of most companies.  If a company owns land, this law probably applies, especially if the activities of the company lower the value of the land that they operate on.  This is not just a subsidy to oil companies.</p>
<p>For example, If I own 100 acres of forest, the land is worth a certain amount of money, and the trees are worth a certain amount of money.  Land with trees is worth more than land without trees.  If I start a lumber company and cut down the trees to sell boards, my land is now worth less money and I can deduct the loss on value from my income.  This is actually one of the oldest tax deductions in existence and applies to almost every company that owns land.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually they can't deduct &quot;land depreciation&quot; because such a deduction doesn't exist. The basis of depreciation is to allocate the cost of an asset across its useful life. Both the US Tax Code and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles treat land as having an unlimited useful life, and thus, it cannot be depreciated. I think the term you're referring to is the &quot;oil depletion allowance&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Depletion of resources on land is something that all companies and individuals can deduct from earnings.  Look at this primer on managing a timber by Penn State.  They explicitly explain how to incorporate depletion of trees (and thus land value) due to logging in a property owner's tax documents. The argument is that because trees, oil, stone, or minerals cannot be replaced during a human's life, the depletion of these things lowers the value of the land.  I don't' remember the exact law, but it was applied to oil and gas to make things more even with other extractive industries.</p>
