			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have some 50-100 m thick sand deposits in Vancouver.</p>
<p>The Quadra Sands were (likely) deposited in the early stages of the Fraser glaciation when alpine glaciers were carving out valleys. That huge influx of sediment overwhelmed the transport capacity of streams and rivers, causing widespread deposition and channel changes that turned most of the lower mainland into a floodplain of braided rivers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I lived pretty close to the Navajo reservation, and it honestly depends. In some areas, where they would farm primarily had more silt, however only a couples miles down in &quot;Chokecherry Canyon&quot; it's 100% sand to clay, and it's pretty deep sand everywhere. To keep in mind this was in a valley area, where on top of of the mesa's/plateau's there'd be more farming areas, while down in the valley it was almost all sand. If you look at sattelite images of the 4 corners area from Shiprock NM to Aztec NM you can actually tell by the color of the sand on top. Areas where it goes from sand to clay it's a lighter more khaki color, while the darker more coyote brown would be the sand/silt/clay. It's pretty neat.</p></div>		</li>
