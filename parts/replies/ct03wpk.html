			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't we simply control where it pools? e.g. if you slaughter a chicken, you can chop of its head and hang it upside-down over a bucket. The blood pools down towards the neck and runs out of the body. Why wouldn't this same approach work with people? Slice open the neck and top of the scalp along an artery, hang over a basin, and let gravity do the rest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>because doing this leaves the heart temporarily still beating long enough to help drain the blood as well. often times it's done by slitting the neck as the means of slaughter in the first place with larger animals like pigs, because not bleeding them soon enough can ruin the meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You contaminate the blood with anything on the face/neck/skin and airborn particles.  The reason blood from others is useable in the first place is because we have sterile methods of extracting it and keeping it a closed system to prevent contamination.  I can't imagine what would happen if you got dust in your veins...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think as long as it isn't too much dust or airborne particles, it would just be phagocytosed by phagocytic cells, I mean when you get an open wound, dust gets in it, but then again, it's already started to clot, so most of the particles wouldn't travel far through your vessels... idk</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. This answer makes the most sense. Stagnant blood can't just be extracted in the same way pumped blood is. I can't imagine a truly effective method that could yield results anything close to what we can get from live donors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This might sound heartless but couldn't you just drain a corpse with some form of external suction? </p>
<p>Im sure they have equipment that mimics the effects of a live heart for things such as heart transplants, modify something like that so it collects the blood instead of cycling it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>think a butcher shop:</p>
<p>pig and cattle blood purchased for cooking isnt gonna be from the drain, there's a clean way of doing it already.</p>
<p>they hang the animal, cut a neck artery, and stick in a pump hose.</p>
<p>if they can do it, why wouldnt a hospital?</p></div>		</li>
