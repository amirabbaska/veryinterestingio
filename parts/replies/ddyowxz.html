			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my brain's storage technique is different than this.  My wife seems to store things by letters; she'll remember the letter it starts with.  I store by association, like with some sort of synonym or association.</p>
<p>As an example, if we forget Christopher Walken.  For my wife: &quot;What's his name?  Christopher W something.  Williams? Walker? Walken!&quot;  For me: &quot;What's his name?  Christopher Jogging?  Walking?  Walken!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mine is a bit different also. I seem to always remember how long the word is. Sometimes first letter also but mainly length. So for me it's Christopher hmm, it has 6 letters? Unfortunately I'm usually stuck at the amount of letters until someone helps me out. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember me and a friend, both males, trying to remember the name of a whisky we'd been recommended. He was saying it was something like Devil's Choice or Devil's Selection, and I remembered it something like Devil's Nut. </p>
<p>Between the two of us we were able to figure out the name, Devil's Cut. It was interesting to see how we both almost remembered it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always get the letter wrong though.</p>
<p>It usually goes:</p>
<p>&quot;What's her face, the chick with the gages, her name starts with a 'C'... 'Chrissy'... 'Clarissa'...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You mean Alyssa?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yup, that's the one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You said it started with 'C'&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;... No I didn't.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: I actually had somebody give me an anagram of their name and I STILL couldn't figure it out for like 5 minutes. But I can remember the names of African birds on sight, even if I'm not sure I've seen them before.</p></div>		</li>
