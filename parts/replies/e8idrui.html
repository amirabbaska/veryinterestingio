			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually yes.  Keep in mind, there are a bunch of different classes of cytokines and bunch of different function.</p>
<p>But there are therapies for certain cancers that involve using specific cytokine. They usually are used to help induce growth in blood/immune cells that were damaged following chemotherapy/radiation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Of course, in &quot;healthier&quot; people where the immune system wouldn't be compromised like cancer/hep C, you do have to worry about the cytokine storm.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>edit: by healthier, I mean like a flu vs cancer. Cancer and its therapy involves destruction of cells. Much more so than like a flu, or a cold, etc</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do. For example, Interferon (one kind of cytokine) is used to fight severe viral infections. But it’s only administered in a hospital setting, and as an injection. Even if cytokines weren’t dangerous (like the other people mentioned), you couldn’t really take them at home. They’re proteins, which means if you took them orally the pepsin in your stomach would break them down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are plenty of protein-based medications we take orally, we just have to modify the delivery system. Creon (enzymes) is encapsulated to protect against the acidic environment of the stomach, then the capsule opens in the duodenum when the pH hits 5.5 and the enzymes take effect.</p>
<p>All oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors we use in oncology are also proteins (gefitinib, erlotinib, all the -nibs). We've just found ways to circumvent stomach acid and still facilitate good bioavailability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For people wondering why a tumor-related chemical would be produced - your immune system polices your body for tumors, and TNF happened to be discovered that way. It's a more general pro-inflammation signal that can be (but isn't always) triggered by tumors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole class of TNF-inhibiting drugs used for autoimmune disease. The problem with modulating the body's own immune processes to fight cancer is that you can overdo it and cause autoimmune diseases and cancer cells that survive may be resistant to such therapies.</p>
<p>The trouble with cancer is that it evades all the normal processes to stop it. TNF doesn't do anything itself, it's just a signalling molecule that tells a cell to tell a cell to tell another cell to recruit some more cells that combine to kill a cancer cell. A lot can go wrong and get mistranslated along the way and cancer cells survive and proliferate because they junk up that process (among other highly complex reasons).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes, TNF research exists.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>thing is, cancer cells are normal cells gone insane. They keep reproducing without limitations and taking up space healthy cells would otherwise have, leading to a person's death.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>TNF is usually anti-death and pro-death for most normal cells. It prevents cells from dying through cellular mechanisms, and there are other mechanisms that allows it to lead to death of the cell. </p>
<p>Cancer cells seem to be resistant to TNFs effect of causing cell death. So there is research seeing how to make cancer cells more sensitive to TNF. and of course, TNF is just one piece of the puzzle in cancer, other things are going wrong as well that allows cancer to proliferate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TNF is very commonly researched, but it isn’t the only avenue. It’s tough to get a treatment to only affect cancer cells and not healthy cells; chemotherapy, for example, is like just blasting all the cells with a machine gun and hoping the healthy ones outlive the cancerous ones. </p>
<p>Getting a person’s immune system to work FOR them and identify cancer cells is a very promising treatment. The lab I’m in works predominantly with NK (natural killer) cell immunotherapy, but there are a lot of other types. :)</p></div>		</li>
