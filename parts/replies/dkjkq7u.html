			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if an object from space could enter the atmosphere at the correct angle and speed to skip off the ocean and still have enough momentum to exit the atmosphere (return to space). Think there's a mathematical way to prove this possible/impossible? Any size, any speed, any composition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well TIR is the case for a interface from a higher to a smaller refractive index. In the questioned case total <em>external</em> reflection has to be considered.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually it would still be TIR as it is reflecting internally within the air against the more dense water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking from air into water at an angle, the light of the sky reflects in the water and overpowers the light coming from within the water. A polarizing filter helps, as the reflected light from the sky has a certain directionality in it's vibrations, while the light from the water has not. </p>
<p>If you are in the water, things look very different. </p>
<p>It's hardly a gradual effect when looking from in the water up. Only a small circle above you is transparent, then there is a hard edge and outside of this edge, the water reflects like metal. </p>
<p>There are some rainbowy effects on the edge, which spell out that the size of the see-through circle differs per wave length. </p>
<p>If you are 2 meters deep, the see through circle is still less than a meter wide. </p></div>		</li>
