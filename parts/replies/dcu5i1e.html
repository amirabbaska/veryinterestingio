			<div class="markdown"><p>I ask because one of my theories (I'm an armchair theorist) is that Schizophrenia might be the inability to tell between dream states and reality. Vivid dreams can cause you to really believe the world you see in them until you're awake and fully conscious. </p>
<p>Because a person having symptoms of Schizophrenia believes what they see, hear, and feel, to be reality is why I thought the part of brain mostly responsible it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>are in fact cortically blind, but still claim/believe that they can see!</p>

<p>What does this mean? Does it mean that they cannot be proven to be blind or seeing? That seems like an easy thing to prove, ask them how many fingers you're holding up...sorry if this sounds ignorant </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be something like I'm holding up a bottle and asking the patient, &quot;what am I holding in my hand?&quot;, and the patient would <em>confabulate</em> something. Perhaps &quot;oh, you're holding a spoon&quot;. And maybe I'll ask &quot;what do I look like?&quot; and the patient will say something like &quot;you're a handsome young man with dark hair and a mustache&quot; when I'm actually a ugly af (haha).</p>
<p>In all seriousness, their brain doesn't &quot;know&quot; it's missing part of it's visual cortex, so it constructs visual information/experience from other cues in the environment. I would imagine the visual experience they're actually having is probably pretty lacking, but the brain is also damaged in such a way that realizing this is impossible. It is pretty similar to other forms of (anosognosia.)[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia</a>] That is, neurologically caused unawareness of deficits (the most common form is people who deny that their arm is paralyzed).</p></div>		</li>
