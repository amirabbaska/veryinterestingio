			<div class="markdown"><p>You could code a game that takes the time to do that every time you changed something applicable, but you'd made that trade-off of time versus performance again. And sometimes there are limitations in the engine, the API, and/or the operating system that don't let you do what you want.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people seem to take ELI5 way too literally. I actually really appreciated this explanation. It may not be perfect, but it allows me, an adult human - but a complete layman when it comes to programming computer games - the chance to understand without someone giving me some silly analogy about stacking crates and changing one on the top versus one on the bottom. Those analogies have their place, too, but sometimes you want a little more without also needing to be an expert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like that ELI5 often has a blend of super simple answers for the curious and simplified &quot;deep-dives&quot; for the interested reader.</p>
<p>That being said, I also laughed because I read the &quot;Mission Failed&quot; thing in the CoD announcer's voice and apparently that's all it takes these days for me. So maybe I'm not a good barometer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's pretty hard to take too literally: it means &quot;Explain in such a way that a five-year-old could understand it&quot;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this whole subreddit has misappropriated the title, which only serves to confuse people more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's good for an ELI5 post to have a top comment that is simple, and also a top comment that is in-depth. It's a popular sub and top posts are going to get a lot of attention, so it's nice to have the easy explanation, but also the detailed technical answer for those who are curious and want a deeper understanding.</p></div>		</li>
