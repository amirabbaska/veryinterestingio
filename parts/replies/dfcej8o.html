			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your great answer!</p>
<p>I'm from germany, so I don't know which school I would be in in America. I'm 14 years old.</p>
<p>I'm programming an 3D - Fusion Simulation, and it would be really weird to show clouds of probabilties :). That's why I want to show it as small balls, but I wasn't sure how I should arrange the protons and neutrons in the core.</p>
<p>So if I understood you right, they are random? Okay, thank you!</p></div>		</li>

You only need to worry about nuclear orbitals if you probe the nucleus itself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've taken some college General Chemistry courses as prereqs (nothing too advanced) and was wondering if you could provide some more info (or maybe show me where to look for information) about the proton and neutron arrangement within the nucleus? I know about quantum numbers and orbital theories but I don't remember if nuclear arrangement was taught in my course--or if it's something basic that in completely over-thinking. Thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look for the nuclear shell model in any physics text book, or use <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Nuclear/shell.html" target="_blank">this</a> as a starting point. It is more complicated, because the potential the nucleons move in is generated by the motion of all the other nucleons whereas the electrons move in a fixed potential generated primarily by the nucleus.  Think of the electron's movement as that of marbles rolling in a bowl, but the motion of a nucleon is more akin to that of a fish in a swarm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there any sort of diagram to represent how the protons and neutrons are arranged in the nucleus? Like some sort of &quot;aufbau principle&quot; equivalent for the nucleus, I mean</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shell model orbitals are shown <a href="http://www.blazelabs.com/pics/shellmodel.gif" target="_blank">here</a>. Each orbital with angular momentum J can hold (2J+1) nucleons.</p>
<p>Each nucleus has two &quot;copies&quot; of this diagram, one for the protons and one for the neutrons.</p></div>		</li>
