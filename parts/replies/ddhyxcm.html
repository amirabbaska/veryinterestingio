The old style school buses have an articulating arm that swings out to force pedestrians to walk outside of the massive blind spot directly in front of the bus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the right answer but to add on... As TeahTheSage said, the skin friction drag is a much bigger factor for such a long vehicle. In aerodynamics air is treated as a fluid and in this case the large flat face of the bus will actually creates a bubble that separates the flow from the body. An example of this is a torpedo. If a torpedo had a sharp nose all of the body would be slowed by the water. However, with a more blunt nose, it creates an air bubble of separation between the body and the water, thus reducing skin friction.</p></div>		</li>
