			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed, marketing can cause a huge impact on how people perceive a product.</p>
<p>I remember reading about some cereal that had square-shaped pieces, and the producer re-branded them as &quot;diamonds&quot; without changing anything else...sales skyrocketed. Can't remember what brand it was, though.</p>
<p>EDIT: It was Shreddies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, yes. I'll never forget the first ad I saw for &quot;chocolate&quot; diamonds. I literally said out loud to myself, &quot;But those are just flawed diamonds.&quot; My other self said out loud, &quot;Yes, but idiots don't realize that.&quot;  My third self recommended I should turn off the TV and go for a nice walk, but my fourth self recommended I turn off the TV and play some video pinball instead.  My fifth self thinks we should go seek professional help, but my sixth self has a crippling fear of professional doctors of any kind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It was basically a friendly gag as much as a shrewd marketing move. It's clear as day that Diamond Shreddies are the exact same product as Square Shreddies - that escaped nobody. The true masterstroke was the Shreddies Classic + Diamond <em>Combo Pack</em>. Which actually existed for a time. Funny stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not American,  but I was introduced to the Grey Poupon campaign at business school in my country because it was supposedly a very well-known campaign that worked in America. My textbook was American and it just assumed that I had heard of it. </p>
<p>We looked it up and we were not disappointed by the pure American-ness of the set-up. </p>
<p>Also viewing these delightfully campy commercials made me understand what the fuck Boots Riley is talking about on the intro  to The Coup 's song &quot;Fat Cats, Bigger Fish&quot; where he references this awesome piece of American Cinema. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have all their albums on vinyl. So, as you can probably imagine, business school was not for me. I actually became very critical of capitalism itself at business school. Even more than I initially was. I dropped out to play music and supported myself as a DJ. I don't like working around drunk people, but it sure beats wearing a shirt and tie and inventing new, arbitrary &quot;needs&quot; for a culture which already has plenty of everything. </p></div>		</li>
