			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually got a free TV this way. It wasnt like a brand new TV or anything but it was a big ass 57&quot; TV with some scratches on the frame and stuff. My friend got it from this place for cheap and then gave it to me because the input lag was too bad. I immediately looked in the settings and saw game mode. Turned it on and it was fine.</p>
<p>Thing only lasted like 9 months but still.</p></div>		</li>
