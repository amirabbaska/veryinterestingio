			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Approximately</em> true. If you scaled the earth down to the size of a billiard ball, it would <em>almost</em> meet manufacturing standards for a billiard ball; the oblateness and roughness are really very small, but deviations like the Himalayas and the Marianas Trench screw it up a bit.</p>
<p>OTOH, Mt. Everest, at 29,029 feet above sea level, is not the farthest point from the center: that distinction goes to Chimborazu in Ecuador at 20,564, thanks to its position near the equator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually false. Check out the latest Vsauce vid on Youtube, just came out last week and sheds light on this exact topic!! :)</p>
<p>Not intending to bust your balls or anything, but it's a genuinely interesting topic (to me, anyway) and I previously held that same belief before watching the vid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This breaks my heart, this was one of my favorite pieces of trivia.  Thanks I'll definitely watch the video but honestly no matter how great the video nothing makes up for the loss of one of my favorite fun &quot;facts&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
