<p>First, really great explanation by /u/tsuuga! You can see in <a href="http://www.bldgblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/05/HugeNest3.0.jpg" target="_blank">these castings</a> how ant nests are shaped. It's pretty impressive. Also <a href="https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/ant-colony.jpg?w=748&amp;h=555&amp;crop=1" target="_blank">this one</a> is even more elaborate. All this surface area helps absorb the rain. I'm getting a lot of questions about this, the ants are killed during the aluminum casting process. Dr. Walter Tschinkel got some flack for the amount of ants that died each time he created a cast by animal rights groups. </p>
<p>As for intelligence, ants are intelligent, though not in the way humans are or even other arthropods. Well, other than bees which are very similar to ants. It is difficult to discuss intelligence in non-human animals and compare it to how we view intelligence in ourselves and other animals. Ants also individually are not super bright, but their collective intelligence in really spectacular!</p>
<p>For instance ants are excellent navigators. They take many cues from the environment, such as the position of the sun, odors, light polarization, the direction of the wind, slope and ground texture, and they count their steps, among other great navigational cues. What they can't do though is build a world map in their heads, like we can. Instead they need to devote different parts of the brain to different navigational tasks. They never really get an entire picture, just pieces they put together as needed. This is a significant difference between how we perceive our surroundings and how they perceive theirs. It's remarkably effective though! </p>
<p>They are pretty incredible animals given how tiny their brains are. This would be another huge difference. With fewer neurons intelligence or cognitive ability will be drastically lower, but they seem to handle themselves regardless. Again mostly due to the collective intelligence of the ant colony and not the individual ant. Ants are master manipulators of their environment, they use tools (leaf cutter ants use leaves to fertilize fungi) and they even farm (aphids for nectar and fungi). That's something incredibly special! Intelligence is defined by the capability to manipulate the environment and to deal with new or trying situations (problem solving). Ants certainly do all of these things, but it is important to remember intelligence and how we measure it differs between species.</p>
<p>Scientific American has a great <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/weve-been-looking-at-ant-intelligence-the-wrong-way/" target="_blank">article</a> on ant intelligence.</p>
<p>Stanford University also has a wonderful write up on <a href="http://news.stanford.edu/pr/93/931115Arc3062.html" target="_blank">collective intelligence</a>.</p>

<p>If you're into science facts you might enjoy /r/sciencefacts which is my attempt to corral random things I remember or come across into a sub. It's sort of a TIL for science along with some science news.</p>
<p>Edit - Folks are asking about the counting. We're not sure how exactly. It's likely an internal pedometer. They are not performing complex mathematics, but they keep track of how many steps they take. There was a really interesting study where researchers shortened ants legs and also attached them to stilts. When attached to the stilts the ants overshot their nests because their stride length was longer than when they originally counted. So they take the same number of steps, but go too far! It was a really well done study.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a mining engineer it's interesting to see how some of those casts look compared to underground mines. Your first post the tunnels going downwards almost look like a corkscrew ramp, and the little pods off to the side look like huge remucks. The second picture I almost imagine as a really selective mining method. Thanks for the share!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An individual ant is very dumb. It has a fairly limited number of behaviors and responds appropriately to a fairly limited number of conditions. A <em>colony</em> of ants, however, is extremely intelligent. They are capable of solving a great number of complex problems and accomplishing a shockingly diverse array of tasks. This is due to something called the emergent property of intelligence, or just &quot;emergence&quot; more generally. The whole concept is absolutely fascinating and if you want to learn more there is a great Radiolab episode about it and a couple of really amazing books. </p></div>		</li>
