			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet.org" target="_blank">Free Basics</a> is one thing that's already in place in a lot of the world. This provides free access to a very small number of websites which include Facebook, Wikipedia, Bing, etc.</p>
<p>Let's say you're a startup and you actually have a product that is better than Facebook or Google and actually has the potential to take their customers. Can you compete with Facebook, Google, etc, who pay ISPs to let large numbers of people access your site for free? No way.</p>
<p>Let's say you're Netflix. ISPs want a slice of your revenue or they're going to cut you off from your subscribers. Do you really even have a choice? Not only that, you're directly competing against their own content networks. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_NBC_Universal_by_Comcast" target="_blank">Comcast acquired NBC Universal</a>. <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/23/verizon-closes-aol-acquisition.html" target="_blank">Verizon acquired AOL</a>. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/11/15/att-time-warner-acquisition-a-rare-deal-that-makes-economic-sense/#2bb61e325b69" target="_blank">AT&amp;T is attempting to acquire Time Warner</a>. Another major player in the space that a lot of people don't normally think of is Major League Baseball, and they provide streaming services for Disney, HBO, WWE, the NHL <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLB_Advanced_Media" target="_blank">via BAMTech</a>, and more recently <a href="http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/18292308/mlb-bamtech-streaming-platform-inks-300-million-exclusivity-deal-riot-games-league-legends" target="_blank">partnered with Riot Games</a>. If you have a subscription with one of these ISPs, you could get their vertically-integrated content without any premium, but if you want content from other websites or services like Netflix, you have to pay, either directly by paying your ISP, or indirectly by Netflix hiking prices to pay the ISP to deliver you content.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a huge part of it. Most ISPs also provide some sort of video/TV service and VoIP.  There are services available, such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, and Skype that are direct competitors to the ISP's options.  </p>
<p>The ISPs are looking for ways to make these services less appealing. If they either throttle bandwidth for these services or charge additional premiums to access them (either on your end, the content provider's end, or both), they can make their own services more appealing by comparison.  It's drastically better profits for the ISPs, and significantly worse service for the consumers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Comcast was caught throttling* netflix when netflix was in the process of deciding whether to pay or not. There are tons of news articles about it if you search comcast+netflix. Here is one:
