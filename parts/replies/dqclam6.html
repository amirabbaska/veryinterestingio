			<div class="markdown"><p>Check your math. [EDIT] had to check my own math (forgot to account for the playback speed).... See bellow
This has my revist in it. </p>
<p>Essentially the speed is between 22m/s and 10m/s</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7ficf3/what_is_the_velocity_of_the_edge_of_a_bubble_as/dqdj0so/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7ficf3/what_is_the_velocity_of_the_edge_of_a_bubble_as/dqdj0so/</a> [EDIT]</p>
<p>The bubble is aprox. 15cm diameter. That means the failure front traveled one half the circumference of the bubble to the other side.
((15cm*pi)/2)/(13s/18000) = 326.2m/s or just a hair under the speed of sound in air.... that cant be a coincidence...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it may actually just be a coincidence. Would the speed of sound in air have anything to do with it? Wouldn't it be the speed of sound in the soap? The only problem with that is, assuming the soap has a similar bulk modulus and density to water, it should theoretically be moving at closer to 1000-1500 m/s </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be the speed of sound in the medium (bubbles).</p>
<p>Sound propogates through a medium by the molecules 'bumping' into one another and transferring energy from molecule to the other. </p>
<p>So the speed of sound is really a measurement of how long it takes energy to transfer between molecules in a medium. When you think of it like this,  this would also be a limiting factor for how fast a fluid would flow within itself. This is just a top end though.</p>
<p>Now, there could be some wonky stuff that happens given the thickness of the bubble being so small... Since the bubble is so thin, it might be that the air could play a larger role in transferring energy (giving us a smaller velocity since the speed of sound is smaller in air). But because the breakage front travels along the surface, I think the description above is valid for this situation.</p>
<p>Edited for clarity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because it's a bad assumption. The bulk modulus of methanol is almost three times smaller than that of water, so I'd assume with soap the difference may be even bigger. And then there's the problem that soap on the surface of water has different characteristics than in bulk.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was expecting a similar thing myself.
However I would speculate that displacement is involved. As the bubble collapses air needs to move into a very thin wide area from a very small round area, so the bubble can only collapse into small droplets as quickly as it can displace the air to form those droplets. The fastest that pressure wave could travel would be the speed of sound in air I would imagine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't a coincidence, because this is wrong. This doesn't take the framerate of the video into consideration. This video is recorded at 18000FPS, and if you play it at 1FPS, then the 13 second of video would be equivalent of 13 frames/18000FPS of real time.</p>
<p>But the video is more likely played at 30FPS, so during that 13s there are 390 frames, not 13. So the correct anwer would be about 11m/s (assuming the FPS of the video is 30).</p>
<p>Example: You record a video at 100fps. Each second of the video consists of 100 frames. If you play it at 10fps, for one second in real time in the video you have to play it 10 seconds, as that 1s of video consists of 100 frames. If you play it at 50fps, that 10 seconds would be 10s * 50 FPS / 100 FPS = 5 seconds in real time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok so I did a revisit and a different 18,000 fps bubble video they did.</p>
<p>I got numbers more line line with your 11m/s</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvZ2Z_s4Bo" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvZ2Z_s4Bo</a></p>
<p>So I looked over another video they did at 18,000 fps and looked at the camera setup. I Pulled some dimensions from the video using a screen capture pixel distance measurements with some known datums within the view-plane in question (dimensions of the camera, tripod size, lens diameter, ect. I then reproduced the sensor and lens (60mm macro, or 100mm macro) combination in blender then placed a sphere at the calculated distance from the camera and then reproduced the framing from seen in the image. I got a bubble size of just a hair under 10cm/5cm (60mm/100mm lens). I then re-watched the video at 1/4 speed and timed it with a stop watch and got 20 seconds total time.</p>
<p>After watching the video a few times, I think it was actually encoded at 24 frames per-second, but lets do the math for multiple frame rates.</p>
<p>5 seconds of 30 FPS video captured at 18,000 FPS - 6.66x10^-4 s
5 seconds of 30 FPS video captured at 18,000 FPS - 8.33x10^-4 s</p>
<p>0.5<em>10cm</em>Pi = 15.7cm</p>
<p>my calculations on the revisit.</p>
<p>15.7cm/0.0066s = 2356.19cm/s = 23.56m/s 60mm   lens
7.86cm/0.0066s = 1191.13cm/s = 11.91m/s 100mm lens
15.7cm/0.0083s = 1884.00cm/s = 18.84m/s 60mm   lens
7.86cm/0.0066s =   947.16cm/s = 9.476m/s 100mm lens</p>
<p>I watched another video of them at 18,000 FPS firing a M4 fully automatic, so I used that as a scratch sniff test for the frame rate play back (M4 cyclic rate is 700 to a scratch over 900) took the average rate of fire and reduced it to rounds per second (not exactly a precision time keeping device by any stretch of the imagination) with that I calculated rounds per frame. With rounds per frame I then multiplied by 30 FPS and then took the shot to shot time average of 30 seconds and got almost 1 so it looks like they are using a normal playback ratio, although it should be noted they do artificially slow and and or speed up play  backs so that 30:18,000 combo isn't dead on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's definitely dependent on <em>what</em> the bubble surface is comprised of. There's another video linked above, with gigantic bubbles (20' big) that are likely made with glycerine or similar, and the propagation is much slower than 208m/s. At normal speed, you could easily time the duration of the burst with a watch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Movement in matter propagates at the speed of sound (which is vibration/movement in matter). It might seem obvious and unhelpful, but it will be much easier finding speed of sound in water than speed of bubble burst.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there's no guarantee that the popping front has to travel at the speed of sound though... Not all motion of material is at that material's speed of sound. Water waves for example are obviously way slower. Wind in air moves way slower than the speed of sound (try blowing out a candle from a few feet away if you don't believe me). </p>
<p>Vibrations travel at a material's speed of sound, but a propagating wave doesn't have to have that speed. The speed of sound is more of a speed limit than a speed of everything (and even then, you get into murky waters when you allow shock waves and things).</p></div>		</li>

<p>This seems plausible.</p>
<p>I suspect the medium the bubble is traveling in (air in this case) might also affect the speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking from /u/MorRobots comment... the speed the pop happens it half the circumference (not diameter) of the bubble divided by the time for it to pop.</p>
<p>Since the video was likely played on YouTube at 30 fps, then the total real time is (13 s/18000 fps)*30 fps=0.0217 s (not 0.72 ms).</p>
<p>Therefore we have: (0.5<em>pi</em>0.15 m)/(0.0217 s)=10.8 m/s (or 24 mph).</p></div>		</li>
