			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, I didn't really elaborate on that. Glass with a rough surface would look cloudy but light would still pass through it. You just wouldn't be able to see much detail from the other side because as the photons meet the rough surface, many of them would be effectively scattered in random directions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tape has a very similar refractive index, hence the rough surface at the tape/glass barrier no longer matters because light is not reflected at that boundary anymore, so there's no more scattering. This is a useful trick often used in windshield repair actually, where they fill the crack with an adhesive that has the same refractive index as the glass, making it nearly invisible, if done properly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the way it's been made opaque. Frosted glass is indeed normal glass that's been made opaque by roughing up the surface and it still doesn't absorb light, it merely scatters it so much that it's all scrambled up and you can't recover the image. On the other hand, things like tinted windows and sunglasses have dopants added to them that adsorb the light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>light travels slower through glass</p>

<p>I thought photons always travel at the speed of light - so do you mean they just &quot;bounce around&quot; more before coming out the other side?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Light travels at <em>c</em> (as in E = mc^2 ) in a vacuum. Within a material light travels slower (which is where the index of refraction <em>n</em> comes from [as in Snell's law]). As stated by the other reply this is because the photons are more or less absorbed and re emitted by the atoms in the material.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the index of refraction <em>n</em> isn't a flat constant for a given material, it varies with the frequency of a photon - which is why you can get a prism/rainbow effect, glass actually bends light a different amount depending on the color. </p>
<p>Also, the lowest absorption of glass is in the infrared range, which is why in fiber optics (made of glass) we mostly use 1500 nm light - for a given length of fiber, less 1500 nm light will be absorbed than other colors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'bouncing around' explanation cannot be true because in that case all information about the direction of the photon would be lost - every piece of glass would be frosted, and even worse, your eyeball would be frosted too. It also doesn't explain things like Cherenkov radiation, which happens when a charged particle moves faster than the local speed of light, nor does it explain how in some materials the speed of light can vary wildly with color or polarization of the light.</p>
<p>Instead, when a photon enters a material it interacts with the electrons in the material. As a result of that, you can't really treat it as a photon any more, instead you have to treat it as a quasiparticle called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polariton" target="_blank">polariton</a>. Polaritons have propperties that are different from bare photons, although they will be quite similar as long as the coupling between the photon and the electrons is weak (which is the case in glass). In that case, a polariton is effectively just a photon with a different velocity. If you have stronger interactions between light and mater you can get all kinds of weird effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The denser the media, the slower the light. Afaik it is around 125k in diamond whereas 300k in vacuum. This phenomenon causes all types of weird stuff such as Cherenkov radiation, which is the awesome blue light emitted when a charged particle (such as an electron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium.</p></div>		</li>
