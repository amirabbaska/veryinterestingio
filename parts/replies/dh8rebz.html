			<div class="markdown"><p>Small, but i am not sure i'd say <em>extremely,</em> thats a bit value-added. An outlier, but its still a lot of iron, not like, microscopic or something. This is thought to be because whenever the giant impact occured, it was lighter material that was kicked into orbit that became the moon and the heavy stuff from both impactor and pre-earth stayed largely in the earth.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_structure_of_the_Moon" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_structure_of_the_Moon</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Several lines of evidence imply that the lunar core is small, with a radius of about 350 km or less.[3] <strong>The size of the lunar core is only about 20% the size of the Moon itself, in contrast to about 50% as is the case for most other terrestrial bodies.</strong> The composition of the lunar core is not well constrained, but most believe that it is composed of metallic iron alloyed with a small amount of sulfur and nickel. Analyses of the Moon's time-variable rotation indicate that the core is at least partly molten.[4]</p>
<p>In 2010, a reanalysis of the old Apollo seismic data on the deep moonquakes using modern processing methods confirmed that the Moon has an iron rich core with a radius of 330 ± 20 km. The same reanalysis established that the solid inner core made of pure iron has the radius of 240 ± 10 km. The core is surrounded by the partially (10 to 30%) melted layer of the lower mantle with a radius of 480 ± 20 km (thickness ~150 km). These results imply that 40% of the core by volume has solidified. The density of the liquid outer core is about 5 g/cm3 and it could contain as much 6% sulfur by weight. The temperature in the core is probably about 1600–1700 K.[5]</p>

<p>I feel like I shouldn't comment on this because this is slightly outside of my area of expertise, but all natural radioisotopes (today) have half-lives either on the same scale as the age of the Earth, or much much larger (because otherwise they would have decayed away by now).</p>
<p>But the Earth is also roughly halfway through it's lifespan, from supernova of its stellar progenitor (when all of these radioisotopes were formed) to being consumed by the sun's red giant phase (roughly 5B out of 10B years).  I assume that the primary component of radioactive decay heating to be U-238, which has a half-life of about 5B years, so we will lose, at-most, half of our heat before being consumed by the red giant phase of the sun.  Even if it were some other major isotopes contributing to the heating of the earth at present, a little bit of advanced differential equations would show that the activity thereof must certainly decay away more slowly than if it were monoisotopic.</p>
<p>Also, not fission, but radioactive decay.  There's not much neutron radiation in the core/mantle, and there's not many (any?) s.f. radioisotopes hanging around there, either.  While radioactive decay gives off much less energy than a fission event (in general), there's just not much fission events going on.</p>
<p>If there is anyone who is an expert in natural radioisotopes and/or stellar nucleosynthesis and/or stellar/planetary evolution, please feel free to make any amendments to my statements as necessary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>from what i learned today, (i could be totally wrong) it would seem that the inner core is actually solid due to the pressure and it is actually being spun faster than the earth like a giant electric motor due to the magnetic forces in the outer core affecting it.</p></div>		</li>
