			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question because a Free Body Diagram could lead you to believe otherwise. There would be a downward vector of force of gravity in equilibrium with an upward force vector of buoyancy. At a glance the two would cancel, and the swimmer would have no net gravitational force downward, making you think they are essentially weightless. This part is correct. The swimmer is weightless in that the forces on him are balanced and no net resultant force is produced.</p>
<p>However, if you draw a FBD of the entire pool, and consider it with swimmers inside, you can see that net mass is being added to the system, therefore weight will also increase. The buoyancy vectors are also subject to Newton's law of equla and opposite forces, and thus for every Newtonof force they lift a swimmer, they push down on the pool bottom equally and this is equal to the swimmers mass.</p>
<p>Good question and good thinking on your part to see the limitations of simplified models like FBD. You are a smart human. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where that goes wrong is that you're looking at the free body diagram of the wrong object.  If you want to know the force on the swimming pool, draw a FBD for the swimming pool.  One of them will be the buoyancy force: if the water exerts an upward force on the swimmer, the swimmer exerts a downward force on the water by Newton's Third Law.  Include that, and you're fine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cheers for the explanation, my initial thoughts were based around the mechanical installation and principles of operation counteracting weight with overflows and level control but this got me thinking about whether itâ€™s actually required in terms of buoyancy etc.
This is where I got lost in thought and confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to be a little pedantic here and say that, for some swimming pools, the answer will be &quot;no.&quot; Know those little white flaps that the water gently laps at around the side of the pool? Those are for recycling/cleaning/treating the water, and also regulate the amount of water in the pool. Large commercial pools will prevent a major change in water level, so would remove some water from circulation if you just started filling the pool up with people.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a small pool like a kiddie pool or backyard pool with no real recirculating capability would certainly feel the extra weight of swimmers. So I guess the answer is &quot;it depends.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
