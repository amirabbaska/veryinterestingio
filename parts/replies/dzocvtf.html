			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, Vitamin D helps maintain plasma levels of calcium (and also phosphorus since it is stored as Calcium Phosphate in bone). Too much can cause hypercalcemia which can cause a lot of different problems. It is absorbed in the skin but activated in the kidney, thus too much can cause kidney problems (as well as problems that calcium imbalances can lead to)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Parathyroids release parathyroid hormone (PTH) which ends up converting Vit D to calcitriol, the active form of Vit D. Without normal function, you end up getting low calcium and high phosphate in blood (PTH helps to get rid of phosphate through urine excretion). </p>
<p>According to UpToDate, treatment is usually calcium or calcitriol (or some other Vit D analogs)</p></div>		</li>
