<p>Apart from the one answer about engaging in &quot;play which builds muscle and muscle memory&quot; the answer is most likely &quot;no&quot;. Exercise for the sake of exercise burns up a lot of calories which in other animals is best preserved for acquiring food and reproducing etc. </p>

<p>But what about hamsters running around in hamster wheels? What &quot;sake&quot; does this exercise have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered how the hamster wheel was invented and how the inventor knew that it would work. The most information I can get is that it might have been inspired by the mechanism that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnspit_dog" target="_blank">turnspit dogs</a> used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many highly sexually dimorphic species of mammals have violent contests between males for mating rights. </p>
<p>Males in these species will generally put on large amounts of muscle mass, which is calorie intensive tissue and probably  has little benefit (if not hindrance) to strict survival. </p>
<p>Whether they engage in resistance training to help produce the growth I don't know. But even though it takes a lot of energy, if it creates better chances of mating it would be very reasonable to see it as an evolved behaviour.</p>
<p>The need to impress others in the group is hardly a human trait alone.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The need for resistance training is mostly a human trait. With appropriate genes, simply growing muscle without the training is not only possible but takes less calories, so is much more efficient and preferable.</p>
<p>We happen to desire more muscular bodies at the expense of calories, but our body is tuned to conserve calories at all cost, and grow extra muscle only in very specific cases when and where absolutely required, i.e. resistance training and calorie surplus. There's no reason why it couldn't be tuned differently and you'd gain a gorilla-like physique by lying on your couch, but genes like that were <em>strongly</em> selected against up until very recently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah.  This is a small part of why CRISPR and its kin are going to have an absolutely massive impact.</p>
<p>And I agree with you.  If there was an evolutionary choice between working out to build muscle and simply building muscle, it's just going to build muscle</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess you could argue that's what people at the gym are likely doing too...but there's probably like 1 guy there just to gain muscle with no sexual end result in mind. Probably. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Functional strength is a thing, and plenty of people use their body.  There's a lot more to working out than vanity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Functional strength is a bit of a misnomer though. You can still get strong with isolation exercises, but the reason compounds/functional exercises build more strength is due to neurological adaptations. Lifting heavy loads are very skill based.  Kind of like running, it takes time to build the neuromuscular cooperation. That's why a person can get insanely strong without being huge. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, but no amount of skill training is going to let me lift 500 lb weights. That takes muscle mass.</p>
<p>And a less damaged set of cervical vertebrae, which will be involved. Skill training may reduce that tangential involvement, however.</p></div>		</li>
