			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell me if my interpretation works:
At this point, God still asked for sacrifices to absolve people from their sin, and this worked by people basically putting the guilt of sin on the animal and killing it as an offering. Jesus basically acted as the end all be all sacrifice that allows people to be saved and put back into relationship with god. Does that make sense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good summary.</p>
<p>Where pretty much all the Christian denominations argue with each other is whether that salvation is automatic or whether a person needs to perform an action to apply that salvation to their record.</p>
<p>And whether Jesus was human or divine, whether to baptize in His Name or in the titles of God.</p>
<p>Or whether some dude took a bunch of drugs and wrote a new gospel hundreds of years after the fact.</p>
<p>Or whether a man gets elected and makes up new rules whenever he feels like it, even if they contradict original Scripture.</p>
<p>You get the idea.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Eh not really. That line is more around Calvinist predestination where it doesn't matter what you do, the outcome is already certain. </p>
<p>Catholics + Orthodox on one side and mainline Protestants on the other were just talking past each other about grace and works for 500 years; Catholics believe in Sola Gratia and virtually all mainline Protestants believe that true faith will always bear the fruit of good works. There have been many ecumenical statements and it's almost impossible to come up with a statement that one group would agree to but not the other.</p>
<p>Now, sects that believe in The Elect? Whole different ballgame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll copy and paste what I just made in another comment as I'm curious to how Christians try to explain it. --</p>
<p>See this is repeated over and over, but <strong>how</strong> does death equal forgiveness? Why did it <em>have</em> to be the slaughter of innocent, irrelevant animals, and <em>then</em> a human torture and slaughter? </p>
<p>How do y'all force this to make sense in your minds? Where is the connection between something dying and that squalling forgiveness?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's go back to the original analogy: You're in the courtroom facing an exorbitant fine...</p>
<p>But before this guy comes in and pays your fine, you are told that he is going to do that. You might react in different ways:</p>
<p>You might think that you aren't deserving of that level of kindness from a someone and reject the very idea that someone would do that for you.</p>
<p>You might decide that this man doesn't actually exist and the people telling you about him are just making up wacky stories.</p>
<p>You might realize that by accepting this kindness, you may have some obligation to reassess your life and begin behaving in a way so that you don't end up back in that courtroom for some future infraction. You may decide this is too much for you to achieve and give up on receiving the kindness.</p>
<p>You might accept the man's kindness in paying the fine and then go right back to the same behaviors, assuming that this guy will be around to pay any other fines you incur (this would be the sin of presumption).</p>
<p>You might decide that the entire courtroom situation is some kind of illusion and reject the existence of it, reject any power it has over you, and try to ignore the reality of the fine. You continue to create your own reality about the situation in your head to avoid thinking about your actual situation.</p>
<p>You may decide that you enjoy the behaviors you were participating in so much that the risk of facing the fine is superseded in your mental cost/benefit analysis. Maybe you don't believe there will be a fine, or maybe you think you won't get caught or maybe you just don't care about facing the fine in the end as long as you can keep going with the behaviors you enjoy.</p>
<p>These choices would reflect in some way a rejection by you of this man's kindness, either before or after the fact of him paying the fine. As incredible as it seems many people will choose one of these paths.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might accept this man's kindness with gratitude and commit yourself to self improvement so that you can avoid these situations in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, I understand. Follow up, what of the people who are never introduced to the kind man, or at least not to the same degree as others?</p>
<p>I'm thinking of the of the population of Earth preceding the first coming of Jesus and after the fall of Adam and Eve, also throw in the large segment of the population that was indoctrinated into another belief system or no belief system at all, yet led somewhat decent lives. Dante's Inferno indicates that they are confined to Purgatory, but I'm not sure if that's necessarily biblical canon. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I'm honestly curious....</p>
<p>Isn't it more righteous to accept punishment for your sin than to let an innocent person/deity take the fall for you?</p>
<p>Is hell filled with righteous people?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Or you might decide that while there is historical evidence that this man may have existed, he may or may not have had money to pay off this fine.  </p>
<p>And come to think of it, you've never seen this court, and you've never even received a ticket or summons in the mail telling you that you owe a fine.  But a man says to you, &quot;You broke a law, it says so right here in this book.  And the proof that this book is telling the truth is that the book says it is.&quot;</p>
<p>And you might incidentally agree with some of what is written in this guy's book, like &quot;Be a decent human being&quot;, but that doesn't mean you say &quot;Hey thanks buddy for paying off a fine for me that no one can show me a record of.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
