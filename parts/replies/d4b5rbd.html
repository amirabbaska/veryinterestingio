			<p>Yep, this was my tack and it extends to any transposition of digits, not necessarily reversal.</p>		</li>

			<p>This thinking shows that not only does it work for the reverse of the digits, but also any scrambling of the digits. In addition, you can choose to place any of the original number digits into any new numerical place, including one already occupied by another digit, by adding the digits together.<br><br>abc - cx = (a00 - a) + (b0 -b) + (c-c0), where x=a+b<br><br>127 - 73 = 54 = 6<em>9<br><br>Also, you can break apart a digit into two numbers and treat each as a new digit.<br><br>ab - xby = (x0 - x00) + (y0 - y) + (b - b0), where x+y=a<br><br>17 - 314 = -297 = (-33)</em>9<br><br>Combining the two above, one can say: If the sum of the digits of a number equals the sum of the digits of another number, then the subtraction of the numbers is divisible by 9.<br><br> </p>		</li>
