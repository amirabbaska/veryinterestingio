			<div class="markdown"><p>Its not a comparable result, it's a superior result. Lath and plaster walls are almost unfixable. The design is such that any damage is nearly impossible to fix properly and have it look perfect. Also renovating with lath and plaster is a massive nightmare. You cant just cut a hole in the wall if you want to, for example, look for mold, or move electrical components. </p>
<p>Lath and plaster is an absolute nightmare to work with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, its thicker, but far less rigid. Drywall is a solid piece, and stiffens the wall quite a bit.</p>
<p>I dont know is lathe and plaster is actually stronger, but I doubt it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer, just a small missing info: The big space between the studs is selected for various reasons: Is it a load bearing wall? if so 12 or 16&quot; will be used, if not 16 or 24&quot;. A standard sheet is 4x8', so the studs must be spaced so one studs at each end of the sheet, so the two sheets can be screwed to it, which prevent the joint from moving much and causing it to break the plaster that hide the joints. And then there need to be some in between those end-of-sheets studs. 16&quot; is common, strong enought for a second floor and the roof, while 12&quot; would be used in a basement IF the whole house sit on it, which is uncommon nowadays. 24&quot; can be used for the second floor, but then it get easy to break the drywall due to the spacing... So they will usually still use 16&quot;.
Now, you want it to be evenly spaced, not only it help to locate them so you can screw in it, but you may have an insulated wall, which will most likelly be insulated with fiberglass insulation, which come in sheet of 10.5, 14.5 or 22.5&quot;, which is the 12/16/24&quot; spacing less the stud thickness, which is 1.5&quot; (a 2x4 really mesure 1.5x3.5... they claim that it is 2x4&quot; unfinished, and the finish remove 1/4&quot; per side). If the studs get uneven then the fiberglass won't fit proprelly: too tight cause the air cell inside to be smaller and you lose some insulation propriety. Too lose and it won't stay in place and will have space, which of course is worse...</p>
<p>Interior walls usually do not have insulation, unless you want to soundproof a room, then there will be some, usually mineral fiber instead of fiberglass, or some more specialised insulation material. Also, the wall construction is slightly different (to prevent the vibration of one wall to be mechanically transfered to the other wall, basically they will put two sets of studs, one for each wall, that do not touch. No direct vibration transfert... but thicker wall)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You wouldn't use mineral fiber for soundproofing. You use it for reflection absorption, such as reducing the reverberation length of sound inside of a room. </p>
<p>To actually soundproof a room, something along the lines of a block wall, floated on a thin layer of silicone, with the interior floor also mechanically separated from the subfloor and the walls. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mineral fiber is like the basic basic thing, for when you just want some less noise, without going with the more complex, more expensive stuff, but it does have it's limit and isn't that great. But yeah, there is way better stuff.</p></div>		</li>
