			<div class="markdown"><p>It's so cool to see this mentioned. My grandfather invented and patented a lot of the processes involved in geomelting back in the 70s. His team was also working with the Chinese government to deploy a means of handling a lot of their radioactive waste like this, but he ended up dying of skin cancer before he could finish that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's relatively easy to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium_glass" target="_blank">uranium glass</a>. The degree of enrichment doesn't make any difference to the chemistry. Glass is chemically and physically stable- you don't need to worry about your uranium dissolving out into something, or 'settling' at the bottom of your container and going critical etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>what would happen if there were an earthquake or some other event that disturbed the encasement of the buried material? would it pose a threat?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because dirt is a great, cheap radiation barrier.</p>
<p>You don't even need to go stupidly deep, something like 5-10 meters would be &quot;good enough&quot; depending on the radiation your blocking.</p>
<p>Downside is it can leak into the soil in a bad container, it can pollute the area when done wrong (see - pacific proving grounds /marshal Islands where the US literary dumped tons of contaminated waste from bomb tests into a bomb crater and sealed the top with concrete - sand underneath let's seawater flow through the waste and spread it because of no proper sealing) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that the earth moves due to plate tectonics. The radiation barrier and containers can fail over the very, very long time that nuclear waste is radioactive. Some places are geologically more stable than others, but sometimes earthquakes and other natural phenomena can strike in unexpected places.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It'll be interesting to see if we can create stuff that's fueled by radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's still radioactive and still not nice stuff, but the ground does a very nice job of absorbing the emissions, while simultaneously letting the powers that be keep tabs on where it is.</p>
<p>Understandably, processed nuclear material is something authorities have a vested interest in making sure the big block of nasty stuff stays where it's put.</p>
<p>One day, something like firing it into the sun would be an ideal disposal process, but given that glass can still be turned into a dust, and that dust wouldn't be a party to spread across the atmosphere should a rocket decide to have a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly', even today's launch records aren't enough by any sane safety standards to even consider this yet.</p></div>		</li>
