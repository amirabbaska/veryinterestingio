			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, we lost the majority of our hair when we started standing upright. We evolved into distance runners, which necessitated shedding vast amounts of heat quickly; skin+sweat is MUCH better at cooling than hair/fur.</p>
<p>Retaining on our head allowed us to block the sun which (because we stood up) is mostly upon our scalp. Anyways, preventing heat input while maximising heat output allowed us to run almost indefinitely, while our prey literally baked itself to death running away.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sure you know this but just to add info to the thread, this is called &quot;persistence hunting&quot;. There are some theories that this was a key factor in human evolution.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no agreement as to why this is. There are several views that exist though. One hypothesis relates to the evolution of the &quot;aquatic ape&quot; (the idea that humans were, in the past, more aquatic. In this scenario, the view is that longer hair allowed infants to hold on to their mother better, increasing their chances of survival. Also, they'd need to swim less, retaining more energy.</p>
<p>Another hypothesis is that we have long hair because of mate selection. That is, in the past, long hair was considered a sign of a healthy mate. </p>
<p>Then there is the hypothesis that there are indeed practical benefits of having a full head of hair. It allows retention of heat escaping from the head and protects from damaging UV rays.</p>
<p>You can read more about it in <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/5676/why-does-human-facial-and-head-hair-continue-to-grow" target="_blank">this Biology StackExchange answer</a> which also cites sources, which I haven't bothered to do, I just gave you a quick rundown, since just pasting a link would be against the rules. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, as you seem to know what you're talking about, I'd like to ask something kind of unrelated but it's been bugging me.</p>
<p>I had a nostril hair poking out a few years ago so I went to pull it out. Instead of the usual short pull and brief pain, the hair just seemed to keep coming out whilst making a squeaking noise. It was probably a good 14-16 inches long and when it stopped coming out I couldn't get it to snap off so I ended up cutting it.</p>
<p>I assumed it had just got curled inside the follicle and grown underneath the skin in my nose for many years. Thing is though, my nose seems like it's stuffy all the time, a bit like the passages inside are too narrow and breathing through it is constantly strained.</p>
<p>Could I have some kind of condition where there are lot's more of these trapped hairs, growing inside my skin and reducing the airflow capacity of my nose?</p></div>		</li>

<p>But would this explain hair growing past the shoulders?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, remember that humans primarily evolved in Africa, moving out only in the past few ten thousand years.  I believe the theory is that we lost hair to lose heat faster.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Terminal length varies from shoulder-length (an anagen period of about two years with a below-average 3 inches per year) to many-feet-past-floor-length (Guinness world record holders grow hair at 12 inches a year for multiple decades).  </p>
<p>With that extent of variation it's not really meaningful to talk about an average.</p></div>		</li>
