Red, green and blue together make white, so if you've got three quarks then there'll be one of each colour. With two quarks, if one is red, then the other must be anti-red (anti-quarks have anti-red, anti-blue and anti-green as their colours, instead of red, blue and green).</p>
<p>You can't isolate quarks of a single colour because the energy required to separate a quark from other quarks is also enough energy to create new quarks by pair production, so the quark you attempt to separate will just end up bound to one of the new quarks you've created.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By isolate, I mean taking a quark and making it so that it isn't nearby to any other quarks.</p>
<p>Quarks that are not isolated won't be in the exact same spot but they'll be fairly close (about 10^-15 m) to one another.</p></div>		</li>
