			<div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't find any good info about this, other than product demos. Seems interesting though, if an unusual niche between cheap and good.</p>
<p>They don't seem to usually be true multitouch, just two finger and some gestures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I should add that resistive screens are pretty common for industrial equipment and things as well.  &quot;Can detect pressure from anything solid&quot; is a major upside for that case, rather than a downside, because it means operators can wear gloves, have wet/oily/greasy fingers, etc.</p></div>		</li>
