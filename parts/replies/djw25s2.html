</blockquote>
<p>did you read your own article?</p>
<p>They conclude that all 3 effects are important, Trail effect, Gyro, and steering center of mass. As in adjusting any one of the 3 can make a stable bike unstable.</p>
<p>&quot;We have found that almost any self-stable bicycle can be made unstable by mis-adjusting only the trail, only the front-wheel gyro or only the front-assembly center-of-mass position,&quot; the researchers said in their paper. &quot;Conversely, many unstable bicycles can be made stable by appropriately adjusting any one of these three design variables.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure the gyroscopic effect goes the other way, and is not in play for the most part on bicycles. I say this because when you ride a motorcycle, above about 50k you turn by counter steering, which is the gyroscopic effect. The second you turn the bars a little to the left it shifts the bikes weight to the right, causing you to lean right and then turn in that direction. </p>
<p>I believe bicycles balance because of the tendency of motion to want to continue in a linear fashion, which has the side effect of balancing the bike</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would the effect of turning the wheel to the left make a motorbike roll right, but go the other way on a push bike? Gyro may not be as big as I thought, but it's still helping keep the bike upright. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I'm saying, it's not the gyro on a bike because that's the reverse of what a gyro does. Because that's definitely what happens on a motorcycle so it can't be the same phenomena I don't think I'm may speculating though. </p></div>		</li>
