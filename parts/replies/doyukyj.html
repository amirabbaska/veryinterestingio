<p>If there is no current draw the unit will not be using the power, it just sits there at the ready. No harm is being done at this point. The components are barely working until current is pulled.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not true, in general.  Most ac/dc adapters do have a significant power draw called a vampire drain even when no device load is attached, although less power draw than when in active use.   The simplest circuits have no design to specifically limit this vampire draw and this inefficiency can add up when multiplied by all the devices that are constantly plugged in over the millions of households that are served by mains power in a region.</p>
<p>This is why municipalities have been creating regulations to ban inefficient devices with wasteful vampire loads and to require more intelligent circuit designs that specifically limit this waste.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The LED will cause a small current drain, very small. If the step down transformer doesn't lower the voltage enough then yes a bit more current drop during regulation may happen. </p>
<p>I haven't opened one or measured current draw but in theory the above stands. </p>
<p>Edit: There are other methods without getting too technical to achieve the same results but basically AC to DC to AC back to DC. But I can't see this being the case on something as simple as a laptop power supply. This would improve current and power regulation and likely cause a little more current draw. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There can be significant vampire drain on ac/dc adapters that have no LEDs at all.   Merely having any transformer in the circuit involves vampire drain, regardless of the stepdown voltage, due to inefficiency of transformers that result in leakage and other waste.</p></div>		</li>
