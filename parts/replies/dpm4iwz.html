			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. So it appears to be a matter of seconds. If I may ask a follow up question, what causes the protons to snap out of alignment? A magnetic material such as iron remains magnetized indefinitely after being exposed to a magnetic field.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since no one specifically answered what causes the misalignment, in NMR it's caused by a an energy pulse of a very short duration, think 1 *10^-12 seconds in the frequency that protons absorb which happens to be in the radio frequency range. </p>
<p>The proton will absorb the pulse and lose its orientation. Since it's now misaligned in the magnetic field, it will emit tiny radio waves until it's fully relaxed, as in realigned with the field. </p>
<p>The radio probe will pick up those waves, and do a Fourier Transform to make sense of the waves, then turn the output into an NMR spectrum.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how this happens in an MRI but it has to be very similar. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I learned that stuff so I wanted to check online first. Turns out Wikipedia has a very clear explanation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, materials made of atoms with filledelectron shells have a total dipole moment of zero, because the electrons all exist in pairs with opposite spin, every electron's magnetic moment is cancelled by the opposite moment of the second electron in the pair. Only atoms with partially filled shells (i.e., unpaired spins) can have a net magnetic moment, so ferromagnetism only occurs in materials with partially filled shells. Because of Hund's rules, the first few electrons in a shell tend to have the same spin, thereby increasing the total dipole moment.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OK so in MRI you force the Nuclear spins to align by using a really strong magnetic field, when the field switches off the 'relax' into a non aligned state, which is normal for them. Nuclear spins are not normally aligned at all. </p>
<p>Permanent magentism is determined by unpaired Electrons and is quite different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in an experimental solid state NMR lab and your description of how T1 works in NMR/NMRI is wrong. The magnetic field, for one, IS ALWAYS ON.</p>
<p>The main magnetic field B0 is a superconducting magnet (40 years ago it was mostly ferromagnets) and is always on and cannot easily be changed. Experimentally, it is not done.</p>
<p>After an excitation rf pulse (B1 field in the rotating frame), you have a non-equilibrium of spin up and spin down for a spin-1/2 system. Through either spin exchange with neighbors or spontaneous spin flips from thermal energy will the population distribution approach the equilibrium distribution described by Boltzmann statistics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't 'snap' out of anything. It's a decay process and follows exponential decay rate.</p>
<p>Except in some extremely rare, definitely not MRI situations (solid sample nmr, for example).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the magnet never turns off (and if they need to turn it off because something has become stuck inside it has to release all of the helium tanks that are used to cool the machine).  It is a very expensive process to turn the machine’s magnet off.  What actually is happening during the scan is radio waves similar to AM radio waves are applied and actually collected by the Protons (hydrogen atoms) causing the atom to flip by a known amount.  When the radio wave is turned off the atom relaxes and realeases a weak but measurable signal that is then picked up by the camera. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries, it’s a very common idea that the MRI turns off the magnet (which gives people a false sense of safety if they think that having metal in an MRI room is big deal, since it should only matter if the magnet is “on”).</p></div>		</li>
