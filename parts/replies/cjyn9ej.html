			<div class="markdown"><p>Most planes will have a cabin altitude of around 8,000 feet at cruise. Especially at 35,000 feet. The windows are designed to withstand those pressures. Normally, windows are weak point in the system. That's why they are oval shaped or circular. A stronger shape</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Windows are ovals not because of the strength of the window pane, but because of the strength of the material around the window. Sharp corners increase stresses, and that leads to cracking. The De Havilland Comet is a classic case study on this; they carried the square window design over into the early jet age, when planes flew higher and had a larger pressure difference acting on the fuselage. After a number of them went down, they figured out the problem, and planes have had oval windows ever since. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was always told round or oval shaped objects can handle stress much better than square or 90 degree sided object. So you're saying the oval shape reduces stress on the materials around the window?</p></div>		</li>
