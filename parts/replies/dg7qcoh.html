<p>On a less serious note, that first comment was just a joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mention Truman, and another thought occurred to me since writing my first post: Truman was a deeply unpopular president when he left office. Not only did he get involved the Korean War, which was unpopular among a section of the populace that felt we had just gotten back from a major war, he fired Gen MacArthur, one of the heroes of WWII, in the middle of the war. Truman's reputation has been rehabilitated, but he was extremely unpopular at the time. </p></div>		</li>
