			<div class="markdown"><p>A popular destination could do it. Where I used to live out in a very very small town was a ton of motels and mom/pop stores that basically would make their operating costs for the year in 2 weeks (NASCAR races) wanted a 6 pack? It was $20 or a 40 minute drive to the bigger store, one way through a ton of traffic. The small stores made a killing every race.</p></div>		</li>
