			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah. Sweat is amazing because conduction (transfer of heat through contact) is the best form of cooling. We'd overheat very quickly without it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't follow how you get to conduction from sweating. If you're sweating, the sweat starts off at your body temperature. The way it helps you shed heat energy is by evaporating. I guess the temperature of the sweat goes down as it evaporates, and your body conducts heat to the now cooler sweat. But it seems like evaporation is the bigger deal there. If you were able to convect your sweat around, in and out of your body, you'd still do alright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its extremely efficient. The main reason for this is understood by looking at water. On average, 1g of water takes 1 calorie of energy to heat up by 1C. However, 1g of 100C water takes 540 calories to heat up to 1g of 100C steam. So each gram of sweat that evaporates off of you took a lot of heat with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a video awhile back where people were asked to touch a piece of aluminum, and a piece of plastic, and then state which was colder to the touch. Of course everyone said the aluminum was colder, but when measured, they both had the same temperature. The difference was that the aluminum, being a good heat conductor, drew more heat than the plastic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's something we all know intuitively becuase we learn it growing up. Getting into a hot car you don't touch the metal until the car cools down because the metal transfers heat far better than plastic or fabric. Because of that fact, it's also often hotter or colder because of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What exactly determines heat conductivity?  I know water has a high specific heat (energy per degree per gram) - is that related?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Specific heat is how much heat is required to raise a certain mass of material (usually 1g) by 1Â°C.  So water takes a lot of energy input, aluminum does not (which is why foil coming out the toaster can be handled by bare hands almost immediately afterward).</p>
<p>There are two types of conductivities for materials (thermal conductivity, K and convection coefficient h).  Thermal conductivity is used for contact between two solids like two metals in contact or my hand touching your skin.  Convection is for 1 or more &quot;fluids&quot; which can be gas or liquid.</p>
<p>Thermal conductivity is affected primarily by the material composition.  Metals conduct electricity because their electrons flow readily and can transfer heat quickly on a molecular level.  They are also rather dense, so have fewer air voids (which are good insulators, meaning they prevent heat flow).</p>
<p>Convection coefficient is affected primarily by material composition as well, but also how quickly the fluid is flowing.  For example, your windows are likely two panes of glass with a very narrow gap between them for air.  Windows are poor insulators, but that thin layer of air is pretty stagnant and acts as a great insulator.  If the panes of glass are separated farther apart, then buoyancy differences (warm air at bottom will flow upward and vice versa) will cause flow in the fluid, making it a significantly less effective insulator.</p></div>		</li>
