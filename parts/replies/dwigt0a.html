			<div class="markdown"><p>The article I read said it's the chemicals they use after they cut the tissue out dries out this stuff. Not squeezing. I could be totally wrong though. I (regretfully) didn't take biology in college.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It could be, I was fairly sleep deprived when I read the article. I couldn't remember how it happened, just that those in the medical profession had actually seen it before, just never realizing what it was because of the collapse of the structure. In the article I read, the guy who discovered it said it was kind of a lucky crossroad of technology and collaboration</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you prolly wouldn’t be awake when it’s happening. If it makes you feel any better the endoscope route is basically the standard for most vascular surgeries. Like if you have bad blood flow problems they usually go through your femoral artery (either side of your groin) and it snakes it’s way to where the problem is and puts a stent or closes the issue. </p>
<p>It’s scary but because it’s much less invasive than the past</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article must have been severely ignoring known information on the subject. I got here late so I wasn't able to post a comment.</p>
<p>In the last thread I posted about how this has been known and argued about whether it should be an organ for years.</p>
<p>The methods to look at this fluid are not new. In my text book they had full pictures and that was made likely 10+ years ago. </p>
<p>They are reclassifying a debated body system not one we didn't understand or didn't know they are just finally saying stop arguing this is what it is.  </p></div>		</li>
