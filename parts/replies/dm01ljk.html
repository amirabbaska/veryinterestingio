			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the situation - density depends on both pressure and temperature. If you take a parcel of air and heat it up, it expands and the hot air is less dense than before. If there are 2 separate parcels of air with the warm one at low altitude where the pressure is high and the cold one is at high altitude where to pressure is low, it's possible to have lower density due to lower pressure (even though temperature is lower also).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess the density argument is correct but it's very uncommon to think of the atmosphere that way since density is actually quite <del>stable</del> uniform in the atmosphere, it's much easier to consider temperature, pressure and water vapour. As for the difference &quot;types&quot; of clouds at different altitudes due to density... no, not right. The type of clouds can be function of altitude but it relates to the temperature and ratio of ice to water droplets.</p></div>		</li>
