			<div class="markdown"><p>To be a bit pedantic, the Reynolds number is a characterisation of flow behaviour, not a cause of it.</p>
<p>Flow does not become more turbulent because the Reynolds number increases, it becomes more turbulent because the inertial forces (which generate turbulence) become dominant over the viscous forces (which suppress turbulence). </p>
<p>The Reynolds number is the ratio of the two factors, so a higher Reynolds number describes a fluid state with higher inertial forces and hence higher turbulence - but the turbulence is caused by the forces themselves, not the Reynolds number.</p>
<p>Sorry to be picky, it's a bit of a soapbox of mine when people confuse models with the underlying physical behaviour. You may have not actually been doing that but your language felt a bit ambiguous.</p></div>		</li>
