<p>Well, in the English speaking world, they are the absolute worst.</p>
<p>In the US, there are tabloid papers, but they are considerd low level crap (News of the World, National Enquirer, etc. ) In fact, they are generally referred to as &quot;Supermarket tabloids.&quot;</p>
<p>In the UK, on the other hand, the top newspapers by circulation are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Sun</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/ushome/index.html" target="_blank">The Daily Mail</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="http://metro.co.uk/" target="_blank">Metro </a></li>
</ol>
<p>It is an oddly British thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not great since it's still geared up to the tabloid population, but at least it's remarkably non-partisan. Better than the Evening Standard, which has gone downhill in the last few years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Didn't know that, I only see their website.</p>
<p>I dont know what people read anymore, really. I was Guardian/Independent reader, but they have just gotten terrible. Bad editing, typos, no research, all Trump, all the time.</p>
<p>Telegraph?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Alfred Nobel did a similar thing to Joseph Pulitzer. He invented dynamite for mining, but of course it was quickly adapted for war. He didn't want his legacy to be one of destruction, so he established the Nobel Prize, which notably includes a <em>Peace</em> Prize.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lost_Honour_of_Katharina_Blum" target="_blank">The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Lost Honour of Katharina Blum, or: how violence develops and where it can lead (original German title: <strong><em>Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum oder: Wie Gewalt entstehen und wohin sie führen kann</em></strong>) is a 1974 novel by Heinrich Böll.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the book the name of the paper is never given but there also is no question about what is meant either and it lead to the paper in question stopping publishing their bestseller list so they would not need to acknowledge its existence.</p></div>		</li>
