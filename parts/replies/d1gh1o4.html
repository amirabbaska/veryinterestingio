			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if they can hear the car, they have no idea about the rules of the road. So if a car is coming, how are they to know it will stay on the road? They stand in the grass all day and don't get hit the noisy cars, so by their logic standing in the road is no different. Or they are standing in the grass and here comes a noisy car, so they need to run away, and run into the road not realizing the car will not drive on the grass to get them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolution sometimes comes up with the same solution multiple times (though the mechanism will be slightly different) because that adaptation is now beneficial again.  A good example are mammals that swim (dolphins, whales, etc.) they evolved from land animals that found it was advantageous to move quickly in water and specialized in that skill.  If it was simply the old genes being used again mammals would have a side to side motion to their tail instead of up and down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite. In the retina there are rods and cones. Rods are good monochrome vision at night, cones are for color. </p>
<p>Birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish and insects can have up to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrachromacy#/media/File:BirdVisualPigmentSensitivity.svg" target="_blank">4 different cones</a>, sensitive to red, green, blue and ultra violet.    </p>
<p>The last common ancestor of all mammals alive today was likely a nocturnal animal. Living at night, it had more use for rods than cones, so it lost two cones. Mammals can basically tell blue from non-blue. Red/green (and brown, yellow etc) are all the same.    </p>
<p>Some species of old world primates, which includes us humans, have a mutation that causes us to have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trichromacy#/media/File:Cones_SMJ2_E.svg" target="_blank">two slightly different versions of the mammalian Red/green cone</a>, which enables us to tell red from green. No reactivation of dormant genes, it is a new mutation.    </p>
<p>This has a number of interesting implications. First of all, birds, reptiles, insects etc. can discern millions of times more colors than we can, just like we can discern many times more colors than most mammals. Many birds and flowers that seem dull to us have bright, vibrant colors that we simply can't see with the naked eye. If you see plants with bright red fruits, you can generally assume the plant wants birds to spread the seed, not mammals. Plants that want their seed to be spread by mammals and not birds are more likely to have green fruits (avocado, mango etc). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We didn't &quot;re-evolve&quot; at all our eyes evolved when we where in water, that's why most land mammals have a fluid in their eyes (it helped compensate for the fluid we where seeing thru). Our eyes are accually pretty bad at seeing thru air, u mean we have a blind spot right in the middle of our field of view. If you look at eyes that evolved to see thru the air (birds) they are so much better than ours it shameful to say we see at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diurnal ones, yes - but nocturnal owls (that is, most of them) primarily use their sense of hearing to hunt, and some are able to catch prey in total darkness. Theoretically, a blind barn owl could fend for itself if it was really lucky and didn't hang out in open spaces much. Which it would, because it's a barn owl. Blind owls can do okay in captivity sometimes, although usually that means the bird has a tiny bit of vision left. Owls that come to wildlife hospitals/rehab centers with eye injuries can sometimes be released with only one functional eye, if the bird is able to adapt to the partial blindness. I work with a great horned owl who is non-releasable because she has a crossed bill, but she's also missing an eye, and her vision is just fine. She can fly and navigate perfectly well. She probably would've been released back into the wild if not for the beak problem. </p>
<p>Anyway, owl vision is excellent, especially in the dark, but it isn't their primary sense for hunting!</p></div>		</li>
