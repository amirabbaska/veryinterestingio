			<div class="markdown"><p>Diurnal ones, yes - but nocturnal owls (that is, most of them) primarily use their sense of hearing to hunt, and some are able to catch prey in total darkness. Theoretically, a blind barn owl could fend for itself if it was really lucky and didn't hang out in open spaces much. Which it would, because it's a barn owl. Blind owls can do okay in captivity sometimes, although usually that means the bird has a tiny bit of vision left. Owls that come to wildlife hospitals/rehab centers with eye injuries can sometimes be released with only one functional eye, if the bird is able to adapt to the partial blindness. I work with a great horned owl who is non-releasable because she has a crossed bill, but she's also missing an eye, and her vision is just fine. She can fly and navigate perfectly well. She probably would've been released back into the wild if not for the beak problem. </p>
<p>Anyway, owl vision is excellent, especially in the dark, but it isn't their primary sense for hunting!</p></div>		</li>
