<p>Handy little tool there.</p>
<p>So let's take system with a star and 3x Jupiter a good distance away.  Say it has a Hill radius 100 Mkm (Neptune in real life exceeds that).  We'll give it a 'moon' with the mass of Neptune and put it at the extreme limit, the 100Mkm.  It will itself have a Hill radius of 18 Mkm.  Then we put a super-Earth (10x) at that distance, which has a Hill radius of 10 Mkm.  Put Earth around that one, 3.2 Mkm.  Mars around it, 1Mkm.  Then Luna, 336,000 km.  Ceres, 53,000 km.</p>
<p>So clearly, this can continue for quite a while, if you're willing and capable of engineering it yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neptune's moon Neso is the farthest moon from its planet in the solar system. It takes 27 years to orbit Neptune once. If only Neso was more massive, its Hill Sphere would be huge,and would be likely to have a submoon (I just made up that word)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neso and Psamathe have similar orbits, so they might have been 1 moon that got smashed apart. This would make the likelihood of a small fragment orbiting one of them pretty high. Neso's Hill Sphere is still in the neighborhood of 100,000km wide, and much smaller asteroids have moons. We just need a better way to look that far away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>27 <em>Earth</em> years I presume. <del>Now I'm having trouble with the maths.</del>
How many <em>&quot;Neptune Years&quot;</em> does it take? I mean, if I was Neptunian, how long would it take to see Neso doing a full orbit?
Wait, is it 0.16? Now I need to know <em>Neptune days</em>...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would take 25.7 earth years, or 224980 hrs. If you want the answer in Neptune years:</p>
<p>A &quot;year&quot; on Neptune is 164.8 earth years. The orbital period of neso is 25.7 earth years.  So the orbital period of neso in Neptune years is 0.155. This means that neso orbits Neptune 6.42 times every time Neptune orbits the sun. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, Earth years. (25.6... Julian Years).
Neptune has an orbital period of 164.79 Julian years, so Neso has an orbit of about 15.5% of the Neptunian year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the larger a planets own Hill sphere, the better the odds of this happening. However, there is a bit less material out that far to form the moon, so it's kind of six of one, half dozen sort of situation.</p></div>		</li>
