			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the truth. Outside of really exotic materials, there are no metals that you can buy that won't corrode on an ocean-going boat. You also get to learn a lot about galvanic interactions, as any stainless steel bolt or fitting on an aluminum part will surely eat away at the aluminum in a salt water environment. This is also why any metals in contact with the water, like the cooling system on an engine, or the propeller, utilize sacrificial zinc anodes that, due to their more favorable electrical potential, attract electrons from the metal they are connected to, and corrode in place of the metal they are protecting. </p>
<p>Bronze is one of the few metals that holds up well in a saltwater environment. It still forms an oxide layer -- a brown/green petina -- but this layer also acts to protect the rest of the metal from further corrosion. Bronze is also strong, and usually stretches before it fails, unlike stainless steel which fails without much warning. I think the main reason bronze isn't used on sailboats
these days though is it's quite expensive, and people like the shininess of stainless steel. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Depends on the steel, sometimes once it starts to rust it's even worse than other metals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>actually he's right, stainless steel can be more susceptible to pitting corrosion, which can be very severe.</p>
<p>304 and 316 stainless are pretty sensitive to chlorides, and once a small intrusion like a scratch in the passive layer is made, the reaction can cause even higher concentration of chlorides and acid conditions to develop locally</p>
