			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! And this is why screen protectors do actually work in stopping your screen from shattering. It's not about protecting it from the impact that time you actually drop it, but stopping all the micro fissures that form with general wear and tear.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I always thought it was just to protect from the little scratches that I might imprint. </p>
<p>Never thought it would prevent the screen from shattering. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's really simple, like armour for your phone. Imagine a motorbike racer falls at 50mph and skids along the track to land in the gravel trap relatively unhurt because of his reinforced suit. Now imagine he does that naked. His skin ends up on the track seperated from his body, and he is very, very hurt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume that tempered glass screen protectors are the best, then, because they protect from the micro fissures from general wear/tear, <em>and</em> also dissipate the force of an impact by shattering.</p>
<p>I don't even consider non TG screen protectors for new devices mostly for aesthetics (and screen feel), but also because I've seen quite a few screens saved by TGs sacrificing themselves.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Assuming it does not crack at all (even at a very small level) then there will be no change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if it does crack on a small level, that will compromise the overall integrity, making it more likely break on future drops?</p>
<p>Like, if you drop a phone from 3ft, and it has a 1% chance of small fractures, and 0% chance of &quot;full&quot; fractures. Assuming that 1% chance small fracture happened, the next time it's dropped from 3ft, the chance of a &quot;full&quot; fracture is &gt;0%?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fast fracture (the mode of fracture we're talking about here) is dependent on a few factors: the stress (let's call it s because I don't know how to get a sigma on my phone), initial crack length (a0), a factor called the fracture toughness (K1c), and the shape of the crack(Y). The equation is set up like this: K1c=Y<em>s</em>sqrt(pi*a). K1c is a constant, Y is a constant. You can solve this equation for a given stress to find out how large the crack needs to be to cause fracture. Or, alternatively, you can find the stress needed at a given crack length. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am actually not an expert on mechanical properties, so take this with a grain of salt.</p>
<p>The initiation of a fracture will come from some combination of the stress loading onto the glass, the degree of stress concentration at the tip of the initial crack/flaw, and the size of the crack.</p>
<p>So, in theory, a small crack in a part of the screen which goes through lower stress (typically) will not have any real effect if there is a larger flaw in an area with a larger stress.</p>
<p>Not sure if that made sense.  This wiki article has some actual equations where you can see how stress concentration at the crack tip, size of crack, and stress applied affect whether a crack propagates or not.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you considering a scratch as a non-crack?  Wouldn't a scratch manage subsequent falls more likely to result in a crack.  Scoring of glass is often used to break it, how would a scratch differ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm considering a scratch as a surface crack.</p>
<p>It is not different, except when you are talking about a crack at the surface (rather than an internal crack) you double the measured length (a surface crack can be thought of as &quot;half&quot; a crack)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean you halve the length? Your explanation seems to contradict the math.  Or does the surface crack represent half of a theoretical total crack?</p>
