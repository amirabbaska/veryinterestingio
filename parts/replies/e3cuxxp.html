			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes it's a safety thing too, like one guy in the hole 2 others watching out for him to make sure he doesn't accidentally hit a gas line or something and to make sure no vehicles or whatnot get in the way. Then they switch, 2nd worker goes in hole 1st guy gets out and rests/watches. Etc. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Great, but that doesn't explain why long stretches of highway are closed off for months or even years at a time with zero work being done. Yes, you can't put the roof on a house without walls, but that doesn't explain why the walls are not getting built. </p></div>		</li>
