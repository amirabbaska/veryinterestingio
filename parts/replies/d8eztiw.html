			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fairly easy</p>
<p>The equation for the centripetal force in an orbit is F = (GMm)/r^2</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>G is the gravitational constant</li>
<li>M is the mass off the larger object</li>
<li>m is the mass of the orbiting object</li>
<li>r is the separation between the two centres</li>
</ul>
<p>Then you need to know the orbital acceleration equation, which is a = v^2 /r</p>
<p>Then assuming that F = ma, you can swap F for ma,  and use the orbital acceleration equation, which gives you (mv^2 )/r</p>
<p>Equate this to the centripetal force equation and you get (mv^2 )/r  = (GMm)/r^2</p>
<p>Arrange for v and you end up with v = root((GM)/r))</p>
<p>From there you can just stick numbers in and get the same answer as above</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to this equation (which i totally did not just take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave#Binaries" target="_blank">from wikipedia</a>) the decay time can be approximated by the following equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>t ≈ 12.8 <em>c</em>^5 <em>G</em>^-3 <em>r</em>^-3 (ma · mb)(ma + mb)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where <em>G</em> is Newtons constant, <em>r</em> is the distance, <em>c</em> is the speed of light and ma and mb are the masses of marble and bowling ball. Assuming that ma = 7.5 kg and mb = 1 · 10^-3 kg, this calculates as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>t ≈ 6 · 10^72 s</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which is ridiculously large, considering the age of the known universe is about 4 · 10^17 s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, orbital period as a function of orbital radius is only dependent on the density of the central body.  That means that orbital period as a function of orbital radius is the same for bodies of the same density.  So since geostationary orbit above the Earth (with orbital period of 24 hours) is at 6.6 Earth radii from Earth's center, it would be at 6.6 bowling ball radii from the center of the bowling ball if the bowling ball had the same density as the Earth (5.5 g/cm^(3)).  Assuming a 7.5 kg bowling ball, that density would be true if it had a radius of 6.9 cm.  So to make a 24 hour orbit, the marble would have to be at 6.6 * 6.9 = 45 cm away from the center of the bowling ball.</p></div>		</li>
