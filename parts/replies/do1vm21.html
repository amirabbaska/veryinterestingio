<p>employees, who I heard getting yelled at by a bunch of angry nerds the whole time I waited for my food.</p>

<p>How sad a person do you have to be to yell at someone making minimum wage because they don't have the <em>discontinued sauce</em> you saw in a cartoon?</p>
<p>Like at some point don't you kinda sit down and say &quot;What am I doing with my life?&quot;</p>
<p>The sad part is it's probably not even that great a sauce. I'm willing to bet you could sub in some orange chicken sauce from Panda Express and fucking <em>no one</em> would know. Hell it's probably the same stuff to begin with.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And yeah, part of the reason I didn't care about not getting any is I'm sure it's not great. I imagine it would have no spice and be really sweet and corn-syrup-based.</p></div>		</li>
