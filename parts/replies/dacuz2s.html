			<div class="markdown"><p>A decent portion of the Berlin Wall was in fact not a wall at all, but water-based fortifications within the Spree and Havel rivers. The thought horrifies me, but the Rio Grande could get a similar treatment -- buoys supporting many strands of razor wire, extending both above and below the water line. This would certainly interfere with wildlife, but not so much with water flow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the life in the Rio Grande, but the larger creatures that live nearby that rely on it for water. Javalinas, cougars, pronghorns, coyote, Mexican black bear, there are a number of large animals in the Big Bend area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>whats the largest animal that swims the rio grand?  if its just small aquatic life, they could do a series of holes designed to funnel life into them, but not big enough to let people through.  or some kind of fish ladder like they do in the ballard locks in seattle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd effectively be creating a filter which would gather anything larger than the holes and could cause clogging of the river which could lead to flooding.  Flooding in a hurricane prone area seems unintuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. The Colorado River delta has been dry for a while. It never reaches the ocean. The only reason it even reaches the Mexican border is because of water treaties, IIRC.  Between Las Vegas, Los Angeles and the southern California agri-business, they'd suck that thing dry if they could.</p></div>		</li>
