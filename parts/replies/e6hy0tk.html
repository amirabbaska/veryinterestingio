			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep and the second part does a good job describing basically how we interrupt most biological actions. The pathway generally has to be active and then we throw a wrench in there. Slow to act processes are a pain in the ass to target because of this, ie you want to do anything to a neuron that isn’t synaptic receptor related. Or how we traditional took care of cancers abuse this, most cells replicate slowly, so throw in something that stops a step in replication, or nuclear membrane formation, etc etc. with a drug that’s short lived for a short time period. Only the tumors are quickly going down these paths and get effected by the wrench and die off, unfortunately hair also grows quickly hence why hair starts falling.</p>
<p>Neutralizing antibodies, viral drug delivery, and some others things would be how to target more passive processes. Gross oversimplification but assume this works for the sub.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this similar to nerve damage? After 13 surgeries and hundreds stitches to my ankle and the top of my foot, I can still feel pressure a little, but it will itch. But if course I cant feel the scratching.  If it gets bad I use lidocaine to make it stop and most of the time it works. Are my nerves just suffering from multiple personality disorders?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading an ask Reddit or an eli5 talking about foot itches. The person would often times have to hunt around sometimes and scratch about 6in away from where the itch was felt to get relief. The conclusion was something like the nerves below our knees are kind of patchwork and don't necessarily report the proper location of stimuli. Not sure if that helps at all since you're probably a decent amount of nerve damage, but thought it was interesting. </p>
<p>Good luck with your foot! Try some CBD ointment, next best thing to lidocane and it doesn't smell like shit like all the other topical pain relief I've used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CBD ointment is great, let me explain why. Run a mile really fast, then sink down into a couch. It feels like your body is alive, warm, fuzzy, swarming with healing and peace. That's your endocannabinoid system becoming activated. CBD is essentially an external supplement for a lack of enough endocannabinoids.</p>
<p>Using CBD ointment on a part of your body makes that part of the body feel exactly like you do after sprinting. Ingesting or inhaling CBD makes your entire body feel like you just jogged several miles.</p>
<p>I have fibromyalgia. There are currently five pages on Google Scholar linking fibromyalgia to a chronic endocannabinoid deficiency, which makes too much sense. A major part of my struggles is neurological pain. It is all the difference between me sleeping it off and actually being able to get up and go to work. My grandpa is going through a very risky chemo process for cancer from Agent Orange use during his service in Vietnam. He uses it to get an appetite and feel better. </p>
<p>I just cannot suggest CBD enough to someone who suffers from anything from chronic discomfort to sharp pains. It's like a magical eraser. No, a warm fuzzy blanket that you can pull all the way up to your chin that eases away the pain of wherever it covers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Look up a map of dermatomes. Essentially your body has sensory field supplies by certain nerve roots from the spinal cord, hence the patch work.</p>
<p>Another phenomena that might be in effect are gate  interneurons. These are neurons that connect ot the main neurons going back to the spinal cord. If you stimulate them they'll inhibit the pain signals being sent by the neurons they touch. This is why if your rub around a wound it can bring relief.</p></div>		</li>
