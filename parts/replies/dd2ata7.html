			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this: this question is similar to &quot;Why does 60°F water feel colder than 60°F air?&quot;</p>
<p>It's because our bodies are constantly creating heat, and how our skin &quot;feels&quot; temperature is in no way indicative of what the <em>actual</em> temperature is.</p>
<p>When you &quot;feel&quot; the temperature, you're actually sensing how quickly the heat is either leaving your body or not leaving.</p>
<p>In air, the heat does not travel from/into your body as easy as it does in water. </p>
<p>Thus, in 60° water, the heat your body creates is quickly distributed away, meaning your body retains hardly any of that heat. </p>
<p>In 60° air, there is less &quot;stuff&quot; (particles) for the heat to propagate through so the heat leaves much slowly if not none at all. </p>
<p>So, your body in air is feeling &quot;Huh, the heat isn't leaving as fast&quot; and in water is going &quot;wow we're losing heat quickly&quot;, even though they are at the same temperature.  </p>
<p>100° air and water is a bad example. The water would actually be more uncomfortable, I'm not sure if you've been in 100° heat but if it's dry and you're not in direct sunlight, it's quite bearable. </p>
<p>A better example is 130°. This would be <em>very</em> uncomfortable and even dangerous as dry air. As water? Much much more dangerous and you would be probably yelling from pain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100 F vs 102 F is a greater difference than that between average core temp and and 100F. 104 F feels <em>very</em> comfortable to most experienced hot tub users. Especially if the water is balanced and isn't causing skin irritation.</p>
<p>At that temp though, it's advisable to get out in under 20 min. Industry says like 10 min but that's a big ole pile of CYA.</p></div>		</li>
