<p>Anyone saying that was genuinely insane to begin with.  Caffeine gives a 30-80% boost to performance for most people without anywhere near that level of a decrease in length of life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In moderation coffee is more or less fine of course, but i'm a little surprised you've never heard of any negative effects of excessive caffeine.</p>
<p>here's an anecdotal example <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2pz0ki/til_in_2010_dave_grohl_was_admitted_to_hospital/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/2pz0ki/til_in_2010_dave_grohl_was_admitted_to_hospital/</a></p>

Driving to the ice cream shop. Eating some banana ice cream. Or chocolate. I once had a chocolate banana. This as ice would be awesome. Like a big fat frozen chocolatized hollow ice cream filled banana. With hot caramel. Or strawberry. </p></div>		</li>
