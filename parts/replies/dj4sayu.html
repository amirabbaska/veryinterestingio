			<div class="markdown"><p>I followed the link to largest stars and have a follow up? How accurate is this data? Some stars have various estimates ranging from say 1500 to 700 solar radii. That is a big margin of variance. How accurate are these and how accurate are other estimates about stars?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a non-expert I cannot answer with authority, but as I understand it the standard &quot;main sequence&quot; models are treated as highly reliable because we have such an enormous data set of observations that verify the accuracy of that model.</p>
<p>Hopefully a subject matter expert will weigh in. In particular I wonder how changes in the assumed value of a single variable like the Hubble Constant would affect the calculations on that model.</p></div>		</li>
