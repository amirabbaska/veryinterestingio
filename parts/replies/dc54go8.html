			<div class="markdown"><p>HOLY SHIT the comments are really enlightening(kinda scary) if this is peoples understanding of Socialism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Capitalism is private ownership of the means of production.
Socialism is collective worker ownership of the means of production.
Communism is the hypothesized next stage of society that is moneyless, classless, and stateless. Socialism is viewed as a stepping stone to communism itself.</p>

<p>Sounds like co-ops. If the workers are also the owners, that means they collectively have decision making power with how the organization is run. What is an actual example of socialism where this happens?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Socialism is an economic system, the context of socialism is an entire society. Just because a company is a cooperative doesn't mean socialism. Is every family household in the world communist because the family owns everything in common? No. It's nonsensical and a useless application of the word.</p>
<p>Basically, an economic system is the sum of all economic activities and social relations within a society.</p>
<p>There is a Marxist argument that also shows why a cooperative isn't socialist, but its a bit complicated I think and requires its own ELI5. If you are still curious I would ask /r/communism101 or /r/socialism_101</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd say it's worth noting that you could have an anarchistic society that is also capitalist.  In theory. (This is assuming we treat the definition of anarchy as liberation from the state, rather than from any form of governing structure)</p></div>		</li>
