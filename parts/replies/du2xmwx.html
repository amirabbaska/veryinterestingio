			<div class="markdown"><p>The asteroid belt is so not-dense that when sending probes through it mission control doesn't even bother calculating a clear path. </p>
<p>The chances of hitting something are so low that it's a waste of time to worry about it.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow this got some traction. Some of you are requesting a source. </p>
<p>The &quot;not-dense&quot; part I think was answered in the comments from those of you who explained the density of matter. 4% of the moon's mass spread out over more than the orbit of Mars, with 30% of that being Ceres. </p>
<p>As for the mindset of Nasa when launching things, I think I originally learned this when reading up on Cassini last year when it finally got those awesome pictures of Saturn. <a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/news/2195/cassini-passes-through-asteroid-belt/" target="_blank">Comments from Nasa on Cassini going through the asteroid belt</a>. Apparently they do turn probes to look at stuff (as /u/kd7uiy has also mentioned in reference to Galileo) but they don't worry about hitting anything. According to <a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/New_Horizons_Crosses_The_Asteroid_Belt.html" target="_blank">this article</a> the odds of hitting an asteroid if you just randomly shoot a probe at the belt are 1/1,000,000,000. </p>
<p>Also, thx to whoever gilded this :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>Googling led to some interesting results such as <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/07/78/00/0778002e24c17fc4a6f594d7d3ddf632.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a> which seems to indicate two more asteroid fields at ha Jupiter's orbit passes through</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're standing on a random asteroid in the asteroid belt, the closest other asteroid to you, on average, is further than twice the distance from the earth to the moon. Cruising at 100 mph it would take you about 250 days to get to your closest asteroid neighbor.</p>
<p>Even that statement doesn't give scale well since the moon is further than most realize. If the earth was scaled down to the size of a basketball, the moon would be a tennis ball, and would be 24 feet away from the basketball.</p>
<p>Space is mostly just that - empty space. And we're talking about the steroid belt, which is so dense compared to everything else that it has a name. The rest of the solar system is even more empty, and interstellar or intergalactic space is even more empty than that. It's hard to comprehend just how big and empty the space between galaxies is</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And they're way smaller. </p>
<p>Twice the distance from the earth to the moon and the <em>biggest</em> ones are about 250 miles across (not counting Ceres, which is 500+ miles across). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keeping on with that analogy, if the Earth is a basketball, and the Moon is a tennis ball ~24' away, how small and far away is, let's say, Ceres, if they were at their closest points?</p></div>		</li>
