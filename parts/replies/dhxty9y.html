<p>One thing is that it can give you the correct scaling of many things without any actual calculations (which we sometimes might not be able to even do). For instance, we know that a volume of a three dimensional object grows like its linear dimensions to the power of three just from the fact that the unit of volume (meter cubed, say) can be derived by taking the third power of the unit of distance (meter).</p>
<p>Second thing is that it can give us an idea about what kind of effects are relevant to the problem at hand. For instance, here we were discussing the Planck length which turns out ot be 10^(-35) meters in SI units. Imagine we are dealing with a problem of quantum mechanics and we are wondering if we should start thinking about some weird corrections to our theory from the general relativity (remember, Planck length was derived by combining the gravitational constant with the Planck constant). Well, the chances are that whatever we are studying are <em>much</em> larger in size than 10^(-35) m which means that these effects would be completely irrelevant. For example, a typical size for an atom is 10^(-10) m which is much larger than the Planck length. This means that we don't need to think about any physical phenomena that involves gravitational constant in any form when considering atomic physics.</p>
<p>Third thing is that dimensional analysis can be used to check the correctness of calculations quickly. If you try to calculate how much time something should take and you get an an answer with units of kilogram, you know that you have made a mistake.</p></div>		</li>
