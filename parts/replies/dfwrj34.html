			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all curves can be approximated by Taylor Series. While it's common to assume that they can, especially in physics, a vast majority of curves cannot. However, you <em>can</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem" target="_blank">approximate any continuous function by polynomials</a>, they're just not Taylor polynomials. Notably, all the coefficients can change between two consecutive polynomials in this sequence, untrue for Taylor series. </p>
<p>Taylor series and Fourier series only work for only specific kinds of curves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Fourier series will work on any discrete set of points, but it will ring near discontinuities between defined points and it's not going to work well at all unless the points are equally spaced. </p>
<p>Chebyshev polynomials are probably a closer parallel to the Fourier series than Taylor polynomials but neither is well-suited for &quot;noisy&quot; curves. If you warp the points on the x axis from linear to sin, Chebyshev polynomials behave pretty much identically to the discrete cosine transform (if I recall correctly), which is basically a modified discrete Fourier Transform. It's a lot more interesting than I'm making this sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be fair to say that any curve you can draw (within reason) is analytic? There are a few exceptions, but realistically the counter examples I know of would need to be drawn very precisely to fail to be analytic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Stone-Weierstrass Theorem says that any continuous function (on a closed interval) can be <em>uniformly</em> approximated by polynomials. This means that if you thicken the graph of the continuous function by any fixed amount, then there is some polynomial that fits completely within this thickened line. Since any drawn line has a fixed thickness, there will be some polynomial that fits completely within the line. Polynomials are analytic. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just for completeness, that is actually the MacLaurin series, i.e., a Taylor expansion around 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you take a Taylor expansion around non-zero, expand each term, and collect like powers, then you can transform it to this form. Just call it a power series.</p>
<p>EDIT: yes there are issues with convergence. I glossed over that.</p></div>		</li>

I did a fair bit to get into my course, but haven't used it since I actually got in, and reading about it like this makes me nostalgic. I really want to take it up again sometime when my studies aren't driving me insane.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is very true, you are right. </p>
<p>Typically though you find the Taylor expansion on textbooks in the:</p>
<p>f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0) + ... + f^(n)/n!(x-x_0)^n </p>
<p>form, which is more intuitive in showing its meaning as a local neighborhood (around x_0) approximation. </p>

<p>While that works --- it's pretty inconvenient for making equations for real-life drawings like OP was asking for.</p>
<p>Using sin() and cos() is far more convenient. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't a result driven from the properties of curves that one can study. Try it from the opposite perspective. </p>
<p>Lets consider some curves. We know what a line is.</p>
<p>A parabola is a type of curve with a specific definition: the locus of points such that each point is equidistant from a fixed point and a line.</p>
<p>For conic sections in general you can approach them as different intersections of a plane and a cone.</p>
<p>Polynomials are very explicitly defined and show you the arithmetic steps to get from x to f(x).</p>
<p>Splines, bezier curves, trig functions, fractals, all our named and recognized kinds of curves have exacting properties that make them fit their label.</p>
<p>What is the probability that the random curve you sketched satisfies any of these criteria?</p>
<p>Now if you had some well-defined process behind making the curve, certain steps you followed, is that an identifiable kind of curve? That would be an interesting mathematical question. And if we didn't find a relationship between your curve and existing curves, and your curve had some significance, we would have to come up with a name for it and a way of referring to it.</p>
<p>It is the same situation for numbers: if you start writing a decimal point followed by random digits to infinity, what you end up with will almost certainly not be relatable to any identified, expressible number forms we have like &quot;2/3&quot; or &quot;sqrt(7)&quot; or &quot;log(3)&quot; or &quot;the largest solution to x^(5)+3x+1=0&quot;. Most numbers cannot be reduced to such forms. But if your number is of practical importance, we need a way to refer to it. That is how we end up with &quot;pi&quot; and &quot;e&quot; and even things like &quot;sqrt(7)&quot; which do not directly point to a place on the number line the way &quot;-4&quot; does, but are labels pointing to some process which identifies the number.</p>
<p>If the numbers side interests you, see the construction of the real numbers and transcendental numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although it is worth mentioning that e, pi and sqrt(7) do point to places on a number line. The function exp(x) or sqrt(x) are f(x) functions that would not point to a place on the number line. Very well thought out response tho, got my vote!</p></div>		</li>
