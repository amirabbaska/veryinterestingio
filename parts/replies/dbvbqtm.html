			<div class="markdown"><p>Try making a more delegate green tee correctly vs just microwaving it. There is a difference. Microwaving the water first and then using that (at the proper temp) is fine. Superheated water explosion is a risk then though.</p>
<p>I tried microwaving with the loose leaf green tea for a while and it always ended up more bitter than doing it right. I tried less time to no avail.</p></div>		</li>
