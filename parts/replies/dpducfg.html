			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, I’d heard about this, but reading it over again, I can’t help but wonder WHY 1970 doctors were so adamant that neurons didn’t grow, especially if it’s so obvious in hindsight as that article makes out - if regions of the brain have a constant turnover, I’d think it wouldn’t be too hard to have figured out.</p>
<p>My main suspicion is related to whatever method they were using to count or detect existing ones, but I’d be interested in the answer:</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In brief, adult neurogenesis went mostly undetected because there isn't a lot of it.</p>
<p>It's sort of what you said, that we didn't have the tools, but more to the point it's relatively rare, different than developmental neurogenesis which is what we would look for first, and deep inside the brain. (Hippocampus, some other regions. We do keep finding more, although even what we find underscores the limitations.) </p>
<p>Certainly it's nothing dramatically visible like skin healing or regenerating a nerve. So although looking back there's evidence, it waited for finer tools and more investigation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adult neurogenesis is primarily located in the hippocampus and SVZ regions which migrate towards the olfactory bulbs. Its well established now, but I imagine they were lacking the tools to identify and examine neurogenesis markers in the 1970s. </p>
<p>Even now, standard practice in mice models is to give them a nucleoside which dividing cells then incorporate into their dna for later detection using IHC methods. There are of course other markers like doublecortin which are signatures of immature neurons, but they do not necessarily represent newly generated neurons, could be that they stayed in their immature state. Point is, lack to technology and definitive markers makes it hard for a neuroscientist in the 70s to identify neurogenesis</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might want to read &quot;Behave&quot; by Robert Sapolsky.  He goes into great detail about why adult neurogenesis took so long to be accepted.  Unfortunately, the scientific establishment and dogma had a great deal to do with it.  The people who first conclusively demonstrated it were widely mocked.  The book is otherwise stellar as well, or I wouldn't recommend it :)</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are several (correlational) studies demonstrating a link between bipolar disorder and dementia, and ill provide more sources if you want. this one was just the quickest one I could fine. one moment for the next: </p></div>		</li>

<p>and this is one of the studies for dementia and sleep. this one got flung everywhere by the news. only 32 participants.
i've seen other studies claiming bipolar disorder and dementia are linked regardless of if the patient takes their medication and reduces manic episodes, but that seemed pretty bleak to me and I really hope that's not the case </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These tests were made only on mice. How would it translate to humans do you think? Is 6-7 hours of sleep insufficient, and how many days would qualify as extended period of sleep deprivation? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We’ve seen neural-genesis occur in humans.  </p>
<p>It’s part of the reason why they started regulating the use of Singulair so much more.  It was causing so much extra neuron growth that in those that didn’t end up using those neurons it was causing seizures.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply. It doesn't really answer what constitutes the limits for sleep deprivation in humans though, but my guess is that it can vary a lot between individuals anyway.</p></div>		</li>
