Mexico, Mexico, California, Indonesia, Papua new Guinea, Japan, New Zealand, Chile all 5.5+ within the last 6 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to take a sample of a radioactive material with a half life of say, 1,000,000 years, and tally counts of individual decays, you'd notice that some intervals of time have much more decays than average, and other intervals would have much less than average.</p>
<p>Without knowing the exact physics of mantle-crust interaction, which we don't, any tectonic activity is functionally random to us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same is true of all random events. If I flip an evenly balanced coin 10,000 times, there will be many strings of five or more consecutive results. This does not mean that the coin has memory and is replicating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a perfect analogy because each decay doesn't affect the rest whereas each earthquake relates to every other.</p>
<p>We're talking about normal cause and effect.
Not every second is random like quantum uncertainty. </p>
<p>In which case, OP is right, this is a period of unusually high activity EVEN FOR THE REGION</p></div>		</li>
