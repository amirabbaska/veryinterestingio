			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this. I think our idea of aliens is merely an imagined extrapolation of human evolution. After all, the idea that any extraterrestrial life form would have a humanoid structure is absurd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why is it absurd? Couldn't there be covergent evolution producing aliens similar to humans? We aren't exactly a totally random shape. All the other animal morphs failed to evolve intelligence similar to our own. I guess the counter argument to that point is that earth's conditions are unlikely to be similar to another planet capable of supporting life. I'm not so sure though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that ayyliens would probably be similar in size to us, or at least proportionately to their homeworld.</p>
<p>The reason why dinosaurs would've failed eventually is because they are too large, and thus began the evolution of much smaller creatures. This is why the surface area of our lungs and colons is so high, it's an increase in efficiency. Our limbs I would argue come from our environment, as aerobic land-based lifeforms we need to be able to move against gravity and manipulate objects.</p>
<p>It's likely that any other intelligent lifeform will probably also have hand-like structures to manipulate it's surroundings with, but the propulsion method will largely depend on their environment: we may meet fish men one day in the stars because their homeworld was an ocean planet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I do think that life is very much more liklely on similar planets like Earth. I don't see life being able to substain more than bacteria, if that, on planets and moons with a vastly different environment than on earth. The question is if apes are the only species to dominate these Earth like planets. Maybe on an ancient dinosaur planet that never got hit by metorite, natural selection would increase intelligence in some species to the point where they could be considered self conscious? Ocean planets with self consious fish?</p>
<p>I think this is cool as shit to think about. The universe is awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's not really a rational reason to even think they'd be solid, rather than liquid or gaseous entities. That's why I kind of liked how aliens were portrayed in that weak movie 'The Darkest Hour' - if only it were better on whole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Geez, that's a pessimistic time schedule.  We went from living in caves to walking on the moon and sending spacecraft out of the solar system in less than 20 thousand years.  I bet we will have sent a manned mission to one of the 12 or so stellar systems within 10 LYs in a thousand years or less.</p></div>		</li>
