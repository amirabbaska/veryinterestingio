			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually got my friend hooked on lard. SHe's Gluten/dairy free and had a baby who was allergic to *ahem*:<br />
Dairy, Olives/oil, Corn, Tree nuts, Peanuts, Gluten, Rice, avocado, Oatmeal and Soy.<br />
So she had to breastfeed but couldn't eat any of the following. We had them over of a meal and I had used lard to saute the veggies and bake the lemon chicken in. She panicked at first until she realized lard was just pork fat.  She was a tiny woman and she ate 3 plate full. She had been eating steamed veggies and steamed/boiled meat for months as she couldn't find a fat she could eat/cook with.   </p>
<p>She quickly started hitting her calorie intake after that! </p></div>		</li>

<p>From that to lard. God, I can almost see the look in her eyes on the first bite, and it's a beautiful image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once watched a cooking-show where they were making food for a restaurant, and they boiled lobster in butter. Like... just a big tub of butter.
That was the moment I understood why restaurant food is usually so unhealthy, but also so delicious.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, you're poaching it in what's called a &quot;beurre monté&quot;, which is basically just butter that's melted, but remains emulsified after it's had a little water added and whisked over heat. </p>
<p>Thomas Keller rests his steaks in it, apparently. Great for finishing vegetables too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YMMV.  I used to go to casino buffets when comped and eat nothing but crab legs and prime rib, just plates and plates of crab and beef for 2 hours (to be fair, the line for crab is long, so you have to be persistent, ha).  No sides.  I never put anything on the crab because I love the texture and taste and temperature.  People around me, who had maybe one or two leg segments, would just be drowning it in melted butter.  It is good, admittedly, but it is altogether different than the actual crab meat itself.  I much prefer the meat.  Nobody dips crawfish tails in anything and shrimp basically just cocktail sauce.  They are so delicious.  </p>
<p>I will concede that while I love raw oysters, it is basically a vehicle for lemon and horseradish.</p></div>		</li>
