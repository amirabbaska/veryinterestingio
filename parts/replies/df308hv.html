<p>Additionally a rock-solid 24 fps in a game, with a monitor refresh rate suitably matched, probably wouldn't be so bad. The problems really come when an average 24 fps comes with stutter and lag, and momentary dips well below that, and screen tearing because the monitor refresh rate doesn't match.</p>

<p>That's not true. I have a G-sync monitor and locked the framerate at 24 fps, it was awful and unplayable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a huge impact from input. Input is normally processed at the beginning of a game loop iteration. Frame swapping is normally done a the end. The lower the frame rate, the bigger the time lapse between those two.</p>
<p>If you're expecting something to move, you're a lot more likely to get annoyed by low frame rate, because it's not only about your eyes' &quot;capture rate&quot;, but your brain expectation of movement (which is most probably a lot faster).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. As long as the game's framerate is a factor of the monitor's framerate, it'll be fine. This is why SGIs used to run at 72Hz, because that allowed them to display 24Hz content without issues (72/3=24).</p>
<p>The problem is that a 60Hz monitor can only reliably display content at the following frame rates:</p>
<ul>
<li>60Hz (every frame)</li>
<li>30Hz (1 in 2 frames)</li>
<li>20Hz (1 in 3 frames)</li>
<li>15Hz (1 in 4 frames)</li>
<li>12Hz (1 in 5 frames)</li>
<li>10Hz (1 in 6 frames)</li>
<li>8.6Hz (1 in 7 frames)</li>
<li>7.5Hz (1 in 8 frames)</li>
<li>etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>So a game running at 20Hz is OK, a game running at 30Hz is OK. But a game can't actually run at 24Hz - instead it's constantly alternating between 20Hz and 30Hz. This gives a super-juddery effect.</p>
<p>tl'dr; it doesn't matter that much what frame-rate you pick, as long as you hit it consistently <em>and</em> your monitor runs at the same frame rate.</p></div>		</li>
