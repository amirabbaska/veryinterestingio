			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, the low frequency sounds are easier to cancel out (phase shift) as long as the noise is constant and non-fluctuating. Airplane noise, for example, is a continuous droning hum. Looking at a sine wave, you'd see a continuous and predictable high/low which can be duplicated and phase shifted 180 degrees.</p>
<p>Higher frequency noises on a plane (e.g., people talking, babies crying, someone closing the overhead bin) are short bursts, not continuous. So as /u/ViskerRatio stated, the time delay makes it hard to cancel out these noises. If they were continuous and the circuitry in the headphones was programmed for that frequency range, phase shifting could be achieved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you 100% sure about this? If so, moving your head slightly should greatly diminish the effect of the canceling. Isn't it just that you have to have a much more presise system to cancel out smaller waves, and the wavelength is much smaller on high frequencies? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wavelengths that we can hear are between 17 m and .017 m (17mm). The higher wavelengths are the lower frequency sounds. Sound also travels very quickly relative to normal head movements meaning that the wave that the computer predicts is going to be a pretty good fit.</p>
<p>ELI5 version: Moving your head will mess with the canceling wave but not enough under normal circumstances. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lower frequency sound wave lengths are vary long, on the order of meters and travel ~343m/s. You would have to move pretty freaking quick to cause a noticeable phase shift before the headphones could adjust.On top of that noise canceling struggles at higher frequencies already because of the reasons mentioned above so movement is only a small part of the much larger problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's quite possible you're right about the precise system needed to cancel out narrower sine waves. It's been quite a few years since I learned all of this in my early years in the military (over 20 years ago). I'm sure a lot is foggy in my old man brain.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I punch you in the face, then it will hurt. If I try to punch you in the face, but someone pushes back on my fist with an equal and opposite force, you'll never feel a thing.</p>
<p>This is an example using linear force, but the same principle applies to periodic phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The blue is what's going on outside, the red is what the active noise cancelling makes. If you add these together, you get a straight line. So you're not listening to a loud silence, you're listening to silence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like dropping a rock in a still pond. When it hits the water it will make ripples. Now if you drop two identical rocks at the same time into the pond, the ripples that collide will stop each other. </p>
<p>This is essentially what active noise cancellation is doing <em>before</em> the sound hits your ears. So while it is emitting sound, it never makes it to your eardrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're predictive that continuous noises will continue, which is why they're so nice for airplanes and use around noisy machinery like a generator, where they <em>are</em> making a continuous noise they can cancel. </p>
<p>More variable sounds like a someone speaking nearby, or very short sudden sounds like gunfire, will pass too quickly for the headphone to guess or cancel.</p></div>		</li>
