			<div class="markdown"><p>But in the chart/infographic they list &quot;hottest man-made temperature, created by the collision of lead ions in the LHC&quot;. So do two ions colliding in the LHC not have a temperature? Seems that at least they do in the sense that they certainly have an net kinetic energy, but not with respect to their average kinetic energy(?!?). I'm confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Individually you can't really measure their temperature but their kinetic energy. And you said this temperature was created by the collision, right? So it doesn't necessarily have to have been in the particles, but generated by the collision of the particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be worth noting that when particles are collided in an accelerator, it isn't one particle smacking into one other particle.  Rather, it's two clouds of particles passing one another going opposite directions, with many interactions occurring.  Maybe this is why they can assign a temperature in this case?  I honestly don't know though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of echoing the point that &quot;it makes no sense to talk about the temperature of a single particle in a vacuum&quot;.  Temperature is essentially a measure of the variance of velocities of all of the particles.  Something at a very high temperature would have some particles at rest, some moving very quickly away in one direction, some in the other direction, etc.</p>
<p>From a given reference point, you could have a vast sea of particles all moving with the same velocity.  This sea is at absolute zero, (from all reference frames).  If this sea were to slam into an object, they would scatter, and suddenly be at a very high temperature.</p>
<p>So, if all the energy in the universe were transferred to a single electron somehow, that electron would be likely moving very near the speed of light relative to where it was before being energized, but I'd argue it is still at absolute zero.  That is, until it hits that planet that we missed and transfers all of its kinetic energy to it.  Boom.</p></div>		</li>
