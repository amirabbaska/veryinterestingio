			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah don't listen to him. Some people do this. My dad does this all the time. But instead of a refreshing &quot;ahhh&quot; it's more of a grunt or like.. shit I don't know but it's weird. I guess think of a combination of the refreshing &quot;ahhh&quot; and the sound you make while lifting something heavy. We make fun of him all the time. As to why it happens, for most people, I'm assuming it's because you are holding your breath while drinking. For my dad, I have no fucking clue. </p></div>		</li>
