Intense alpha radiation has also been reported to having an optical effect (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatoli_Bugorski" target="_blank">Anatoli Bugorski</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that the sensation of heat may not be due to actual temperature increases, but rather due to your cells being bombarded by intense radiation and your nerves responding to that.</p>
<p>Given the amount of energy involved, it is more likely that it was a response by temperature/pain neurons than actual heat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I misspoke, they are similar but different. Alpha radiation is composed of helium nuclei (2 protons and 2 neutrons) whereas a proton beam is strictly protons. I would expect that the effects should be similar, but alpha radiation penetrates less deeply due to it's size. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One of the few to receive a lethal dose <em>in a lab environment,</em> and report on it in detail. Rather a lot of people received lethal doses on August 6 and 9, 1945.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also said to be reported by Chernobyl cleanup workers, although reliable documentation wasn't kept and it's hard to separate fact from rumor.</p>
<p>It's indeed hard to explain.  Cell die-off doesn't happen for hours, the byproducts of dying cells poisons the blood but you couldn't taste that right away.  Really it's probably only a small % of cells which are rendered broken by radiation but the consequences of losing pieces of the mesh of cells all over can cause massive breakdown.    </p>
<p>It's mysterious, that's for sure.  You could irradiate animals and see if there's immediate chemical changes in saliva, as a first step.  If not that, neurological testing on animals to figure out he origin of a metallic taste would get super-complicated.  But why.  The study would be expensive and hard to monetize the result into commercial value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Possible, but it's hard to imagine.  The taste persists after irradiation.  If it excited neurons, you'd expect to be able to feel it all over while being irradiated, for the most part, that doesn't happen.  Neurons for taste are much embedded deeper in the body relative to skin.  So you'd expect skin to be like 100x more sensitive to feeling it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slotin and other criticality accident victims were exposed to intense neutron radiation, which in addition to being ionizing would also transmute elements within their bodies by neutron capture. It's possible that this explains some of the symptoms they experienced.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently watched a few documentaries on Chernobyl, and one thing that was consistently reported among those radiation cleanup workers who were severely exposed was apparently a metallic taste in their mouths.  This was most likely due to their close proximity to the reactor core, which was emitting high amounts of radioactive iodine into the air.</p></div>		</li>
