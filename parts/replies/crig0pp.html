			<div class="markdown"><p>As a french i've never heard the term Oeuf used for 0. A google search after, and i still didn't find any clue, the french ever used the term that way even a long time ago. </p>
<p>And the only result i've found about the term oeuf in tennis are all from english sources. Not a single french one, is talking about the term oeuf being related to tennis.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey, just for future reference, looks like you got caught in another weird exception in English.
If you're from France, you're not a French, you're a Frenchman (but French is still the correct adjective to use for anything relating to France; French is an adjective, but not a noun). It's similar to how a citizen of England is called an Englishman. </p>
<p>Oh, and another set of exceptions. German is the noun for someone from Germany, and it is also the adjective for things relating to Germany. Same goes for Italy and Italian.</p>
<p>Spain has 'Spanish' as the adjective and 'Spaniard' for individual citizens.</p>
<p>Plural nouns for citizens of these countries are just the adjectives though (ie the French/the English/the Germans/the Spanish/the Italians). Hope this helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are a few examples of french words being corrupted and used in everyday english. mayday for example, used by pilots to mean they need help, comes from the french pilots who would say &quot;m'aidez!&quot; which literally translates to &quot;help me&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
