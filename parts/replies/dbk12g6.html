<p>might sound weird but: There is NO pink anywhere in ANY map. contrast wise you can obviously see the pink crosshair in the dark. you can also see it against snow, against a blue sky.   no matter what happens around you, the crosshair can always be clearly seen if its neon pink </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note how he said fine.  It's the contrast you're really worried about.  Honestly stick to what you are used to.  Or get ready to get used to a different color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's true green and pink are generally the &quot;best&quot; colors for cs because of how well they stand out and pink is really easy on the eyes, but please know changing colors of your cross hair will not make it easier to &quot;flick across the screen&quot;. I've seen many people use black and white crosshairs because they like it, my suggestion use your favorite color.</p></div>		</li>
