<p>The idea of an antenna is to convert free space electrical fields into measurable electrical signal. When you are working with rf frequencies it is easy to measure as a Ghz sampler can easily process the lower MHz signal.  </p>

<p>What? Since when did antennas need to produce a signal that can be sampled by a digital system? Sampling has nothing to do with antennas - all antennas need to do is convert an EM signal into a voltage signal on a wire, and vice versa.  </p>
<p>In communications sampling happens after the signal is downconverted to baseband (the spectrum is then centered around 0Hz instead of around the carrier frequency). Satellite communication systems do not sample a 30Ghz signal (as you said, analog-to-digital converters cannot sample that quickly). Instead: 1) The signal comes in through the antenna and is converted to a voltage signal, then 2) it is downconverted to baseband (by analog circuits) so its spectrum is centered at 0Hz, and then 3) it is sampled.</p></div>		</li>
