			<div class="markdown"><p>Coming from a neurobiological perspective, do these studies address the issue that up and down are very important biologically and our vestibular system is tied to that and very powerful as compared to left vs right, especially considering reference to each is culturally defined through language. It seems that the latter is implicitly addressed by what you wrote, but what about the former?</p>
<p>Edit: I know the vestibular system also responds to changes in the azimuth (left/right), but vertical orientation is particularly important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think the studies speak to up-down reversal except to point out that some reversals like &quot;p&quot; for &quot;b&quot; do sometimes happen, although rarely, in children. In the review paper, there is also a longer discussion of why up-down inverted text might be harder to read than text that has been doubly inverted (up-down and left-right) which would correspond to a 180 rotation in the image plane.</p>
<p>However, it is generally the case that we process upside down objects differently than rightside up ones, especially faces and biological motion. This leads to things like the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thatcher_effect" target="_blank">Thatcher Illusion</a>. This likely has to do with experience/exposure -- we have a lifetime of experience of seeing and processing upright faces and almost never do we see upside down faces. Whereas asymmetrical objects like a hammer we can see &quot;facing&quot; either direction with equal frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if you can answer this.  Left and right doesn't come completely naturally to me.  When someone tells me to turn left in my car I always have to think about it for a split second, if I don't there's probably a 50/50 shot I will actually turn left.  Why does left and right not come completely naturally to some people?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s gotta have something to do with gravity. It’s effecting up and down much more. We can feel up and down constantly. We feel weight being pulled down. Left and right are equally displaced in the field . Maybe that’s got something to do with it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that perhaps our natural understanding of the world we live in affects the way we see everything in our minds (Of course). Like how having no sense of up or down vs. side to side while deep in space can be disorienting. Were used to up and down being much more different than side to side. Gravity doesnt come into play when talking about compass direction, but people will confuse east and west far more than north and south. I accidentally say the wrong one often enough. I speculate that it could have something to do with how we draw these maps in our heads and that it would definitely be related to the response above. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm understanding your post correctly, you're talking about why we mix up mirror-reversed letters, but I don't see how that ties in to mixing up left and right as spacial concepts?</p>
<p>Can you clarify that connection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Letters are a common example because errors in telling apart left from right in the facing direction of letters have been known for a long time and because reading in general has been a topic of study of psychology for a very long time. </p>
<p>However, mixing up whether something is facing to the left or the right also occurs with symbols, letter-like strings, abstract drawings, and objects. It occurs in adults as well as children. It occurs in memory, when we try to reproduce what we've seen, in writing, and even in matching things that are visible. There are also certain priming effects that occur. </p>
<p>This is what I take OP meant by left and right: We mix up the labels &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; as they apply to objects because they are to a certain extent arbitrary. I don't recall all of the studies cited in the review paper, but I think there was a discussion of spatial reversal as well... some experiment where kids are shown some sort of town and asked about where a car was in the town or something like that and they put it on the wrong side of the street. We do not mix up left and right spatially in the sense that I look out at the world, there is an object to the left of me, but I experience it as being to the right. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in other words, we can innately apply &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; to spatial awareness (for the purposes of location), but not to item comprehension?</p></div>		</li>
