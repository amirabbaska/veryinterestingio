			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly correct.</p>
<p>Alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts alcohol to acetaldehyde.  Then acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) converts acetaldehyde to Acetate.</p>
<p>The reason people have different alcohol tolerances is due to different  levels of ALDH expression.  Asians have really low levels, hence Asian Flush Syndrome.   The acetaldehyde is what is responsible for  the hangover (as well as dehydration).</p>
<p>Fun fact, the treatment for methanol poisoning is actually alcohol.    So those tequila shots could save your life (under very specific situations).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be said the treatment for methanol poisoning is ethanol, but only because if your body is flooded with ethanol it dilutes the methanol enough so the methanol is converting the formic acid more slowly because it needs to convert the ethanol as well, so it doesnt build up quickly enough to hurt you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADH levels are not affected by frequent alcohol exposure. Instead, an alcoholic's increased tolerance is due to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10397283" target="_blank">MEOS</a>
(microsomal ethanol oxidizing system) pathway. It is essentially an overflow pathway that is utilized when the ADH pathway becomes overwhelmed. A frequent high intake of alcohol leads to an increased synthesis of MEOS enzymes and results in more efficient alcohol metabolism, while also increasing perceived tolerance.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>The moonshine and methanol link is widespread but largely apocryphal; the primary driver of complications from prohibition-era moonshine consumption was rooted in unscrupulous producers using automotive radiators and other unsafe materials in the condensers and other components used to distill the liquor, which caused a wide variety of contaminants (including heavy metals) to present themselves. The amount of methanol in even the foreshot of moonshine is not particularly toxic. Methanol poisoning with moonshine usually happened when consuming intentionally denatured alcohol.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeh, it converts from pectins.
Still it would be extremely difficult to produce dangerous amounts of methanol accidentely with distillation.
You have more risk drinking expired orange juice as the quantitys can be much greater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>from the wiki: &quot;Research shows that this is not the case and that methanol will be present until the very end of the distillation run. But the foreshot does typically contain small amounts of other undesirable compounds such as acetone and various aldehydes.&quot;  </p>
<p>Wonder why this is... bad still, too fast of heating? Because the temp that something evaporates is used in lots of different processes to separate materials on an industrial scale (fractional distillation).</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is entirely dependent on the substances involved. Using the boiling point as a sole indicator of when something will come off a still doesn't work, there is a lot of other chemistry involved. Azeotropes, polarity, etc.</p>
<p>Even good fractionating stills do not concentrate methanol excessively. This is primarily due to its polarity, and the fact that it doesn't form an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azeotrope_tables" target="_blank">azeotrope</a> with ethanol or water, it just sort of lingers around coming off at a relatively steady rate during a run. With a good reflux still (fractionating still) you will be making an azeotrope of water/ethanol, with no room for methanol.</p>
<p>Methanol is a non concern when it comes to distilling, except in extreme cases of industrial fruit brandy production where the tails are reused over and over again, building up methanol levels that way.</p></div>		</li>
