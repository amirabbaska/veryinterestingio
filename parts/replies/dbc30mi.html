			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a reasonable set of checks is:</p>
<p>1) has a classical limit under which it reduces to something including general relativity</p>
<p>2) is quantum consistent (very hard)</p>
<p>3) is &quot;useful&quot;: it allows for the exact calculation (in principle) of any scattering amplitude or in general observable using only a finite number of free parameters (unlike, say, a nonrenormalizable theory). </p>
<p>EDIT: I would add 4) reproduces known predictions of semiclassical gravity (such as Hawking radiation)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could you elaborate on what you mean with semiclassical gravity? I am briefly familiar with Hawking radiation and what it supposedly is and am currently finishing up a B.Sc. in physics/maths, if that helps with your answer! Thanks for very well written posts, btw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It needs to have the desired formal properties that we want out of a quantum gravity theory. Mainly, it needs to be finite (i.e. give finite answers for all proper questions), and it needs to reduce to general relativity in the classical limit. The main technical issue is with the finite part: that's where the direct quantization of GR fails, but string theory succeeds. Other approaches like Loop quantum gravity fails at the second one: they can't show that they have the correct classical limit. </p>
<p>String theory also has other properties that we want out of a quantum gravity theory, like holography, and the ability to count microstates for black holes and so on. There is also interesting newer works by Maldacena and others that seem to imply that string theory is the unique way that you can get consistent quantum gravity. </p></div>		</li>

<p>How general are the assumptions that go into a statement like that? As in, how general is X in &quot;the only framework of family X that gives consistent quantum gravity is string theory&quot; ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You already got very good answers. Just wanted to chime in with another qualitative feature that is to be expected from a theory of Quantum Gravity.</p>
<p>It is very likely that a theory of Quantum Gravity has to unify consistently all matter and forces. The hand-wavy argument for this is that gravity couples (interacts) with everything. It's not like electromagnetism that only couples to charged particles, for example. Any form of matter or field is a source of gravity and is affected by gravity. If you cook up a theory of Quantum Gravity that doesn't include all possible sources it's very likely the theory won't be consistent as you will miss contributing sources that will very likely be needed to obtain sensible results (no infinities, probabilities that equal 1, etc..).</p>
<p>String theory does that and is the only alternative that we know that does it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone that stopped following string theory a long time ago, I have a few questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have there been any empirical predictions confirmed by string theory that can't also be explained by the standard model and/or semi-classical gravity. I assume the answer is no, and if so will it always be possible to push the string scale up to higher and higher energies to never have to make predictions. I.e., <strong>can string theory be falsified</strong> in any way.</li>
<li>Has string theory finally been formulated in a background-free way, where it doesn't look like a gravitational perturbation atop special relativity?</li>
<li>Aside from the historical connections, does AdS/CFT really rest upon string theory and also does it relate to any realistic theories of nuclear physics/condensed matter/etc..</li>

<p>As I explained in my point 2), string theory is not a single hypothesis that makes predictions. It is an area of theoretical physics including &quot;theories&quot; (meaning: specific quantum systems), tools, and a mountain of math. You can (if you want) use string theory to create a large variety of phenomenological models in which you take one superstring theory, you sprinkle in a particular configuration (i.e. a compactification) and you get predictions for the resulting low energy effective theory.</p>
<p>Then everyone is responsible for <em>his</em> phenomenological model and whether it matches observations or not, not the whole of string theory.</p>
<p>This aside, we have no observations of phenomena beyond the SM except neutrino masses, and actually no observations of semiclassical gravity. There is literally almost nothing to work with. We have bounds on dark matter, proton decay, but at this point they don't exactly suggest that a particular overall course of action. We know gravity exists and QM exists, and that alone suggests we should try something stringy, but as of today, 2016, there is almost zero evidence for anything beyond the SM + GR.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>String theory is background-independent. The <em>perturbative expansion</em> of string theory requires a choice of background spacetime, but that is obvious, because the spacetime is part of the configuration of a gravitational theory and you base a perturbative series on a given vacuum. </p>
<blockquote>

</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, AdS/CFT is necessarily stringy. It is easy to show that nonperturbative effects in the CFT (such as anomalies) map to exclusively string-theorish corrections (such as D-branes) in the bulk. And for the second question, I don't know. I think it's too early for a definite answer to that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Maybe my question wasn't specific enough. Has there been a background-independent string theory of gravity + standard model put forth?</p></div>		</li>
