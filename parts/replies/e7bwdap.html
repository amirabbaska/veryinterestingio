<p>I had it really bad as a teen then spent a week at a summer camp, outside pretty much all day, and it was almost completely gone. Came back to its normal pizza-face level within a few weeks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The UV in sunlight puts a mild damper on the immune system, which is what hid the redness for a while. The acne comes back because the underlying skin irritation never went away.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You forgot gently exfoliating! Getting the dead skin and caked gunk out 1 or 2 times a week can really help clear up acne. source- multiple dermatologists.  </p>
<p>Also, salicylic acid like astringent after you wash your face, as well as regularly washing your pillow cases and towels. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you watch the movie Dune from David Lynch, there is a very close study of how to treat acne properly. Where it is red and inflamed and a bit yellow, you can dig at it with special tools, and enjoy the spurtings of the yellow pus juice. remember, when you get older all the oil and pus will disappear, so enjoy the spurtings while you are young.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh. I haven’t watched the movie but they have studied “digging” at comedones and even trying to extract out what is inside with needles and they say no improvement in acne using these methods. In fact they seem to cause more harm than good.</p></div>		</li>
