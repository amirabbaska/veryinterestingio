<p>Can you expand on this? I've heard numerous times that within the event horizon time and space switch roles but don't really know how to interpret that. Is that related to your quote?</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you look at the first diagram on this page, the singularity is given by the solid blue line.   This is a space-time diagram where light rays travel on 45 degree lines and time runs vertically.  </p>
<p>The statement that the singularity is at an &quot;instant in time&quot; is the statement that the singularity is space-like (i.e. the solid blue line is more horizontal than 45 degrees).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/eggn00dles this. I will also add somethings below, in case you are interested.</p>
<p>To take a few steps back I will say that general relativity is a &quot;metric theory of gravity&quot; that means that the dynamical field is an object which tells you how to measure &quot;distances&quot; on spacetime. </p>
<p>This &quot;distance&quot; isn't a spatial distance but the time between two events (given some path). In pre-relativity physics this would just be the  time difference between two points in time. If you know a little about special relativity though you know about time dilation and perhaps the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox" target="_blank">twin paradox</a>. General Relativity adds location dependence to the picture.</p>
<p>In Euclidean geometry we have that the distance between two points, expressed in terms of some Cartesian grid, is given by Pythagoras' theorem. If we are interested in the length of some general path we have to consider adding up the contributions from line segments that approximate the path in the limit as these line segments get infinitesimally small, i.e. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_integral" target="_blank">line integral</a>. The metric in this case is</p>
<p>ds^2 = dx^2 + dy^2 (+ dz^2 in 3 dimensions) </p>
<p>In special relativity everything occurs on a &quot;flat spacetime&quot;, which has the Minkowski metric, which we write like this, (up to an overall minus sign that is a matter of convention)</p>
<p>ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2</p>
<p>You will notice that the contribution from the time coordinate carries the opposite sign to that from the spatial coordinates. The Schwarzschild metric, in the Schwarzschild coordinates, is,</p>
<p>ds^2 = -(1-r_s/r)c^2 dt^2 + (1-r_s/r)^(-1)dr^2 (+ the metric on the surface of a sphere with radius r).</p>
<p>Here r_s is the Schwarzschild radius. I should also explain what the coordinates r and t mean. t is the time measured by an observer who has no angular motion and is firing rockets to maintain a constant distance to the black hole and r is the &quot;areal&quot; radius (area-l not a-real) which basically means that I was right to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>+ the metric on the surface of a sphere with radius r</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of interesting things to talk about with this metric and this coordinate system (the difference between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_metric#Singularities_and_black_holes" target="_blank">real and coordinate singularities</a>, asymptotic flatness etc.) but for your question the most important part is that for r&lt;r_s the sign in front of c^2 dt^2 and dr^2 switch, meaning that r becomes a time coordinate and t becomes a spatial coordinate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but I know something like that switching occurs. Once you cross the event horizon, all paths forward in time lead deeper in. That is to say, the only way to leave the event horizon would be to travel backwards in time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Time slows for you relative to an outside observer as you speed up or approach an event horizon.</p>
<p>At light speed and at the event horizon you appear to experience no time relative to an outside observer. For instance, if you had a magical spaceship that could go at light speed without destroying the nearby universe and tried to travel 1000 light years you would arrive at your destination instantly as far as you could tell but the 1000 years would have happened wherever you left from. If you were to travel at light speed you could travel infinite distances (and time) without a single second passing on your ship to an outside observer.</p>
<p>When you are inside of a black hole the space time structure is such that time is at best still unless you are moving and if you are moving all directions lead to the singularity.</p>
<p>Imagine for instance that time was reversed - all of everything would be blue-shifted and heading towards each other as space contracted until you reached the Big Bang at some inevitable point 13.7 billion years away. The only way you could avoid the Big Bang would be if you could go faster than light and escape to the distant places you &quot;see&quot; which is essentially time travel buying you time because as far as relativity is concerned the &quot;present&quot; in your FTL destination is the time it takes light to get to your starting point. The same is true in a black hole - the only way to escape the crunch is to go back in time via FTL.</p>
<p>That's basically how it's like in a black hole - all movement (which causes time dilation) would lead you to the Big Bang &quot;sooner.&quot;The &quot;universe&quot; would get permanently smaller every second and everything closer together with no way to &quot;escape&quot; the Big Bang unless you could travel to the future (or past for you in this scenario). So if you were to try to escape the Big Bang by traveling at light speed in any direction you'd basically hit it instantly from your perspective no matter what direction you traveled.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So then would it be true to say radiation from the big bang, hypothetically if it were something that could measure time, would believe the big bang happened an instant ago.. that is until that radiation is absorbed - or maybe reacts is a better word - with some other form of energy?</p>
<p>Regardless, this analogy gives more meaning to me that time and space are indeed relative. I wonder why we talk as if space is real at all. Seems to me it is merely a means to describe electromagnetic reactions. And, eliminating &quot;space&quot; as something real might open up possibilities as to explain entanglement.</p></div>		</li>
