			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel I have to point out that flies don't land on you and wait to see if you move to determine if you're dead. House flies lay eggs on basically any rotting organic matter, and they know when it's rotting. They don't check for a pulse.</p>
<p>They detect the gases given off by rotting organic matter. Also landing on some rotten fruit or some dung is just as much like winning the jackpot for a house fly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are looking for both food and also somewhere to lay their eggs. They will lay hundreds of eggs which will hatch to maggots and a decent sized dead animal will support thousands of them which will have a good chance to hatch as full sized very healthy offspring.</p>
<p>Flies breeding strategy is the opposite of humans - have as many offspring as possible and invest no effort in their survival which costs the parent. The upside of that strategy is that there are always flies round when something dies and becomes available as a food source. the downside is that they spend a lot of time buzzing actual living animals essentially waiting for them to die.</p>
<p>Of course there are multiple different species and habitats - they don't all live off dead creatures, but if you ever find a dead animal in nature it will almost certainly already have maggots on it. It's a very effective strategy in darwinian terms.</p></div>		</li>
