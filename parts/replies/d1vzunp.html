			<div class="markdown"><p>About a week...Most common way to learn these days is called an AFF(Accelerated FreeFall) course. You normally spend 6 or 8hrs doing you First jump course on the first day. You learn how the equipment works, how to exit the aircraft, the position your body should be in for a stable freefall, some signals your instructor will use to assist you to get things right with you body position and prompt you if you forget what to do, how to deploy your parachute, how to recognise if your parachute has opened correctly and if not what you need to do to try to 'fix' if it is fixable, and if not how to commence your emergency procedures to release your main parachute and deploy your reserve parachute. Also teaches you how to fly your parachute, fly a landing pattern same as pilot would(downwind then cross wind(base) then into wind for landing and then to flare your parachute to generate lift for a nice soft landing. You are also taught about many different problems, unusual circumstances that may crop up and a plan to deal with these. The idea behind it is to already have a good plan in place to deal with things if they go 'wrong' rather than having to try to think something up on the spot in a possibly already high stress situation. You also practice on the ground exiting the plane and the correct body position and jump sequence you will perform in freefall on your first jump. A written exam is also done at the end of the ground training. Gives you confidence you know what you need to know and that your instructor has taught you everything required. Your instructor will go through it with you and go over anything which is incorrect or not clear for you. Your first jump may be done as a training tandem. Quite common these days. It not only makes it less stressful for a 'first jump' but you also have the advantage of being able to fly and land the parachute with someone experienced to assist you in learning the correct things to look for and how to fly a good pattern and landing. Obviously most injuries happen during landing so this also lowers risk for the drop zone to be able to teach good canopy control on your first jump.
Normally your first 3 or 4 AFF stages you exit the plane with 2 instructors holding onto you for the entire freefall. You have a sequence of things to do such as altitude checks, practice touches of your pilot chute handle, etc. If you forget something or your body position is not optimal your instructors will give you signals to help you get thing right. If you don't open your canopy by the correct altitude your instructors will deploy it for you. Once your canopy is open you will do certain visual checks to see if it is good. If it looks good you will then do certain control checks to ensure it is as good as it looks. Usually you will have a 2way radio which your instructor will give you directions from the ground to help you fly and land your canopy. Around AFF 4 one instructor will release you and if your body position is good the other will also release and you fly on your own. The instructors will stay close to assist and give signals as required. Next level you will have one instructor exiting with you linked. When it looks good he will release you and stay close while you fly on your own. Next stage you will be doing unlinked exits, 360 degree turns and moving forward. Next couple of stages is different plane exits(diving), backloops, barrel rolls, front loops and tracking(high speed forward movement). Your last stage is usually a hop and pop(lower altitude exit and then deploying stable within approx 5 secs. This helps to familiarise you with low jumps and quick deployments for fun or maybe required in an aircraft emergency. Generally the whole course is around 8 or 9 jumps(plus repeats if you don't complete the skill requirements of a jump) and then you are able to do solos. Once you have around 20-25 jumps total you can qualify for your first licence. Minor differences around the world with AFF but generally that is what you are looking at. If your interested(send me your email)and I would be happy to send you a copy of an AFF video I edited for one of my students a couple of yrs ago. Will give you a general idea of what to expect learning to skydive. Skydiving is not physically difficult, but learning is definitely a 'headfuck' for most people but very rewarding if you persevere and get past that.</p></div>		</li>
