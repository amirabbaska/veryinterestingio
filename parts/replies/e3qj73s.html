			<div class="markdown"><p>You're basically right but instead of &quot;most of the US&quot; it's more like the eastern half. The western half has similar patterns with a dry season and yearly firesâ€”<a href="https://fsapps.nwcg.gov/" target="_blank">here's a map of current fire incidents all over this area.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. I couldn't believe it when I was stationed in Virginia. It would be sunny in the morning then pouring rain in the afternoon and it happened all year. Here in CA we know when its coming and it usually last a couple weeks then that's about it for the year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Santa Barbara, and when the Thomas fire started there was really not much concern here. Then one night the Santa Anas started blowing with 70 mph gusts and suddenly the fire went almost all the way from Ventura to Carpenteria, burning about an acre per second for about 9 hours. Those winds are no joke.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Growing up I'd see summer rainshowers in movies, and assumed it was just some over-the-top movie drama, because everyone knows it never rains in the summer. Especially not a big downpour</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise when I spent a summer in NY state</p></div>		</li>
