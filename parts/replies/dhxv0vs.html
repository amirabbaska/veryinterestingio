			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what I thought, but it feels like something is missing.  If you have an object on a 3 axis gimbal, and rotate it about x, it should feel a centrifugal force out from that axis.  Rotation about Y or Z should not change that.  So, if you spin about all 3, even if the net rotation is zero, or one direction, or whatever, shouldn't the centrifugal force still exist?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would you rotate a rigid body about two (let alone three) perpendicular axes? Imagine a globe spinning about the X-axis, and then you give it a smack in the positive X direction, so as to spin about the Y-axis. The globe wouldn't be spinning about both axes simultaneously. It would be spinning about a new axis of rotation somewhere between the X and Y axes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will exist sure.  For each of whatever three axes about which you have established nonzero rotation there will be a centripetal/centrifugal forces relative to those axes.</p>
<p>It's just that it's not physically possible to set up a rotation that will make the <em>magnitude</em> of those relative forces <em>equal</em> in all three of your chosen orthogonal axes simultaneously.  So if you average the vectors of those three forces, it will point it some particular direction.  And if you adjust your coordinate system to make <em>that</em> direction one of your axes, you'll find that your net force in both of your other axes orthogonal to <em>that</em> axis equals zero.</p></div>		</li>
