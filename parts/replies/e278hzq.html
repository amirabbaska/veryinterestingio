<p>Experiments where someone's vision is completely obscured show that after 3 days, the areas of the brain responsible for vision are already being used for non-visual tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So is there some truth to the “losing a sense makes your others stronger” thing?  what other tasks take over the vision center, and is it always the same ones in different people or is it just a land grab in your brain?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anecdotal evidence, but I have a friend who went from &quot;Coke bottle glasses&quot; to &quot;black glasses and cane&quot; over the course of a few years. I asked him once if this was actually a thing, and he said that only his sense of smell had gotten stronger, which sucked because you never realized just how many things smell like poop. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I experienced not having vision for a couple of days after a surgery (my face was too swollen to have my eyes opened) and I definitely experienced elevated hearing and feel. I didn't hear things further away but I could differentiate between several sounds simultaneously and perceive all of them without too much effort.
I felt like Daredevil strapped to a hospital bed.</p></div>		</li>
