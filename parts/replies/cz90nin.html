<p>The most stable radioactive isotopes are technetium-98 with a half-life of 4.2 million years (Ma), technetium-97 (half-life: 2.6 Ma) and technetium-99 (half-life: 211,000 years).</p>

<p>That <em>sounds</em> fairly stable to me. 4.2 million years is a long time. Every other element up to promethium is totally stable then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider that Uranium is regarded as radioactive (or unstable). The most common isotope (U-238) on Earth has a half-life of 1.4 billion years. For Tc-98, the amount today on Earth compared to 4.2 billion years is 1/2^1000, which means that nearly all the Te from the creation of the solar system has been lost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still have Tc-99m with a half-life of 6 hours. It's used in nuclear medicine. It's not that <em>all</em> Tc isotopes are slow emitting, it's that most are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>4.2 million years is definitely long, but a small piece of technetium will contain about 10^24 atoms. That's a million million million million atoms, so it will be emitting quite a bit of radiation.</p>
<p>Also, the Earth is really old, so even a half life of 4.2 million years will mean barely an atom will be left anymore</p></div>		</li>
