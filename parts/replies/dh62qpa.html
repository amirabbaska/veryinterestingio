			<div class="markdown"><p>They do have white meat, and it is actually sorta close to fish, but not flaky or segmented. This is probably due to the fact that they evolved from lizards geologically recently, and have not evolved any major differences in their muscles, while fish still have the ancestral state of their musculature (which is in fact ancestral to all vertebrates).</p></div>		</li>
