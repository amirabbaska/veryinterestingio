			<div class="markdown"><p>Ionization is usually independent of the triple point because that is dependent on the chemical or nuclear properties of the gas while the triple point is usually a feature of the states of matter which is about how molecules interact with each other. Though as you ionize you will likely change the nature of your system which means that what was the triple point for the unionized system is no longer the triple point for the new system. </p>
<p>Keep in mind ions are completely different chemical species from their unionized counterparts.   Both in their chemical and physical properties. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For example if you look at density vs temperature there is actually a large coexistance region. In those plots it is the area below the black curves. The area to the left and right at the pure liquid and pure gas regions.  Anywhere above the top of the curve is the super-critical region. What this usually implies is that if the volume of the system is fixed, at the coexistance point the ratio of gas to liquid is dependent on the volume of the whole system.  Or if a constant pressure is maintained that the density of the system will change with the relative ratio of the gas to liquid at equilibrium. </p>
<p>Pressure vs Temperature is usually sharp for single component systems, but for multi-component or non-standard phases it is not uncommon for the coexistance region to be a fairly large area.</p></div>		</li>
