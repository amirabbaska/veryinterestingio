<p>Correspondingly, measurement causes the state of your system to change (&quot;collapse&quot;) to an eigenvector of this operator whose eigenvalue is the measurement outcome.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it sounds like eigenvectors/values correspond to real, concrete state that we can observe, while the normal equation corresponds to the period before the function collapses?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>minor point, but it should be noted that states (wavefunctions) are not observable. only their absolute value squared is observable, and this quantity represents the real probability of that state being present ( =1 for a closed system )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ALL vectors correspond to a state. The eigenvectors are states that don't change (the prefix eigen- is German for same). The equation is just finding out what happens after t time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Err, no, it isn't. &quot;Eigen&quot; means &quot;own&quot; or, perhaps, &quot;proper&quot;. I'm not sure about the etymology of this term, but it wouldn't be surprising if it had something to do with eigenvalues being the elements in the diagonal form of the operator matrix, as those are really proper to this particular operator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So this means an eigenvector is a type of quantum state that is more stable/predictable than others? </p>
<p>Not sure if I got it. Never made it very far into Quantum mechanics as that is the subject that caused me to switch majors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eigenvalues are the only values that measurements will take. For instance, the eignevalues of the energy operator (the &quot;Hamiltonian&quot;) of an electron in an atom are the specific energy levels of the allowed orbitals (the eignvectors in this case). The electron may be in a combination of these orbitals states (a &quot;superposition&quot;) but a measurement of its energy will collapse the electron wavefunction to one of the orbitals and yield the corresponding eigenvalue for the measurement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's what I thought.  Thanks!!</p>
<p>Aren't the allowed orbitals also to do with the mathematical wave forms that don't cancel each other out with destructive interference?</p>
<p>So does that mean the eigenvalues correspond to the frequencies of waveforms that won't cancel themselves out?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really appreciate you helping me understand this!</p>
<p>I  have one more question
When the previous poster mentioned &quot;any observable quantity&quot; in a close quantum system corresponds to this principle, does that include things like, say, the number of quarks, etc?</p></div>		</li>
