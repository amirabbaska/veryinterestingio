<p>if you have access to distilled water the reasoning about polluted ground water doesn't make any sense</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to start with distilled water. The freezing point of really salty water tends to be ~0F regardless of whatever other crap is in the water. That's one of the key benefits of having 0F be the brine freezing temperature. It was a very cold temperature that was easy to reliably reproduce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 12s (dozen, inches in a foot) are because this number has the most number of factors,  making it easy to divide. You get the factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Whereas when counting in 10s you only get 4 factors,  1,2,5,10.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's easier to share buns between 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 people if you bake in dozens.
It's easier to measure 1/2, 1/3, 1/4... units than in decimal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a fairly strong argument to replace the entire decimal system with base 12 for this reason, although I can't see that happening any time soon.  It would be quite funny if feet were abandoned in favour of metres only for decimalisation itself to be ditched further down the line.</p></div>		</li>
