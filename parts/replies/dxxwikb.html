			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition turbos generally are more fuel efficient (from what I've heard) although because they need the exhaust to spool the turbine they don't generate power in the lower rpm range but more in high rpm AKA turbo lag.</p>
<p>Because a supercharger is connected to the engine it uses more gas (again from what I've heard) but since it doesn't need to exhaust to generate power it provides consistent power no matter the rpm. Unless your sitting right around idle obviously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In their F1 car Mercedes is using an electric motor/generator on the shaft connecting the hot and cold side of the turbo. This allows them to spool the turbo up, when exiting a corner and generating energy when the turbo would produce more boost than needed. When the turbo is driven by the motor, it acts more like a super charger, when there is enough exhaust there it acts like a normal turbo. It's combining the best of both worlds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking yes, you're correct. Superchargers are spun by a belt connected to the engine (similar to an alternator, power steering pump, air conditioning). So while there is <em>some</em> parasitic loss from this, it is essentially negligible. There are two types of superchargers currently, centrifugal and roots or screw type. Generally speaking, with a roots/screw type supercharger, boost generated is not controllable. You can get smaller pulleys which in turn will spin the supercharger faster but you'll still be generating the same boost pressures throughout the RPM range. A centrifugal SC works closer to a turbo, but is still belt driven vs exhaust driven.<br />
Turbos are fed by the exhaust which spins a blade and sucks air in. There are a couple popular types but I'll just touch on the single scroll and twin scroll types. Turbo lag is more prominent when you have a larger turbo than the engine can turn efficiently. This is a bigger problem with single scroll turbos. To combat turbo lag, the option of twin scroll is available. It divides the exhaust side into two chambers, one small and one large. This allows the turbo to spool quicker at lower RPM (through the smaller chamber) but maintain boost at higher RPM. Using a smaller turbo to &quot;feed&quot; a larger turbo is also an option but can get complicated to run at maximum efficiency. It should be noted that twin scroll designs tend to be more expensive than single scroll turbos. Turbos have the added benefit of being easier to control the boost levels via wastegates and blowoff valves that are typically absent on SC cars.<br />
Anecdotally, from cars I've driven with both a turbo and a SC, the turbo is the better option. I feel like SC aren't really good at the top of the power band, whereas turbos generally excel there.<br />
Sorry, this is much longer than anticipated.   </p>

<p>Not necessarily. The Chrysler Hellcat's supercharger requires about 80 hp just to spin the blower. 15-20% isn't &quot;negligable&quot;, in my opinion. The motor by itself makes about 450 hp with nothing attached, minus the 80 hp required to run the blower, which then pumps enough air into the engine to result in a net 707 crank hp with the supercharger. A supercharger is going to consume a lot more power than all of the other accessories on a car put together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has figured out how to put a gearbox on a supercharger yet, mainly because contrary to what you've said the parasitic power loss is anything but negligible. Of course you get more power out than you waste turning the supercharger, but it is absolutely not negligible. </p>
<p>A turbo can easily regulate pressure using the wastegate. As all the energy driving it is wasted energy it is no real loss to generate boost pressure just to bleed it off. Because of how the exhaust turbine works you can control the speed/boost pressure by releasing exhaust pressure before the turbine, wastegate.</p>
<p>A supercharger can not regulate pressure since we are missing that gearbox. It makes a set amount of air volume at idle RPM, and it makes a fixed volume at redline RPM and nothing can change that. You can run a supercharger that is too large and open a diverter valve to bleed off boost pressure where it would harm the engine, but since it takes engine power to run that boost you don't want to just bleed it off. You will likely make less power with the supercharger than without, depending on how much pressure you are bleeding. </p>
<p>Without this going on forever, all this means a turbocharged car is able to regulate boost pressure to the physical limits of the engine across a larger RPM range, and that is area under the curve and what makes a car really fast...</p>
<p>A supercharger with a tunable CVT would be hella dope. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Having owned a turbo Miata  (around 220hp) and now driving a supercharged F-Type (380 hp), the Miata felt faster because the powerband was so top-heavy.  The F-Type is actually faster (only by a small margin because it also weighs a half ton more), but it doesn't feel at fast because the power delivery is so much smoother.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To expand on this, it's not the compression itself, it's the fact that more oxygen molecules are crammed into the cylinder which allows more fuel to be injected while maintaining the correct stochiometric ratio for optimal combustion. More fuel = more powerful explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For this reason, forced induction engines (turbo &amp; supercharged) will often run a lower cylinder compression than 'normal'. The increased mass of air/fuel makes up for it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it's too much pressure (and probably too much power), you need really strong internals. Imagine a NA engine running a high (gas) compression ratio like 11.5:1 compared to a 10psi boosted engine running a lower comp ratio like 8.5:1</p>
<p>The NA high compression engine is compressing the gas fuel mixture to roughly 166.75psi (14.5 x 11.5)</p>
<p>The boosted low compression engine is compressing the gas fuel mixture to roughly 208.25pdi (24.5 x 8.5)</p>
<p>A high boost engine (1bar for example) mixed with high compression ratio like 11.5 gives 333.5psi (29 x 11.5)</p>
<p>This is a problem both with too much pressure which can retard the power of the engine and bend rods, or just knock horribly, but it's also a lot of power that requires strong pistons, rods, cranks, and cylinders (or cylinder liners).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How all the molecules balance out at the end so you don't have left overs being wasted.<br />
In this case if the wrong ratios are used you could have excess gas not being fully combusted or too much oxygen due to not enough gas.</p>
<p>Essentially making sure 1+1=2 instead of 1+2=2.   </p>
<p>Slightly more complicated: H2O would be 2H's + 1 O to make H2O.  If you had 4H's and 1 O you would still get 1H20 with 2H's leftover.  </p>
