			<div class="markdown"><p>To add, since a virus is not a living organism is is not right to call it “dead.” The vaccines contain bits of the virus that has been altered or damaged to the point that the body will recognize it as a threat but not have any harm done to it.</p>
<p>The body then remembers this shape or virus to be able to combat it in the future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well viruses are in this weird gray area where it's debatable to say whether it's a living organism or not. It only begins to behave like a living organism as soon as it infects a living cell. Viruses have made us question what the definition of life really is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, it is. Generally, you get the two most prevalent strains from the opposite hemisphere's last flu season, and one or two high risk strains.</p>
<p>This is the most pertinent text from a quick google.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The composition of trivalent virus vaccinesfor use in the 2016–2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza season recommended by the World Health Organization on February 25, 2016 was: an A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm09-like virus. an A/Hong Kong/4801/2014 (H3N2)-like virus. a B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus.</p>

<p>EDIT:  I see some better explanations down below, but I'll leave this anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But not just that. Each subsequent flu shot continually builds on itself. So by the time you’re say 25, if you’ve gotten a flu shot every year, will have a tremendously stronger immunity than someone of the same age who has never gotten a flu shot.</p>
<p>This Is assuming neither of them have some other condition </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've gotten the flu every year for the past 7 years. Does this contribute to my future immunity to the same degree as if I had gotten the flu shot and not gotten sick?</p>
<p>Edit to add: I'm getting the flu shot next year because as an otherwise healthy 22 year old it's not great that I developed pneumonia from the flu the past 2 years</p></div>		</li>
