			<div class="markdown"><p>I live about 20 miles away from southern Ontario (not that birds care about national borders) and our winters here in Western NY can be brutal. At the back of my property is a retention pond that'll usually freeze over by January. There are usually Canada Geese out there flapping around until the pond is frozen solid. I used to be happy when winter would come and they would stop crapping everywhere. Now they never leave!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a border collie when I was young.  Used to run him in the park near where I lived, first time I came across a park ranger and he was like, &quot;You can't run your dog off leash he....&quot;</p>
<p>Just as he hit full stride into a flock of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind.  He's welcome off leash anytime.&quot;</p>
<p>I kept my side of the park clear for the 4 years I lived there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I know your pain i live in alaska and I used to be so happy when the geese would leave. Not anymore there is a run off pond not far behind my house that manages to stay liquid and warm on one side most of the year the geese haven't left since that was built. I want to just go purge thier numbers and be done with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true of many bird species, not just geese. Sticking with geese though, In the winter, in much of the temperate latitudes of North America, you not only have the resident subsecies of Canada Goose, but you also have its various migratory subspecies coming down from Canada and the Arctic swelling the ranks. In certain areas, there's also Cackling Geese (recently split from Canada Goose), Snow Geese, Greater White-fronted Geese and Brants. In the US at least, there are actually many many more geese in the winter than there are in the summer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really cool info. </p>
<p>How do the golden-winged warblers remember where to go year after year? Do they have a lifespan greater than a year so that they are always 'led' by birds that can remember from the previous winter, or are they led by purely biological instinct and environmental factors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know the maximum seen age for common warblers is 10 years. So i say it would be pretty unusual and tragic for a bird not to live over a year. They wouldnt even had a chance to breed. Less then a year would be like childhood mortality.</p>
<p>I know it happens alot, its just they wouldnt contribute to the gene pool.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the vast majority of birds do not live a full year. Many die before leaving the nest, the young that do leave are relatively easy prey, and many inexperienced young die in migration. Once a bird has lived through a successful year, however, mortality drops and they can then live for many years.</p>
<p>How birds find their way in migration is a topic of major current research interest, and it's complicated.  Check out The Homing Instinct by Bernd Heinrich. It's written for popular consumption and is very thoughtful, entertaining, and accessible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't study the golden winged warbler but I have worked with them in the past as a lab assistant. Currently I'm working with prothonotary warblers which are really similar but much prettier. I don't study migratory behaviors but before this project I had to read EVERYTHING about them because it's an independent study for my undergrad and I had to find a research topic and the easiest way to do that is to read every thing you can find on them. They live to be about 10 as someone else pointed out. </p>
<p>Migratory patterns are thought to be partially learned but also partially instinct. In order to migrate you have to have reason to, and recognize that reason, and know where to go to escape that. Some animals, like elephants, take different routes every year (they're escaping the fire season in the savanna) whereas caribou take the exact same route every year (they're looking for food and better climates). Birds are a bit trickier because it's expensive to put GPS on them and they fly, obviously. There's also a range in how set each species migration pattern is. It's thought that they follow others, but they do not live in large families, instead they nest near each other but they don't really flock like geese. The offspring might follow the parents to some degree, unfortunately, we don't really know where the offspring go once they fledge. Like I said, I've mostly worked with prothonotaries, and we have enough trouble catching and banding the parents in the first place. So to summarize, no ones really sure, but it's probably part instinct and part just following other birds and remembering. I'll check my notes tomorrow and if I find anything I'll update this comment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've encountered some Canada geese in the tundra before, they are a bit smaller looking and make a bit different sound, and will fly away if you get within 50m of them. If only they'd spread their ways further south. </p></div>		</li>
