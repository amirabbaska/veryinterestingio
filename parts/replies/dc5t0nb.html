<p>Countless potential ways, unless you assume that the causes of mental disease are 100% biological/genetic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure thing - stress of studying is hard to cope with when there are additional mental health troubles. But also, I'm a science PhD student with serious mental health issues, and my professors told me that mental health issues are quite prevalent in the field. The tendency to think deeply about things is a necessity in academia, but is also a contributing factor in mental health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Discrimination against disabled people is prevelant in education. Lots of people are forced to drop out because schools will not help as they're required to. <a href="http://www.houstonchronicle.com/denied/6/" target="_blank">And there's places that deliberately cut funding for special ed and individual education plans, deliberately cap the number of students who can have services.</a> Lots of schools will not help as they're required unless you can document an impairment, which means that people without access to long-term healthcare don't have those documents, and so can't get services, and so can't get the help they need. Conditions that do have one-time tests, those are expensive even if you do have healthcare. Even when schools do say they'll give you services, it's always a fight, and they'll deliberately try to screw you over to get you to drop out because they don't want you on their campus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm reading through this more, trying to separate income and education. But this is something they couple together. The bottom line is: Higher Education =&gt; More $ &amp;  More social support(via connections via education) =&gt; better mental health</p>
<p>It's tricky, as /u/holaemailer states, there are certainly many special cases for this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think u/thatserver was also referring to the socioeconomic status under which subjects were raised prior to attending college, given that people from healthier socioeconomic backgrounds are much more likely to go to college to begin with. It makes sense that being raised amid healthy socioeconomic conditions would lead to better mental health regardless of the level of education that follows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stats major here. There's always special cases in any situation. The important factor is the special cases probability. Peer reviewed studies have to take this into account. That's where you get statements like &quot;blah blah blah is between such and such percent.&quot; This range is more or less calculated from the potential for special cases when looking at the global system based on the data from the study. </p>
<p>There are other ways special cases can be taken into account. For example they can test the data based on what amount of accuracy they want. Example: blah blah blah with 99.3 percent accuracy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You always see this reply to any cohort study, particularly in sociology and psychology. And for some reason, it's always the highest voted reply. </p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, any concern a lay person has about a scientific study would have been raised by at least one of a peer review group. So yes, either SES is controlled for or the authors have a damn good reason not to. Otherwise it wouldn't have passed peer review, it wouldn't have been published, and you wouldn't have read it.</p></div>		</li>
