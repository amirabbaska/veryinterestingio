			<div class="markdown"><p>When I say high dose I really just mean the therapeutic dose for ibuprofen to achieve antiplatelet and how it’s high relative to aspirin. To achieve that activity you’re taking around 200 mg of ibuprofen every 4-6 hours whereas you’re only taking 81 mg of aspirin per day. </p>
<p>While that dosage of ibuprofen isn’t high by any stretch it’s about duration of therapy. Since you take antiplatelet therapy for the rest of your life sometimes, you want to minimize the risk and maximize the benefit. Taking less NSAID is always better for your GI and stomach. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Is there a problem with more? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if someone was ordered to take 1800mg every day for a week, would it be seriously detrimental? (for a one week period). </p>
<p>On the other hand, what about someone who has been taking 325mg of Aspirin every day for six months in order to combat long-term high levels of C-reactive protein?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify about 'toxic' doses of ibuprofen... You really have to take somewhere north of 400 mg PER KG bodyweight (&gt;150 tabs for average person) to have acute toxicity, i.e. &quot;overdose&quot;.
Tinnitus, nausea, vomiting, nystagmus, coma, renal failure... Big league stuff at those levels.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't exactly right. Platelets have primarily COX 1 which is irreversibly inhibited by Aspirin and reversibly inhibited by Ibuprofen. COX 2 is inhibited in the same manner but is present primarily in vascular endothelial cells. These can regenerate COX 2 but platelets will not regenerate their COX 1. COX 2 is usually responsible for inflammation/pain which is why COX 2 selectivity will help with inflammation/pain but not with your heart.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd recommend <del>striking out</del> your mistake and adding the new information since a lot of people just naturally skip small EDIT comments, since they often are &quot;grammar&quot; or &quot;thanks for the gold kind stranger&quot;.</p>
<p>Especially since the difference/selectivity between blocking COX1 and COX2 activity accounts for basically the entire variance of these drugs' pharmacological profiles.</p></div>		</li>
