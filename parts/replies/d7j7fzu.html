			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom works for Wells Fargo, and has since they merged with Wachovia. Reading articles and personal accounts of the employees is so crazy for me, because it's just like listening to my mom after an awful day at work. She's also been there for a long time, along with a few other people at her branch, and they make a lot more than the average newcomer. She often feels as though they put more pressure on them, so they can eventually fire them for not meeting their quotas and then hire someone else for a lot less. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your services. I'm one of those outliers not intending to get a credit card (mid 20s, out of college for a few years). I earn a decent income from my business. But everytime I go into my bank, this one teller keeps forcing the issue with me and really eating up time. I like to know if an offer is available, but I don't like getting guilt tripped into taking something. As a business person I'm disciplined, I'm not blowing money fast (somedays). I got a respectable cushion saved up since graduating 2 years ago. BUT I also had problems with addictions, vices. Hell in uni I lied to my parents about using my student loan to pay my tuition, and I went and partied with a good chunk of it. I like to think I'm past my party like a rockstar phase, but I know that dark untameable side exists and I know with a credit card I'd likely end up treading water in debt. I procrastinate the ever-living-fuck out of things, I'm sure the credit card would be a trap. </p></div>		</li>
