			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The field of research is called &quot;isotope harvesting&quot;, and people are working on it. But as of now, it's mostly for producing small amounts of radioactive materials for specific uses, rather than mass producing arbitrary nuclides.</p>
<p>It's a problem of making the operation of particle accelerators cheap enough for it to be worth it. If it costs more to produce it with an accelerator than dig it out of the ground, then people will just going to dig it out of the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For making isotopes in small quantities, it's already commercially available.</p>
<p>For making elements in bulk, not even remotely close. Aside from all the costs of the equipment needed to do it, you also need a reaction where the raw material is significantly cheaper than what you're making.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And really only for the ones you can't find easily in nature. For example, radioactive ones with short lifetimes on a human timescale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the specific numbers, and such numbers would also depend on the scale of the facility, but I'd say it'd be really low; like on the order of grams. Definitely many orders of magnitude away in efficiency compared to the most expensive extraction mechanisms, which is why it's pretty much just used for stuff that doesn't really exist in nature due to decaying so quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding (and I'm not anything close to a nuclear engineer) is that the purpose of this process is to make <em>isotopes</em> of a given element, which are the same element with a different number of neutrons. </p>
<p>For example, medical imaging isotopes are designed to be extremely short lived, so that when you inject them into a person the electrons will fly off at a known rate and can be measured precisely by outside detectors. </p>
<p>This allows a computer to determine exactly where in the body those electrons started and create an image of an internal body structure without sticking a camera inside the body. </p>
<p>As far as gold production goes, the only way we know how to turn elements into other elements is by nuclear fission or fusion. The atomic number of gold is 79, so if I had to make a guess I'd say it's gonna be quite a while before we can control either of those processes enough to manufacture gold from other elements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A non-naturally occurring radioactive isotope of gold has been produced from mercury, but it has a relatively short half life, after which it decays back into mercury. It has also been produced (via an intermediate product) from lead, but I recall even less about that process. In both cases, I believe the yield was vanishingly small.</p></div>		</li>
