<p>I think you might be thinking of baking powder. Sodium Bicarbonate (Baking Soda) is a mild base.  It is not acidic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I'm not mistaken. Although it is typically considered a base, there is an acidic proton on HCO3- that can react with bases to become carbonate. HCO3- + OH- -&gt; CO3-2 + H2O.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Biologically you're correct but chemically inaccurate.</p></div>		</li>
