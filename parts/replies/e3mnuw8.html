			<div class="markdown"><p>In response to your first question - yes. The method of birth (vaginal vs c-section) influences the composition of gut bacteria for life. Vaginal birth is ideal.</p>
<p>Can't answer your second question sorry. Hopefully someone can and provide a source.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4315782/" target="_blank">Journal article discussing this</a>, as requested.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Initial postnatal microbial exposure occurs during and shortly after birth. Vaginally delivered infants are colonized by maternal vaginal and fecal bacteria, including Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp. (33). Infants born via C-section are not directly exposed to maternal microbes and are instead colonized with microbes associated with the skin and the hospital environment. It is suggested that the microbiota composition in these infants may remain disturbed for months or even years (34, 35). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>EDIT: A user /u/zzay has commented below, posting a systematic review (high level evidence) which concludes that any significant difference in the diversity of gut microbiota disappears after 6 months. I wasn't aware of this (not an expert in the field). What would be interesting to consider is what effect (if any?) these 6 months of difference have on health for life, particularly in the context of allergy and autoimmune diseases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can’t provide source but remember recent (&lt;1yr) article that they have had success with swabbing the vaginal canal and wiping that onto c-section delivered babies to provide those bacteria. Sounds kinda gross, but then it makes so much sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The effects are very transient (see my reply above for more literature). There was one study to my knowledge who checked for effects of birth mode in a population scale cohort and found no effect (after correcting for many other co-variates):</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference in bacteria is likely related to antibiotics given for c-section, not vaginal seeding: <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2018.00135/full" target="_blank">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2018.00135/full</a></p>
<p>Therefore attempting natural birth wouldn’t change anything, since exposure to the bacteria is likely not relevant. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not statistician but if, for example; 1% of vaggies babies are on the spectrum and 50% of sun-roofers are, that would surely infer a correlation at least. That wouldn't take much of a study.</p>
<p>I'll hold up my stretch of the wall against the hogwash in society, there's a point where skepticism must yield to a common sense especially in a field such as autism where the definitions and causes are not clear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't a study to say C-section is to blame, just that their is some correlation, possibly partly because of microbiome or something else making you at higher risk for both.</p></div>		</li>
