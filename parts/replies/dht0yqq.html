			<div class="markdown"><p>Plinko is a bad example I think. That game shows a single object actually making its way out. It might be more accurate to say that each moment the plinko disc hits an object, you stop it from traveling any further, and replace it with another disc, and repeat that process each time it hit something until it makes it way out.</p>
<p>That's basically what's going on as you put it right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me try my own questionable analogy:<br />
It's like one of those <a href="http://imgur.com/Pxdq7iY.jpg" target="_blank">machines you drop coins into</a>, except it's circular and unthinkably wide. There are quarters spread throughout, and when you drop a penny in and it hits a quarter that quarter shoots one or several pennies in random directions, which then continue to hit other quarters.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If an atom absorbs a high energy photon, it can later release it as multiple lower energy photons. The electron excited by the high energy photon can occupy discrete energy levels, and the wavelengths the atom can absorb relate to the energy difference between pairs of energy levels. But it doesn't mean it jumps just one level at a time. While absorbing it could jump several levels at once, and then return back to its ground state through the intermediate levels. Each jump down releases a photon with the energy equal to the difference in energy levels.</p>
<p>As an extremely simplified example, if the atom has 4 energy levels A B C D in increasing order of energy, absorbing a high energy photon could cause an electron in the atom to jump from A to D, and after some time, release a photon and fall back down. But while doing so, it does it by falling to C, then B then A. Each fall will release a photon of lower energy. The total energy of the 3 emitted photons will be equal to the energy of stimulating photon </p>
<p>Edit: It is also possible that the electron falls from D to B directly or even D to A and release just 2 or 1 photon respectively.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a few other things happening. Doppler shift of the moving atoms means they can absorb wavelengths that are slightly off, because they compensate by red shifting or blue shifting and having different photon energy they &quot;see&quot;. Then you have &quot;collision broadening&quot;, where a photon comes in that isn't the correct energy for an energy transition, but an atom bumping into the &quot;target&quot; atom imparts some energy too, so if a photon didn't have enough energy for a transition, that atom bump will provide a little extra energy, allowing an atom to absorb a photon that wasn't energetic enough on its own.</p>
<p>You also have uncertainties in terms of the emitted photons from excited atoms.</p>

<p>The longer the lifetime of a particular excited state, the more broad the emission spectrum is, so that photon with the &quot;correct energy&quot; for absorption will emit photons of a range of wavelengths.</p>
<p>On top of all of <em>that</em>, you then have accelerating charged particles emitting radiation as well:</p>

<p>Since we know the Sun has a plasma going on, there will be lots of free electrons and protons and other positively charged ions which radiate different photon energies.</p>
<p>This is off the top of my head. There may be other processes going on in the Sun that &quot;smear out&quot; the photon energies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons in atoms in free space absorb and emit well-known wavelengths. When they're in ensembles and at all kinds of pressures the energy gaps change.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, when photon hits an electron and it doesn't cause a state transition, it is scattered in a random direction with energy and frequency depending on the angle between its original and final direction (Compton scattering).</p></div>		</li>
