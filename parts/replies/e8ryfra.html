			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really yet. One variable in there is that the Sun is a relatively uncommon star, with most stars in the galaxy being smaller than it (generally, small things greatly outnumber things that are bigger)</p>
<p>Some things we now know are not unique about the Solar System. We've found other systems with multiple planets, up to Kepler-90, which has 8 planets and ties the solar system. We also know that planetary systems, in general, are quite common.</p>
<p>The big limit thus far is that we still can't really find a solar system like ours. Our methods that we use are sensitive to certain kinds of planets. Kepler looked for planets that would pass between us and their star to cause a dimming. Because of that, it was most sensitive to planets that orbit close in, both because they pass in front of the star often, and because the closer they are to the star, the likelier it is that they transit. In general, this means that finding planets with periods much longer than 1-2 years this way is very challenging. So while we've found systems with lots of planets, it'd be like cramming all the planets into the inner solar system (say, roughly Mars' orbit).</p>
<p>Other methods are able to find planets further out, but it's harder to find small planets with those methods, and sometimes also to find planets that are closer in to the star. So we can find features of our solar system (giant planets far from the star, rocky planets close in, etc) but we would be very hard pressed to find all the planets in our own solar system if we were looking from the outside. Our methods are improving over time, though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For comparison, if we were outside the Solar System using these methods on the Sun, we probably wouldn't have discovered Mars or Mercury. Uranus and Neptune would likely be planet candidates because their orbits are so long that it'd take years to confirm it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I read somewhere that among sun mass stars having a planet as big as Jupiter was uncommon, is that accurate? And would that make our solar system a double anomaly since Saturn is actually not too far off from Jupiter, or are Saturn-like planets expected?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense they're uncommon. There are a lot more smaller planets than there are larger ones, though that's not the same as saying that it's uncommon for a star to have a planet that size, just that they're generally going to have more smaller planets than larger ones.</p>
<p>Kepler looked at planets generally no further from their star than the earth is from the sun, and in that case most people don't expect gas giants like Jupiter to be able to form there, they'd have to migrate there. And so for stars there seems to be about 1% that have these close-in hot Jupiters.</p>
<p>Radial velocity surveys are able to find massive planets further out, and in systems that were known to have planets already detected with the radial velocity measurement, a large portion of them appear to have massive planets that are on much larger orbits (on the order of years to tens of years). The number I'm finding for that is 50% from Bryan et al 2016, which does require some planets to be already known, but I couldn't offhand find another survey that looked at longer period Jupiter-sized planets. Someone else may know a better paper for that, though a lot of the focus atm is on terrestrial planets.</p>
<p>So, I don't think, yet, that we could really say our solar system is an anomaly. I think we'll have a better answer for that in about ten years as we'll be better able to find Jupiter-like planets (combo of new technology and increased baseline, since to find a planet in an orbit of 10-30 years, that often means observations for double that)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone may be able to elaborate here, but after a certain point gas giants don't get (much) bigger, just more dense. If I remember correctly, Jupiter is quite close to the maximum (physical) size a gas giant can be*. Jupiter's mass is far greater than that of Saturn.</p>
<p>Jupiter = 1.898 x 10^27 kg</p>
<p>Saturn = 5.683 x 10^26 kg</p>
<p>EDIT: For easier comparison;</p>
<p>Jupiter = 318 Earth Masses</p>
<p>Saturn = 95 Earth Masses.</p>
<p>*Max physical size in a normal situation. Gas giants orbiting very close to their host stars can &quot;inflate&quot; to truly gargantuan sizes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the &quot;wobble&quot; method found many big gas giants far from the star, and the dimming method found lots of planets near the star.  </p>
<p>So i don't see why there would be a magical gap between the two.Most likely scenario is that our solar system is average for our type of star</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wobble method still is best for planets close-in, and still can't find, say, Uranus or Neptune (Saturn would likely be pushing it). Part of this is simply having to observe long enough. Direct imaging may become the dominant method for finding the outer planets in star systems, so we may be about 5-10 years out from that.</p>
<p>The reason why there's enough reason to be hesitant is also that a couple things we've found are large planets close-in (which likely indicates that star systems go through significant changes during and after formation) and that in other systems we find planets between the size of the earth and of Neptune, which is a regime in planet size that simply isn't present in the solar system.</p>
<p>One example of a paper that mentions some of this by looking at planet frequency as a function of planet radius: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10375.pdf" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10375.pdf</a></p></div>		</li>
