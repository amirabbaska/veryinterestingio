			<div class="markdown"><p>But wouldn't there be multiple varying factors that come into play, such as areas that we don't tend to normally search i.e. Inhabitable areas such as deep in the ocean and forests? What if we went to a deep part of the jungle where no one has been and we start to find new creatures every day, wouldn't that change the percentage?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The statistics you are talking about are called &quot;rarifaction&quot; and yes we do consider things like the fact that almost all research happens in North America. </p>
<p>Chao2 is a popular statistic for measuring the number of species in a certain place. After doing a bunch of random surveys you look at how many species you got only 1 example of, how many you got 2 of, and how many were more common than that. If you get a lot of &quot;singletons&quot; and few &quot;doubletons&quot; then the estimated number of species will be much higher than what you found.</p>
<p>To get global estimates, people usually pull data from smaller studies for more specific areas.</p>
<p>Source: am getting PhD in ecology. Did a study estimating species richness of ants in rainforest plots of different age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably, but isn't that what should happen? I mean if those little isolated enclaves contain way more species then we expect wouldn't that be evidence that there were more undiscovered species than we thought and therefor &quot;change the percentage&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ehh that's probably not the right way to extrapolate the data.  You'd have to account for how intense the effort was to find new organisms over time and then factor in how the differences in technology affected the discovery rate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, as our technology changes, won't our ability to discover new species change too? </p>
<p>So you take the rate of discovery, and the rate of technological advancement, do some mathematical mumbo jumbo, and you get some numbers that are guaranteed to be inaccurate within X and Y, post the finding on the web, and become famous! </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes exactly but it'd be tough to quantify that.  Like say 200 years ago we discovered X amount of organisms.  We'd have to figure out how to say &quot;if they had the technology we have now they would have discovered X + Y organisms.&quot;  I don't think you can reliably answer that question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk Ken M is usually pretty spot on. If circling missing spots to fill them in was good enough for undiscovered elements on the periodic table, I don't see why it's not good enough for undiscovered species. </p>
