			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. Some bees species can also use it as a defence against invaders by literally hugging it and vibrating so that the temperature inside the ball of bees gets too high and the invading wasp or whatever it is dies from overheating. The bees can tolerate only a degree or two more than the invader, but this febrile response literally roasts their enemies alive</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. That’s right. 10,000 shivering bees.
In the summer they keep it cool by circulating air using their wings. </p></div>		</li>
