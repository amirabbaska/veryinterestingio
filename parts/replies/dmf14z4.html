			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I recall my AP bio teacher mentioning something along these lines in high school. I'm not a scientist or even really that interested in genetics, but as I understand it, there's a strong possibility being an early riser or night owl IS partially genetic. In fact, a handful of genes have already been identified as more common in night owls than early birds. One of the theories he offered about evolutionarily why this might occur is simply because in some gene pools it might have been advantageous to survival to be able to stay up late and wake up later in the day, while in other gene pools it's more advantageous to be able to go to bed early and wake up early. This lineage has carried on through today. </p>
<p>This behavior however is still adjustable with a proper diet and exercise regimen, and of course some self discipline. I used to wake up at 11 every day feeling groggy, and now I'm up and feeling refreshed at 7 most days. We just have natural proclivities.  </p>
<p>Edit: This theory is heavily connected to the theory below, which points out that the genetic factors may have come from daily and nightly watch duties in Neanderthal villages. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionarily it makes sense for some members of the tribe to get up early and some members to stay up late. This way there's always someone &quot;alert&quot; to keep watch on the surroundings. I'm a morning person, when I wake up I'm insta up, and I start to tire as the sun goes down. I don't go out to bars because I don't have energy at night</p>
<p>For me it feels emotional and mental, like I wake up &quot;motivated&quot;, I also fall asleep motivated, like I'm going to sleep in order to wake up motivated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I buck that trend. When I was night shift, I was a night owl. On day shift I wake up early and wane early. I sleep much better on day shift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I identify my self as a night owl. In the morning I often have the hardest time forcing my self to get out of bed and I usually don't feel awake until I get some kind of food in my body. At night I'm the opposite. I can be doing something, glance over any the clock see it's 2:00am and then think to my self, &quot;Self, you should probably start getting ready to go to sleep.&quot; And then stay awake for another hour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot to be said about genetics. Being a morning person or a night owl does have a lot to do with genetics. Another factor maybe visit some people have more human growth factor or testosterone in their body naturally, this could help with having more energy and needing to sleep less.</p></div>		</li>
