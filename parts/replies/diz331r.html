			<div class="markdown"><p>nope, you can still define pi the same way, for instance, by the first positive root of the Taylor series defining the cosinus, if invoking circles seems too physical to you. It is completely independent on the real world stuff as it can be completely defined with abstract mathematics.</p>
<p>edit: changed &quot;as&quot; to &quot;by&quot;, because the first root of cos is pi/2, not pi.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couldn't you define pi by isolating it from Euler's Identity and avoid needing to invoke geometry or trig?</p>
<p>I'm thinking π=|-<em>i</em> ln(-1)| or similar?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One example: the interior angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees on a plane. In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_universe" target="_blank">a universe that was not flat</a>, the angles would add up to more or less than 180 degrees, and the sum would depend on the size of the triangle rather than being the same for all triangles.</p>
<p>An example of this can be seen on the surface of a globe. Draw a triangle with one vertex at the north pole and the other two on the equator. The angles are each 90 degrees and therefore add up to 270 degrees. Smaller triangles will have angles that sum to smaller numbers. It's only because the surface of the Earth can be considered as flat over small areas that we are able to draw triangles on the ground with angles that sum to 180 degrees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>pi would still be the same because pi is defined in flat geometry. the only geometry where it makes sense to define it because it doesn't vary for different triangles (you can see this on the sphere which has constant curvature) . </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But if you define a Euclidean space triangles are always 180 degrees. All of mathematics comes from a few axioms that don't depend on physics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at multi-dimensional expansion (dimensions as variables, not as alternate realities) then variation in universal constants would be at least the 6th dimension, assuming dimensional order is non-commutative.</p>
<ol>
<li>Length (or width or height, doesn't matter so maybe all are commutative)</li>
<li>Width (See above)</li>
<li>Height (Also see above)</li>
<li>Time - dimensional expansion of the current 3 dimensional frame of reference to include all linear possibilities given the current set of variable constraints</li>
<li>Probability - Expand the current timeline to account for all possibilities within the current universe</li>
<li>Variability - Expand the current universe to include all variations in boundary values, which would vary the universal constants that we know and those that we don't know</li>

<p>Yeah I'm pretty sure we're right on this one, I just learned this in astronomy last semester so as far as I'm aware the laws of physics don't vary in the same universe</p></div>		</li>
