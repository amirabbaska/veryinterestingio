			<div class="markdown"><p>The New Madrid fault zone -- essentially the Mississippi River valley between St. Louis and Memphis.  They had four major earthquakes in 1811-1812 estimated around 8.0, and have had earthquakes roughly every 200 years.  The mud that many of the cities of built on will amplify the waves, similar to the 1985 Mexico City earthquake.  There is a strong possibility of liquefaction too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more than a strong possibility.  The town of New Madrid and its neighbors are built on a massive sea of sand.   You can turn over a shovelful of dirt anywhere in the area and it will be 2/3 sand.   Evidence of past sand blows is everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the new Madrid fault. One of the worst earthquakes in American history happened on that fault.  Look up the 1811-1812 earthquakes. Makes the 1906 (?)  San Francisco earthquake seem small in comparison. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, 1906; this quake was particularity bad because of the raging fire that erupted because of it.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Portugal had a doozy too... followed by a tsunami <em>and a fire</em> but in that order so the fire lasted 5 days. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To actually answer your question.  The New Madrid area is nowhere near a plate boundary, and plate boundaries are the typical areas for faulting and larger earthquakes.  However, the New Madrid area is very active, and there are a few ideas about why.  Most likely, it is a weak spot in the middle of the North American plate, and as forces act on the outer margins of the plate, the stresses on this weak spot / fault zone result in quakes.  Also, there is a fairly coherent line of reasoning about the Mississippi depositing large volumes of sediment in the fault zone; once enough weight builds up in the weak area, it causes faulting / earthquakes.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, I was working in LA in a building on rollers and there was a decent enough but not major earthquake.  There was rumbling like normal, but much more pronounced rolling that lasted longer than the quake.  I was very different that being outside or in a normal building.  I was working on the 10th floor, but in the center of the building so I didn't see other buildings rolling.</p>
<p>Search for japan earthquake buildings sway, there are tons of videos showing it.  The engineering behind it is so amazing when you see it in action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wave starts at the ground, and travels up the building floor by floor.  The frequency goes lower as the structure absorbs the energy, but the amplitude (length of shake) increases, as the wave travels to the top floor of the building.  Almost like cracking a whip.</p></div>		</li>
