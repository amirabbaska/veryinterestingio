			<div class="markdown"><p>Australian here. First visited Japan in September on a conference trip to Tokyo. Never get into a bowing contest with the saleswoman in the Chanel duty free shop at Narita airport. </p>
<p>I’d been nodding and bending politely (I hope) to just about everyone, but this was my first experience of the 90° horizontal at the waist deep bow. I felt it would be rude to turn and walk away while someone was doing that. So I bowed back (deeply, but not horizontally) and said “Arigatou” again. SHE DIDNT STRAIGHTEN UP ! I tried again but she stayed frozen. I started backing up making increasingly more desperate bows to acknowledge hers. Some of my Australian travelling companions noticed and started recording a video with an acerbic commentary. After what seemed a lifetime, I made it to the door and fled. For all I know that poor woman may still be there having suffered some locking spinal catastrophe.</p>
<p>My girlfriend was in the loo and said missing this was her major regret of the trip.</p>
<p>Edit: I don’t know the guys who took the video. We were at the conference together. I think they were valuers from Newcastle. I didn’t tell my girlfriend what had happened until her birthday in November when I gave her the perfume. She paid out on me too for not getting a copy of the video. I’ve let everybody down and brought shame on my family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you do here is you go full ostrich. Slam your head into the ground while your lower torso remains in an upright position and scream &quot;Arigato!&quot; proceed to tear up while in this position. If she attempts to match you, wag your bottom in her face alluringly further showing deep submission. Wag it good, get a little bit of a groving motion in there and then. She will know who's boss. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gonna get buried but these &quot;consultants&quot; who base their business on telling Americans how to interact with Japanese for business and tourist purposes are generally off the mark. They essentialize Japanese culture and completely ignore the fact that the Japanese -- like most people -- aren't robotic idiots who take offense when foreigners don't perfectly emulate some arbitrary set of rituals and, instead -- like most people -- are actually quite appreciative of the effort and are generally pretty happy just getting along.</p>
<p>You want to avoid pissing off a Japanese person? Don't litter. Don't yell. Pay attention to your surroundings and if you notice other people are or are not doing a thing, make an effort to follow suit. </p></div>		</li>

Whenever I go in to their rooms to give meds or whatever I often get a quick little &quot;thank you&quot; bow from family, and I usually respond with some awkward white dude head nod, but I like to think it goes a little lower than usual in an attempt to have a little, albiet sloppy, etiquette.</p></div>		</li>

If not, can you &quot;cheat&quot; by bowing deep and long to everybody, or will people consider it as mocking if you bow deep and long for somebody of equal/lower social stature than yourself?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't bow too long or too deep, that creates an awkward situation for them. They'll have to deny they deserve that level of reverence and/or get into a weird bowing contest with you which is not enjoyable for anyone involved.</p>
<p>A foreigner not particularly versed in local culture should stick to light bows, like a slowish nod with a touch of forward shoulder movement, nothing more. There is no situation in which that's inappropriate.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, don't put your hands together in front of you in a praying pose, though. That's just ridiculous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly right. The larger the gap in social standing, the deeper the bow. The junior starts, the senior gives the standard shallow bow, then senior then junior straighten up. Having the senior stick to the expected shallow bow allows the junior to not commit the faux pas of accidently straightening early; if the senior wants to especially honor the junior, he can bow longer but not longer.</p>
<p>When bowing while walking, its a mix of bowing, and slowing down your rate of walking, with anywhere from a slight slow and bow as you pass each other to the junior completely stopping, standing aside to the perpendicular, and bowing until the senior passes with length of junior left standing again depending on gap in social standing. I would not completely stop and bow unless it was probably my boss to the 4th or 5th level.</p>
<p>tl;dr - as the senior, depth may vary, but keep it short. as the junior, depth and duration varies on social gap. slow down when walking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're sincere about it and not over - the - top ridiculous then no one will care. Day to day you can bow for everything (to shop staff, if you accidentally get  in someone's way etc) but these bows are VERY small, more like a head bob, and repeated 2-3x.</p>
<p>Also as others have said foreigners get a free pass so even if your bow is terrible they'll probably say that it's amazing!</p></div>		</li>
