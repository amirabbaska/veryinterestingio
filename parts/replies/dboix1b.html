			<div class="markdown"><p>More common in the universe as a whole, but hydrogen makes up only a small part of the <em>mass</em> of the Earth. There is very little of it in the atmosphere as well because it rises up and is carried away by the solar wind. IIRC most of the hydrogen (at least available to us) is just the water, not the thousands of kilometers of rock beneath us.</p></div>		</li>
