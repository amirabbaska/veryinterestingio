			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this explanation, but the way the cones respond to colors is pretty broad.</p>

<p>It should be noticed that the graphic is &quot;normalized,&quot; so our ability to detect blue light is not the same as it is to detect green light, even though they both have the same peak value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good point. </p>
<p>Also, the color wheel is a simplified version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromaticity" target="_blank">chromaticity diagram. </a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for the information.  You mentioned that it if all three colors come into your eyes together, then you see white.  If that is correct, then wouldn't black be the absence of color? And if that is correct, then we come to the point of my reply.  I thought the theory of Black being the absence of color was false, and that white was the absence of color.  Can someone confirm/deny this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC black isn't the absence of color, it's the absence of reflected photons. AKA it's cookie monster and the photons are the cookies. That we see black at all is cause they're the crumbs flying out as Cookie Monster gobbles greedily.</p>
<p>Vanta Black reflects so little light our brains can't even figure out if anything's there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, black is the absence of color, because it's the absence of light, and color is a property of light.</p>
<p>Pure white light is a combination of all wavelengths of color.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We only see color if an object reflects that particular wavelength. So seeing white means all colors are actually reflected, so that would be absence of color. Seeing yellow means everything but the yellow frequency is absorbed. Black would therefore be having all colors causing it to absorb all wavelengths. You could say that black is the richest color of all.</p></div>		</li>
