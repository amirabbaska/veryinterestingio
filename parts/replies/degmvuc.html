			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there were several methods tried for each part of the WWII process (never put all of your eggs in one basket). Some of the U238 separation from the desirable U235 was accomplished by using really strong magnets. Since WWII was in full swing, all of the patriotic copper was being used to make brass cartridge cases and wire for radios and electric motors, etc...</p>
<p>In order to make the huge strong magnets for the separation, silver dollars were borrowed from the US treasury, and melted down to make into wire. The Uranium was turned into U-Hexafluoride gas and shot past a very strong magnet. The 235 and 239 had slightly different weights, so each had slightly different trajectories, which were captured on collectors designed for that. </p>
<p>This made pre-WWII silver dollars rare, where they had previously been very popular with the public, who had grandparents which suffered from the paper money issues during and after the Civil war of 1865.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One clarification:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a chain reaction, one atom breaks and releases two neutrons, which breaks two more atoms, which releases four more neutrons, which breaks four more atoms, which releases eight neutrons</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the &quot;ideal&quot; model.  A chain reaction doesn't need to be 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 8, it just requires that each fission results in slightly more than 1 subsequent fission.  You explained that later on, but it should be more clear that 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 8 is not typical.</p>
<p>The best case scenario in the real world is that two (or more) neutrons are released, but on average slightly more than 1 of them break down other atoms.  If the atoms are densely packed you can improve the odds, but you're still going to have a lot of neutrons escaping into the surroundings, or being absorbed by nuclei that don't immediately split.</p>
<p>In a bomb, you want that exponential growth to be as fast as possible.  If you manage that, then in the last few stages of the bomb's explosion, a large fraction of the total number of atoms in the bomb are all splitting at the same time, causing a massive explosion.  But, it's really hard to have a bomb that is safe until you trigger it, but that is extremely efficient when triggered.  So rather than 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 16, it might be 1 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 6...  Yet, even with a much smaller exponent, the number of atoms reacting at once in the final stages will be enough to cause a huge simultaneous release of energy.</p>
<p>In a power plant you want it to be as close to constant as possible so that you're producing a constant amount of energy, so on average you want 1 neutron released by a nucleus to interact with 1 other nucleus causing it to split.  Any other neutrons should be absorbed by something else and removed from the system.  If the chain reaction is uncontrolled and too exponential, you could get a nuclear explosion at worst (very unlikely) or a meltdown, where the amount of heat being released by the process goes up so much that infrastructure around the core melts.  Of course, if the chain reaction is too slow, you won't get enough atomic decay to generate enough heat to boil water to turn turbines to generate power.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Tom Clancy's novel <em>The Sum of All Fears</em>, he spends a chapter describing the milliseconds of the detonation of a nuclear bomb. Can you speak at all, if you've read it, to how accurate it was? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read it in grade school and really liked it, but I wasn't old enough to really critique it well. I enjoyed it a lot though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a novel with a little nuclear physics thrown in, so read it if you like Clancy novels.</p></div>		</li>
