			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so you know, you lose zero, and I mean ZERO time while knocked out. It's why so many fighters seemed confused when they come to. It's like, hey I was just punching you two thousandths of a second ago, why am I looking at you from the mat??</p>
<p>The experienced fighters will recognize the confusion as the sign they were knocked out, since there is no actual like, remembered trigger? Either way it's something I've always found interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup my 4th MMA fight I was square to the guy and he threw up a head kick I didn't even see. Next thing I knew, one millisecond later I was sitting against the cage talking to my corner. Had to ask him what happened, was so confusing. One of the weirdest feelings ever. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, being knocked unconscious via traumatic brain injury is yet different from fainting (due to low blood pressure, hypoxia, etc.). </p>
<p>They're also dangerous in different ways. As long as the issue causing the hypoxia or low blood pressure is fixed in a timely manner, fainting is unlikely to cause any permanent damage (unless you hit your head on something).</p>
<p>A traumatic brain injury is, in general terms, at least partially permanent (the injury persists, brain can learn to work around it).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have fainted a fair few times due to low blood pressure, high altitude, etc. Almost every time it happens or nearly happens, I first lose my vision. Sometimes I still have enough motor function and cognition left to lie down and/or put my head down or feet up and prevent actually fainting. </p></div>		</li>
