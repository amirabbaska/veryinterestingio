<p>Be on shift 14 hours drive 11 unless adverse conditions then they can drive an extra 2 as long as it's within that 14 hours. Local drivers can be on shift 16 hours once a week though but I believe it's still only drive 11.</p>
<p>Edit: unless you mean drive 11 take 10 off then drive again. Then it's technically in the same day if you start at midnight but you're forgetting you can't go more than 8 hours without 30 minutes off plus fueling, plus pre-trip and post-trip, plus safety checks every 3 hours or 150 miles for non-hazmat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Start at midnight, drive 8 hours. Do 10 hour break. (do post trip and fueling if needed during 10 hour) drive 6 hours. </p>
<p>14 hours in a day. No one stops every 3 hours or 150 miles. </p>
<p>Now of course you would never drive like this on purpose. But I have had to start my clock after 9pm before, doing my 30 minute break before midnight and driving about 7 hours past midnight, 10 hour break followed by driving straight through midnight again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Diesel has several things going against it. First and foremost is probably that diesel fuel is no longer the clear winner that it used to be when it comes to mileage/cost. Before the new environmental restrictions came into play in about 2005-2010, diesel not only got better mileage than gas, it was cheaper. Ultra-low sulfur diesel is more expensive to produce, and the price of diesel went up. On top of that, you have all sorts of new emissions controls, like DEF and soot control that reduce the efficiency of the diesel engine. Finally, gasoline engine efficiency has really improved in recent years. American consumers have never really taken to diesel, because gas has mostly been cheap in America, but the argument in favor of diesel is weaker than it ever has been.</p>
<p>Bear in mind also that many of the advances discussed above, like lined cylinders, don't exist on consumer vehicles. The consumer vehicles aren't designed to go a million miles. They're not designed to be rebuilt. They're designed to wear out so you have to buy another one. This isn't pure greed on the part of the manufacturers. Consumers, by and large, don't want to pay for a car that will last a million miles. They'd rather get rid of it when it &quot;dies&quot; at 200,000 and get a new one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American refineries are engineered for a higher production of gasoline than diesel as compared to refineries in Europe, where diesel cars are much more popular.  In the US, only about 10% of a barrel of crude ends up as diesel, as opposed to about 25% in Europe.  The US actually exports gasoline, but has to import diesel to meet demand.  This also contributes to the price disparity between gasoline and diesel in the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually you CAN buy diesel cars.</p>
<p>Also, diesel typically creates less pollution. Trucks with our engines can actually emit cleaner air than what goes in.</p>
<p>The reasons as to why they aren't common are numerous. Fuel prices, temperature issues (specifically in the northern part of the country), bad PR...</p></div>		</li>

<p>On January 20, 2015, the USPS released solicitation RFI-NGDV for the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle.  Potential bidders have until March 5, 2015 to submit comments an pre-qualification responses. The USPS will then select companies to receive the RFP for prototype development. On February 13, it was announced that General Motors was actively pursuing this new contract, which would have them provide the USPS with 180,000 new vehicles at a cost of at least $5 billion.</p>
