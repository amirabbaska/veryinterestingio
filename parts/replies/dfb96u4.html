			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on the first bit, the push mechanism is definitely one of the four fundamental forces, likely electromagnetism or gravity. These forces will create the bound states that have the spatial densities. Higher energy bound states will have more spatially dense states available if there is enough energy to access those states.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Im so tempted to start asking the endless &quot;why&quot; here... as in, why do wavefunctions overlapping create the need for more energy to push electrons closer together.... and why does that happen and why that and why and why.</p>
<p>I wont but, you know... just sayin.</p></div>		</li>
