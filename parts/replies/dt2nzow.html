<p><em>Quantity</em> isn't entirely the issue.</p>
<p>One of the serious problems with the state water project and the central valley project is that, in times of drought, in the late part of the season, there may not be enough water in the delta to prevent saltwater intrusion from San Francisco Bay. Because the intake for the aqueducts is on the western end of the central valley, there's a real risk that the <em>aqueduct intake</em> may be subject to saltwater intrusion if the amount of water available in the delta is sufficiently low.</p>
<p>Saltwater intrusion would devastate the farms that get water from the aqueduct. It would be an economic catastrophe.</p>
<p>The general scheme for both projects is that water is trapped behind dams on tributaries of the Sacramento River, and then released into the Sacramento River, and thereby into the delta, for withdrawal by the aqueducts in the delta. </p>
<p>The idea behind the tunnels is that tunneling under the delta would allow this water to bypass the delta entirely, and go straight from the Sacramento river into the aqueduct --- thereby allowing saltwater intrusion to destroy the delta's ecosystem <em>without</em> damaging the aqueduct or the consumers of water provided by the aqueduct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it really is all about quantity on one side. Salt water intrusion is the impact of that increased quantity. Hence the long standing fight between north and south.</p></div>		</li>
