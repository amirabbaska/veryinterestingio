			<div class="markdown"><p>I like the comparison to a machine that is vulnerable to wear and tear. It's not because it's not made of iron and stone that at doesn't deteriorate.</p>
<p>I do have a followup question: I guess a low heart rate at rest considered healthy because fewer beats means fewer wear. But what other differences are there between low and high heart rate at rest people?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To kind of answer your question, physical fitness can result in lower heartbeat (but according to logic, the converse is not necessarily true). This is because your heart muscles become stronger as the tissue thickens, which increases efficiency as you move more blood with each beat. This allows your heart to beat slower. </p>
<p>Edit: I don't really know about this &quot;less wear&quot; thing though. What I learned for lower heart beats was due to fitness strengthening the heart, not less wear. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if a person was experiencing caffeine induced anxiety, would it be beneficial to say go for a run to open the blood vessels up? Or would it make it worse? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, doing something to help open the blood vessels would probably help counteract any rise in blood pressure. Would probably help with the anxiety as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If say someone was unable to exercise, would it be possible to chemically increase heart rate AND dilate blood vessels? Obviously missing out on all sorts of other benefits but would that be beneficial for someone handicapped or disabled or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, it's called adrenaline - opens up blood vessels and boosts heart rate. It's one of the things naturally released during exercise, but it's not the only thing.</p>
<p>However, that alone doesn't promote the benefits that come from exercise--the whole process releases a cocktail of hormones and chemical messengers and we've yet to really identify a way to artificially stimulate all of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The medication dobutamine acts as you describe. But it wouldn't help anything; the primary mechanisms by which exercise improves health involve physical damage to the muscle tissues and the resultant release of specific hormones and by-products. Simply exciting the heart wouldn't help that.</p></div>		</li>
