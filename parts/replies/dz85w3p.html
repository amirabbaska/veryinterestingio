			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait seriously?  I’ve been on Lyrica for 10 years now. All kinds of different doses to try to get the max therapeutic benefit.  I’m scheduled to get my nerves burnt off in a few weeks and was really hoping that if it worked that I could toss the Lyrica. Now you are totally freaking me out, friend.  Does it go away after the 2 weeks? Or are you just taking the meds again so the symptoms stop when the drug is reintroduced?
I honestly did not know that these were withdrawal effects of Lyrica. I assumed there was some restlessness and difficulty sleeping. 0/10 not looking forward to “brain zaps”</p>
<p>Is this painful or just more like jarring and annoying?  I must say you’ve got me a bit unsettled here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shameless piggy-backing. Some people who have brain zap also liken them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lhermitte's_sign" target="_blank">Lhermitte's sign</a>, as it would seem the brain zaps (like many seizures, too) are electrical/electrochemical in origin. *In addition, anecdotally both have been correlated to head/eye motion in some people. As to what this destabilization is due to specifically, obviously no one knows the answer to (perhaps the GABA theory as you mention, which may be why small doses of lamotrigine are reported to help some people in this situation). As you say, knowledge about how these drugs truly work is pretty lacking.</p>
<p>A reminder for anyone in withdrawal/suffering from brain zaps. You will improve over time. It sucks, but the brain is surprisingly neuroplastic, and with enough rest, maybe a few supplements, and most importantly time, you'll see improvement.</p></div>		</li>
