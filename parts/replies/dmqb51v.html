<p>The most important thing is to remember is that in all reality, you wont be able to brace. A slow car crash of 35mph (~56 KPH) is over in roughly 150ms, which is faster than an average humans reaction time. Bracing only rarely can come into play like if you were run off the road or something and were going to crash into a tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems a bit dubious - that corresponds to the circumstances of an accident appearing and the accident happening all within the 150ms it takes to travel less than 3 metres. I'm not an expert on car accidents but surely most accidents happen due to something occurring further away that might allow more time to tense up but nevertheless doesn't allow enough time to avoid it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd think, but in most scenarios where you have time to respond, you have time to avoid the accident all together. I've swerved around people pulling out in front of me a bunch of times, and the only way I'd get in an accident is if I was not paying attention at all, in which case I wouldnt be bracing, or if they pulled out in front of me faster than I could react, which wouldnt give me enough time to brace either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, if you have x milliseconds to avoid a collision and take 250ms to react (say) but x - 250 is less than the time required to stop (or slow to a speed such that you won't be injured) then you have x - 250 milliseconds in which to brace yourself (during which time you'll be braking as well, presumably.)</p>
<p>If your point were correct then people would never (or almost never) brake to try and avoid a collision but still have one because they wouldn't have time, but we all know that's not true.</p>
<p>It sounds like you were citing the time it takes for a crash to happen starting at impact and ending when the vehicle is stationary, which on the order of a couple of metres is plausible (I guess if that is indeed what you were citing it'd be about half that assuming constant deceleration, and it sounds about right that a car would carry on travelling about a metre after impact, crushing the front) - but wholly irrelevant here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most common low speed accidents is rear ending. There's quite often brakes applied and time to say 'oh shit'. Any time you're on ice or water or otherwise losing control of a vehicle and trying to regain it you're gonna have time to brace. People brace for impact. All the time.</p>
<p>When I got blind sided and t boned I probably didn't brace, but I know I did when I heard the pickup desperately trying to screech to halt behind me before he blasted me across the intersection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been in 4 accidents where the airbags deployed (only one of which I was driving), and one more they arguably should have. Only one of those accidents did I not tense up, and it was because I was asleep until the airbag explosion woke me up. I know it's anecdotal, but if you'd had sensors on me you'd have seen that I definitely tensed up lol. None of these were significant impacts, so I can't attest to whether I was or wasn't injured because of tensing up, but I can guarantee I had plenty of time to tense up, and the above math supports that claim. The time the airbags probably should have deployed I traveled at least 600ft, and even at the 120mph I was at when the skid marks started, I had pleeeenty of time to be tense, trust me ;) That was the official moment when I stopped being a stupid teenager.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I hydroplaned into a telephone pole at 50 mph.  I saw it coming a good 10 seconds before I hit it.  I had tons of time to brace and I braced hard.</p>
<p>However I didn't brace into the steering wheel I knew that was bad.  Instead I braced onto my seat belt to try to reduce the load I would be thrown into my seat belt without breaking my arms.  I basically was holding onto my seat belt.</p>
<p>Worked.</p>
<p>I was driving a ford tempo with no abs and no air bags...</p>
<p>Walked away bruised, but without a scratch and nothing broken.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In front of me, holding onto the seat belt from the top side of it.  Elbows out, arms flat against chest, seat belt under arms on my chest, gripping the seat belt with my hands and stiffening up my neck.</p>
<p>I basically manually locked my belt before impact putting tension on it, so I would absorb a little force with my hands/arms before slamming into the belt with my chest.</p>
<p>I likely lost some speed in the 10 feet or so of grass between the road and the telephone pole, but then I hit it head on just like I knew I would.</p>
<p>A lot of force was in my hands, then they gave way, seat belt slipped out from my hands, arms thrown to my side a bit, then I lunged forward into the seat belt.</p>
<p>I had about 5-10 seconds between when I knew I was hitting that pole and when I hit it.  About an 1/8th mile stretch of road and it was pouring ran (standing water on road) and I knew I was locked up and not getting out of that hydroplane before impact (I just forgot where I was until it was to late to do anything about it.).</p>
<p>I didn't make impact with the steering wheel, the telephone pole didn't get past the engine block.</p>
<p>I just kind of went from somewhere in the range of 35-50 mph to dead stop in about a second....</p>
<p>It hurt like hell, I felt like my ribs were broken and I had bad whiplash, but they weren't broken and were  just bruised really bad in the chest area.</p>
<p>The next day my whole chest was black and blue in the shape of a seat belt.</p></div>		</li>
