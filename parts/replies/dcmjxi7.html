			<div class="markdown"><p>It's never too late! Although it is too late to prevent some of the unpleasant consequences of climate change, and it is very nearly too late to avoid 2 degrees centigrade of global warming (above the pre-industrial level). The crucial thing is that we have to find a reason to want to preserve this remarkable planet and our place in it. I get my inspiration from realising that we wouldn't be here in the first place unless previous life forms had created an oxygen-rich atmosphere for us to breathe and a stable climate. I don't doubt that human are adaptable creatures. So what we need to do is ride out some difficult times we are creating for ourselves in the near future and work on creating a better future for the generations to come.

			<div class="markdown"><p>No matter what, we have to assume that it isn't too late.  The fate of humanity hinges on that.</p>
<p>That being said, how could anyone possibly know what future technology is capable of? There may be some crazy development that allows us to control the climate as we see fit.</p></div>		</li>
