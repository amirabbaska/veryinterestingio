			<div class="markdown"><p>Strongly-interacting particles are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement" target="_blank">confined</a> so that all naturally-occuring particles must have a net color of &quot;white&quot;.</p>
<p>Also at very high energies, when strongly-interacting particles scatter off of one another, they <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1PL4.png" target="_blank">polarize the vacuum</a> in a way which anti-screens their interactions. The strong coupling constant decreases, and so the strong force actually becomes weaker at very high energies. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_freedom" target="_blank">asymptotic freedom</a>.</p></div>		</li>

<p>How does the arithmetic of colors work for this property? As another lay person, this concept of color charges is brand new and suddenly fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it gets complicated quickly haha -- the reason why nuclei don't fall apart is a residual effect of the reason why individual nucleons (protons and neutrons) don't fall apart.  And they don't fall apart because the gluons binding them together bind into &quot;flux tubes&quot; where the strength of the force increases with the distance rather than decreases.  Eventually as you pull two quarks apart, there is enough energy present in a bond to spontaneously pair-produce a quark-antiquark pair so that the bond can be broken.  When you smash protons together like at the LHC with plenty of kinetic energy, pulling quarks apart more or less converts the kinetic energy into new hadrons, and you end up with a lot more matter than you started with, which is pretty neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So colour confinement (if I understood the basics of the wikipedias on it) is the reason that hammering particles into each other at silly speeds is how we can attempt to find other particles that might not otherwise exist in easily observable locations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The strong interaction ensures that nucleons (i.e. protons and neutrons) don't fall apart easily. The force that keeps the nucleus together is the &quot;residual strong force&quot;, which is to the strong interaction in a similar relation as the van der Waals force to the electromagnetic force.</p></div>		</li>
