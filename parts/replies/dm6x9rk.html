			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea of course but still, in Korea there are about 50 million inhabitants and about half of them (25 million!) live only in Seoul, the same for Japan where 36 million people live in the Tokio metro. AFAIK not a single European country has similiar statistics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because Europe is more like a single country when you compare it to China or India</p>
<p>London actually has 15 million people but people just outside the official boundaries like to consider themselves as living outside of London. Paris has 13 million.</p>
<p>In the same way, most of Seoul and Tokyo wouldn't be considered part of Seoul or Tokyo if they were in Europe.</p>
<p>Having a garden isn't a status thing in East Asia so people don't mind being crammed into tall buildings.</p>
<p>The rural parts of China and India and Pakistan are so crap that everyone wants to move to the cities, so the cities grow bigger. In Europe rich people move to the countryside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's got anything to do with having a garden and status. More than likely it's high rise building regulations in Europe that prevent verticalization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And less (or equal) land space.</p>
<p>iirc China is approximately the same size of the US, but since most of the western half is desert, everyone lives in the east/southeast. China has what, 1.5 billion people? So imagine putting the entire US population multiplied by FIVE into only the eastern half of the US. Shit's cramped. </p>
<p>I probably got some of that info wrong. Please feel free to correct me</p></div>		</li>
