			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel the need to add, although I have never dealt with one of these companies. Mine is more of a parallel route, I guess.</p>
<p>I used to do a fair amount of debt collection defense when I practiced law. Mostly this was credit card collection. The credit card company sells the debt for pennies on the dollar to a collection agency, but often doesn't send them any actual proof of the debt. He'll, sometimes it's just a spreadsheet with names, contact info, and the amount owed.</p>
<p>The collection agency eventually files suit to collect the debt. They're based in California or some shit so they use a third party to find a local attorney to appear in court on their behalf. That attorney is given a ludicrously limited amount of information, and is usually in no way capable of actually winning the case against another attorney.</p>
<p>His job is to settle with people who show up without attorneys and to obtain default judgments against people who don't show up. Some cases got more complicated than others, but I literally never had to actually litigate one. We might have to deal with a continuance or two, but in the end every single case ended with the collection agency's outside counsel voluntarily dismissing the case (without prejudice, so in theory they could re-file), but they never re-filed and the statute of limitations would run out on them.</p>
<p>Also, if they ask for a good faith payment, don't pay it. In most (maybe all?) US jurisdictions the statute runs from the date of the last payment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This explains how I got my debt erased so quickly after saying that I'd bring lawyers in. And also why they insisted it wasn't an error. They must not have got any info with it. AT&amp;T charged me long after I canceled and kept mailing notifications to my old address which I obviously never got since I canceled and moved. They eventually sold the debt off and its been hurting my credit score since. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had nearly the exact same thing happen with AT&amp;T. I moved and transfered my service to a different 'market' within their company. 3-4 years later I start getting collection notices.  I call AT&amp;T to ask why I owe them money since I pay a bill every month. They tell me they can't discuss it since they sold the account to collection. I call collection and they say they can't discuss it because they don't get the detailed documentation. </p>
<p>I had to call all around AT&amp;T yelling and asking for a supervisor and what not to finally get to someone who would open the account and look at it. At which point I found out that they had sent the bill for my 'old market' number to my old address for a couple years - despite the fact that I updated everything in one of their own damned stores. The bill was about $20. </p>
<p>I yelled and screamed enough about having paid hundreds or thousands since then and them literally having my cell phone number the entire time and not contacting me that they finally deleted it from collection. About 8 hours of my life I'll never get back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. I am lawyer for a big law firm. As a first year associate I litigated most of our collection cases for a big bank. These were secured, collateralized loan agreements and were a good way for a young associate to cut his/her teeth on drafting and filing pleadings with the law and facts generally on your side. </p>
<p>The debt collection defense guys should only be used for credit card debt or something similar. I've had a &quot;debt defense&quot; firm as opposing counsel several times on collateralized secured loan cases. It was awful to see how woefully unprepared they were for real litigation (discovery, motion practice, etc.). </p>
<p>If you have collateral and default on the loan, do yourself a favor and give the collateral back. If you don't have the collateral, file a police report (if you gave your car/RV/boat to someone and they refuse to return it). These banks will drag you through the full scope of litigation until they get the collateral. In my experience, once the collateral is returned (in reasonable condition) the remaining deficiency isn't too important. Yes they will take a judgment, but collection is no longer a priority. </p>
<p>TL;DR - if you default on a loan with collateral and still have it, give it back. Don't expect debt collection defense lawyers to magically erase that debt while you keep the collateral. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your mother is correct.</p>
<ul>
<li>Good: debt paid in full.</li>
<li>Bad: debt settled for less than full amount.</li>
<li>Worse: debt unpaid.</li>
</ul>
<p>The question between good and bad here is how much your credit is worth. If you have no plans to buy something like a car or house on credit in the next few years, the cash on hand might be worth more than the change in credit score <em>to you</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi There, Medical insurance professional who specializes in state/fed regulations/law here to weigh in... the question you want to ask of the billing provider is if they <em>report to a credit agency.</em> If they do, a settlement <em>may</em> impact your credit negatively. I am assuming you are dealing with a small-ish provider given the amount of your debt. If that's the case, I'd bet my house that they <em>don't</em> report to credit bureaus... and in that scenario, I would advise you to take the settlement and be done with it. Just a side note - medical insurance companies don't report to credit agencies either ;).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't believe it's an actual functioning program because if someone could not pay taxes untill they owed the IRS a quarter million dollars and then the IRS would settle for a tiny fraction of that, then no one would pay taxes. Well not no one, but most people wouldn't have any qualms about doing that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone seems to be missing the most important point about why this feels so scammy: This only works when you’re not paying your bills. So if you call up one of these debt settlement companies, what they tell you to do is stop paying, if you’re paying anything at all. This drops your credit score by lots and lots. So you may have been clinging to an okay score but draining your bank account and now you’re saving money but your credit score is dropping like a stone and you’re getting harassed to insanity by debt collectors. What the settlement company is doing is basically playing chicken - the only way you can convince a credit card company to settle is by proving they’re going to lose money on you some way or some how. If you stop paying, they know things are getting real. If you stop paying for long enough, the debt either gets sold or the company agrees to settle to get back whatever they can. The hope is that part of your settlement terms include removing the blemishes from your credit score. So you settle for “pennies on the dollar,” your bad credit marks are removed, and you walk away. The problem is this doesn’t always work, so you may end up trashing your credit score for nothing. That’s why these debt settlement companies should be your last resort after things have already gone to shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Your <del>debtors</del> creditors have no way of knowing what you make.</p>
<p>I meant this is response to negotiating a debt, not going so far as to get sued.  Call 'em up, &quot;I owe $1,000.  I'll pay you $300, right now today, and you send me (fax) proof that you're dropping this off my credit report.&quot;  &quot;OK.&quot;</p>
<p>They bought your debt for pennies on the dollar.  They're happy to recoup anything, especially if you're cool about it.</p>
<p>I did this for many debts after a divorce.  Credit score jumped overnight.  Also, unethical-LPT, get on the credit agencies websites and dispute EVERY debt.  If they can't prove you owe, by mail, in 30-days you're off scott free.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. And you have to be willing to let your credit go to shit for awhile too. </p>
<p>Theyre not going to look at the guy with a 700+ credit score, who's made all his payments, and say 'sure we'll settle'.</p>
<p>But they will look at the guy who has a lower credit score who is well beyond delinquent. </p>
<p>Its why one of the first steps these places have people do is 'stop paying'. It trashes their credit, and the customer may or may not realize this, but its a prerequisite for a settlement. </p>
<p>I wasnt in the actual industry, but i saw a side of it as someone who worked in the lower end of the mortgage spectrum for a bit. We'd help people consolidate their high interest rates into lower ones on a mortgage (there are pluses and minuses to this, obviously), and often that involved calling up a creditor to talk them into a settlement. Basically &quot;i can get $X cash out on this loan, if you can tell me the debt will be off their record with it so it won't affect their debt ratio anymore. Deal?&quot;.</p>
<p>And when a lot of the collection agencies bought the debt for pennies on the dollar anyway, theyre pretty amenable at that point to taking it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are the ones that offend me the most.  I represent a state taxing authority on occasion, and have to deal with these folks.  They call and say &quot;I know the client owes the state $40,000, but he is willing to settle the debt today only for a lump sum of $2,500.&quot;  I quietly do the mental calculus - &quot;Yes, he is broke today, but these taxes have a 40 year statute of limitations, are secured by tax liens, and are most likely partially or fully nondischargeable in bankruptcy.&quot;  </p>
<p>It is usually one phone call and yields no change in position on my end.  I have to imagine that these folks are charging these debtors something, making a bad financial situation worse, when they literally add zero value to the situation.  It is offensive, but it my state at least, it is not law firms doing it (but rather tax representatives), so I don't have a bar association or grievance panel to report it to.</p></div>		</li>

A good example is my own wife who had a bank account she didn't use for years but the bank did collect fees on it pushing it in debt. Meantime we moved and totally forgot about the account. Eventually a collector got hold of us and I started to realize what happened. I asked for a copy of the regulations at the point she signed for opening the account. They didn't have so they showed up with all kinds of other papers but nothing substantial. I called the bank myself and told them they can choose to either close the account or leave it open for indefinite but I will never pay the outstanding debt. They closed the account.</p></div>		</li>
