			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the issues, yes.  You can have both tunnelling from the gate to the channel or direct tunnelling from the source to the drain (thus bypassing the gating).  I don't know if I'd say it's &quot;the&quot; issue.  There are other, arguably more fatal, concerns for hard limits on Si-MOSFETs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Current CPU's are at 14*nm - The chipmakers are currently working on deploying 7nm, which is regarded as &quot;the end.&quot;</p>
<p>7nm isn't on the market yet, though, and 3D NAND at 7nm has a lot of growth in it as a technology.... at least 5-8 years.</p>
<p>Edit: Wrote 13 instead of 14. What's a nanometer between friends?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, would other, perhaps more exotic materials help limit these sources of noise? I've heard for years that diamond would be the next step if only we could make fabs for it economically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mean oxide tunnelling specifically?  Well already we've started by getting rid of silicon dioxide and instead using &quot;high-k&quot; materials like hafnium oxide:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-%CE%BA_dielectric" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-%CE%BA_dielectric</a></p>
<p>Given that capacitance is proportional to k/t where t is the thickness and k is the dielectric constant of the insulator, if you can't reduce t (because of tunnelling) you have to use a material with higher k.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you're reading about diamond but I can't see it having any value as an oxide layer.  Diamond is actually itself a semiconductor with actually a pretty high bandgap (about 5x that of silicon).  This high bandgap means that it could potentially be a good CHANNEL MATERIAL for transistors intended for power applications. (i.e. for power applications, diamond could be used where SILICON is, not the oxide).  Perhaps it was this you heard?</p>
<p>There are also approaches on the horizon that are MOSFET-like devices that still use all the same manufacturing techniques.  And example of this is FinFETs and another super trendy example over the last year is Negative Capacitance-FETs (NC-FETs).  The idea with all of these is to allow the electric field produced by the charged gate to still adequately control the channel without having to thin the oxide layer anymore (because of tunnelling).</p></div>		</li>
