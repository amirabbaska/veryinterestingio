			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, that's a super complicated problem because you have to calculate the rate of diffusion of gas back into the excised region as it's getting &quot;burnt&quot; away. So, I dunno.</p>
<p>Just to give you a sense of what's going on, <a href="http://www.space.com/images/i/000/034/337/original/cosmic-rays-nasa.jpg?interpolation=lanczos-none&amp;downsize=*:600" target="_blank">this</a> is an artist's impression of what happens to cosmic rays as they hit the atmosphere, where each line in the bunch is a different secondary particle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, detectors aren't even <em>trying</em> to detect the cosmic rays themselves. One thing they look for are neutrinos. Basically, a proton with outrageous energy slams into the atmosphere and cascades into a shower of particles, each of which carries some fraction of the original particle's energy (which is more than enough to share around). Some of the first particles made will be neutrinos, these can go through the atmosphere (and the rest of the universe) like it's nothing. Out of the <insert enormous number> of neutrinos fired out of these showers one <em>might</em> hit something else and create a more interactive particle, which then makes a tiny blip of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation" target="_blank">Cherenkov light</a>. <a href="https://icecube.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Giant detectors</a> in ice and water spot one of these blips every week or so. A handful so far have been absolutely mind-boggling. The largest blip so far suggests the original proton that hit the atmosphere had the energy of a pitched baseball; not the velocity, the <em>kinetic energy</em>, in a single proton. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's just consider a single pulse. We can disregard diffusion, as the pulse will pass through the atmosphere in less than 1 ms, and assume all energy is deposited in the air it passes through.</p>
<ul>
<li>The LHC beam has an energy of 362 MJ. [1]</li>
<li>Air has a heat capacity of about 1 kJ/kg/K. </li>
<li>Each m^2 has about 10000 kg of air above it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally the cross section of the LCH beam is a lot less than 1 m^2, but once it leaves confinement, it'll diverge pretty quickly. So lets just assume that it averages 1 m^2 in cross section on its way through the atmosphere.</p>
<p>DeltaT = E / (C * M) = 36 K. I.e., the beam will heat the column of air it passes through by an average of 36 K. Not enough to in any way &quot;burn through&quot;. </p>
<p>By the time a new pulse has been accelerated up to speed, the air in that column will long since have diffused and been replaced with cool air.</p>
<p>Let's assume continuous operation: All of CERN draws a maximum of 200 MW of power [2]. If all that magically ended up in the LHC beam, it would be able to heat that 1 m^2 column of air at a rate of 20 K/s. Since 1 second seems a reasonable time frame for the air in that column to be replaced (Coriolis forces pretty much guarantees strong winds at high altitude), the atmosphere would easily be able to diffuse that amount of power.</p>
<p>Naturally the above results change dramatically, if we could somehow kill the beam divergence without expanding the cross section of the beam, so that the column of air it had to pass through was drastically smaller. But that would violate conservation of phase space density.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No chance at all. Atmospheric pressure is too high, meaning the density of particles around is way too high for any 'hole' to be maintainable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on to the artist's impression specifically: What's shown is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_shower" target="_blank">particle shower</a>, where one high-energy particle will cause a whole slew of various radiation/particles to be released. &quot;Scattering&quot; here means losing energy (possibly all of it in one go), which is then converted into (for example) particle-antiparticle pairs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherenkov_radiation" target="_blank">Cherenkov Radiation</a> and other fun stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, but when being a bit more pedantic, there still might be a point to be made:
What force do you mean when talking about orbits? </p>
<p>In terms of gravitational force I agree with you.
But you might also say that electrically charged particles are being shot into space. Those would interact with the magnetic field of Earth and might get into something similar to an orbit. An orbit &quot;around the magnetic field lines&quot;.
