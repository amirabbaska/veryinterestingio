<p>I don't know if this was the point you were trying to make, but this kind of phrasing bugs me because its so often used by anti-government types.  &quot;Who's the government to blah blah blah&quot;  - that's the whole point of the government!  To create rules and enforce them which lets us have a civilized society.  Without a government, the people would just have to take things into their own hands.  Someone not playing fairly?  They get hit in the head with a big rock.  Or a mob gathers and burns their house down.  </p>
<p>By establishing a government, we say &quot;Ok, you can't just take justice into your own hands, AND you shouldn't have to because we've set up rules to keep things fair and we'll be enforcing those using fines/prison&quot;.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I would not consider myself to be an anti-government type. </p>
<p>But, the phrasing I chose presupposes that governments will inevitably exist. </p>

<p>The establishment of government, I will concede, produces this exact result. I hoped to only emphasize that when determining when a government is &quot;keeping things fair&quot; it is wholly within the governments realm to determine whether an agreement is fair or unfair. And for the sake of the original question OP asked the perspective I was trying to emphasize was that, when determining whether politicians should be allowed to take money from big companies or lobbyists it is entirely debatable whether allowing them to take money from certain entities is fair or not. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The existence of corporations as entities separate from the natural persons who have invested in them is itself a legal fiction entirely dependent on the government's recognition of it. A corporation cannot be characterized simply as two or more people making an agreement, because it comes with rights that are created by the government (like limited liability).</p></div>		</li>
