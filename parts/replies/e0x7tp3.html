			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes, in certain ways. Usually tensile strength is determined by pulling material apart. A sample is marked and pulled apart, then you compare the distance between your marks before and after. Hardness can be tested with a press though, it presses a predetermined shape (a diamond in one case, and I think a sphere in another) into a sample piece of material using a calibrated and carefully controlled force, (the hydraulic press) then you compare the size of the mark on the material to other materials to determine its hardness. For toughness you smash it with a pendulum and measure how hard the pendulum was hit. Elasticity is determined in the tensile strength test.</p></div>		</li>
