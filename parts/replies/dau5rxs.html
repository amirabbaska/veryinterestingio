			<div class="markdown"><p>The blue whale is the largest animal that's ever lived as far as we know; some dinosaurs approached it in size, but none that we know of exceeded it.  However, dinosaurs did have a biological advantage that helped them to attain large sizes, and even approaching a blue whale in size is remarkable for an animal that lives on land and isn't supported by buoyancy.  </p>
<p>Dinosaurs had the same style of respiratory system as modern birds, which uses air sacs and a flow-through lung to achieve extraordinary efficiency in gas exchange; something on the order of 3-5 times the efficiency of mamallian respiration, and the high flow rate of gas through the organism also provides an effective cooling mechanism, allowing for large, active animals that otherwise would be unable to cool themselves through their skin alone due to surface area limitations, and which would have allowed for metabolic rates higher than what mammals can sustain, meaning faster growth.</p></div>		</li>
