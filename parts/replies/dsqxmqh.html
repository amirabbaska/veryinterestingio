			<div class="markdown"><p>In a way.  In QM the number of particles is conserved.  Hence particles cannot be created or destroyed.  We know this is untrue in the real world as we see it happen.</p>
<p>QFT fixes this defect.</p>
<p>Edit:  The use of creation and annihilation operators in QFT is what fixes this.
We still use QM, because it's still useful.  Atoms don't  create or destroy electrons, so it's OK to use QM to, say, compute energy levels of electrons in atoms.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The statements you are making are all correct in the context of many textbooks that take a narrow view point of &quot;QM&quot;, but at a broader level QFT is still a subset of quantum mechanics.  Here I mean QM in the sense that the state is a vector in Hilbert space, which can be viewed as a complex linear combination of classical configurations, the state evolves unitarily in time according to a Hamiltonian, and measurements yield classical configurations with probabilities given by the Born rule.  All of this formalism applies equally well to QFT, where the classical configurations are fields instead of e.g. the position of a particle.  The superposition over field configurations is sometimes called a wave functional.  </p>
<p>In the case of QFT the underlying &quot;classical&quot; field configurations are not smooth, they are distributions (i.e. generalizations of smooth functions, similar in type to Dirac delta functions).  This is why they are represented as basis elements of a Fock space, with quantities like the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian in terms of creation and annihilation operators.  </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>By this, do you mean QFT can be derived by QM or just deals with special cases that QM can't handle? </p>
<p>Basically, does QFT have more or less explanatory power than QM?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>QM is a broader mathematical framework about how general notions of states (elements of a Hilbert space) and operators work in a physical system. QFT is a bit more specific in some sense, in that it considers fields on a background space as forming the basis of the Hilbert space of &quot;states&quot;, and includes creation and annihilation of particles as specific operators. The classic (!) QM case of a particle in a box we learn about first is a much simplified version of this, QFT is a second order or level of quantisation of the fields rather than the particles themselves, and you sometimes see &quot;first and second quantisation&quot; for this reason. But all within the more general sense of QM.</p>
<p>QM and QFT can be seen as broad mathematically abstract families of physical theories rather than simply specific models of our universe. The standard model is <em>a</em> quantum field theory, with <em>specific</em> fields and operators etc., which lies within the framework of quantum mechanics. </p>
<p>String field theory broadens this to include a still &quot;quantum mechanical&quot; notion of fields of particles of one dimension (or more). I would still call this &quot;string theory&quot;, and it's still a &quot;quantum field theory&quot; in a broader sense, and still assumes the whole abstract framework of &quot;quantum mechanics&quot;. Any distinctions are only likely to be insisted upon at a pedagogical level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting from the perspective of functorial quantum field theory that quantum mechanics should be a 1-dimensional theory in the appropriate sense while general functorial quantum field theories don't have such a restriction. It's also worth noting for those unfamiliar that physics isn't the study of a single field theory. There are different fields describing different phenomena. Ex: the Kalb-Ramond field for strings generalizing the electromagnetic field for particles.</p>
<p>Edit: To bring it back to OP's question: The word &quot;field&quot;, in the context I presented, is typically specified when the theory nontrivially propagates over higher dimensional cobordisms. I say &quot;specified&quot; since the 1-dimensional theories are subsumed by those of higher dimension.</p></div>		</li>
