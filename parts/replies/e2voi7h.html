<p>The cool thing to think about is while they are seeing dinosaurs, we are currently inhabiting the earth, but that light is 66 million light years old, so they see dinosaurs instead of us.</p>
<p>If they were 200 light years ago, they would be seeing the 1800s.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you eli5 how this is possible?
Because if we are living in this present moment and the person looking at us from far away is the present moment as well. Then how are they able to see the past? I'm actually really confused.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it takes time to light to reach that person from us. So if light leaves Earth <em>right now</em> and the person is 1000 light years away, it will take light a 1000 years to reach that person. Think of it as major space lag of sorts (also, as you can see, light year is a measure for time <em>and</em> distance at the same time; the crux of Einstein's ideas is that you measure time and space with the same unit of measure.).</p>
<p>Actually, but this is above ELI5 now, the speed of light is actually the speed of causality, it's the speed that all massless particles have to travel at. It doesn't really have anything to do with light itself. Google it, the topic is lots of fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because light takes time to travel. For everyday life light travels so fast that we see it move instantly. Someone turns on a lightbulb in a window across the street and we see it instantly. But a lightyear is a measurement of how long it takes light to move over a year.  So being 200 light years away means you are seeing light which has been traveling for 200 years. I.e. the person who turned on the oil lamp on the 1800s.  Everything reflects light though so if you magically had a telescope which could see people and details then you'd see the past since it is all 200 year old light. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's because light takes time to get somewhere, so if you're looking from really far away you're actually looking at light that has emitted from somewhere a really long time ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP's and your question both get at the right idea - regardless of how telescopes work, light seen from 66 million light years away would have left the Earth 66 million years ago. </p>
<p>So if there were any image information still in that light, it would be of an image 66 million years old. </p>
<p>This is the same concept behind looking at more distant stars/systems to see what the universe was like at an earlier time</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:</p>
<p>This is like how you can hear the boom of fireworks after you see them, maybe even a full second or longer.  It's like listening a second into the past.</p>
<p>If the fireworks were louder, and you were further away, it could be several seconds.  This is how you can sometimes hear thunder tens of seconds after seeing lightning.  You're hearing tens of seconds into the past!</p>
<p>Sound spreads out, and eventually if you get super far away to have to wait minutes or hours or years into the past, there eventually won't be something loud enough to hear.  Just like with light, go too far and it won't be bright enough to see, and dinosaurs weren't very bright.</p></div>		</li>
