			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, you're right. So what is Figer going on about then?  Could he have discounted it because of this...?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>R136a1 is undergoing extreme mass loss through a stellar wind reaching a velocity of 2,600 ± 150 km/s. This is caused by intense electromagnetic radiation from the very hot photosphere accelerating material away from the surface more strongly than gravity can retain it. Mass loss is largest for high luminosity stars with low surface gravity and enhanced levels of heavy elements in the photosphere. R136a1 loses 5.1 × 10−5 M☉ (3.21 × 1018 kg/s) per year, over a billion times more than the Sun, and is expected to have shed over 50 M☉ since its formation.[5]</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe they just hadn't found the larger stars when he wrote that. There are now a handful over that theoretical limit he proposed. I imagine with the James Webb we are going to find some seriously amazing stuff </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically the 150 solar mass limit comes from the initial formation. New gas cannot fall into stars over this mass because their radiation pressure blows new gas away.</p>
<p>However, imagine you had 2 or 3 such large stars in a single system, a binary or trinary collection of giants. They might have such puffed-up atmospheres that they would actually touch. This would cause drag, and they would eventually spiral into one another. The 150 solar mass limit is how big you can get with a single lone star collecting matter by its own gravity. But it's always possible for two or more large stars to collide, merge, and exceed this limit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe. It's so massive that it might collapse into a black hole without a supernova, or it might undergo a hypernova, we don't know enough to know for sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's basically what they are. They are not stars in the sense that they don't have nuclear fusion occurring in their cores. But they are objects that are so dense that they have gravitational forces strong enough to allow light to not leave from them. That's why they are black</p></div>		</li>
