			<div class="markdown"><p>Queer coding. A lot of villains, especially in older films, are given traits commonly associated with homosexuality. This means male villains were often effeminate and &quot;prissy.&quot;</p>
<p>So you get Governor Ratcliffe with pink bows in his hair and a spoiled little dog, Scar who is very delicate compared to Mufasa/Simba and has lines like &quot;I'll practice my curtsy&quot;, delicate hissy-fit throwing Prince John.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They converted it to queen to bring it to Europe.  The Queen was a more significant position in Europe while the king's top minister was less official.</p>
<p>Politically the king's right hand was arguably more influential than the king himself.  The king tended to rule by delegating.  All the people that wanted stuff would usually go to him.  He had all the connections to make everything happen.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The piece also originally was a shitty bishop, interestingly - it could move only one square diagonally. </p>
<p>Although then again at that time, the piece that became the bishop, the elephant, could only move two squares diagonally, but could jump like the knight. </p></div>		</li>
