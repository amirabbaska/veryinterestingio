<p>So if you wanted to hide your tracks, and I assume hackers would, wouldn't it pay to pretend you were someone else, and use Russian malware if you were American and vice versa? Or would that be too obvious so you would double-fake your tracks by using Russian malware if you were Russian so it looks like you are American pretending to be Russian? And so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are two things in play here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>BGP. The Internet is literally just a group of connected networks. From the network at your home, to your school, to your office. Just connected networks. BGP (border gateway protocol) is the way that the networks communicate with each other to share routing information. So if your office has a block of IP addresses, its router will advertise to other routers that they can get to that block through it. Do that a couple of hundred thousand times and you have the full BGP feed.</p>
</li>
<li>Looking glass. Since BGP is different for every network ( since no two networks are connected the same way) sometimes it is helpful to see your neighbor's work. If you are having a problem getting to an IP address block you can go to a looking glass server and see what routes they have to that block. Maybe there is a misconfiguration somewhere along the line.</li>
