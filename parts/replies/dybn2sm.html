			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my question as well. It seems like OP's question is easy to answer, without having to know the exact history of parachutes.</p>
<p>What would be needed mostly is something to estimate speed, assuming we can have a very rough idea of what can of speed/force humans can fall without injuring themselves. Even just mentally, we have a rough idea of what height we can jump from. If it hurts when we land, it starts being too high.</p>
<p>Speed could be based on height and time; I supposed a little trigonometry would be warranted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure there were tests of this nature.   But first &quot;test&quot; could be taken to mean &quot;first time a human tested one&quot;.  I'm pretty sure even Da Vinci built little models to test the concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to evaluate survivability with dummies without the use of embedded impact sensors. Modern day crash dummies only work in car impact simulations because they actually contain rudimentary sensors.</p>
<p>This being said, a dummy would probably be useful for a first launch, just to see if the thing slams into the ground or not. However OP's answer doesn't exclude this: it's logical to assume that he did some test runs before climbing into it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need electronics to build impact sensors.</p>
<p>You could, for example, have rods of material of different strengths, and examine which broke and which didn't or how much they deformed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, seems like it wouldn't be too difficult to conceive a way to measure relative impact strength.</p>
<p>1)  Find some known height where human fall speed starts getting into dangerous territory.  For instance, take a ladder and jump from one rung up each time until it starts hurting enough to stop.  </p>
<p>2)  Put a pile of sand down as a landing zone.</p>
<p>3)  Drop your dummy weight from your known-safe height to see the kind of impact crater it makes in your sand pit.  The important thing is the relative speed of the dummy weight to the human fall speed.</p>
<p>4)  Drop dummy weights from considerably higher heights with your speed reduction apparatus.  Compare the craters created using your device to the one created by free fall.  If the crater is smaller, then the device is probably safe.  If it's bigger, then you're running into the danger zone.</p>
<p>It might not be a perfect test, but my guess is that it would be accurate enough to give you a reasonable idea of the safety of your parachute.  I'm sure anyone who really wanted to test a parachute could have thought up something similar, even 200 years ago.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pure speculation on my part but I assume it would be difficult to rig some kind of remote or delayed trigger to disconnect the weight from a balloon and release the parachute. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was going to chime in and say that HCl and Aluminum is another good hydrogen source but some research has informed me that aluminum was extremely rare and more expensive than gold prior to the advent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall%E2%80%93H%C3%A9roult_process" target="_blank">Hall–Héroult process</a> in 1886.</p>
<p>So I think it's safe to say that Fe/H2SO4 was far more likely to be the reaction done in the late 18th century.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We often underestimate the wit and skills of our ancestors. Even considering all the progresses made the last 50 years, it doesn't erase the wonderful inventions, theories and experiences led by the Mesopotamian, the Chinese, the Indians, the Greeks and Romans, the Muslims, the Pre-Hispanic Americans, and so many others... And all of this was with tools and possibilities so much more archaic than the ones we have now. Now, imagine the late 18th century Europe, with the post-enlightenment ideas, in a prosperous and wealthy (yet always at war, thus eager for innovation) France, on the verge of industrialization. Nothing surprising about that. </p></div>		</li>
