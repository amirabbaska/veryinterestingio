			<div class="markdown"><p>There is this weird cognitive dissonance between baby boomers on stuff like this.  I was just talking to y dad about this last week. (For context I'm in my mid 30s, but my baby sister just graduated college.)</p>
<p>He was complaining how my sister doesn't have any money or plan and is lazy now that she's graduated and how when he was her age he worked driving a fork lift while going to school full time, making enough money to pay his entire tuition AND buy a small house by the time he was 22.  He didn't appreciate when I pointed out that his yearly tuition cost what my sister pays for textbooks and he bought the house for slightly less then one <del>semester</del> year of her tuition.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know a guy who bought a 3 family house in S. Boston at 19 yo on an electrician's apprentice salary. He didn't even have his journeyman's license yet. He later sold the house which was subdivided into 3 condos, each are worth $400,000+ today. You couldn't buy that entire house if you were an master electrical contractor today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like his complaints are grounded mostly in her efforts than with her lack of money and property. I currently have coworkers with recent college graduates who are upset with their children for lounging around the house all day with no plan or sense of expediency in searching for employment. One even applies for jobs on her daughters behalf because she doesn't take it upon herself to seek jobs out while living at home.</p>
<p>Of course, our anecdotes aren't measures of general truth nor should they be perceived as such.</p>
<p>Edit: I also don't know where you got your numbers from?</p>
<p>The average cost of a new home in the 1960s ranged from $12,700 to $15,500 with a median family income of $5,620 a year. That is, after adjusting for inflation, equivalent to $104,555 to $127,607 in today's money for the price of a new home. The average annual cost for American universities for the 16-17 school year was $33,480 for private universities, $9,650 for state residents at public college, and $24,930 for out of state residents. </p>
<p>It is of course worth noting that a new home today costs roughly $310,800 but I think your original comparison is still a bit exaggerated. Unfortunately, I can't find reliable per capita income data to issue a proper comparison on this point. All I see are measure for average household income which I've never considered a serious measure as it doesn't take into account the number of earners in a family and the choices of individuals within the unit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>We see plenty of stories on r/relationships where the parents think this, but actually are just not recognizing online job searches (they falsely assume gaming) or the length of applications these days even for minimum wage jobs.</p>
<p>It also seems to me that many parents are just handling their anxiety poorly-- like a manager who falls into berating productive employees if he doesnt seem them walking around hurriedly.</p>
<p>I think poor stress management  also applies to these types:</p>

<p>I am reallu starting to wonder if there are more people on either extreme end of parental reaction than in the middle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have the post of the topic IMO</p>
<p>The other odd thing is that it's quiet a bit easier now. I mean, someone here on Reddit posted a kind of 'showerthought' that by moving out of the house the only difference was that they were microwaving frozen pizza in an apartment and not a house. </p>
<p>but you are right that it's changed dramatically and now it would be impossible for the vast majority to move out at age 18 or 19 and would probably ruin them.</p>
<p>You still see Americans throwing that internet insult around &quot;Ya.. you probably still live at home!&quot; or 'in your parents basement!' but the truth is, that is just describing a very common American scenario now. </p>
<p>BTW: That insult or that idea really is foreign and 'meaningless' to probably most people on Earth. It's entirely common, normal and standard to live with parents around much of Asia where I live now. &quot;35 year old still living in his parents basement&quot; would be... well.. yes what else would they be doing? </p>
<p>But ya there was a time when you absolutely could do that at age 19. Not so much now.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I disagree. Sure i didn't own a house at 19, i didn't even own a car. I worked 2-3 jobs and rollerbladed my ass to work. I lived with 3 other dudes and we shared rent/bills. I usually had about $100 left to play around with at the end of each month. Sure it's not an ideal life but I did it, and I have a pretty great career now doing something i love, and that i taught myself to do by using the internet as a tool not just a source for funny videos.</p>
<p>Not everyone needs or gets to start off life with a shiny new house and fancy car. Sometimes you've gotta work your way up in the world.</p>
<p>But most importantly, move out the damn house so I can run around in my underwear all day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So did I and it was a foolish move in retrospect. Considering the economy in my area, I'd have been better to to live at home for 2 or 3 more years and chip in a few dollars to the family (even if it was just groceries or a few bills). </p>
<p>Mind you, everyone's local and specific situations were different but I'd have been way better off doing that and investing in a sound reliable vehicle, saving up a deposit (or even a downpayment on a home??) and then paying for certain schooling with cash upfront and/or paying off the debt. </p>
<p>In my case, from a strictly objective, financial, good budgeting, common sense PoV it would have made way way more sense to stay at home until around age 25 or 26 sorta thing.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The problem now is that far too many young people will start life with a 'mortgage' and no house and a Barista job that - in effect - will put them in more debt every month they work. They won't be working their way 'up' but instead losing hope every month as costs and debt outrun their maximum earnings. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>and that's where the arguments for objective fiscal goals, budgeting and sensible saving go out the window. People gotta live. young people want to live and have fun or feel free. They want to run around in their underwear or be 'king of their own castle' and maybe those things are worth the money or worth more than money itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree, it sucks. I am no slouch. I joined the Marine Corps and went to a prestigious college to get my bachelors degree as well. Yet I make a pittance at my salaried job and am currently staying at my parent's place. I didn't do anything wrong. I'm not lazy. It sucks to have people (and somewhat myself) think that I'm some sort of loser. </p>
<p>I'd love to have my own place but I don't make enough money. If I was alive in the 70's when the economy was reasonable I'd be living large. But the system is rigged against us so I have to struggle. I hate it. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Not trying to judge you but what did you get your degree in and have you considered moving to a different part of the country? I have met a few people in your position and, without projecting on your individual situation, often times reluctance to move (or lack of the money to do so) has held them back. </p></div>		</li>
