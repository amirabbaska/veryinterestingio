			<div class="markdown"><p>Ranger's jurisdiction extends beyond parks.  My friend in college found this out the hard way when he passed a park ranger on the highway.  (Well away from any parks)  My friend was going 15 over the speed-limit and flipping the ranger off because quote &quot;He's just a park ranger, he can't do anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Ranger turned his lights on, pulled us over, and ticketed my friend.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you are correct. Since Park Rangers are Federal law enforcement they have jurisdiction everywhere. However out of respect for other agencies they usually do not enforce laws in other jurisdiction, unless there is extraordinary circumstances. Or someone is being a dick.</p></div>		</li>
