			<div class="markdown"><p>One side note, raising algae instead of trees could cause worse problems. A few years ago near the Oregon coast, there was a huuuuge freak algae bloom, which led to sea foam of massive quantities, which is created because for some reason algae manufactures a natural soap, which erased the oils that keep bird feathers waterproof, so a few boatloads of seabirds died of hypothermia. The only cure for this was to bathe the birds with clean, non-foamy water and wait for them to make more of that waterproofing oil. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a happy medium. Too much oil is bad, but not enough and they just stick to the pan.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crowd funding guy here. Currently researching a campaign to do it here in the U.S.. </p>
<p>I did some simple math and discovered that if the average American planted just 2 trees a year for life, their carbon footprint would be gone in ~40 years, and reversed in 80.</p>
<p>The campaign focuses on arming the individual to combat change, because I believe our leaders clearly aren't going to do it, big business certainly isn't going to do it, so it's up to us. </p>
<p>Most of us aren't scientists or engineers... but we can plant trees. </p>
<p>Apparently we should all keep algae tanks instead? Guess I'll have to research that now. </p>
<p>Trying to find my original thread, I comment a lot.  </p>
<p>Edit: lol really? Downvotes? How dare I self servingly share my project about planting trees to save the world on a comment about planting trees to save the world. </p>
<p>Most people make little to no profit at all on crowdfunded projects, and I plan on keeping none of it, if that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To address your complaint about downvotes, that has to do with the crowdfunding, even though you didn't link it. When you're not asking for money, a harmless idea is just a harmless idea.</p>
<p>But when you turn it into a project and start asking for money, that invites a lot of scrutiny and criticism, and for good reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the US crowd fund name? I'd donate. </p>
<p>I've also been thinking of an app, let's call it Community Trees, to specifically crowd fund and organize tree planting. Ppl could propose tree projects, get approval from local private/public land owners, and then raise money for it. The idea would be to take advantage of local open spaces along roads or people's yards that don't have the resources to plant trees themselves. And people could donate money to spaces that they live near and pass by everyday. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand your point.  We're currently developing a series of guides for urban areas - take my home city of Philadelphia for example.  There are many areas that have no space for more trees, where trees would be a nuisance.</p>
<p>There are, however, <em>tons</em> of unused spaces, and Pennsylvania itself is filled to the brim with land worthy of planting trees on.  Everyone I know is within a 10 minute drive of a place that they could totally plant a tree - they just don't <em>feel</em> like they are - and I bet you are, too.</p>
<p>Sure if you're in an ultra metropolis like NYC, or in the desert, it may seem more difficult - but there is flora in every environment that supports humans - and therefore, there is a place to plant plants, if you truly want to.</p>
<p>Every single building has a roof.  A roof is a great place to grow plants - maybe not trees, but crunching the numbers on how many plants it'd take to equal one tree, and viola, three garden boxes on a roof a year, and your carbon footprint is erased.  There are vertical walls filled with plants that are easy to install - in France, it just became illegal to have a roof without either plants or solar panels.</p>
<p>People are on it, it is possible, I promise you.</p></div>		</li>
