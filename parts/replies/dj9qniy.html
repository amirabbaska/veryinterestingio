			<div class="markdown"><p>You did a lot of word dropping, there, and I'm not sure how many of us will know what you are talking about. Just take a pseudo-complex mission - like we want to launch a vehicle from Earth and place it into orbit around Europa. Can you walk us through what coordinate systems you would use for such a mission and what the basis for each coordinate system is?</p>
<p>Any references to Kerbal Space Program a definite bonus - in my brain that game lays out pretty well how the coordinate systems should generally work -- in a simplified way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are high fidelity satillite tool kits that exist. When I worked at NASA I used a commercial off the shelf program called Free Flyer. These softwares have a lot of useful tools built into them which makes importing and exporting a wide variety of data easy. In fact, Free Flyer is such an amazing program it feels as if you are playing Kerbal space program.</p></div>		</li>
