			<div class="markdown"><p>The Frye standard is still used in some state judicial systems.</p>
<p>But I speak from experience that almost any judge will toss expert testimony based on a polygraph, even in Frye state. However, the judge can admit any evidence they believe meets the standard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/next-case-on-the-court-colander/" target="_blank">Here's a Snopes discussion of it</a>. I've no idea if it actually happened or not â€” it is just part of the &quot;lore&quot; about polygraphs. <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/38982/wire-ripped-real-life" target="_blank">David Simon has reported</a> that similar sorts of misrepresentations have been used by police over the years. Simon's book <em>Homicide</em> describes the many ways, from his person experience, that detectives can misrepresent themselves to suspects and have it be deemed legal. (It's a great read, as an aside!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember being told in basic training that it was &quot;illegal&quot; to shoot a .50 caliber machine gun at a human being, but that you could shoot at their weapon/helmet/canteens etc. (which would obviously result in the enemy soldier getting shot as well) because that was equipment.  The story itself is not at all true, but the message it's imparting was a part of that culture.</p>
<p>I kind of feel like this xerox story serves kind of a similar purpose for the police, which makes me doubt that it ever actually happened. </p>
<p>Oh, and I just realized who I was talking to,  I really like your blog.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. That xerox story is hilarious.</p>
<p>And also kind of scary given that a recent TIL mentioned the things regularly caught fire.</p></div>		</li>
