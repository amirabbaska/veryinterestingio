			<div class="markdown"><p>YES!!!! THIS!!! Even if it's boiled, there are ways to make them better, good olive oil, a bit of peppers, garlic and good bread, and a delicious meal it's done. I actually like to put everything on a pan with a thread of olive oil (a good one) break the spices, and add the onions, garlic, then zucchini, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, everything cut small and raw, green wine, chicken stock and done, I can use this to eat with anything. Ironies of ironies, I learn this type of mixes (roasted chicken with french fries and vegetables), with the guys from fish &amp; chips lol. To awesome. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just that, but people are accustomed to veggies that aren't fresh, which taste very different. You can get frozen veggies, sure (and depending on how you're preparing them it doesn't make a ton of difference) but I know quite a few people who primarily ate vegetables out of cans and wouldn't try fresh versions because they assume it will taste like shit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the whole problem, people don't want to cook, they want food NOW.  Its easier to make a med-rare steak and potatoes than it is to cook a meal with veggies.</p>
<p>Lots of people just can't eat veggies much to, i can't eat salad, at all.  Or i run to restroom after 30min of eating it and shit lettuce.  Goes for most veggies i eat.   </p></div>		</li>
