<p>Billing costs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've always found paying for healthcare in this country weird. You goto a service provider and pay them a small visitation or co-pay. Then several dollars worth of care are done for you. Then you can go home. All the while your healthcare provider has to chase down the insurance company to get compensated for work that was done instead of getting directly paid by you.</p>
<p>Car repair, cleaning services, basically any other service provider does not work this way. How did american healthcare get screwed up? How did paying for healthcare directly get divorced from the point of receiving healthcare?</p>
<p>Note: I can understand billing an insurance policy if going in for life threatening or very expensive procedures. I'm talking about outpatient, urgent care which accounts for most healthcare in the USA.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense to use a distributed risk model for expensive treatments because the need for those treatments is distributed very unevenly. Individuals have only limited control over their health care needs, and those needs aren't elastic.</p>
<p>If you're going to distribute the cost of expensive treatments, then you <em>want</em> to distribute most if not all of the cost of primary care as well. You don't want people in your risk pool delaying primary care because of the upfront cost, because that will increase everyone's overall costs in the end. Primary care is extremely cheap (relatively speaking) and has a fantastic return on investment, even if you allow for a modest amount of overuse.</p></div>		</li>
