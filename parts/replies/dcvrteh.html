<p>I ment ask like if proton decay is real, and helium4 can decay into hydrogen3 (in this case the energy would be half of what colling helium4 to a anti proton would yield)that way, can helium4 also decay into helium3 using a similar process. </p>
<p>Yes i know (i think) about binding energy and stable isotopes and the different observed ways atoms can decay, but proton decay hypothesis predicts that all atoms will decay into em radiation eventually rigth?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, even if a free proton could decay (and of course there are scenarios how that would happen) the arguments I gave are valid. You cannot look at the individual particle, you have to look at the whole bound system.</p>
<p>Helium-4 could <del>never</del> decay into Hydrogen-3, <del>depending on the (hypothetical) decay products of the proton you'd need to look at the energy balance of the whole system before and after in detail.</del></p>
<p>edit: I stand corrected :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your answer here is technically correct (saying you have to look at the whole system), but off the mark.  Decay of nucleons via baryon-violating processes, such as occur in grand unified theories, would be occurring on such short distance scales that the nucleus in which the proton or stable neutron sits would be essentially irrelevant to the process, and, in addition, nuclear binding energies would never overcome the energy released in these processes.  For example, one of the standard proposed routes for proton decay is into a positron and a neutral pion; there isn't a nucleus you can think of where this wouldn't be allowed.  Likewise, if you had a neutron decay into a neutrino and a neutral pion, or an electron and positive pion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The neutron will only decay if the decayed state has less energy than the non-decayed state. Same for protons, if they do decay. </p></div>		</li>
