<p>Moving them horizontally would risk to damage them. One fake iguanodon is horizontally for display.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love that, initially (and for at least 50 years) early paleontologists believed that iguanodons' thumb spike was actually a nose spike, and that this helped popularize the notion that dinosaurs are closely related to extant lizards.

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not so bizarre when you consider the diversity of modern bird morphology - the modern day ancestors of dinosaurs. </p>
<p>What's silly is the lack of integument (feathers, fat, extra skin) in most dinosaur art. Dinosaur artists typically depict dindaurs in a &quot;shrink-wrapped&quot; way where the skin is just barely covering the bones. Which leads to the really mean, deathly looking dinos of pop culture.</p>
<p>tldr: dinosaur art typically depicts anorexic dinosaurs with mange instead of the feathered fluffy fatty dinosaurs that really would have existed.</p>
<p>Edit: An example of what I'm talking about. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fc/Emu-wild.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is an emu, <a href="http://www.skullcleaning.com/userfiles/image/services_photos_10_large.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> is an emu skeleton. Imagine if we drew an emu the way we drew dinosaurs and it would look like an entirely different beast. BTW, there's some evidence now that T. Rex's arms may have been awkwardly bent out like the Emu's little stubby wings.</p></div>		</li>

<p>One way scientists distinguish Dinosaurs from more basal archosaurs is from their very advanced ankles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually really amazing how much you are able to tell about how a creature looked just based on its skeleton. You basically have to very thoughtfully reverse engineer a creature's musculoskeletal system just using the support structures. How many holes are in the skull, how the teeth are set into the jaw, the angle and number of protrusions coming off the hips. These all can tell you a lot about the nature of the creature you are looking at. </p></div>		</li>

<p>The earliest known dinosaurs, such as iguanodons went through a few different permutations of what we thought they looked like.</p>

<p>This is most famously shown in their depiction at Crystal Palace in London.</p>

<p>It's pretty easy to see why they were named after iguana lizards after seeing those statues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were actually named that because, at first, all that was found was their teeth (iguanadon means iguana tooth)! And their <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/stevetearle/Brookside/assets/images/Iguanadon_Tooth_and_pound.jpg" target="_blank">leaf-shaped teeth</a> are similar-looking to <a href="http://www.savalli.us/BIO113/Labs/08.DietImages/IguanaTeeth.jpg" target="_blank">iguana teeth,</a> only way bigger.</p>
<p>They really just hadn't found very much of most of the animals depicted in Crystal Palace Park. Like, Megalosaurus <a href="http://palaeo.gly.bris.ac.uk/Palaeofiles/Frauds/owenmeg.jpg" target="_blank">was only known from this much, and they were totally guessing on the shape of the rest of the animal.</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't it the case that megalosaurus is still mostly guess work as only partial remains have ever been found?  We've no idea what it's head looks like as only partial bones from its skull have been found.</p></div>		</li>
