			<div class="markdown"><p>One slight correction: a tube/cylinder is actually flat in the geometric sense. When we embed this 2-dimensional space as a cylinder inside normal 3-dimensional space it happens to have curvature, but that is not the same thing as having an <em>intrinsic</em> curvature like the surface of a sphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(Repeating the question I asked someone else below)</p>
<p>Can you explain that a bit more? A cylinder can only be unrolled to obtain a flat sheet if you cut the cylinder, right?  Is that allowed in defining intrinsic curvature? </p>
<p><a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/IntrinsicCurvature.html" target="_blank">This definition</a> of intrinsic curvature says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>A curvature such as Gaussian curvature which is detectable to the &quot;inhabitants&quot; of a surface and not just outside observers. An extrinsic curvature, on the other hand, is not detectable to someone who can't study the three-dimensional space surrounding the surface on which he resides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if we inhabited a tube, heading in one direction means you get back to where you started while any other direction lets you continue forever without getting back to the starting point. That sounds like intrinsic curvature according to this definition. </p>
<p>Hoping you can clarify.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The real definition is much more technical than that.</p>
<p>What MathWorld is getting at is that intrinsic curvature is “local”, meaning that it shows up in measurements of arbitrarily small regions (“neighborhoods”) of the space. Since you can unroll any sufficiently small region of the cylinder to be entirely flat without stretching it, its intrinsic curvature is zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of wrapping a cylindrical object with wrapping paper. You can do it without creasing the paper because the wrapping paper (a plane) and a cylinder have the same intrinsic geometry. Both are considered Euclidean. </p>
<p>Contrast this with trying to wrap a bowling ball with wrapping paper. You can't do it cause a sphere is not Euclidean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually a cylinder is not flat in the geometric sense. You remark about an intrinsic curvature, and an infinitely long rod does have an intrinsic curvature. There exists a direction on said rod where if you travel long enough in that direction you will end up back at your starting location. That is a detectable curvature by those that reside within the world of the infinite rod, and one need not be an outside observer to discover that property.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a manifestation of extrinsic curvature, specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_curvature" target="_blank">mean curvature</a>. A plane and a cylinder are locally isometric, and therefore have the same intrinsic curvature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry, you are wrong. When mathematicians use the word &quot;flat&quot; in this context, they mean that the intrinsic curvature is zero. The intrinsic curvature of a cylinder is zero. This can be seen intuitively by the fact that a cylinder can be unrolled to obtain a flat sheet (without locally distorting lengths).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would like to add some information:</p>
<p>Euclid is the Jesus of mathematics: sometime over 2000 years ago, he wrote a book with some basic rules (axioms) that people agreed with until a few hundred years ago, people started questioning it.</p>
<p>The explanation of curves as opposed to flat is a good explanation—I personally really like the explanation of cutting an orange into eighths and you can have a triangle with three right angles, which relates to this explanation. These types of non-Euclidean geometry reject the fifth axiom, which is the parallel postulate. This is the postulate that states that if you have a line and a point not on that line, there is exactly one line that goes through that point that is parallel to the line. When you reject this postulate, you get the geometries listed above.</p>
<p>However—there are non-Euclidean geometries that reject other axioms instead. They just usually are not what we talk about when we talk about non-Euclidean geometry.</p>
<p>Specifically, one type is called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry" target="_blank">taxicab geometry</a>. It is a geometry in which the shortest distance between two points is not necessarily a straight line because you are only allowed to move up, down, left, right, like a taxi driving on streets in a grid.</p>
<p>While this geometry is not one we apply in math nearly as often as hyperbolic or elliptic geometry (the geometries that reject the parallel postulate), it has some cool implications. For example—and I raged on this one so angrily when I realized it was right—a circle in this universe would look completely different and would have pi equal to exactly 4.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting thing about Taxicab geometry is that it too has real world implications. Yes in the real world a straight line might be the shortest distance, but even in ye'olden times they would say things like 'Five miles away as the crow flies' because they knew that people couldn't fly like crows and the distance would be greater.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So it would not be the same direction because it would be the other direction. Not the same direction.</p></div>		</li>
