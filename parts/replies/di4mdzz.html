			<div class="markdown"><p>Really good point.  This is also important in food production equipment.  Proper sanitary design always calls for slotted screws so they can be easily washed out and don't end up holding any food or bacteria. </p></div>		</li>

<p>the master of this is the shittiest of all screw heads, the flat head. The only tool you need to clear the slot of a flat head screw is the screwdriver you're going to use to unscrew it. No other screw type has that ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally you don't even need a screwdriver, just a flat tool sufficiently hard and of proper size.</p>
<p>This is why you see flathead on a lot of military firearms. You can take it apart &amp; put it together with anything that will fit and be strong enough to not bend or break.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Older military weapons yes. But Thay is why we went to pins. But yes military equipment in general use flathead or we change them out with what is laying around.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What kind of military forearms are you using? Every gun I've ever taken apart doesn't require any tools. Instead, they use takedown and pivot pins in the case of rifles and slide releases in case of pistols.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually, the screw heads are sized to use a cartridge rim as a screwdriver. I usually use a normal (although fitted and hollow-ground) flathead blade instead. It's much easier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, flathead screwdrivers easily slip off the head of the screw, thus allowing you impale yourself with the tip.  Craming the wound with dirt and grease where extreme pain, bleeding and infection occur.  Good times!</p></div>		</li>
