<p>The company budget for the safety training of the crew was US$2, which was used to buy a paper certificate.</p>

<p>Wow.  They really <em>would</em> have been better off with no safety budget at all: the optics on that are just offensive.</p>
<p>Thank you for the link: I hadn't kept up on how that played out.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The captain had abandoned the ship with passengers still aboard the ferry, while South Korean law explicitly requires captains to remain on the ship during a disaster. Two other crew members, a helmsman and the third mate, were also arrested on that day on suspicion of negligence and manslaughter.</p>
<p>Three crew members, Park Ji-young, Jeong Hyun-seon, and Kim Ki-woong, are credited by survivors with staying aboard the ferry to help passengers escape. All three went down with the sinking vessel.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get that it's the rules and as part of accepting that type of job you take responsibilities like that.</p>
<p>But, can you honestly blame someone for escaping a sinking ship?</p>
<p>The three that stayed died, and while I admire their bravery and they undoubtedly saved a lot of lives. Their families have lost them, for the sake of total strangers lives.</p>
<p>I suppose in an ideal situation with proper regulations etc, the crew remain only to coordinate escape then leave as well and in theory everyone should be fine, but these staff members must have known how bad the situation was, and the chance of everyone getting off alive slim to none, so yes the ones who stayed are brave and i'm sure those they saved are incredibly grateful, but I can't really blame the ones who left for just trying to survive. (anything else they did to contribute to the accident in the first place aside, just talking strictly escaping sinking boat here...)</p>
<p>You say a persons character really shows through, but lets be honest most people would do the same thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crew told the kids to stay in their cabin, while the ship was sinking. They were to busy getting off the ship, nobody bothered to tell the kids to evacuate. There is a video from one of the kids which shows these kids didn't even realize (initially not realizing the ship was in serious trouble) how serious the situation was. I'll look it up. The captain was one of the first that got off the ship and left them all to die.  link to video <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/05/01/south-korea-ferry-student-cellphone-video/8558607/" target="_blank">(not for the weak at heart)</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>And thats why most people aren't suited to being a captain of a large people carrier like this one. They get a big-ass pay-check for captaining vessels like this, and that pay-check is for the training you have, experience you have and responsibility you have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, i can blame them for leaving their post. Part of the job is taking on the responsibility for those on your vessel. Left without guidance, passengers are prone to panic and make a bad situation an absolute uncontrollable cluster fuck. It's the job of the crew to ensure that there's clear guidance in place, even if they're bluffing and have no clue what to do. That's just part of the job. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Others in the South Korea maritime industry only see that they died during the sinking trying to rescue the passengers from for what is probably systemic deficiencies that they are privy to, but no one will dare discuss even in a government investigation.<br />
Corruption runs deep, because you don't know what you don't know.   Fear of retaliation is a motherfucker.</p></div>		</li>
