			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw some documentary (or possibly home-filed youtube video) that showed a guy who built one in his house.  Basically it was a chimney behind glass that would heat up. When the heat rose out of the chimney, it would pull in fresh air from a below-earth vent tube that would pull cool air into/through the house.  </p>
<p>This wasn't for power but rather for cooling the house.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very rarely to almost never.  The cost of running water up to the roof isn't nothing, and while water is very cheap electricity is also very cheap.</p>
<p>Even in thick layers, pollen doesn't block out all the light.  For instance <a href="https://newenglandcleanenergy.com/energymiser/2013/06/25/its-pollen-season-do-you-know-what-your-panels-are-doing/" target="_blank">this post</a> indicates they saw a .7% drop in overall production on uncleaned cells.  Solar cells are also higher up, somewhat away from where the pollen settles, and more exposed to wind.  They get washed in the next rain too.</p>
<p>Generally it can be a problem in low-rain, high-dust areas, but those areas also tend to have a very high level of solar irradiance.  For instance the southwestern US dust can produce a 20% drop in power (in the extreme), but there's 40% more sunlight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, sometimes the home owners wash them sometimes they just get coated and stay that way. </p>
<p>In a recent study out of China and India the losses experienced when covered with the dust and dirt there losses range from 15 up to 25% in some places.  The worst being when the dust contains a lot of metal particles.  </p>
<p>WASH THEM WITH WARM WATER if you're going to wash your panels at home. Some installers say it's a myth but I assure you it's not.  You can shatter your panels if you spray cold water on them in the heat of the day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You really have to think of it as $/kWh. If your fancy triple junction, germanium arsenic panel give you twice the efficiency but cost 10 times as much it's not worth it. The issue with solar panels is almost never the actual surface you have available. The more important thing is how long will they take to pay for themselves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The highest is ~46%.  Cells like that operate at high temperatures using many different kinds of semiconductors, not just silicon.  They are also multijunction, meaning they're kind of like a bunch of different cells laminated over each other.  The cost of solar cells is mostly in turning the silicon into cells, not the silicon itself, so multi-junction cells are much more expensive for diminishing returns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You need exotic (crazy expensive) materials to get those 40% cells. Really, 15% is fine, most people have plenty of spare roof area for panels. The metric that really matters is cost per kilowatt, which has been steadily coming down, even as efficiency is fairly flat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I am an engineer and have developed experimental solar thermal systems for a living, so I can maybe clear up a few misconceptions.</p>
<p>First off, practically this type of system would be a nightmare, but not because it cannot be done with simple off the shelf components.</p>
<p>A simple vacuum tube solar collector can deliver 250 °C heat easy. No tracking or lenses required. This is however terribly inefficient. You would like to run your system at as low an outlet and inlet temperature as possible and above 80 °C it starts to have significant losses.</p>
<p>Secondly using water circulation in such a system would be asking for trouble, so a heat pipe would be better.</p>
<p>Lastly any kind of conversion from heat to electricity will always come with energy loss. This is why small thermal systems should primarily be used for space heating and hot water. This is however at great way to reduce electricity consumption, if you have this as your heat source.</p>
<p>Hope this helped, and if anyone builds such a system &quot;vacuum tube collector + stirling engine&quot; please post pictures and spec! :) -Science</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought that PV panels are cheap enough now that it's more economical to oversize a PV system and to run heat pumps for heating and hot water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is definitely possible and as the PV price continues to drop this is possible. But if you are in an area with good netmetering (sending electricity to the grid) this might be better, and then have a small part of the roof dedicated to hot water and heating.</p>
<p>The only general thing you can say is that, as prices between the two system types changes so should the system you consider building. :)    </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, if it's not connected to anything.  But its output temperature drops dramatically as you try to draw more heat from it: see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal_collector#/media/File:SolarCollectorsCompare1.jpg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_thermal_collector#/media/File:SolarCollectorsCompare1.jpg</a> but swap the horizontal and vertical axes.  As power output goes up, delta-T plummets to zero very quickly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The equation is quite simple: input energy - energy losses = available energy. At 250 °C energy losses are almost (or exactly) equal to the input energy. This is also why they do not get any hotter. :)</p>
<p>But in the original calculation you needed just over 115 °C. According to the graph you provided (which seems reasonable) at a delta-T of 90 °C (just outside the chart so we can reasonably extrapolate) we can expect between 4 and 5 kWh/day. Not great but usable. :) -Science</p></div>		</li>
