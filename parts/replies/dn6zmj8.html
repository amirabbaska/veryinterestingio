			<div class="markdown"><p>The admiral would probably love to fire six shots for 150k than one cruise missile for 1.5 million.</p>
<p>...Or however much those things cost.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not entirely sure but i would expect that it probably is easier. I'm not actually a drop-short I just spent 12 months working with an artillery unit. I've never fired anything bigger than the 60mm but know that its something that can be done with conventional shells and that both large mortar and howetzer shells use variable charges. I don't know how important that is for MRSI though.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not just for artillery. English Longbowmen could sometimes get up to five arrows to hit their target at the same time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP quotes &quot;10 shots per minute&quot;. So you would fire 1 shot per 6 seconds. So 6 shots per 36 seconds. To achieve that multiple shots reach the target at the same time you would need to anticipate a target's location 36 seconds in advance which seems non-realistic for a moving target. Therefore no one would bother with it on moving targets.</p>
<p>It could however be used for intimidation in the opening attack against a stationary target.</p></div>		</li>
