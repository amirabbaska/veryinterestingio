			<div class="markdown"><p>Historical footnote here.</p>
<p>Around 1770, when the team of Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon was surveying the eponymous line in the American colonies, they used a common technique where they would survey a section moving forward, then survey it again in the opposite direction for verification.</p>
<p>The two lines might not match perfectly, but if done correctly the errors would statistically average out over time.</p>
<p>But in fact the errors tended north; it appeared that their instruments were somehow getting pulled north very slightly.</p>
<p>Communicating back to the Royal Society in England about this phenomenon, another surveyor speculated that the Allegheny Mountains were producing a gravitational pull that was causing the peculiar readings.</p>
<p>An experiment was approved, and upon his return to England, Mason surveyed the island country to find a mountain matching various criteria such as distance from nearby mountains, prominence, circular symmetry, etc.</p>
<p>Locating a good test mountain, another surveying team was dispatched in his place.</p>
<p>This team had several goals.</p>
<p>One of them was to attempt to measure the volume of the mountain.</p>
<p>Another was to measure gravitational deflection toward the mountain.</p>
<p>And a third was to take astronomical readings from positions near the mountains to provide baselines for the deflections.</p>
<p>After all of this was completed, they came up with a number suggesting the mass of the mountain, as well as numbers indicating the gravitational ratio between the mountain and the Earth altogether.</p>
<p>The latter ratios were such that the Earth was projected to be significantly more dense than the mountain was, by nearly a factor of two, resulting in the first scientific evidence for an extremely dense planetary core.</p>
<p>This also let them extrapolate the mountain's mass number to the spherical size of the Earth altogether, giving them the projected mass of the Earth.</p>
<p>Even with their relatively simple instruments, the tiny nature of the deflections involved, the nearly pulled-out-of-a-hat mass of the mountain, and the relative newness of Newtonian physics, that second number turned out to be, by far, the most accurate measurement of the Earth's mass that had ever been taken, being a mere 20% off modern measurements.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schiehallion_experiment</a></p>
<p>An additional footnote (!) is that this experiment also resulted in the invention of contour lines to assist in surveying the mountain.</p>
<p>So in addition to changing our understanding of astronomy, geology, gravitation, and physics, this experiment also practically invented topographical cartography.</p>
<p>And all because a couple guys trying to draw a line through Pennsylvania started scratching their heads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Step 1: Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, F = G (m1 * m2)/r^2</p>
<p>So we take the Earth and an object of known mass as m1 and m2, and measure the force with which that object is pulled towards the Earth. We also separately know the radius of the Earth. All that's left to determine is the constant G; then we can solve for m1 to get the Earth's mass.</p>
<p>Step 2: The value of G was measured experimentally by Henry Cavendish in the 18th century, by careful measurement of the horizontal gravitational force between two metal spheres.</p></div>		</li>

<p>studying the orbits of satellites around Earth</p>

<p>Can you explain a bit more about this? How can we see that the mass of the earth is not evenly distributed by looking at satellites?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the Earth were a perfect sphere, satellite orbits would be perfect ellipses that never change.</p>
<p>However, the Earth is slightly oblate - it's wider than it is tall, so someone standing at the equator is slightly farther from the center than if they were standing at the pole. Accordingly, the gravitational field is also slightly oblate, so orbiting satellites will experience a little more or a little less gravity at various location in their orbit than if the gravitational field were perfectly spherical. The exact shape of the gravitational field is also affected by deeper layers such as the inner core, which is also slightly oblate.</p>
<p>This causes two effects - the orbit wobbles (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/HSk2HRe.gif" target="_blank">regression of the nodes</a>), and the orbit rotates (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/hSbAnvy.jpg" target="_blank">precession of perihelion</a>), both of which we can observe very precisely. Exactly how quickly each of these effects happen depends a lot on the exact shape of the gravitational field, which in turn depends on not only its oblateness (as well as <a href="http://i.imgur.com/d4OnpZ7.gif" target="_blank">higher order moments</a>), but also the internal density structure of the planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Satellite orbits can be studied thoroughly for deviations with respect to the most simple example: a satellite orbiting a point-mass Earth.  Deviations from the 'trajectory that follows from this simple example' can be interpreted and can be used to re-construct the gravity field of Earth. The 'larger' effects, such as the flattening of the Earth, can result in deviations of roughly a few kilometres with respect to the simple model. The smaller the deviations you can measure, the more accurate you can re-construct a gravity field model.</p>
<p>The GRACE mission was a key player in determining Earth's gravity field to extreme detail, as was the GOCE mission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/spekboffer did a good job explaining it, and the grace mission is something really interesting to look into!  But, incase it wasn't clear from their description, I'll briefly point out <em>how</em> that measurement can actually work:</p>
<p>An orbit is merely a trajectory where you continually miss the surface (hopefully) indefinitely!  Because of this, you want to be moving fast enough horizontally (parallel to the surface) that the earth's surface curves away from you as fast as you're falling.  If you go too fast, you'll fly away from earth, too slow, and you'll fall down to the surface.  This is the most BASIC description of an orbit.  </p>
<p>But, you can see that, your speed in an orbit, is intimately related to how fast you're falling.  If you're not falling very fast, you don't need to move very fast horizontally to stay in orbit.  (Hopefully you can see that is true!). Now the speed at which you are falling is directly related to how &quot;hard&quot; gravity is pulling down on you.  The stronger a grip gravity has on you, the faster you'll fall, and thus the faster your orbital speed will be!</p>
<p>Now on Earth, the gravity is more or less the same everywhere, and for most elementary problems (if you've ever taken entry level physics, or even intermediate mechanics), the earth can be treated as a homogeneous sphere, as that is a decent approximation.  But, reality is a bit more complicated than that.  Imagine you're on a satellite over flat land, then your satellite flies over a mountain 1 mile tall.  All of a sudden, you have a whole mile of extra rock below you!  That's a lot of extra mass which creates a stronger gravitational field!  When you fly through that field, it pulls you a bit closer to the earth, which increases your speed!  It's easy to see how this can happen with a mountain, but the same holds true for if you fly over rock with a higher density than other rock.  A difference in mass leads to a difference in gravity which leads to a difference in speeds!  Measure your speed closely enough, and you can calculate how the mass below you has changed!  </p>
<p>This can be incredibly precise, and GRACE, was actually used to see the depletion of ground water in places like California.  This is because dry ground is less dense than saturated ground, meaning it has less mass and thus a weaker gravitational field!  </p>
<p>Edit:  I simplified some things just I have it make sense, but if anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to discuss it further and even go into the math behind it a bit if anyone wants!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi</p>
<p>So my question is that if Venus doesn't have a magnetic field, why hasn't it's atmosphere been depleted by the solar wind?</p>
<p>Also, my knowledge at the moment is that Earth's magnetosphere stops our atmosphere being pushed off the planet by the solar wind. Mars has less of a magnetosphere, hence its now thin atmosphere. Or am I wrong with this assumption?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>It's a super-common myth that a magnetosphere is required to maintain an atmosphere.</p>
<p>Is it true that a lack of magnetosphere hastened Mars' atmospheric loss? Yes. Do all atmospheres require a magnetosphere to protect them? No. Would most of Mars' atmosphere still have been lost even it had a magnetosphere? Probably...it would have just taken longer.</p>
<p>There are many, many different kinds of atmospheric loss processes, and solar wind sputtering is just one of them. In fact, some atmospheric loss processes can only occur <em>with</em> a magnetosphere, such as polar outflow and charge exchange, which does happen for Earth.</p>
<p>How quickly an atmosphere is lost depends on a large number of variables, including the planet's escape velocity, the temperature of the upper atmosphere, the molecular weight of the atmosphere, active replenishment, the presence of a magnetosphere, etc. Just because the lack of magnetosphere helped speed up Mars' atmospheric loss does not mean that would necessarily happen for other planets.</p>
<p>For the case of Venus, its escape velocity is much higher (due to higher mass), its upper atmosphere is actually quite cold (unlike its scorchingly hot surface), its molecular weight is quite high (since it's made of CO2), and it's actively being replenished by volcanoes. All of these things far outweigh the effect of not having a magnetosphere.</p></div>		</li>
