			<div class="markdown"><p>I can offer insight into this whole situation from the perspective someone who ended up addicted to prescription narcotics.  Especially the part where you mentioned the doctor might be in on it, making money from it.  I found myself in the midst of that reality.  A doctor (my mom's cardiologist, actually) with loose ethics, a prescription pad, and what I'm guessing was a fat deal with big-pharma to give people percocet.  He handed it out like candy on Halloween.</p>
<p>I've told the story here before, so I'll do what feels wrong and just quote myself instead of typing it all out again.</p>

<p>Comment I was replying to, by /u/Rainbow_Gamer</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, once your kids are old enough you should tell them. Drug education is absolutely horrendous in the US (not sure if that's where you are) and most people think prescription = safe. You would not believe the amount of suburban housewives popping pills nearly every night while at the same time talking about potheads like they are the scum of the Earth. They can't fathom that a drug prescribed by a doctor could be dangerous and addictive. Many people have no idea how easy it is to get hooked on pills and only learn through getting addicted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My reply:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You're absolutely correct.</p>
<p>I was one of those people, including being scornful of other drugs users even if all they used was pot.</p>
<p>I saw drugs ruin my entire family, including taking out two of my brothers. I was ardently anti-drug. So much so that I was judgmental about it, and wouldn't even associate with people who smoked pot (I've since corrected that about myself, both the judgment and my view on marijuana). I sometimes wonder how many amazing people I lost out on knowing because of that.</p>
<p>Anyway, about 6 years ago I was prescribed perocet after some rather involved oral surgery. I didn't even want to take them, given that they're an opioid. The pain was just too much though, so I took one.</p>
<p>I liked it, a lot. So I took another, then another. Before I even realized what I was doing I was addicted. I soon found myself consumed by it, always thinking about the next one (at first I timed my usage so I didn't OD, or raise suspicions), making sure I had enough to get by before the next refill, etc.</p>
<p>I then met a doctor with loose ethics. All I had to say was &quot;it hurts...&quot; and I'd have a new script in-hand. I didn't even have to explain myself, or what hurt. I then found out he'd authorize refills over the phone, no visit required. &quot;Oops, I dumped them in the toilet accidentally.&quot; New script. We all know I hadn't really accidentally dumped them into the toilet.</p>
<p>Now I had two bottles at once!</p>
<p>That went on for two years. At this point I was taking between 8+ a day, just to get by. Then one day I had a moment of clarity as I was about to pop a couple more. I looked into my hand, saw them sitting there, and asked myself, &quot;Why are you doing this? You're not in pain.&quot; I then thought back to my brothers, and how drugs had cost them their lives. I also thought of my mother, and how alcohol had ruined hers as well.</p>
<p>I knew I had to stop. I threw them all away and, thanks to the support of my partner at the time, I have been clean for almost 4 years now. I wont say it was easy, the urge to just call that doctor up. I still miss them sometimes. I dream about them, from time to time.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for it though, in the end. I learned a great deal about the power of addiction, and how easily it can sneak up on and then overtake you. I also learned that not every addict is some worthless wretch worthy of condemnation. It taught me to be more careful about the judgments I make about people, and to be more open with others. I don't know their life, or what they're dealing with.</p>
<p>I've seen articles talking about the silent epidemic of opiate addiction in the United States. It really is everywhere now, and it's so easy to get. It's frightening.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>To add to this, explaining why it was my mom's cardiologist, and not my dentist, giving me these prescriptions it was because my dentist cut me off.  I explained further down the comment chain in the original post that my dentist refused to give me more after the first ones were gone.</p>
<p>My mom had-had the same cardiologist for years, and had become a sort of friend of the family.  While in his office one day I mentioned to him that I'd recently had this surgery, was in pain, and the dentist wouldn't give me anything stronger than ibuprophen.  That's all I had to say and the rest, well, is quoted above. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Drop the rhetoric. It is illegal for pharma to pay doctors for writing scripts. And even if it weren't, Percocet is cheap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. I hear this over and over again. Doctors do not get kickbacks from writing prescriptions for one drug or another. It happened in the past, but the laws regulations have made it enough of a crime that a pharmaceutical company would not want to take the risk. Yes, drug reps drop of literature and post-it notes on weekly basis, but they can't offer anything of value in exchange for scripts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Congrats on getting clean but I need to ask, did you ever poop? </p>
<p>I had my tonsils out as an adult and had an opiate prescribed for 2 weeks. The pain was excruciating so I took them on time every day to stay ahead of the pain, still had break through pain that required ibuprofen too. I didn't shit for a solid 2 weeks. I stopped taking the pain meds and had a clearer head, which led to my realization that I hadn't shit in quite some time. </p>
<p>I had to take some heavy duty laxatives to get the pipes working again. I imagine being an addict maybe your body adjusted or maybe that's exactly how the supreme leader doesn't ever poop, idk... Just curious if it affected you in that way</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would have affected me in that way, save for one thing.</p>
<p>I'm lactose intolerant and my diet at that time included a more than fair share of cheese (lactose intolerance be damned, I'm not giving up cheese or ice cream!).</p>
<p>So on one hand I had the opiate slowing things down, and the lactose intolerance trying to speed things up.  It ended up creating a sort of balance.</p>
<p>Honestly, that was probably the only positive thing in the whole ordeal.  I could eat dairy and not have to worry about being within a sprint away from a toilet.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know, for someone who had an addiction problem, you sure don't seem to have gotten to the stage of taking responsibility. You seem to place all the blame on everyone else.</p>
<p>We live in an era of infinite information. It is not hard to find out these drugs can be addictive. Like, you don't even have try to figure that out. It is not your doctors responsibility to stop you from being a drug addict.</p>
<p>Honestly, posts like yours make me so mad because it is people like you that make it hard for people like my wife to get her medicine without being judged. </p>
<p>Medicine is a PARTNERSHIP between doctor and patient. You have as much responsibility as the doctor to inform yourself. To advocate for yourself. </p>
<p>Everyone should always read about surgeries, their conditions, and pills to know what they are getting into.</p>
<p>Finally, accusing doctor of having loose ethics just because you were able to scam them is incredibly unfair. </p>
<p>Believe it or not, some doctors don't feel like they need to treat every patient like lying drug addicts. That doesn't make them ethically loose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nowhere in my comment did I place blame on anyone, that wasn't the point of relating my experience.  I explained how, and where, I was able to get so much of the drug I shouldn't have been able to continuously get.  That's all I was trying to do.</p>
<p>Taking responsibility for it, which I've done (and since you don't know me, or live my daily life, don't presume to know that I haven't), and placing blame aren't the same things.  An explanation of the factors that allowed it to happen has nothing to do with blame, or who's getting the lion's share of it.  If you wanted an assessment of blame, you missed the point.</p>
<p>I could write a litany about blame, who owns what share of it, and why, but I don't see a point in that.  It solves nothing.  I just wanted to tell my story, my experience with this.</p>
<p>It's not a unique story either.  I've watched quite a few documentaries about this problem, now that I experienced it myself, and the data is in.  It shows the overwhelming majority of people addicted to prescription opiates are getting them from doctors, not street dealers.  There exists a massive incentive program, multiple actually, for doctors to push these drugs and earn compensation from the manufacturers when they do.</p>
<p>However, if you were looking for a statement of blame, which I believe to be pointless, then I'll say this.  Putting them into my mouth, abusing them, was my decision and my decision alone (something I think I mentioned further in the chain of the discussion I linked, but I'm not quite sure if i did or not).  Nobody forced me.  That's my responsibility in this.</p>
<p>I never blamed the doctor for my abusing them, but to say he wasn't a key component in this cycle of abuse would be a lie.  I mentioned him because he was a key figure in getting my hands on so many of these pills.  A situation that without him wouldn't have been likely, or even possible.  If that, to you, amounts to assigning him blame, then so be it.</p>
<p>As for my statement that he did have loose ethics, I stand by it and I would go ever further.  I would suggest he had none at all, when looking at the totality of the situation.  Just because he is the <em>doctor</em> doesn't mean he's on the side of right by default.  He doesn't have entitlement to some sort of grand virtue and exoneration for his actions any more than I do.</p>
<p>Prescription narcotics are dangerous, they kill, and they're also feeding the heroin epidemic now gripping the country.  If you're refiling scripts, for a patient who isn't even yours, so much that it allows them to maintain a habit of taking 8+ of them a day for two years, without questions, then your ethics as a physician aren't just loose, they're completely absent.</p>
<p>When a drug is so ubiquitous that its abuse is now being referred to as an epidemic, and that drug requires a prescription to access, then yes, the doctors writing them do have an accountability in this.  Especially so if they're involved in one of the many pharmaceutical schemes that reward them for selling the product.  That's not just ethically loose, it's egregious and wanton.  Even more so now that we know the truth about the dangers of prescription opiates.</p>
<p>I should never be able to call a doctor on the phone, a doctor of whom I am not even a patient, and get multiple scripts per month for a narcotic substance.  Even if he is a family friend.  In fact, in that situation one would think the more ethical thing to do would be to refer the person to another doctor who doesn't have a familial connection to the patient in question.  We're talking about narcotics, not a checkup.</p>
<p>Yes, a portion of the responsibility is on me.  However, every part of the system that's setup to stop this from being possible failed, including the doctor at the top of this chain writing one script after another, after another, after another.  So yes, he is responsible too.  </p>
<p>So is the pharmaceutical industry who manufactures and <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/chasing-heroin/" target="_blank">lied about its dangers and addictive nature</a>.  This was proven, that they knew and lied, not only to the public, but also to the FDA/doctors.  Now that we know however, the prescriptions just keep coming thanks to incentive programs.  So you could say greed also deserves a share of the responsibility here, on account both the doctor for wanting incentives to sell narcotics, and the pharmaceutical companies for wanting to sell so much of it.</p>
<p>As for scamming the doctor, I don't think saying &quot;it hurts&quot; amounts to scamming.  I didn't beg, or entice.  He didn't even ask me why I wanted it when I specified Percocet, or specifically what was hurting.  I just said I was in pain, that Percocet helps, and he wrote the prescription as if he was giving me Tylenol.  I wasn't even one of his patients, he didn't have access to my history, my medical state, my prescription history, nothing.</p>
<p>I've had to deal with more bureaucracy getting my ID renewed at the DMV than I did getting virtually unlimited access to a Schedule II narcotic.</p>
<p>If you say it was scamming because I wanted it, but did not need it, then yes I guess I did and I own that.  Though in the moment I <em>thought</em> I needed it. </p>
<p>That's the nature of addiction, rational thought isn't exactly foremost.  If it was then addiction wouldn't be what it is and it wouldn't kill as many as it does.  That's one of the things I learned in all this.  They aren't thinking clearly, so judging the addict doesn't serve a purpose, and ending up an addict was far easier than I ever knew.   </p>
<p>As for your comments about partnership, I disagree that medicine itself is a partnership.  Especially when you're talking about a situation that involves dangerous and/ore addictive substances.</p>
<p><em>Healthcare</em> is a partnership between patient and doctor.  Medicine is too, but only to a point.  Long-term medication, what options are best for the patient, etc., yes.  However, when it comes to what is supposed to be short-term use of a highly addictive, and potentially dangerous medication, the onus to educate the patient about that is on the professional in that situation.  &quot;This is what I'm prescribing, here's what it's for, here are the risks...&quot;  The onus to cut that patient off when abuse is suspected is also on the professional, such as what my dentist did.</p>
<p>Expecting an addict to self-police shows a gross misunderstanding of the nature of addiction.  It's the same perspective I had before I experienced the other side of the coin.</p>
<p>I knew percocet was addictive to a point, I'm not an idiot, and I knew it can cause liver damage when taken over long periods (due to it's backer being Acetaminophen).  Knowing that, logically, and understanding how quickly the addiction can set it, how powerful it can be once it has, etc., are two entirely different things.  I had never experienced addiction before, and I truly had no idea addiction to this substance could occur within the span of consuming just one full prescription.</p>
<p>That's why one of the suggestions on how to combat this problem is prescribing fewer pills per bottle.  The bottle I was given had 30 in it and they were the highest dosage available (10mg).  Another suggestion is not starting the patience at the strongest dosage.  Start them with a lower dosage and if that's not working then increase it, over time, requiring them to surrender the remainder of the previous bottle in the process (so they can't double-up, reducing access).</p>
<p>Finally, </p>
<p>I think you came to this post already angry about your wife being judged and you found a target to vent on.  That's fine, I can understand that urge.  I am sorry that your wife finds herself in this situation, and for whatever part I may have played in her experiencing judgment I am sorry for that too.</p>
<p>It changes nothing to say this now, but I wanted my experience with opiate addiction to happen about as much as you want your wife to be judged unfairly by others.</p>
<p>As for this post, I related a story about a how easy it is to get addicted to narcotics, how easy it was to access them when it shouldn't be, and the insight I gained from that experience.  Now I try to educate people who will listen about how easy it is to become addicted, how easy it is to access these substances, and that there's a serious problem with this system.</p>
<p>That is my only goal in relating my experience, but take from it what you will.  If you want to be angry then be angry, but try to make something constructive come from it instead of allowing it to fuel judgment and animosity towards people whose shoes you haven't walked in, or a situation you haven't experienced.</p>
<p>I wish you, and your wife, the best.  Hopefully whatever situation she's in that makes her need strong pain management eases and she is able to find some peace.</p>
<p>Also, thank you if you actually read all of this.  I didn't intend for this reply to be this long, but this is a complex, and now deeply personal, subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: The link I included in the pharma section is to a FRONTLINE documentary about the manipulation of the FDA/doctors regarding prescription narcotics, and how that ultimately lead to the heroin epidemic now gripping the country (Many of the people, when cutoff from their prescription supply, turn to heroin, a street opiate, to feed their addiction.  Thankfully, I did not.).  I think it also goes over the incentive/kickback programs for prescribing them, but it's been a while since I watched it.  It's an eyeopening piece of journalism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a patient who requested pain narcotics. She had been a long time patient and our provider didn't see anything wrong with giving her a single prescription for pain management.</p>
<p>The pharmacy actually contacted our office to inform that she also has standing and filled Rx for similar opiates from other medical offices. Needless to say our provider canceled the order.</p>
<p>This patient called our office ALLLL DAY LONG. Requesting to speak with the doctor. Our doctor said she will not fill it because she already has several Rx and prescribing any more would be irresponsible. </p>
<p>That explaination did not work.  She kept our lines busy first calmly saying she was in pain; then slightly more aggressively that we do not care about her and finally loudly and angrily that she will sue and call her insurance and the licensing boards and everyone she could imagine to close down our office.</p>

<p>This is why I just roll my eyes when I see people on reddit screaming about how opioids are too hard to get and all these people in pain that legitimately need them aren't able to get them. I work in the industry .. I know how rare that is from firsthand experience. They act like any attempt to curb opioid abuse is somehow inhuman. </p>
<p>Yeah - attempting to prevent 12,000+ completely preventable and unnecessary deaths is <em>so</em> inhuman. /s</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I've suffered from chronic back pain for the past 20+ years. In that time frame I've found it easier to just buy what I need off the street, than attempt to get a script from a doctor. I only need about 90-120 tabs a year, and have been turned down 50+ times from doctors. The best that I've ever been given was 30 tabs of 10mg of hydocoidin with zero refills, and sadly that was from a dentist for my teeth. I was able to make that script last almost three months.</p>
<p>Every time I attempt to get a script from a doctor they accuse me of being an addict. I only use them when my back pops out of place, and if I don't get any within 12 hours, I can't walk for over a week. This happens about three times a year.</p>
<p>Luckily I know several people that are abusing the system and get 120+ tabs a month, and sell ALL of them. They pay  a $10-20 copayment, and then resell them for $1,000. </p>
<p>I wish I could find a doctor that would just get me a script for 15-30 a month. I own several businesses, and without the medications, I'm unable to work. I hire out any work that requires any type of lifting, since I'm always afraid of throwing out my back. I also visit chiropractors about two- four times a month. I have spend over $4000 in the past five years attempting to find a mattress that doesn't make me wake up in agonizing pain. I also own an Inversion table, that gets used regularly.</p>
<p>I don't understand how people faking pain get the scripts so easily, and I always get turned down. I honestly HATE the buzz they give me. I always only take what I need, often only taking half a pill, unless I really need the full pill. </p>
<p>So yes I agree, they can be hard to get.. I've been fighting the system for years, with zero help. I have been told a bunch of times that I should get back surgery, but why should I get back surgery, when taking less than 15 tabs a month solves the issue. I've seen way to many people get screwed up for life over a failed surgery. Also how is surgery going to fix the fact that the pain moves from one area to another every time.. they going to put a rod all the way from the top to the bottom of my back? It switches from lower, mid-lower, mid, to upper, and into the neck all the time. </p>
<p>I feel the medical field has failed me, I shouldn't have to live with life stopping pain.. Just because other people have abused the system. </p>
<p>I spend on average $3000 a year on different treatments, and sick of being called an addict by doctors, for wanting 120 tabs a year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly didn't find it difficult to get them when I was 19 and struggling to roll out of bed in the mornings from the pain. It was the first thing my doctor did when he couldn't find anything on the MRI, give me an opioid pain medication. The same one my FIL is addicted to. It's unfortunately common in our area, I could have traded those pills for a lot of different drugs or just sold them but I didn't.</p>
<p>I didn't take them for long. I don't enjoy seeing fish swimming in the bathtub with me. The hallucinations really bothered me, so I got another doctor, and we found a much safer medication that worked very well.</p>
<p>Luckily, I do not have an addictive personality. It took me a day to quit smoking, and the only addiction I have is food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Weak opioids are easy to get. The problem is that addicts don't want weak opioid because they have to take 1/4 to 1/2 the bottle to get their fix, and they risk serious injury to their liver by taking that much. Heavy narcotics like Percocet and OxyContin are the preferred opioids and those are the ones that are hard to get. </p></div>		</li>

The pharmacies that were a part of corporate chains were dealing a tenth of the Oxycontin that those three were. So it's not just &quot;bad doctors&quot; overprescribing painkillers- pharmacies that have corporate controls (or just the money) to empower the pharmacist to refuse to fill every prescription they see even if its fishy have the ability to curb the problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to add to this.  Recently a doctor was describing how in the USA, medicine is becoming &quot;a business&quot; with all that corporate BS.   The hospital's business degree people were adding posters in offices like, &quot;How are you leaving your customer&quot; (not patient), with images <a href="https://image.shutterstock.com/z/stock-vector-smiley-faces-rating-icons-389818513.jpg" target="_blank">like this.</a> </p>
<p>He described how being a good doctor usually means telling people they're obese, need to exercise more, are dying, etc.  Generally a lot of things that make people unhappy.  With this &quot;healthcare as a business&quot; movement, it encourages doctors to prescribe to hypochondriacs and addicts to get their &quot;feedback&quot; score higher. </p>
<p>I can't find the source, the doctor pasted the story here on reddit, and he was promoting his book.  That's all I can remember. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It all comes from the government though. Ever since Medicare decided they would reimburse partially based on patient satisfaction scores, insurances decided to copy that. Thus if a doc or hospital has upset patients, they can actually lose money from reimbursement on services already rendered. </p>
<p>They have done studies on hospitals that have the highest patient satisfaction scores have increased costs and higher patient mortality. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bam.
Healthcare provider checking in.  I now answer to people who hold MBAs, not senior doctors.</p>
<p>In the emergency room closest to you, I can guarantee that there is an administrator yelling at the ER doc that admission rates are low and there are 4 patients over 60 who JUST HAVE TO HAVE a complicating health issue SO FIND A REASON TO ADMIT THEM DAMMIT!</p>
<p>Case reviews have given way to P&amp;L (profit and loss reports), appointments are bumped off the book or otherwise marginalized if there are unprofitable or something high $ comes along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain this further? I've been told forever that I should never go to the ER unless it's serious.</p>
<p>But your statement about admitting rates being low seems to imply hospitals want all the random people with the 'flu' to show up?</p></div>		</li>
