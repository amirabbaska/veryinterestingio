			<div class="markdown"><p>if you're as annoyed by this as I am I found a reasonably simple way to properly randomize a spotify playlist:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go into your spotify playlist</li>
<li>Ctrl-a then Ctrl-c to copy everything</li>
<li>go to <a href="https://www.random.org/lists/" target="_blank">https://www.random.org/lists/</a></li>
<li>Paste the playlist into the box</li>
<li>Press randomize</li>
<li>Copy the resulting list</li>
<li>Paste it into a new Playlist</li>
<li>Turn shuffle off to play your newly randomized playlist</li>
</ol>
<p>This isn't perfect of course since you have to repeat this every time you forget where you left off but for me at least its better than nothing and if you have the randomizer as a bookmark you should be able to do it in a few seconds every time so it's not as much of a bother</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I don't know about spotify, but with iTunes/iPhones if you just have a playlist in shuffle I'm relatively certain it won't play the same song twice before going through the whole list. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, so as it randomly chooses certain songs to play more, those songs become more likely? And as they become more likely, they play even more often, and become even more likely? That's so dumb. If I'm understanding this right, then the algorithm reinforces itself to play the same songs over and over. Why would they do that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your understanding of the algorithm is backwards. It didn't increase the likelihood of songs already in the playlist it decreased their likelihood and put more weight on newer songs. The reason people mistook randomness in this case is because as you build a playlist and listen to it, you will actually hear the first song you added more than any other song. If on day 1, you add Ice Ice Baby and Let it Be, and listen to the playlist, you'll listen to each song once. The next day you add two songs and listen through, you'll have listened to thr first two songs twice and the new two songs only once. You experience this as &quot;I've already heard this song, why is is playing it again, because you listened to it yesterday&quot;. This example doesn't even contain randomness yet. Randomize it and you can see for a lot of users it will play the songs from day one first and it won't 'seem' random. Do this for 50 days and now you have a playlist with 100 songs and you've just added two new ones. You've heard the original first two so many times now, you're sick of Vanilla Ice, but that song is equally likely in coming up as the new songs you added, and statistically 1 in 100 iTunes users would get Vanilla ice on the first song, and all think random was broken. Half of the users would get to their new songs in the last half of the playlist when they've heard the first 50 many many times already.</p>
<p>TL:DR; They weigh the new songs more likely than the old songs. You had it backwards. This is because users don't actually want/expect a random song when they add a new song to the list because they've already heard the old ones before, they want the randomness curve to pretend like the new songs were in the playlist all along, not reset the 'randomness' as if they were just added.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine that only songs played manually get weighted up. As you say, yhr alternative is a bit dumb. Skipping a track probably lessens its chances of playing.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The events, characters and actions depicted in Dilbert are not only real, they're the good days. Usually, reality is much worse.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think so.  If I skip a track, it invariably comes up the next day.  I go through maybe 20 songs a day from a playlist of 600, so it seems unlikely it's random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably not. Random sampling n items n times statistically will leave out ~36.8% (1/e) of items. I'd assume their pseudorandom selection chooses not from the whole set, but from those which haven't yet been chosen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ARE YOU SERIOUS??? I think about this all the time, i'm always wondering why it seems like the same songs are played. One time i even considered doing an ELI5 but then i thought people would think i'm craaaaaaazy. Thank you for confirming that i am NOT crazy... That is such a relief. </p></div>		</li>
