			<div class="markdown"><p>There are possible ways other than &quot;it's alive&quot; to tell if a lifeform is extraterrestrial. The ATCG code. If some other chemical was found to be used to code genetics. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chirality_(chemistry\)" target="_blank">chirality</a> (handedness) of other life chemicals. </p>
<p>It turns out all life on earth has the same forms of these factors. So if we found radically different forms, we can be reasonably sure they are in fact, extraterrestrial. If they were the same the results will be inconclusive and some other (more difficult) ways of determining non-earth forms would be needed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If we introduce life and find fragments of that life later, &quot;inconclusive&quot; is exactly what we get.</p></div>		</li>
