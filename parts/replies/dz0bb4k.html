			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have the &quot;standard&quot; blood pressure of 120/80, your blood vessels (at least the major ones) are always subject to a minimum of 80mmHg pressure so they're definitely OK with that. The arguments against continuous flow that I've seen centre more around your body's regulatory mechanisms - eg stretch receptors in your heart, blood vessels in the neck etc - and obviously it's quite different when the stretch is not pulsatile.</p>
<p>However people needing artificial hearts are likely to be on a lot of medicines that interfere with those regulatory systems already!</p>
<p>Fundamentally it was proven that it works by people just going ahead and doing it. </p>
<p>In terms of complications it seems they're mainly around the issues of having artificial &quot;things&quot; in the body, and the pump itself: <a href="https://www.ajronline.org/doi/abs/10.2214/ajr.13.11066#/doi/abs/10.2214/ajr.13.11066" target="_blank">Article here</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing of note is that most pumps cause damage to the blood. I don't remember the details but some medtech startup I was looking at investing in said they had solved that. I didn't invest.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can answer this question based on what we already know about devices like this that already exist. In particular, a Left Ventricular Assist Device (or LVAD). Depending on the type of LVAD a person has implanted, there are potential complications associated with having the device, such as developing blood clots that affect the blood flow of the heart. Sometimes, the clot can break off from the pump and cause an embolus (free floating clot in the bloodstream) which can travel to other parts of the body and cause a stroke or impede blood flow to other tissues. Another complication we see (less common) are pump malfunctions, where the mechanism in the pump stops and puts the patient at risk for sudden drop in blood pressure or output of blood from the heart in a failing heart. One other common complication is infection at the insertion site of the device. In LVADs (and total artificial hearts as well), the power source of the device exits through the abdomen of the patient, so that open area leaves a huge risk for infection. Sometimes, the infection can travel up that power “line” and the infection can go to the heart. That can be potentially dangerous, as an infection in the heart can cause a systemic infection and make someone become septic. Source: I am an RN on a heart and lung transplant unit where we take care of LVAD patients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are, but blood thinners aren’t completely reliable 100% of the time. If patients are not compliant with taking their blood thinners, or their INR drops down to a sub-therapeutic level for whatever reason, they’re at a high risk for developing clots. It happens, I’ve seen it. It’s no bueno.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The earliest artificial hearts came with a bar magnet, if I recall. The owner could take the magnet out of his pocket and slide it across his chest, which activated a magnetic switch in the artificial heart beneath his skin, and sped the heart up - say, to allow the owner to run and catch a bus or something. Sliding it the other way returned the speed to normal.</p></div>		</li>
