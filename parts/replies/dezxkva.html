			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that there is also a rising viewpoint in physics that dark matter (or dark gravity) is the result of imperfect gravitational formulas. The basic gist of it is that it is more likely that our theory of gravity needs to be updated than that there is some invisible matter making such a huge difference. </p>
<p>There has been at least one recent paper published which redefines gravity as not curvature of spacetime but rather an emergent phenomenon of information in spacetime. According to this new theory, our observations of galaxies matches the math, and there is no need to invent placeholder names to explain away massive differences between our math and our observations. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There have been a variety of alternative gravity explanations around for awhile, like Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MoND). I wouldn't say this is a <em>rising</em> viewpoint, but that discussion would devolve into discussions over percentages of professionals. There doesn't seem to be much <em>professional</em> recognition that this is a viable option, largely because it <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/01/18/why-the-universe-needs-dark-matter-and-not-mond-in-one-graph/" target="_blank">leads to contradictions</a> if gravity doesn't work the way we understand it.</p>
<p>Also, there are multiple lines of evidence that result in dark matter. For example, gravitational lensing also shows an excess of mass in open space that exactly matches what is expected from galaxy rotations.</p>
<p>That being said, Verlinde's approach is built on pretty good grounds from information theory and has had <a href="https://m.phys.org/news/2016-12-verlinde-theory-gravity.html" target="_blank">some validation</a> that fits some observed data, but there are still observations not explainable by Verlinde's model.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to watch, that's for sure. We also didn't expect our universe to be accelerating apart, and that was a pretty exciting discovery.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I am sorry, but this is not really the case. Although there are presumably still people working on primordial black holes as dark matter, the commonly favoured story (with lots of evidence, the most famous one being the bullet cluster) is that of particles. Depending on their properties, you won't see them at the LHC, but there are tons of other experiments looking for them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like this answer, you don't bother with definites where there are none and and very simply explain the leading theories about dark matter and dark energy.</p>
<p>This is, I think, what OP really wanted to know, but asked in an unusual way. I'd like to know where he got those percentages, I don't understand why they are useful numbers presented as they are. Is that 100% supposed to reflect all the energy in the observable universe? Is all the regular energy like gravity and electromagnitism supposed to be part of the 4% of matter? I don't know much of anything, but that confuses me.</p>
<p>Also I think it would be a useful addition to your answer to state that the &quot;dark&quot; in dark energy and matter are only called that because we know so little about them. They aren't really related in any other way that I have ever heard.</p></div>		</li>

That is, the main components that determine the rate of expansion are matter and dark energy.

<p>The early universe was <em>radiation dominated.</em> The rate of expansion was primarily determined by the radiation content. &quot;Radiation&quot; here refers to highly relativistic particles such as photons, neutrinos, gravitons, etc.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked on dark matter specifically in my final year at university, but can confirm that both explanations for dark matter and energy are correct and you can commit them to memory :)  </p>
<p>Edit: for anyone interested, since the stars in the galaxy orbit the galactic centre at a roughly constant distance, the force pulling them towards the centre (gravity) needs to be equal to the force throwing them outwards (centrifugal force).
For clarity, centrifugal force is not a 'real' force, but that is another story.
Setting the equations of these two forces equal to each other, manipulating the equation to express orbital velocity as an expression of distance and using the mass of the visible matter in the galaxy produces a 'Rotation Curve', just a graph of how the velocity of the stars changes with respect to the distance from the centre. At least, this curve would be correct if visible matter was the ONLY matter contributing to the mass of the galaxy.
However, what we observe by measuring the orbital speed of stars is that most of the stars, especially ones at the outer edges of the galaxy, are orbiting far too fast and their centrifugal force should far exceed the gravitational force holding them in, so they should have flown off. Therefore there must be some 'missing mass' in the galaxy that we cannot see or detect since it does not interact with light or normal matter (aside from gravitationally, of course) hence the name DARK matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thanks for identifying the forces that they are balancing in these equations for dark matter.</p>
<p>i tried to imagine what forces are involved in dark energy, but quickly realized pressure would only push ordinary matter apart, not space itself. is there some kind of internal pressure component to spacetime that accounts for dark energy? i know einstein added a cosmological constant, but have heard conflicting ideas about whether it was a mistake or not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>idk, if it were me i'm not sure if i would stick with 'there is this crazy stuff that we cant see or feel or touch or interact with in any way BUT IT'S TOTALLY THERE and that's why our numbers don't jive' over 'hm, these numbers aren't doing what i expected, maybe i'm doing something wrong'</p>
