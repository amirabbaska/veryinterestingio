<p>Because the cost of moving it from where it was pumped, to the gas station, didn't drop in half.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the cost of moving it depends strongly on the price of gasoline, it did drop significantly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As soon as electric cars become ubiquitous you'll get major increases in electricity costs. It's a pipe dream to think that electric cars are going to make the power companies throw their hands up in the air and say &quot;ok, guess we're going out of business&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would anyone think that they are going out of business?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>firstly, why would a power company decide to go out of business when they just got a bump in sales of there product(electricity)
secondly,
we have plenty of wiggle room for power when they layed the copper to supply peoples house's we were using such power hungry devices we have easily relieved that with the power effecient devices we have today.. and thats kind of the point we dont need to use trucks to deliver our fuel(electric) everything is in place already.. not to mention the advances in solar.. </p></div>		</li>
