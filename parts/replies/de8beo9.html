			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, just to BS for a sec on the notion, that may make sense that it is that old. Live theater was a very important part of ancient Greek culture, and therefore there must have been certain performer movements and postures that served as shorthand for various internal human activities, to make them visually understood by the audience. Again, this is just me riffing, but it seems plausible enough.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In short, you might touch your chin when you think about something because you have grown up in a culture where that gesture signifies that to you. It's possible not everyone does touch their chin when they think about something.</p></div>		</li>
