			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami</a> Basically what MSG tastes like, usually described as a &quot;savory&quot; flavor but because we didn't really have a specific name for it in English we just kept the Japanese word. Also insert obligatory PSA that monosodium glutamate is actually not bad for you, it's a very natural compound that just so happens to have a scary chemical name, and it makes food taste amazing, etc.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I have a friend who regularly turns down snack foods (chips, etc) because he claims the MSG gives him headaches, then he'll eat some other snack food containing MSG (without checking, obviously) without any problem.  It's actually kind of annoying.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I ain't scared o' MSG but I have noticed when I have an XL beef pho (quite a bit of added MSG, as far as I know) I get this weird exhaustion/fatigue that I feel in my cervical/thoracic spine area. Could this be bad?...</p>
<p>EDIT: I also only found out there was MSG in pho (never thought of MSG before) <em>after</em> I decided to investigate my weird symptom. </p>
<p>EDIT 2: This thread made me hungry so I got some takeout pho and my cervical spine definitely feels weird. Like it's very tired. Hit about 10 mins after finishing the sopa. Soup was amazing though. No ragrets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m not the right person to ask, all I can do is quote Wikipedia which says that no double blind studies have found any negative health effects. It could just be that it’s a lot of food, but you should consult an actual doctor if you’re concerned.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! MSG was derived from seaweed because it had a distinctly &quot;meaty&quot; flavor. </p>
<p>To taste protein in food, your tongue only searches for one particular amino acid. MSG basically is that specific amino acid your brain identifies as protein. Thus, when you use MSG your brain says &quot;oh wow what a protein rich food. Delicious.&quot; We've naturally associated this sensation with meat, since it's typically the protein-rich component of our diet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is the flavor of glutamate. You need about 11 grams of glutamate per day, compared to about 1 gram of sodium per day. The difference, though, is that your body does produce glutamate -- just not enough. So you have to eat the rest.</p>
<p>Thus, foods high in gluatamate (think MSG) have a certain flavor. It isn't as powerful as sodium, but its there.</p>
<p>It's for this reason that I <em>really</em> doubt there are only 5 tastes. I suspect we can taste all sorts of stuff that our body needs</p></div>		</li>
