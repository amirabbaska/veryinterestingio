			<div class="markdown"><p>One large factor is that the smaller transistors also generate less heat and use less power.  Many chips are not just size limited, but are more constrained by how much heat the system they're going into can support.  More efficient chips allows for you to use more powerful processors with the same level of cooling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One major part is also software. Initially, when Ambient Occlusion and parallax mapping were introduced, they looked good but were performance hungry. Now, the same effects can be achieved with much less resources dedicated due to more intelligent optimisation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is still a physical limit of how small we can get before quantum effects start messing things up and if I’m not mistaken we’re getting pretty close to the limit. I’m sure everyone’s working on continuing improvement but it won’t be my miniaturization </p></div>		</li>
