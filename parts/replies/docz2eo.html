			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, but you can take multiple measurements, so you could measure it in two different spots, and what i'm wondering is whether the time and distance between those spots is constrained by the speed of light.</p>
<p>If it is not, then couldn't you construct a relativistic frame where you could view the same particle in two different places at the same time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, you can’t collapse a wave function twice, but maybe you mean two separated experiments that interact with the same big wave function.  But now the particle’s wave function is shared among causally connected observers as part of one overarching mega-wave function that both experiments are in, and the whole thing collapses to one state when they share results, which will agree.  Causality is the constraint that fixes the paradox.  </p>
<p>The only way they could disagree would be to design the experiment that they were somehow unable to share data, say they are on opposite sides of the cosmic horizon.  Then it just doesn’t matter, because causality is unbroken.  To steal an idea from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycAzdtUIko&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=230" target="_blank">this PBS Space Time</a> video, causality defines space and time, not the other way around, and tricks with wave functions never break causality.  The weirdness of wave function collapse is part of that diabolical conspiracy that makes reality work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing stopping two different people from measuring each &quot;side&quot; of the entangled particle at the same time. Communicating what you measured to the another party is limited to the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>
