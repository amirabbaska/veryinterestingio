			<div class="markdown"><p>No room is perfectly sealed either. The dust will get in from the outside, the wind will blow around the other dust already inside, to evenly coat, as well as other sources such as degrading fabrics, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the temperature is likely to fluctuate throughout the day. Air will expand/contract with temperature fluctuations, pulling air into the room in colder times and pushing air out in hotter times. This can bring dust into the room as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are in fact ultra clean rooms that prevent any dust or unwanted matter from entering or exiting whatsoever.  Used for keeping materials perfectly unadulterated, for instance in facilities that manufacture certain drugs that will be injected into humans, or in bio safety facilities meant to contain the really nasty viruses or bacterial pathogens.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ever wondered why it only builds up to a certain thickness and no more? That's the point where the dust being added equals the rate of dust being blown off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the construction of the room, its contents, and how well-sealed it is.</p>

<p>For a couple of years, I basically never went into my (finished) basement except to do laundry -- and I can confidently say I haven't dusted down there in much longer.  There's only a thin film of dust down there, about what I'd see build up on surfaces in my living areas in about a week or two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is amazing, considering laundry tends to deposit a lot of dust. Just cleaning the lint trap in a dryer should be adding plenty of dust each time.</p>
<p>That being said, it is perhaps that the dryer sucks in dusty air and filters it through that trap, exhausting any additional dusty air through the vent to the outdoors.</p></div>		</li>
