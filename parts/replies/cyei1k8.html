			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;W&quot; seems so strange in this context. It's the only letter named after the way it looks rather than the sound it makes.</p>
<p>In a just world, W, Y, H, and G would sound like &quot;We&quot;, &quot;Yee&quot;, &quot;He&quot;, and &quot;Gee&quot; (like Gun) respectively; and The letters C, Q and X wouldn't exist at all.</p>
<p>Edit: I was wrong, C has a purpose. How else could you produce &quot;ch&quot; the sexiest consonant sound imaginable.</p>
<p>While I'm ranting: I hate that English doesn't use accents! I think it would be simpler if, instead of relying on accompanying letters (Y or H as a vowel?!) to determine hardness, we had a soft and hard pronunciation for each vowel that can be shown with an accent.
Ex: o=&quot;ah&quot; ≈ç=&quot;oh&quot;</p>
<p>Edit2: U=&quot;ooo&quot; (like boo)</p></div>		</li>

<p>All of them end in consonants. What exactly do you mean by &quot;second move of the mouth&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Canadian as well and I always used the two interchangeably. I didn't really know which was the American way until recently. Having to deal with Microsoft reps on the phone if I make a mistake and say Zed while reading a product code they generally have no idea what I'm talking about. If it wasn't for the fact that most Americans don't even understand Zed I don't know if I'd notice if people said zee or zed at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I researched a few years back, is that when the British started speaking with a non-rhotic accent as opposed to the &quot;original&quot; rhotic English the plantation owners started copying the British as a status symbol. I believe this was one of the major influences on the early development of &quot;southern&quot; American accents.</p>
<p>(not to say either accents are &quot;original&quot; but Shakespeare would have originally been spoken with a rhotic accent.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but as far as I have learned: The settlers of the American south were mostly very rich Englishmen looking for more land farmable, of which the south had lots.  They brought their very posh type of older English accent, a slow and lawling dialect from which we get things like &quot;ain't&quot; and &quot;y'all&quot;.  Over time it bastardized and regionalized (the rich east retained this drawling character, the more rural west mixed got quicker and mixed with Spanish and French accents) into the various forms you hear today.</p></div>		</li>
