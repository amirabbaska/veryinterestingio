			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if Einstein's first wife (Mileva) was more proficient in scientific disciplines than the average person, she never graduated from Zurich (because of health problems and because she had to take care of the children she had with Einstein). I'm not trying to say she wasn't an important figure, but her circumstances and society's expectations didn't allow her to focus as much on science as his husband.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that most of Einstein's biographers agree that he only talked about 'our discoveries' in a polite, inclusive way (there's no evidence that she offered direct contributions besides affection and support).</p></div>		</li>
