			<div class="markdown"><p>No one knows for certain, but a theory is that it started out as a porridge made of wild grains. At some point it was heated and became &quot;baked&quot;. It may have also picked up wild yeasts and began fermenting into a sourdough-type mixture. But for the most part they were flatbreads like pitas and foccaccia.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is possibly how beer got its start. This porridge was a little too liquid to bake, yet it began fermenting. As the other poster said, nothing was wasted, so someone thought of drinking it. Of course that beer was nothing like today's. It was more like liquid bread. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bread isn't that complicated. It's 1 accidental microbe away from hard tac, just flour and water baked. Flour (ground grains) is easier to eat in water, boiled for sanitation. So it's about 3 steps from grains with each one being an improvement. And grains have been eaten for millions of years. Bread is one of the simplest foods that exists. Something like hakarl is much more surprising because it's rotten shark, kinda normal to eat rotten food, except it isn't food, at least not before rotting for a very long time. It's poisonous to eat unless hung to rot for weeks. Idk how the hell people figured that out. Also puffer fish. Like what? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My theory on harkarl is that a starving Icelandic settler came across a dead shark on the beach and was like &quot;Well, I know when we tried fishing one of those out and eating it, people died, but I'm dying now, so it's worth a shot.&quot; Then he ate it and just wished that he was dead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is very unlikely.  Meat dropped into a fire used for warmth is more likely, but either way, cooking meat probably caught on <a href="https://www.livescience.com/2877-chimps-prefer-cooked-food.html" target="_blank">literally right away</a>, every time it was discovered.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ec/3d/1e/ec3d1e5705646740cd0e7aeaa3c84e99.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ec/3d/1e/ec3d1e5705646740cd0e7aeaa3c84e99.jpg</a></p>
<p>Casu marzu (Sardinian pronunciation: [ˈkazu ˈmardzu], also called casu modde, casu cundídu and casu fràzigu in Sardinian), literally 'rotten/putrid cheese', is a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese that contains live insect larvae (maggots). A similar cheese, casgiu merzu, is found in Corsica.[1]</p>
<p>Derived from pecorino, casu marzu goes above and beyond typical fermentation to a stage of decomposition, brought about by the digestive action of the larvae of the cheese fly Piophila casei. These larvae are deliberately introduced to the cheese, promoting an advanced level of fermentation and breaking down of the cheese's fats. The texture of the cheese becomes very soft, with some liquid (called lagrima, Sardinian for &quot;teardrop&quot;) seeping out. The larvae themselves appear as translucent white worms, about 8 mm (0.3 in) long.[2]</p>
