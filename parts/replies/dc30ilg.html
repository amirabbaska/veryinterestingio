			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the original series DID have a code, it just wasn't consistent over multiple episodes. </p>
<p>From the Star Trek Guide (the series bible used by the creators)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We invented &quot;Stardate&quot; to avoid continually mentioning Star Trek's century (actually, about two hundred years from now), and getting into arguments about whether this or that would have developed by then. Pick any combination of four numbers plus a percentage point, use it as your story's stardate. For example, 1313.5 is twelve o'clock noon of one day and 1314.5 would be noon of the next day. Each percentage point (sic) is roughly equivalent to one-tenth of one day. The progression of stardates in your script should remain constant but don't worry about whether or not there is a progression from other scripts. Stardates are a mathematical formula which varies depending on location in the galaxy, velocity of travel, and other factors, can vary widely from episode to episode.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using TNG as a reference...</p>
<p>Stardate 41153.7 - Season 1, Episode 1 - Encounter at Farpoint</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> (2<strong>4</strong>th century) </p>
<p><strong>1</strong> (<strong>1</strong>st season) </p>
<p><strong>153</strong> (show progression through that season)</p>
<p><strong>.7</strong> (Just a generic day counter.)</p>
<p>Jump ahead to season 3, episode 4 (Who Watches the Watchers), and we have stardate 43173.5. So we've incremented the second digit (from 1 to 3) for the 3rd season. </p>
<p>Episode 5 of that season is stardate 43198.7. So we've increased the last 3 digits going from one episode to the next.</p>
<p>TNG did have a few faux pas with their stardates early on but were pretty consistent most of the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What no love for ST:Enterprise?  Its actually a good show once you get past the first season (like all post ST:TOS, the first year was usually meh)</p>
<p>I'd take T'Pol over 7of9 any Stardate of the week.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gave Enterprise another shot, with it being on Netflix.  It's pretty weak until Shran and the rest of the Andorian commandos show up.  </p>
<p>I went back and watched Voyager.  People complained about 7 of 9 being fanservice, but she's actually interesting and brings some much needed friction to the crew.</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole blended Maquis/Federation crew rarely had any problems.  </li>
<li>Tom Paris, a dishonorably discharged Starfleet officer who joined the Maquis, and then sold them out for early parole, was supposed to be hated by everyone.  Nope.</li>
<li>B'Elenna's Klingon side was supposed to make her dangerously violent.  Nope.  At most, she worked up a good whiny pout.</li>
<li>Neelix was supposed to be a shady conman scamming the Voyager crew for unlimited water.  Nope, harmless goofball.</li>
<li>Energy was supposed to be a premium, meaning little use of the replicators or holodeck (hence Neelix being a cook), which would have crushed morale.  Nope.  Tom is playing The Rocketeer every goddamn week.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why I preferred ds9. Right from the first episode they make a point to show you it's not like TNG. Quark is a greedy businessman, Kira is a non-star fleet militant commander, there is a shady former cardassian spy aboard, the commander is full of hate and grieving and somehow he make this work.</p>
<p>It really set the tone for the numerous moral gray areas that the show explored, and showed that the TNG utopian world had its demons, and that some times tough decisions need to be made that walk thin line between right and wrong. And some times it's not even clear what's right or wrong is.</p>
<p>I tank voyager could have been really good if they stuck with the original themes - a mixed crew in non ideal circumstances trying to get by. But ultimately all these potentially complex characters ended up being more or less flat.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When he cut off that dudes antenna... that was hilarious (forget what episode.. just remember the ending).</p></div>		</li>
