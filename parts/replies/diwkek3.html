<p>I think I remember <em>something</em> in the brain not working correctly and noticing you're awake, so it keeps you in this state of a paralyzed body, but you still take notice of what's happening around you, but the brain can't fully comprehend what's happening and sometimes makes other things (like a tall man looking at you from one corner, hovering over you et cetera) appear instead.</p>
<p>Not going to say I know what I'm talking about, but this is what's left in my head after reading about it a few times here and there (mainly on /r/nosleep and their comment sections)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right, my sister suffers from sleep paralysis which is basically where your body remains paralysed from sleep even after awaking. Often, early in the morning this paralysis hasn't worn off yet fully and so you feel weaker and unable to perform the tasks you normally would later in the day.</p></div>		</li>
