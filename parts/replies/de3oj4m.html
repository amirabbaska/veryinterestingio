			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Essentially all domestic breeds (chicken, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc) as well as all agricultural plants were created by humans. They wouldn't do well in nature because they weren't naturally selected.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's true. They wouldn't necessarily do well in the wild, but near human settlements they do very well. They essentially have no serious predators (large predators have been driven away and kept in control by hunters for a long time now), and they can eat just about anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we didn't domesticate them for our own personal use like we did with cows and chickens, instead, both cats and humans became co-contributors, we domesticated each other in a sense; cats kill small rodents which would eat our grain and we allow them shelter, it's more of an indirect domestication and therefor cats still possess much of their animalistic natures and tendencies.  Look at it more like the parasympathetic relationship moss and a tree share.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Domestic sheep have been bred for thousands of years for maximum wool production, and are now dependent on humans.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wool sheep have a mutation that causes continuous hair growth.  Mutations are not due to selective breeding but selective breeding can be used after the mutation for improvements.  </p></div>		</li>
