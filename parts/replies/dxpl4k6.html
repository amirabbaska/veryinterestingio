			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I just recently heard about ketamine being used for depression/crisis. I’ve heard that it snaps them out of it almost instantly but no one really knows why.  I’ve seen kids at festivals in a “k-hole” and it looks terrifying. </p>
<p>This may be a dumb question but why can’t they give some one a pill that contains those neurotransmitters (seretonin, dopamine, etc)? I understand that it might get broken down in the liver, but could they make a drug that the byproducts of being broken down is similar to those neurotransmitters?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As you suspect, the active neurotransmitters will never get to the brain; even if they didn't get broken down by gut or liver enzymes, they wouldn't cross the blood-brain barrier. The weird part is that those neurotransmitters actually have totally different roles outside the brain, because they exist separately. Serotonin helps move the intestines along and does something with platelets I've never fully understood. Norepinephrine and dopamine help regulate blood pressure in different ways. </p>
<p>Your second idea is already in use. Prodrugs are converted into the active ingredient in the body. L-DOPA is the molecule step before dopamine, but unlike dopamine, it can get into the brain (where it's turned into dopamine.) While it's one of the most important treatments for Parkinson's disease, it's never turned out to be much of an antidepressant. 5-HTP is similarly converted into serotonin, and it at least has some crappy evidence as an antidepressant, but... well, it's crappy evidence.</p>
<p>What all this suggests is that the old model isn't good enough to explain what's going on with these drugs. Just increasing synthesis of these chemicals doesn't have the same effect as prolonging their effect. It seems there's more stuff going on, probably involving weird indirect effects we're only partly aware of. The same neurotransmitter can have very different effects in different parts of the brain--dopamine can influence movement in one area, reward in another, and breast milk in a third! </p>
<p>(P.S.: We're also all worried about the potentially terrifying side effects of ketamine, which is part of why it's not more widespread.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What potentially terrifying side effects for ketamine out of curiosity? </p>
<p>It's been used for a long time at higher doses as an anesthetic, and the kidney damage it can cause is from daily moderate dose if I remember right. And the depression treatment is only every few weeks or so</p>
<p>I've followed it with interest but haven't heard much in the way of terrifying side effects</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They already do this for people that want to self medicate without taking drugs. They're called pro-drugs, they get converted (ex l-dopa is the precursor that converts into dopamine)</p>
<p>The difference with SSRIs and SNRIs is that they don't do that, they simply prevent the body from sucking the serotonin/norepinephrine (or even) back into the synapse. Think of it like this: Reuptake of neurotransmitters is like a Mom cleaning up the toys and putting them back in the toy bin (toy bin=synapse).</p>
<p>Without the toys there's no fun any kids can have. If the mom didn't get a chance to clean it up The kid could have tons of fun whenever they wanted. The fun in this analogy is a synaptic potential that allows the signal to move across the synaptic Gap between the two neurons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using a prodrug is using a drug. In fact, lots a drugs have pharmacologically active metabolites. The difference is that a prodrug is (largely) inactive until metabolized (by the body) into an active compound. There are a variety of reasons why you would design a drug to be a prodrug -- increase absorption or half-life, for instance. </p>
<p>As an example, consider patients with Parkinson's. These patients have lost the dopamine producing neurons of the substantia nigra (a part of the brain the regulates the gating of movement). Perhaps the symptoms of Parkinson's could be alleviated if dopamine could somehow be resupplied to the brain? Unfortunately, dopamine itself is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the brain. Enter L-dopa. L-dopa can cross the blood brain barrier. L-dopa is precursor to catecholamines such as dopamine. L-dopa is a prodrug. L-dopa is a drug. </p>
<p>L-dopa is not used to &quot;self medicate without taking drugs&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The synapse is the gap BETWEEN the two adjoining neurons (and when mom picks up the toys they’re being sucked OUT OF the synapse [the gap] and back INTO the cell). In your analogy the boy’s play space is the synapse, and the toy bin would be the cell firing the signal which the neurotransmitters are reuptaken by.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ketamine is a psychotomimetic, which is probably why it's so strongly regulated. It does produce rapid mood elevation, unlike SSRIs or trocyclics, so is a promising avenue of research. </p></div>		</li>
