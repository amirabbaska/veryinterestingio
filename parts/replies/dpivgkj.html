			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep...that's why every patient in the hospital we beg them to wear SCDs (Sequential Compression Device) and put them on blood thinners or anticoagulants. You'd be surprised how many people get DVTs (blood clots in your legs) in a hospital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand yes. I had a family friend who did 2 longs distance flights in 24 hours. When he returned home he went for a bike ride and a clot from his legs caused a massive heart attack. Dead before the bike stopped moving.</p>
<p>Edit before people ask.
He was incredibly healthy in every way.</p>
<p>Edit
I'm an engineer not a doctor. This is how it was explained to me and I took it at face value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but it can be easily remedied by a walk to the bathroom, shake your legs, and maybe do a quick squat just to stretch the legs. Do this like 2 times (which isn't even unreasonable on a 10 hour flight) and you should be good </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's what my internist recommended. Anyone and everyone over 30 should wear compression socks on flights over a few hours. Even over 20 wear them for flights over 6 hours. It's one of those can't hurt, might save you issues. I have found they're made in cute colours and patterns now so you don't have to wear elderly looking socks. I keep a pair in my carry on, and pop them on at take off. I don't know if they've kept me from dying, but I definitely feel like my legs don't feel as &quot;congested&quot; after a long flight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I absolutely love those! It's like getting a massage. When they wanted to take them off, I asked them to leave them on longer. Apparently many people hate them and refuse them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're sensory torture for autistic people. Source: Am autistic, have needed multiple surgeries, have begged nurses to take them off because the compression is too much sensory input and my body starts interpreting the squeezing as pain after an hour. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just spent 2 weeks in a hospital and while yes they feel like a massage, when you are dealing with infections and your temp spikes to 104 every few hours those things become heat traps and cause you to sweat so bad. They do feel wonderful however when you're not burning up!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And even shots doesn't guarantee you won't get a DVT. I was in the hospital for 3 weeks and was on blood thinners, but went back 2 days after release because I developed a clot in my leg. I had the compression device, too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could have been a rebound effect. Your body was compensating for the blood thinners and your liver was naturally trying to make your blood &quot;thicker&quot; to counter the thinning meds. Then you left the hospital and the blood thinner meds stopped, and now your blood was too thick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it's a risk factor, not absolute certainty. Haemostasis is only one contributing factor towards blood clot formation Maybe if you're sitting for those periods on a regular basis, getting old, pregnant and have cancer, etc. then you might be more likely to get an embolism during a raid.</p></div>		</li>
