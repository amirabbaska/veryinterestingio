<p>Sweet: This contains carbohydrates</p>
<p>Sour: This contains acids</p>
<p>There is also an emerging body of evidence that we may have a unique taste receptor for lipids, which would constitute a sixth basic taste, and would mean that we can basically detect three of the four major macromolecules (as you noted, the umami flavor is due to proteins) + a few extra things like salt and poisonous stuff. This is not yet conclusive, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was referring to what our preliterate ancestors and closest primate kin could derive from the experience of taste. Off of the top of my head short of honey I can’t think of much in the forageable wild that’s sweet. I’m there are examples.</p>
<p>The recent news of a possible taste for fats is exciting. I’m a retired chef. When I was in culinary school the umami taste wasn’t recognized in the west, the receptors wasn’t known to our science. We didn’t have the word for why veal sweetbreads are so amazingly tasty!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are exceptions to everything. Coffee and tea contain the alkaloid caffeine which in its pure form is in fact bitter. Amongst other bitter alkaloids are substances like strychnine, conine (hemlock), and morphine. The taste of bitter is a warning, not an absolute rule. God forbid me being denied chocolate! </p></div>		</li>
