<p>The correct answer with the water may be that it feels cold because your mind assumes water is going to pull temperature away from your skin. If your body expected it to be boiling it would probably feel hot instantly. Our minds play a large part in dealing with sensorsory perception because the signals aren't always detailed enough to say what exactly is going on. A good example would be if your toe was cut off, you may not know till you look and see &quot;oh I'm missing a toe&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is not technically right as it would be a contradiction. if you put the metal in a colder place and then the temperature of the air was recently raised to room temp, metal will take longer to heat up, because of their higher specific heat capacity. but by definition once they are at room temperature they are at room temperature. if that's the case it will still feel as if metal is cooler because metal conducts heat better.</p></div>		</li>
