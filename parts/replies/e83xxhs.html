			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh thank you!</p>
<p>I just got into podcasts. By that I mean I've listened to one, after surfing through 3-4 that I didn't like enough to finish the first one. </p>
<p>The one I listened to, it turns out, is unparalleled. It won a Peabody and shattered listenership records. So I've been feeling a little bereft, I haven't found anything else that great or that I love and much, although I've been tiding myself over with Serial. </p>
<p>It was S-Town, by the way. If you are interested. But don't read ABOUT it too much. I accidentally googled a spoiler trying to learn about the producer while listening to it. Just read what's on the podcast summary or what have you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes they're a fun gateway to podcasts. Still, never listen to their podcast for a topic you're an expert on. You'll tear your head.</p>
<p>But still my go-to  podcast when I have run out of other podcasts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that was the point they were making. The voters aren't responsible for the shit the politicians do.  That's why it's called election fraud instead of voter fraud. That's how I understood it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Election fraud means that the government and its officials are going out of their way to keep the 'wrong' people away from the polls. Things like moving polling stations away from bus lines in poor parts of a city, keeping election day on a Tuesday to keep the working class away from the polls, overzealous voter purging, requiring ID to show up to the polls (which affects the poor much more, since many don't have 'valid' ID. In some states it's even worse: a gun permit counts as an ID, a student ID does not), shutting down polling stations in places that are likely to vote against you without enough time to transfer voters in that area to another polling station, gerrymandering.... There are lots of ways that elections can be skewed against the voters you don't like.</p>
<p>Voter fraud means that people turned out to the polls illegally to vote. There are only a few dozen votes that have been cast as part of voter fraud in the US but if you believe President Trump, the Democrats are doing this on a massive scale with pushing immigrants through the polls.</p>
<p>It's a hugely important distinction. The comment above you is saying that we should call it 'election fraud' rather than 'voter fraud' because it's not the voters who are behaving fraudulently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you're largely accurate you use the word &quot;never&quot; quite liberally here. </p>
<p>Continuing your example...</p>
<p>Let's say students have an elective once a month for an hour. Many states are attempting to pass laws so if a kid misses that elective one time all the teachers in school just stops calling their name.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no need to resort to hyperbole - no one's considering roll purges for skipping one election. The controversial Ohio policy that went to the Supreme Court was for six years of non-voting. The current chicanery in Georgia affects people who haven't voted since 2008.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel like that's still not okay. Tons of people only vote when there's a presidential election (not saying this is a good thing, but it's true). So if a voter misses one presidential election but wants to vote in the next one, they're out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, the purging of rolls isn’t the problem. Or not really. In Canada I can show up at my polling station and register on the spot if I am still registered in a place that I moved away from. To me, that is one of the biggest problems with the American system. I have to swear an oath and have some ID and maybe a bill or something to prove I live there, but I can vote ON VOTING DAY. </p>
<p>Edit. I’m not even sure if you need the ID. I just know that I took those things to go vote in Nova Scotia when I was still registered in Edmonton. There is an election coming up soon where I live now and I will do the same thing again. </p></div>		</li>
