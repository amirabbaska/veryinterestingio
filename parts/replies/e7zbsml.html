			<div class="markdown"><p>RAM is a much more mature technology than NAND, so the paths for technological progress are much less available. That makes it just a pure supply and demand thing, and you have recent huge demand coupled with fairly inelastic supply. More fabs are coming online but itâ€™ll take some time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Problem with supply however, is more expected in a new industry like SSD rather than in a mature industry like RAM.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really, yes RAM was mature but in any industry mature or otherwise sudden increased demand will be an issue, and cloud computing combined with smartphone demand put a ton of strain on the RAM fab capacity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Smart phone advancements.  RAM capacity makes a huge marketing headline for a new flagship.</p>
<p>So flagship phones all went from 3-4GB of DDR4 to 6GB of DDR4.  The Note 9 has 8GB of DDR4.</p>
<p>Mid tier phones went from ~2GB of DDR3, to ~3GB of DDR4 this year.  Even the Samsung J6+ coming out right now has 4GB of RAM.</p>
<p>So while total shipments of smart phones for the year grew only at single digit % when SSD makers expected +10% or more, the actual demand for DDR4 from smart phones increased by &gt;50%.</p></div>		</li>
