			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, but that would be more like processing than storing information </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So lets say we have 8 neurons in our brain capable of processing information (being on or off, firing or resting). Why are those 8 neurons not comparable to a computer's byte?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, but there is a lot of metabolic stuff involved in processing and storing information, so just looking at the all or nothing binary response of the neuron kinda underestimates what is happening</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only half true. We don't know nearly enough about brains to tell if it works in a binary way. We know there are electrical pulses (idk if that's the right term, I'm not a native speaker) and they could work just like electricity in a computer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we don't know enough about how it works but it's safe to say or brains have a very different architecture than a computer. About the electricity, I think the axons use electrical pulses but I don't have time to verify that right now. The synapse between cells is bridged by neurotransmitter chemicals.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a change in ion concentration gradient that propagates down the axons. So it's electric, but not really like a wire.</p>
<p>I guess it's a bit like a wire with inductance. If you try to send an AC signal down an axon, and the signal is too fast, the ions won't have time to move and the signal won't go through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha we know enough about brains to know it most certainly DOES NOT work in a binary fashion at all.</p></div>		</li>
