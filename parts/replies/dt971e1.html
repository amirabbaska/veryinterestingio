			<div class="markdown"><p>To make fire you need 3 things: </p>
<p><strong>Heat</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oxygen</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fuel</strong></p>
<p><em>Now that that's out of the way:</em> </p>
<p>When you remove one of these things fire no longer happens. Say you snuff out a candle with a <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/files/2010/06/candle_snuffer.jpg" target="_blank">candle snuffer</a></p>
<p>IDK if you've removed Heat or Oxygen first -- but the fuel is definitely still there. As a result COMBUSTION (the flaming stuffs) cannot happen, because 1 or 2 of those 3 critical things has been removed (again IDK which, maybe both?). </p>
<p>I'm guessing you remove the Oxygen because that's what seems obvious to me -- because the wick is probably still very hot! </p>
<p>Anyway -- you remove the ability for the FIRE to do what it wants to do (eat available stuff that can burn, consuming Heat &amp; Oxygen &amp; Fuel Source). When that shit fails then you probably get into some weird science shit about why a wick smokes instead of burning -- I'm ((TOTALLY)) guessing that this is just failed combustion which results in ((SHITTY)) chemistry which makes SMOKE instead of fire... because you're heating up -combustion stuff- that isn't being rendered into FLAME/OTHER-STUFF.  </p>
<p>I know nothing about what I just wrote, I'm mostly guessing but I did do 3 seperate google searches before writing it which basically makes me as educated as your average redditor. </p></div>		</li>
