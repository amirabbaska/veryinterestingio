<p>Now this piques my interest. If the singularity is a point particle, how can it rotate?</p></div>		</li>

Also, the singularity doesn't need to be rotating for everything in its well/orbit to rotate around it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's true, but a Kerr black hole actually <em>is</em> rotating (we're not talking about the accretion disk here, which is always orbiting the black hole). Or, more accurately, we can say that the black hole has a non-zero angular momentum.</p>
<p>Point masses can have angular momentum. Take elementary particles (such as electrons) for example; these also have an angular momentum (spin).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Rotating&quot; is a slight abuse of language here, but it's a common one: what I really mean is &quot;a black hole with angular momentum&quot; (technically, a black hole described by the Kerr metric, or something like it). Just as an electron can have intrinsic angular momentum even though it appears to be a point particle, a black hole can have some amount of &quot;rotation&quot; just built in to its basic structure. That's important, because without that feature we would find that angular momentum was no longer conserved!</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is that the only reason it's important? Does the angular momentum show up in any other way than as a way to catch the incomming angular momentum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A rotating black hole is one that has a non-zero angular momentum. This translates to something resembling a rotating event horizon. </p>
<p>The gravitational field around the singularity is what carries the angular momentum, much the same way that electric and magnetic fields can carry the momentum of a photon.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medium-sized black holes are difficult for our current observation methods to detect and would be an excellent candidate for dark matter.</p>
<p>The problem is, our current understanding of the early universe does not allow for medium-sized black holes to exist in any quantity.  It allows for smaller holes - but those would have to be so numerous we would have noticed lensing effects in our astronomical observations, and we haven't.  The early universe models allow for very large black holes - but those are readily apparent due to their very hot accretion discs, and there aren't enough of those to explain dark matter, either.</p>
<p>So medium-sized holes have not been ruled out as dark matter - but we'd have to scrap our entire understanding of the early universe if enough of them exist to explain the extra gravity we observe.  We'd need more evidence of numerous medium-sized holes (such as frequent observations of gravity waves from LIGO) before theorists would pursue that option in large numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Actually, one of the leading theories about dark matter is that there are (for some reason or other) clusters of black holes that tend to orbit around the outer rims of galaxies.</p>
<p>These would, of course, be very difficult to detect, but as we get better at measuring gravitational waves and as better and better telescopes watch for signs of gravitational lensing, we might be able to find evidence for or against them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The bullet cluster provides observable evidence that strongly suggest a new type of particle since it affects matter gravitationally but does not appear to be affected by the gravity of that matter (only other dark-matter).<br />
This is over-stated to consider it a fact but it is what the observations of the galactic collision suggest.  </p>
<p>It gets worse because this means either Einstienian space-time is wrong or only affects &quot;in phase&quot; particles so dark-matter is out-of-phase gravitons (which is non-sense as far as we know but I suppose we once thought the same of antimatter.)</p></div>		</li>
