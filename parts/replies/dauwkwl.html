<blockquote>
<p>If you look at any liquid, molecules will constantly be leaving the liquid to go into the vapor phase and vapor will re-condense into the liquid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another way to visualize this for others, if they want: leave a cup of water outside and it eventually evaporates (i.e., liquid -&gt; gas). But it's never 100C outside (212F), the boiling point for water at typical pressure. </p>
<p>Even at 30C (a nice warm 86F day), there are still a few water molecules that can &quot;escape&quot; the liquid. A few of the molecules can exert a greater force than the &quot;vapor pressure&quot; above your glass of water. Not all. But a few. And then, free from the liquid, these molecules are now in the gas phase.</p>
<p>Leave the cup out for hours and, at some point, every water molecule on the surface of the water in your cup will have a &quot;random&quot; spurt of energy (i.e two molecules that ricochet off each other) that can overcome the vapour pressure pushing down on them....and then all the liquid will evaporate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a rate equation for this dependent on ambient temperature? Because now I'm wondering how long it would take for a frozen solid cup of ice to evaporate, if at all. And with that, if there's a cutoff point where vapor pressure essentially equals 0. </p>
<p>Edit: I guess a zero vapor pressure value assumes there's no molecular vibration/movement, which is only achieved at absolute zero. So any temperature above zero with have some rate of evaporation. But still... Is there an equation for this? Aside from me trying to derive one for myself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the rate is dependent on ambient temperature. Refer to this graph for the proportion of particles at particular kinetic energies (also known as temperature):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.antonine-education.co.uk/Image_library/Physics_5/Nuclear_physics/graph_2_c.gif" target="_blank">http://www.antonine-education.co.uk/Image_library/Physics_5/Nuclear_physics/graph_2_c.gif</a></p>
<p>As you can see, at a particular temperature there are only a portion of particles even near that temperature. When you say a cup of water is X degrees Celsius that is the average temperature of all the particles there, not that every particle as at that temp. There are particles above even 100C which then boil off by themselves. </p>
<p>If you increase the average temperature the curve will shift to the right and you can see a higher proportion of particles will have higher temperature. Vice versa for cooling it down. </p>
<p>Graph to illustrate the shift:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's only the boiling point of water near sea level. Above a couple thousand feet above sea level, the boiling point drops. It becomes fairly significant, to the point that food that needs to boil often comes with altitude charts showing the increased cooking times for higher altitudes based on the lower boiling temperatures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is it just bubbling water (as vapor is escaping) or is it also very hot as well (at boiling temperature)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The water is scientifically boiling, as the liquid water is turning to vapour at a rate much higher than normal evaporation. If it were bubbling, then it would just be gas (not necessarily water vapour) going through the liquid. It should be noted that the bubbles seen do come from water vapour as well.</p>
<p>The water is not, and <strong>cannot</strong> be 'boiling hot' (i.e 100 degrees celcius) as no energy has been added to the liquid water.</p>
<p>What's interesting to note however, is that as the water boils, the hotter water molecules leave as they have more energy to escape the inter-molecular forces associated with liquid water. Taking away the 'hot' will therefore leave the 'cold', with the net effect that the average energy (read temperature) of the liquid water decreases. Decreasing the temperature of water far enough (made easier by having the water already cool, say, room temperature) will cause it to freeze.</p>
<p>This means that by reducing the air pressure around a body of water significantly, and causing it to boil, will eventually cause the water to freeze. You are boiling water to freeze it. Trippy, huh?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to remember that 'boiling hot', or 100C, only applies <em>at sea level</em>. The higher you go, the temperature required to boil water <em>goes down</em>. This is due to the reduced atmospheric pressure - the water requires less energy to 'boil'.</p></div>		</li>
