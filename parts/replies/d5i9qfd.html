			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer is unfortunately factually incorrect. Copper and fiber can both be used with multiple channels (frequency multiplexing).</p>
<p>Optics (fiber) can go faster because the losses are lower. Losses always go up with switching speed but optical fiber has insanely low loss.</p>
<p>It's actually easier to pack many channels into copper because coppers behavior is smooth with frequency. Fiber has water peaks (no ELI5 sorry) that reduce the available bandwidth considerably.</p>
<p>The other strength of optics is the lower power required to obtain high data rates. A laser can go 100 km and consume 100 mW of power. A comparable copper connection might require 5 W, 10W, or 100 W of power. Practically speaking this was avoided though electrical repeaters or just going to radio broadcast instead.</p>
<p>TLDR: Fiber is low enough loss and lasers are low enough power that you can crank the speed up a bit. However at short distances where copper loss is small the cost and complexity of fiber isn't worth it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Another reason is that fiber is not susceptible to RF/EM interference the way copper is.  This means a higher signal to noise ratio over long distances, which isn't nearly as efficient with copper. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the original reply was good for its objectives and although the explanation is not ELI5 at all, the original analogy holds with respect to the number of lanes on a highway. You can multiplex electrical signals as well, you are right, but you don't have nearly the same bandwidth on a coaxial cable than you can on a fiber and that has to do with physics of coaxial cables and fibers. </p>
<p>Coaxial electrical cable design is a tradeoff between attenuation losses and the cutoff frequency of the cable. Coaxial cables start becoming impractical in the 10s of GHz area, after that you need to use waveguides for any sort of practical transmission. </p>
<p>Optical fibers, by comparison have several ~7 THz of bandwidth in the commonly used C-Band alone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Sure, but the frequencies used in fiber are in the hundreds of terahertz, several orders of magnitude higher than what you can push down a copper waveguide. That means you can generally fit a lot more bands of the same width into the useful frequency range of fiber compared to copper. Hence a higher overall data rate per cable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dodgeballrocks, great answer! Especially <strong>Bonus Info</strong> def'n of <em>bandwidth</em>.</p>
<p><strong>More Bonus Info</strong>. The OP asked the question carefully, asking about &quot;electric signals&quot; rather than &quot;electrons&quot;. Electrons move much more slowly than light. In copper wire, electrons move at a rate of about 200 microns/sec. That means that electrons originating in your phone take nearly an hour and a half to reach the earbuds in your ears. The electric signal, though, is due to field propagation in the wire, which occurs at the speed of light under appropriate conditions. A not-bad analogy: if you have a hose full of marbles and you push one in, another pops out the other end almost* instantaneously, even though it may take the former the rest of the day to get out the other end. The signal travels quickly even though the marbles don't. </p>
<p>*I say almost because marbles compress and expand a little bit along the way. Similarly, an electron doesn't pop out immediately because the electrical forces that push it out take time to propagate down the wire, even at light speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm afraid that satcom is different.</p>
<p>Your satcom is an electromagnetic (EM) signal not electric signal nor electrons.  It is carried by photons through free space</p>
<p>A signal just means something that 1) varies with time 2) can be measured</p>
<p>We build even the most complex messages out of bits - the smallest piece of information in a signal that is possible.  A bit is a measurement at one time period of 1 or 0.  </p>
<p>Let's say you want to send a signal to me using a light bulb.  We agree that I'll count out the seconds and observe whether its ON or OFF and that you'll do the flicking.  We can now send signals!!! </p>
<p>BONUS:  If you add in a fading dial that lets you set amount of light.  Maybe you can send more than 1 bit per second to me.  But we have to be careful with this because I have trouble telling the difference between 1/3 on and 1/2 on.  And I might take my measurement when you are still turning and get 1/4 when you meant to set it to 3/4.   We might want add in some extra bit of info, call it a checksum, at the end so I can check if my signal is likely to be the same as the one you sent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually an incorrect answer.</p>
<p>Fiber-optics is not faster. Both copper and fiber-optic can transmit data at pretty insane speeds (like 40Gb/s and more) over one cable.</p>
<p>Actually signal in fiber optic cables is slower than in copper cables because in fiber optic cables light bounces repeatedly off the walls of the cable and travels longer distance.</p>
<p>The main reason why fiber optics is used is not how many signals can be sent over one cable, it's how far they can get before they fade. For example for 10Gb/s ethernet cable max length is 100 meters, for 10Gb/s fiber optics - 10+ kilometers.</p>
<p>So if you want to use the highway analogy - both fiber cable and copper cable are high speed highways, copper highway is faster initially, but it's bumpy and cars begin to lose their speed very quickly. You have to send much bigger cars with big tires, which means that less cars will fit into your highway and you need to send <em>more</em> cars to deliver the same amount of cargo because some cars will break and won't make it to the other end.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you are confusing the speed of light with data rates. </p>
<p>In fiber, data is transmitted using pulses of light. You are correct when you talk about the concept of light bouncing around with total internal reflection in multimode fibers. This bouncing around causes some delay, which slows the propagation time. However the propagation time/speed of light in the fiber is not what determines the data rate. </p>
<p>The data rate is determined by how many bits of data can be transmitted per second. This means how fast you can switch the light on and off. Say the maximum frequency you can turn the light on and off is 10GHz (10 billion times per second, a reasonably accurate number). That means you can send approximately 10 billion bits per second (10Gbps) down that fiber. However, optics has a huge advantage over fiber. You can transmit multiple frequencies (colors) down the fiber at the same time without them interfering with each other. If you send two colors, you can have a data rate of 20Gbps, if you send 100 colors, you can have a data rate of 1Tbps. This is one of the huge fundamental differences. </p>
<p>With electronics you can really only send one signal at a time. With optics, you can send many signals down the same fiber at the same time. This is called multiplexing and is one of the main reasons why it is possible to have such high data rates using optics. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not true. Both can multiplex. A single copper cable has much more capacity than a single fiber cable. A copper cable has about 1000Mhz bandwith with 6-8Mhz per channel which translate to around 166 channels . A single fiber typically only does 16-80 DWDM channels. The reason why you see cable bandwidth smaller than fiber is because with cable only a few channels are used for internet, the rest are use for video and audio; while all channels on fiber are use for internet. A typical fiber route also has MANY fiber cables inside one big cable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is actually more correct. OP is probably referring to fibre to the door, as opposed to cable internet or DSL, both of which have constraints at the distances the signals need to travel to get to your door. DSL needs to sync frequencies over two copper wires before it can pass intelligible data and cable suffers from collisions.</p>
<p>Fibre is like a nice smooth speed-of-light highway right to your door.</p>
<p>In a data centre, you can have fibre or copper providing the same massive throughout between devices, but it's only a small distance.</p></div>		</li>
