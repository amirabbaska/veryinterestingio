			<div class="markdown"><p>This same question has been addressed on /r/askhistorians several times. The fact is, Europeans often did die of various new world diseases when settling in the Americas, but never succumbed to any one disease as devastating as smallpox. Medicine and record-keeping weren't really up to modern standards at the time so it's very hard to say what these new diseases actually were. However, there is a lot of evidence that syphilis was imported back to Europe from the Americas. </p>
<p>Here are a few of the threads from /r/askhistorians:</p>

Chicken pox, measles (cattle), the flu ( can be found in swine, domesticated birds and horses, hard to know the origin).

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he (being presumptuous) said. I would also like to add that the main reason why the African Land Grab that occurred between 1890 and 1910 didn't happen sooner was because of diseases that absolutely decimated European settlers prior to that period. Changes in both medicine and an increase in the already overpowering arsenal of those powers (refinement of artillery) were the tipping points that led to the near destruction of the continent that is no doubt a contributory factor to Africa's underdevelopment (in tandem with the African Slave Trade undertaken by Europeans between 15-18th century).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Lets not forget the slave trade began in Sub-Saharan Africa via Islam, which took more slaves than did Europeans.
In April 1998, Elikia Mâ€™bokolo, wrote in Le Monde diplomatique. &quot;The African continent was bled of its human resources via all possible routes. Across the Sahara, through the Red Sea, from the Indian Ocean ports and across the Atlantic. At least ten centuries of slavery for the benefit of the Muslim countries (from the ninth to the nineteenth).&quot; He continues: &quot;Four million slaves exported via the Red Sea, another four million through the Swahili ports of the Indian Ocean, perhaps as many as nine million along the trans-Saharan caravan route, and eleven to twenty million (depending on the author) across the Atlantic Ocean&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's amazing how a religion did that! If you'd like to be more specific you should state which entity was responsible.  Just like how you didn't say that it was the Christians who were kidnapping the African, you said Europeans.  For the majority of that time period, the slaves were being taken by the Ottoman Empire, which actually treated slavery much differently than their European and American counterparts.  Slaves were a specific cast of society known as kul, that actually could get pretty high up in society and were not based on race.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>If this were true then there would be large medieval/Ancient African cities dotted all over Africa (I assume you aren't taking into account Egypt, Morocco and other North African countries). Africa's underdevelopment was due mostly to lack of arable farm land and raw resources in terms of iron or copper. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were in fact large amounts of medieval/Ancient African cities, they are simply not given prominence in Western ethnocentric interpretations of African culture (what happened when 'we' showed up, see the Songhai, and Ethiopia during the 16th century). As for resources, Zambia's economy was in fact centered around copper mining prior to the collapse of copper prices during the 1970s (have several articles about that if you're interested). During the African Land Grab, Prince Leopold took advantage of the abundance of rubber in the Congos by enslaving the local population causing the deaths of 10 million people in the span of thirty years, an event not &quot;terribly unique&quot; during this period (McNally, 2002: 163-165). </p></div>		</li>
