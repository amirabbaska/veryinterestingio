			<div class="markdown"><p>Mac is Unix based which has been fine tuned since the '70s to allow updates to install without taking down core systems.</p>
<p>Microsoft tried to do this by restricting things but it's taken a long time for a couple decades of sloppy DOS/Win3.1/Win95/NT programming to come up to Unix standards. No one wants to rewrite from scratch which is what would be needed for some things to work like this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Windows 10 has gotten a bit better about it.  Most security updates and bug fixes can be implemented on the fly without a reboot.  Major updates however still require a reboot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Less sloppy, more optimised for things that are no longer relevant. This is the source of most of Windows's modern problems ­— a lot of it was designed for very low-power personal computers, most of which would interact with perhaps other computers in a single office at worst. Designing the OS to be secure when connected to a network of millions of other potentially malicious computers around the world was simply not important, because it would get in the way of making it run well on this low-powered hardware. Similarly, designing it to be able to be updated without a reboot was not important, because updates came on floppy disk and so were rare enough (and usually something the user actually requested or bought, since Microsoft didn't just send floppies out willy nilly) that not being able to apply the patch/update/whatever without a reboot was simply not important.</p>
<p>Why don't they just scrap it all and start again? They have, but they can't go as far as they might like because backwards compatibility is king. You make a new version of Windows that breaks some business-critical software, and guess what? That business won't upgrade.</p>
<p>Linux and Mac OS by contrast are based conceptually around UNIX, which has almost since it began been designed for larger networks of comparatively high-powered connected computers. They are also both relatively OK with breaking compatibility, so redesigning components that prove to be suboptimal is much more likely to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, Unix based systems let you delete a file while its open by another process, which will keep seeing the original file data until its closed. That lets you replace files without having to ensure nobody has them open.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can get software to remove locks so you can do updates without reboots but it can make the system wonky.  It's handy in a pinch in a business environment but overall not worth it if you can simply reboot.  There's also the issue of services that need to be bounced and often will have to restart dependant services.  If you're on a normal user account and you need to restart the spooler service to fix a printing issue you won't have the rights to bounce the service but you can reboot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is possible (but a bad idea for system files) to make changes by accessing the drive directly to access where they are stored on the disk instead of using the windows file system as you usually would.  A tool that is well known in information security for doing this is called ninjacopy.  It only takes the locked data and makes a copy, but the theoretical basis of what it is doing could be used to make changes as well.   It's a terrible idea if you want your system to stay working, but it is possible.</p>
<p>TLDR locks are only reliable protection if you use the windows file system directly.</p></div>		</li>
