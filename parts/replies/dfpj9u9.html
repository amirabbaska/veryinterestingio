			<div class="markdown"><p>I've seen a peanut shelling plant in action before and they employ hundreds of women to just sit at a conveyor belt and shell peanuts all day. Although the factory I saw was actually shelling chocolate bars at the time. They could get through a surprisingly large amount of them, I remember the factory owner saying &quot;nineteen thousand bars an hour they're shelling&quot;, which is quite a feat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The facility my fiance worked at was mostly automated, and most plants around here are as well. (We live in Southern GA, where peanuts are such a big industry we have a national peanut festival just half an hour from us.) They actually only had a few women working there, and they were mostly samplers -- the people who would get a bucket of each grade of peanuts and take it to a little office where they made sure that all of the Jumbos were in fact mostly Jumbos and things like that. Otherwise, most workers basically just watched machines and handled the big nut sacks.</p></div>		</li>
