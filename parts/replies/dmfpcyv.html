			<div class="markdown"><p>A quieter pre-alarm can give your brain a recent frame-of-reference so it can prepare more reliably for the alarm. You don't even have to wake up to it.</p>
<p>You can find alarm apps that do that, as well as ones that slowly ramp up the volume over 15 or 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I even heard of somebody who used a sort of reverse-alarm that slowly amplified white noise and then cut it out. He woke up to the sudden silence!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I put my clock radio across the room from the foot of my bed, set for 20 mins. before I need to actually get out of bed, tuned to NPR at a reasonable listening volume.</p>
<p>It's too far away to hit snooze without going through effort sufficient to render me persistently awake anyway, but the volume isn't annoyingly loud enough to motivate me to do that anyway, and the broadcast content is interesting enough to rouse my attention towards whatever topic they're talking about.</p>
<p>So I wind up being roused to consciousness gradually as I get my wits about me, lounging and stretching a for a while before I have to get up. Sure beats my old method of having a full-volume rock station blaring from the nightstand right next to my ear and instantly snoozing it so much I'd often wind up oversnoozing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, when I was in highschool my parents believed that the only way to wake somebody who slept through loud alarms was to get even louder alarms.</p>
<p>They even tried putting one of those bedshaker things under my pillow that would vibrate while the alarm went off, but it kept falling out of the bed during the night.</p>
<p>Just before I graduated, my dad was debating getting hydraulic pistons to tilt me out of bed. I'm still not sure he was joking...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to do this too! Albeit when I was a kid and I was definitely not waking up to NPR unless I was at Grammas. Now though waking up to NPR sounds delightful! I wonder if there's a phone app that would allow me to program certain podcasts play at certain times. Thanks for the memory!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to use Timely on Android, it will play a quiet alarm 20mins (iirc) before your actual alarm at a quieter volume. </p>
<p>For iOS I now use Sleep Cycle. It monitors your movement with the mic and will wake you up at any point up to 20 mins before your alarm, based on where it thinks you are in your sleep cycle. Works really well from my experience. </p>
<p>Both of these are based on sleep cycle theory. I'm by no means an expert but it's a pretty interesting subject. </p></div>		</li>

I check my phone and sure enough, I only got 4 minutes left before the little buggers starts blaring. FML.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if your brain tries to come online too early, you end up with some really weird crap, like hypnagogic hallucinations and having really weird ideas, like thinking I could program a dog standing on my bed if only I could attach the right cable and feed in raw machine code, or wondering why I could communicate with other people when we were clearly running different operating systems.</p>
<p>Dreaming while you're awake. Weird stuff.</p>
<p>(On a related note, take breaks when you're driving long-distance, even if you don't think you need to. Dreaming while you're awake while you're driving can kill people.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once woke up in such a stupor that i got up, walked over to my alarm clock, mostly aware of what i was doing, and then proceeded to hold it, turning it end over end in utter confusion as to what it was and why it was making noise for what felt like a full two minutes. I then realized it was my nemesis, promptly proceeded to turn it off and go about my daily routine.</p></div>		</li>
