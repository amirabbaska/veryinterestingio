			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean everybody is allowed to call themselves a nutritionist. It's likely that you meant dietician. Also what's your point of contention? If you want to lose weight calories in and calories out is all that matters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ikr, it seems like most of them miss the entire point for the sake of being pedantic about how the calories are being used, when the sentiment is fairly clear</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to diet, nutrition and exercise a ton of armchair experts like to get pedantic and nitpicky.</p>
<p>It's just calories in and calories out, that's all we should care about. People love to over-complicate it though. <em>Literally</em> all that matters is &quot;Am I consuming less calories than I am burning?&quot; If so, &quot;Yes, I <strong>will</strong> lose weight!&quot; Anyone worth their salt will tell you this, but people want things to sound fancy and complicated.</p>
<p>Are there ways to adjust how many calories you burn by increasing muscle, reducing fat, exercising more, etc? Of course there is. But people want to make it out to be some complex deep science they're personal experts on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's far more complicated because thermodynamics doesnt apply. The body is not an isolated system. When you restrict calories, your body adapts to use less calories to do the same work. </p>
<p>The medical community keeps saying &quot;calories in, calories out,&quot; yet science keeps saying &quot;that doesnt work.&quot; Hundreds of studies over the last fifty years and continuing to just recently proves this. It is FAR more complicated than a simple thermodynamic equation. </p></div>		</li>
