			<div class="markdown"><p>The math isn't necessarily all that fancy:  in its most basic form, you emit a pulse, then listen for an echo.  You take the time it takes for the pulse to travel out and come back to you, divide by two (because the pulse goes both out to the plane, and back from it), then multiply by 299,792,458 (speed of light in meters per second).  This will tell you the distance to the target in meters.</p>
<p>Different forms of radar work differently; Doppler radar emits continuously and looks for a doppler-shifted return, indicating movement relative to the transceiver.  This requires slightly more complex math, but still not too bad.</p></div>		</li>
