			<div class="markdown"><p>Before that, well, either a fancy mounting that keeps the gun above the propeller, or <em>armoured propeller blades</em>.</p>
<p>Later on, some of the aircraft had a large gun going right through the propeller's shaft. &quot;Large&quot; as in 57 mm on some Soviet &quot;tank hunter&quot; fighters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bell Aerocobra was built around making room for a 37 mm main cannon.</p>
<p>Now here's stuff that not available in English. Yak-9T with an NS-37 37 mm cannon. An Il-2 strike aircraft would have two underwing mounts. Then they packed an NS-45 cannon with a muzzle brake into Yak-9K. And briefly tried producing the N-57 for the MiG-9 jet. And even then there was development of 65, 76 and 100 mm autocannons, because there were big fat bombers aplenty.</p>
<p>In all the cases, the planes were stopping in midair and shaking loose like crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quite a few of the german bf 109 moddels had 20mm cannons throug the  prop shaft as well. I believe the bf 109 k4 was built with a 30mm cannon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this only came after a while. From my understanding they just accepted it and many propellers got hit from time to time. I struggle to understand how the weren't destroyed immediately on firing the gun. Would be interesting to know the bullet speed combined with the propeller rotation speed and size of the propeller. You could then judge the odds of it hitting the  propeller.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A vast majority of the time, a propeller is not in the way of the gun. Look at the arc between the blades and the arc width of a blade. You've probably got 115 degrees between blade edges, giving 345 degrees of open space out of 360. </p></div>		</li>
