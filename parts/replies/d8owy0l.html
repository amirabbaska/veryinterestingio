			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;What was discovered was that the rate of spin oscillation (flipping from up to down) took twice as long as expected. This is considered the proof that the crystal was affected by time.&quot;</p>
<p>I don't get this part, why would the longer time of spin oscillation is assumed to be proof of the crystal beeing affected by time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The researchers didn't say that this is &quot;proof that the crystal is affected by time.&quot; The crystal needed to be started with a laser to oscillate with a certain period (flip every 1 second, 2 seconds, etc.). However, they found that no matter how fast or slow they started the flipping, after they waited a while (without touching the crystal and affecting it), their measurements showed that the crystal would start oscillating at a certain frequency that was different from the initial one. This meant that the time crystal is inherently more stable at this frequency, because the system naturally tends to to this rate of flipping. You can kind of think of it like how diamonds (a spatial crystal of carbon) eventually turn into graphite (another form of crystalline carbon), because the crystal structure of graphite is more stable than diamond (though it would be reallllly slow).</p>
<p>TL;DR: They're saying that the time crystal is more stable than expected, and it has a &quot;preferred&quot; flipping rate that is independent of how fast you started the flipping.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Can anyone further explain this point?</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Upon further reading it seems &quot;affected by time&quot; may refer to the evidence that the crystal oscillated at frequency somewhat independent of the frequency of the laser that initiated it. So the slow oscillation is an indication of a time independence in the structure of the crystal itself; a time &quot;property&quot; of the crystal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The quote you referenced implies that all that has changed in the illustration is that the understanding of time is different. This is a very presumptuous illustration that doesn't appear to be implied in the original paper. Does this experiment challenge the standard model? If not, the statement &quot;the crystal was affected by time&quot; needs clarification. How can something be affected by time? What is time? Is it a fold in space-time, like a gravity well?</p></div>		</li>
