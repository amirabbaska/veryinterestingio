			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point. I think part of the difference is bare legs (so long as they are shaved, trust me, I don't) are OK now and we don't always have to wear nylons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To wit, it was the Gillette corporation, specifically, who decided that having only 50% of the population of America as their market was not enough, though this was before World War II.</p>
<p>They began running ads suggesting that men found shaved arms and legs more attractive (at the time nobody cared.) However, over time, this marketing campaign shaped what Americans think of as proper hygiene, and now it is considered normal.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Additionally, you have the wrong world war and the wrong reason:</p>
<p>“<em>Western countries, the majority of women engage in leg shaving, doing so largely for aesthetic reasons. This practice has developed especiallysince the early 20th century, around the time of the First World War, as hemlines on women's dresses have become shorter and women's swimsuits have become more revealing, displaying all of a woman's legs</em>”</p>
