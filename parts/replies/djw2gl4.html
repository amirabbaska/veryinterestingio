			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't feel that this explanation is ... enough? Like I still don't understand. Most of the time the bike is not falling at all, it's just rolling along the floor horizontally, I don't see how the CG of the front wheel being low helps us out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the point. A rigid bike with no steering and two wheels is unstable. If it starts to fall over even a little bit it will continue to do so. A bicycle doesn't work the same way, at least when it is in forward motion. If a bicycle is moving and starts to tip over the front wheel naturally &quot;falls&quot; under the direction of falling, which rights the bicycle and helps keep it up. In other words, a bicycle automatically steers in the direction it's falling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense to me when it's visualized as the front wheel being like a butler's arm balancing the champagne on his platter. If you bump him so the champagne starts to tip, he'll move his arm lower and in the direction of its fall underneath it to keep it upright. You can get the same feeling by attempting to balance a tall object on your palm like a hammer or even a pencil. You keep it upright by moving your arm wherever the pencil leans toward.</p>
<p>The bike may start to tip, which causes the front wheel to steer that direction, which moves the wheel back under the center of gravity. Again, it's like the bike is a well trained butler moving his arm to keep the champagne upright, sometimes even running whichever way to stay &quot;under&quot; the glass.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>imagine it as falling forward. When you're balancing stationary you try to prevent yourself from falling left and right, but when you're moving forward you're always falling forward. The momentum forward is strong than the momentum left or right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer, a more detailed article on this can be found here <a href="http://www.phys.lsu.edu/faculty/gonzalez/Teaching/Phys7221/vol59no9p51_56.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.phys.lsu.edu/faculty/gonzalez/Teaching/Phys7221/vol59no9p51_56.pdf</a></p>
<p>It is also well known in the cycling world that the best way to decrease the stability of a bicycle is to replace the fork with a one with more &quot;rake&quot; which moves the wheel forward. This is desirable because decreasing the stability makes the bike easier to handle at high speeds, at the cost of staying up-right at low speeds. A wheel further forward will rotate into falls slower than a wheel which is further back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reverse is true, a long lazy fork is more stable and a short one more twitchy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a lot more sense because you barely need to be moving and the gyroscopic affect wouldn't even exist at such slow speeds. </p></div>		</li>
