Rather than just keep making people until we hit critical mass, let's just bite the bullet and get it over with. And I say that as someone who would likely be on the wrong end of it in a few years. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Populations don't decline suddenly without a war or some horrible disease. Japan is an example of a society that gradually got &quot;greyer&quot; by each generation having less kids. Eventually it will even out, but the interim period hurts. So there really is no bullet to bite unless you implement a population control program like Chinas. Ideally flat to mild population growth is best for welfare systems. Replacement rate. In much of the West, the population growth is due to immigration. The United States in particular is reliant economically on illegal and legal immigrants to supply enough additional taxpayers to offset Americans having less kids. I think I've read about some European countries that are strongly trying to incentise having more kids  because of their negative replacement rates, but I can't remember for certain. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure I follow the logic.  If there are less people, you don't need to collect as much tax.  In fact, don't places with declining populations (Japan) demonstrate this?  They have an increasing quality of life.  China's quality of life has skyrocketed thanks to the One-Child Policy.</p>
<p>I simply can't see how importing poor people in any way improves quality of life, especially as automation continues make the work they typically do more and more obsolete.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, the US is one of many industrialized countries.</p>
<p>And when the US starts to have significantly less money flowing into the Social Security system than is paid out, they will have to either cut benefits to the elderly or increase taxation of the young.</p></div>		</li>
