			<div class="markdown"><p>Polycarbonate lenses are terrible for spectacles. Too much chromatic abberation and they're optically inferior to other plastics. Most lenses will be CR39.</p>
<p>Also, you can't polish out scratches on spectacle lenses. This will alter the curvature of the lense and effect the overall prescription.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I bought my glasses, what I bought was labeled as a polycarbonate lens, and I've had no trouble with the lenses.  Do some eyewear shops simply refer to CR-39 as polycarbonate?</p>
<p>Edit:  I've noticed that other comments are mentioning that CR-39 is common in other countries, but in the US, polycarbonate is common.  Assuming this is the case, perhaps you should edit your statement saying that most lenses are CR39, as this varies by country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One thing; Diamonds, being crystals, have cleavage points in which they will very very easily shatter. Diamonds in particularly have MASSIVE cleavage, meaning they have lots of little angles you can chip away with a little chisel/hammer while still getting a smooth object. This is generally how diamonds are &quot;cut&quot; into jewlery and into nice shapes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a pretty decent rule of thumb; harder things tend towards being more brittle. Steel can be heat treated to be hard as hell, but that'll make it so anything that would dent it instead shatters it. On the other side, when it's softer it won't break, but it's easier to bend or dent. Or like wood- good, solid, thick oak will bend a little then snap since it's pretty hard, but a similar sample of balsa would bend much easier, and maybe wouldn't break since it can bend much more effectively due to its lack of hardness.</p></div>		</li>
