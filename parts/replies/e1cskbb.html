			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh God, I experienced that too. My dentist's topical anaesthetic was to say, &quot;I apologize in advance.&quot; The tears flowed freely and I am certain she overdid it so I couldn't say, &quot;Fuck you&quot; afterwards.</p>
<p>As I was leaving the receptionist congratulated me on my pregnancy. I said, &quot;I'm not pregnant.&quot; She frowned, looked at her notes, and said, &quot;No, it says so right here. You are newly pregnant with high anxiety.&quot;  She showed me the note as evidence of my status.</p>
<p>I said, &quot;I sure hope my dental insurance covers that, because that's not the kind of filling I came in for.&quot;</p>
<p>She didn't laugh. Very brittle woman. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I honestly prefer 2 seconds of pain over that disgusting taste that lingers for half an hour  (it felt like a mixture or rubber with strawberries).  First time I just didn't expect it, second time I asked to not use it and the nurse almost said I was weird.</p></div>		</li>
