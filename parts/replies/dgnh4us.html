</blockquote>
<p>I think all you would get is water vapor. Water doesn't really have an ignition temperature so it would just melt and evaporate.</p>
<p>I'm not aware of anyone trying such a thing, but I suspect something similar could be accomplished by atomizing cold water into sub-zero air and exposing it to a flame. Pretty sure you just end up with a candle in a freezing fog.</p></div>		</li>
