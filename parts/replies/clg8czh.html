			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a little insight - <a href="http://www.healthyfoundations.com/memoryfoam.html" target="_blank">Brief History of Memory Foam</a></p>
<p>After memory foam was developed as part of a NASA project, some saw the promise of memory foam for use in the medical industry to relieve pressure sores. Over the years, memory foam was shown to be unique in the way it responded to temperature and also in its ability to spread pressure over a greater surface area (and thereby reducing pressure points significantly). While the initial version of the foam developed for NASA (called T-Foam) did have a great deal of promise as a bed topper or wheel chair cushion material, it did have issues with wear over time. This first generation of material wasn't very durable, and would often compress or crack over time.</p>
<p>The first company to realize the potential of memory foam for the consumer market was Tempur-Pedic ®. They had worked on creating their own version of memory foam, and developed foam they called Tempur ®, that was much more durable and still had the pressure reducing benefits of memory foam. Initially, this Tempur ® foam was used in medical settings, but soon they began to hear that patients who used the foam slept better, had less back pain, and felt more refreshed in the morning. A light bulb switched on over someone's head in Sweden, and Tempur-Pedic ® began to sell the products to consumers.</p>
<p>Due to its origin as a medical device, Tempur ® foam was very expensive, and has stayed that way to this day. After a few years on the consumer market, other foam manufacturers saw the potential of memory foam and began to produce their own memory foam product lines. Because these manufacturers came from the consumer foam industry, rather than the medical industry, their cost structure for memory foam was much lower and they priced their products at a fraction of the Tempur ® foam. As the years went by, memory foam became more and more popular, and now manufacturers all over the world are making their versions of memory foam. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to justify, just say that &quot;you know they can come down on the price, and you don't want to have to shop around all day&quot;. Be willing to walk away. Walking away after a mediocre offer is the best tool you have to get the best deal. I've gotten my best deals in the parking lot.</p>
<p>If a salesperson is asking you questions about how, or why you came to a certain price point, their goal is really to get you to question yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't justify anything. They know what the lowest they can sell that mattress for is. Just be polite but firm. They will try all sorts of sales bullshit before lowering the price. Be willing to leave the store as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just be honest and ask them to do the best they can.  Mention it that you have seen better prices at other stores (no need to mention from where). Ask them to prepare a price that will ensure a sale on the spot.  This gives you power and put them in the hot seat. Getting a sales rep to salivate at the thought of a finalized sale psychologically allows them to feel more comfortable about giving you a better price.  They don't have to work as hard towards the sale.  (I know, I used to be a sales man once upon a time).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Markups are very much affected by how long an item will sit on the shelf before sale. Grocery stores survive with 1-2% markup because their entire inventory will turn over fairly quickly. Few things spend a long time on the shelves.</p>
<p>Furniture can sit for months before moving. That time and overhead has to be recuperated.</p></div>		</li>
