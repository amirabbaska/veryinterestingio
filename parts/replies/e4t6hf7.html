			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best analogy.
A tandem bike could have the cranks offset so at least one rider had a horizontal pedal to push down on at all times. That would be 4 phase.  For the analog to electrical generators 3 phase gets you almost the same benefit, and uses one less wire. More phases give smoother power, but it's a diminishing cost benefit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also make any number of other phases using 3 phase by wiring transformers in creative ways. You can't do this with 1 phase (1 phase is the same as 2, by the way). For rectifying to DC we sometimes go to 6 phases first, which gives very low ripple.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No, it isn't. Split phase, which is based on a single phase, is commonly (but incorrectly) called two-phase, which is where this misconception comes from. Two-phase has two individual phases with identical amplitudes and different phase angles. Usually, the phase angle is 90 deg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its the same reason power generating wind turbines only have three blades. More blades are more efficient but weigh a ton and reduce the benefit.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>

<p>More blades gives you more efficiency but at the cost of more weight and less power, and its a diminishing cost benefit. Three is the recurring number for peak efficiency and cost/weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, that’s completely different. The blade provides torque the entire way around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More like there are 3 sine waves, all offset so that the &quot;top&quot; of their waveforms is as close to a straight line as possible.  Let me know if that makes sense.  The goal is to fill in the gaps between the peaks of the waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.. but think more that the power of pushing down is happening in a more consistent manner. Have you ever hammered in a garden stake? You on your own repetitively hitting it is single phase, and each hit is one cycle. The stake is not being hit while you swing your hammer around to hit it again. If you’ve ever seen people putting up a circus tent, they may have three people taking it in turns to hit the stake, in sequence, one after the other. As the first has hit, the second’s hammer is falling, and the third is lifting their hammer.</p>
<p>In Australia, the wave cycles fifty times per second, which means the voltage is at zero one-hundred times per second. In the case of a light bulb, this can result in a near invisible flicker, as technically, the light bulb is turning off one-hundred times per second. Fortunately, with a light bulb, the filament doesn’t cool down fast enough for this to be readily evident, but if you couple that as a light source to a film projector that operates at twenty-four frames per second, you obviously will have an inconsistency, and a higher chance of seeing the flicker. This flicker becomes more evident in newer lighting technologies, such as LED.</p>
<p>To alleviate this, three phases “smooths” the supply so that at as one phase has hit the top of its cycle, the next phase is approaching the top of its cycle, and then the next, prior to returning to the first. Each phase is offset in such a way that cycles are offset a third of the length of each cycle from each other, much like the three people hammering the stake above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aslo I'd like to add that more phrases does mean more work gets done, but you get rapidly increasing costs for rapid diminishing benefit.  Afaik experiments were done up to 8-phases  in a double octagon shape.</p></div>		</li>
