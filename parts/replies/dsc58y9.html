			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add that fiber optic cables operate as a sort of filter themselves. </p>
<p>Fiber optic cables work thanks to a phenomenon called &quot;Total internal reflection&quot;: light cannot travel from a material with a higher index of refraction into another one with a lower index when encountering their interface (surface of separation between the two materials) at angles greater than the so-called critical angle (which depends on the indexes). </p>
<p>Choosing the proper materials, one can obtain very high critical angles (close to 90 degrees): this means that only the light arriving into the fibers with a direction which is almost parallel to the fibers can be reflected along them (and so transported to the detector). </p>
<p>This is a simple method that can be used to select light arriving exactly from the direction of the object one wants to observe, and to avoid any form of contamination (&quot;stray light&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify, /u/Bonz3tto is talking about <em>spatial</em> filtering, not <em>frequency</em> filtering.</p>
<p>(Although, they are frequency filters too; the critical angle usually depends on the frequency.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sortof. We're talking about a graph of wavelength vs wavelength intensity. They aren't just based on chemical composition. They're also based on temperature. For example, the type O-star image and type M-star image above could have the exact same chemical composition but just be temperatures. </p>
<p>Star spectra are pretty close to <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/imgmod/bbrc1b.gif" target="_blank">black-body spectra</a> along with the fact that different elements will absorb different amounts of light at different temperatures. </p>
