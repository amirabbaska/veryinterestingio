			<div class="markdown"><p>My thought was when I read this:  &quot;oh sh*t, you mean because I've never had chickenpox, then when I do get them now that i'm nearly 40 they're going to be super godawful?!?&quot;  Here I was thinking man at least I'll never get those shingles cause they look painful.   But now I have to worry about super chickenpox?!?</p>
<p>Please tell me that if I do, it'll just be a fever, some aches and itching?!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I got them at around 30. It was the most ill I've ever been. Fever for 8 days. Covered in pox, with density decreasing from top of my head down to my waist (none on my junk fortunately). Chicken pox on your gums fucking suck. Not actually that itchy, curiously but very unpleasant. Weird nerve stuff going on, like it'd feel like water was dripping on my face, and even 5 years later if I touch a certain pockmark on top of my head I can feel it on my cheek.  Haven't shaved my beard off since, but I suspect I have a load of pockmarks underneath it. Only a few small visible ones elsewhere.
The only good thing is it lasts just two weeks.<br />
Unfortunately for me, those two weeks started three weeks before my wedding.<br />
I thought I had them as a child. I did not.<br />
Do yourself a favour and make sure you don't get them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, yeah, I avoid kids with pox at all costs, but I'm sure with my luck something like this will happen to me.  I'll finally be able to afford wedding and get them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It still holds true for adults when first infected. Chickenpox as an adult is terrible. I had never had it as a child and my kids brought it home fro preschool. They were down for a a day or two. I was covered with spots and down for over a week. My doctor told me it was going to be a long ride because of my age. </p></div>		</li>
