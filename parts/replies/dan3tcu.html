<p>By far the oiliest parts of my body are my forehead, nose, and behind my ears.  If most of my body has a shine level of one, my nose is three and my forehead is five.  I don't know what it looks like behind my ears.  The tight skin of my head (which, when freshly shaven, has zero oil on it) is fifty.</p>
<p>I've also had many injuries that have swelled up.  Swollen skin, regardless of location, is much shinier than normal.</p></div>		</li>
