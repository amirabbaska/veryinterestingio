			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that the population density is much higher in New York. Even if the damage was limited to a few large buildings full of people, this might equal all the casualties of Nepal. New York is filled with non earthquake resistant buildings, there are more of them, and they are more densely packed with people.</p>
<p>The results would be many orders of magnitude worse than Nepal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention that a quake that big wouldn't <em>just</em> hit New York.  That's a pretty densely populated area, and the quake would probably also hit outlying cities like Newark and Stamford.  Not with the same intensity, of course, but probably enough to cause damage and causalities of some number.  Heck, a quake big enough might cause damage as far as Philly.  The mind boggles at the scope. </p>
<p>EDIT: 's was missing. It bothered me. :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, earthquakes on the east coast tend to &quot;carry&quot; for a while. The rock in the eastern part of the US is a lot better at carrying waves for longer distances than in the western part of the country.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And an earthquake with an epicenter in NYC at that magnitude would actually have a MUCH larger affected area that a similar quake in San Francisco, for example. The east coast has much older and colder crust, which allows the primary and secondary waves from earthquakes to travel further, than a similar quake on the West Coast. It all comes down to age of the crust, with additional factors, although relatively miniscule compared to age, relying on number of faults in the area, composition of the crust, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the Population density of Kathmandu metropolitan city(13225/kmsq) is higher than that of NY city(10,314/kmsq). The number of casualties was exponentially low because the earthquake hit the region on a Saturday noon. like sunday in the west, all schools n offices are closed on saturdays and the traffic is considerably less. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Technically yes, but that's taking into account all 5 boroughs.  Staten Island, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx are bringing that average WAY down compared to what the population density is of just Manhattan.</p>
<p>Manhattan would have a far higher population density than Kathmandu.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the subway is below the water table in the area, meaning  that all the ground in that area is wet (there's an ocean and a large river pretty much surrounding NYC).  There are two options, either you can make the entire subway system 100% waterproof (not really an option TBH) or you can pump out the water that does leak in.  </p></div>		</li>
