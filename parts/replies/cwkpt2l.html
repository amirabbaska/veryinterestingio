			<div class="markdown"><p>It creates the same low pressure as with the ball.  Higher pressure on one side pushes it into the tube while the lower sucks it in.  You can see it dimple.  You may have done the trick where you hold a sheet of paper at one edge and blow across the top of it.  When you do this the sheet will lift up because you are creating a low pressure system similar to a wing, by speeding up the air on one side.  If you rewatch the video here with the paper you see the sheet vibrates very quickly.  The paper slightly drops, then air escapes creating a low pressure and the paper is drawn back up again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... how do you explain the same thing happening with the sheet of paper? I'd like to think I have a loose understanding of what you explained (I might not, idk), but all of what you said seems to only apply to spheres. What about the paper that was sucked in as well?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I only hate the explanation. It's a terrible description, it's not prescriptive of physics, and at best it's a combination of bernoulli and continuity which we use daily. It's like the worst possible rule of thumb that teaches no one to nobody and doesn't describe any physical principles. I hate it.</p>
<p>It's bizarre to spend a decade of your life studying one thing and then to see legions of internets rant on it like it describes lift, when no aerodynamicist ever mentioned it in any legitimate publication.</p></div>		</li>
