			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a raft of stuff we can do. The largest contributors to climate change come from (1) fossil fuel burning (for transport, electricity, heating and other industrial uses) and (2) land-use (including farming, deforestation...). Insulating your home and using more efficient means of transport are good places to start. It is true that meat eating contributes significantly to climate change and it varies a lot between types of meat - raising and eating beef is a very inefficient use of land with a lot of associated greenhouse gas emissions - pork and poultry (chicken) are a lot more efficient. I've been trying to eat less meat and walk and cycle more.

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also want to point out eating less meat doesn't mean being a vegetarian/vegan. It just means making an effort to eat more meals that concentrate on veggies, poultry, fish or even pork instead of beef.   Beef is the worst in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and [freshwater use] (<a href="http://blog.ucsusa.org/wp-content/uploads/Raganathan-2016-IFRPI-report-graphic-1-1024x956.png" target="_blank">http://blog.ucsusa.org/wp-content/uploads/Raganathan-2016-IFRPI-report-graphic-1-1024x956.png</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I think this is one of the biggest barriers to change, in that people think it has to be all or nothing. I saw a redditer a few months ago talking about how they don't buy meat to cook with, but will order meat at restaurants. I thought that was a great way to get started - and (as a vegetarian myself) it can be a cheaper way to cook if you get into a habit of it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's crazy how comfortable we are doing things like eating meat and denying climate change when the stakes are inconceivably high for the existence of life. As far as we are concerned, this is all the life in the universe yet we don't do the simplest things  to preserve it-and we aren't even the ones benefitting. While fossil fuel execs rake in millions upon millions, we just go along with it so we can have unhealthy food and never have to walk anywhere. Let's step it up humans, we can be better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've mentioned meat (esp. beef) a few times but dairy (esp. cheese) creates more GHG than fish, chicken, etc. Just a note.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is right, industrial cattle farming has a major role in global warming. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations's (FAO) report in 2006 animal agriculture is responsible for 18% of all human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, including 37% of methane emission. For the agricultural sector alone FAO reports that livestock contributes nearly 80% of all emissions. Therefore our diet choices make a huge contribution to climate change. Consider eating less meat and dairy and buying food from local farmers to avoid the huge GHG emissions related to transportation.
All the best, Regina

			<div class="markdown"><p><del>Additional info I would welcome: has anyone measured/estimated the carbon footprints of various types of food for us to compare? Ideally a detailed list from beef, chicken, fish, etc. through dairy to wheat, rice, tea, potatoes, etc.</del><br />

Edit: I ask all that without looking for myself. <a href="http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/food/brochure6a.png" target="_blank">Here is one answer</a>. <a href="http://www.greeneatz.com/foods-carbon-footprint.html" target="_blank">And here's another</a>. I would still welcome the professor's and doctor's opinion on this and any links to better information.</p></div>		</li>
