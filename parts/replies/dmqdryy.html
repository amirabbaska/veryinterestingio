			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice map, the blue area (younger) is also where the Marianas Trench would be. I have to find a similar map for the land masses next.</p>
<p>Question: why would that part be where the plates push out from? I'm guessing that part is made out of relatively weaker earth material through some roll of cosmic dice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you've got it backwards there. The blue area is the oldest seafloor that is about to be subducted under the less dense continental crust. New oceanic crust is made at the mid-ocean ridges, which are the blue lines running through the white areas. The mid ocean ridges are the edges of the tectonic plates that are moving away from each other. Magma is constantly rising and filling in the gaps with new crust.</p></div>		</li>
