<p>Conceptually, I can give an example.  If you have a field between two parallel plates -- let's say it works out to two volts -- it will be uniform.  If I now stick a nail from the 0V side half way into the middle, I mess with that.  The center around where the nail is has been forced to also be 0V.  So, around that tip, we have a much higher field, since it has to go up to 2V in a much shorter distance.  Also, because charges repel each other, they will push each other to aggregate in pieces that stick out.</p></div>		</li>
