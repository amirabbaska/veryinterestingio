			<div class="markdown"><p>The lunar regolith insulates and protects the rock beneath it from the radical changes in temperature, and thus the fragmentation.  Occasional processes will bring solid pieces of rock to the surface- outgassing from the mantle, perhaps.  Most of the reworking of the moon's present surface will be due to meteorites, however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If all the rocks were exposed, then yes, but as the larger rocks break up over time, some of the smaller pieces get covered or partially covered by the dust. The dust then serves as a buffer against the rapid temperature changes. Additionally, some additional rocks are formed when bits of dust are fused together by the thermal properties of a meteorite impact.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But without meteorite impact, all surface rocks would eventually be reduced to dust because of temperature swings, correct?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The temperature swings are the difference between day, and night, although due to the slow rotational speed of the moon, a full lunar &quot;day&quot; is equivalent to almost 28 Earth days. Once an exposed rock on the moon moves out of directly sunlight, rapid cooling begins. Again, when the same rock then passes into the sunlight, it begins to rapidly heat.</p></div>		</li>
