			<div class="markdown"><p>In Chinese they say &quot;那个&quot; which sounds like &quot;nay-guh&quot;. </p>
<p>Often when speaking people will use it as we use &quot;um&quot;. So people will say something and repeat &quot;nay-guh.... Nay-guh...&quot; and continue with their statement. </p>
<p>I heard a funny story from a friend of mine in China who was black and he misunderstood and thought that someone tried dropping to N-bomb to his face, to which he started getting angry and almost got into a fight over.</p>
<p>They didn't understand the implications of what he thought they meant, and later they all had a laugh about it. Overall it was a cultural learning experience for all parties lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm Chinese and the way I've always said it sounds like &quot;nih-guh&quot;. Can't really get any closer to the English word than that haha. Different people with different accents all say it differently and they don't usually know it's a word in English which leads to interesting situations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Where in West Africa? I'm from East Africa and I've never heard of this. Are you sure that this chieftain wasn't just messing with you? I know I've told some Westerners some nonsense stuff about cultural practices as a joke and they easily believed me just cause. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, I was just making it more accessible for American readers. It's definitely a thing among the Fulakunda--one of the divisions of the Pulaar people. It seems like one of those incidental things that isn't pan-African.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's really fascinating. Do you know what the reaction is, or how people deal with, someone with a low social status who actually has a stutter? Would that be taken as an insult, even if unintended?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>nope! I knew a younger (and therefore lower status) guy who legitimately had a speech tick, and everybody understood that it was just because he got excited. He was well-liked by everyone. It probably helped that he was very intelligent, also that he was a very attentive listener, was very deferential, and never interrupted anyone. </p></div>		</li>
