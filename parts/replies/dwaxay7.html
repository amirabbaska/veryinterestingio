<p>That's misleading. Tesla doesn't tell you how big the magnet (and thus the field) is. Inside your computer's hard drive is a 0.5 - 1 tesla magnet, and it's hardly bigger than your thumb-- but I can guarantee it's not going to shield very much of mars no matter where you put it as the field size is very small.</p></div>		</li>

<p>On the plus side, Mars is farther away from the sun so the radiation striking it will be more parallel, and Mars itself is a little smaller, and you don't need a completely opaque shield since you're not trying to block out light, but you'd still need a huge shield to make a significant difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It will not spread out as a cone behind it indefinitely but he far it extends before narrowing down and equalizing behind the magnet depends on its strength.<br />
For example we can look at the pressure fields of aerodynamics with something travelling very fast though air. At first, the air is pushed aside, leaving a low pressure zone behind the object and the air having velocity away from the low pressure zone. The high pressure zone outside will press the air back into the low pressure zone to equal the pressure.<br />
If the object is 0.8 meters in diameter, we canpretty confidently say that a point 1m behind the object may be shielded but if the object is Ø0,01m, the air may have equalized at 1 meter behind and thus it is not shielded. The scales are a bit different with solar wind and magnetic fields but it still counts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just FYI, all MRIs are superconducting (made of NbTi) and should produce no  heat when operating. It is true that a <em>resistive</em> electromagnet can generate an insane amount of heat, but MRIs magnets need to be made of superconductors and there is no heating problem provided its kept superconducting. </p>
<p>Edit:I know MRIs have pcs and tons of equipment to run them which produce a lot of heat. That specs page comment is exactly that. I am specifically addressing heat In the superconducting magnet, which is close to zero when compared to a resistive Cu magnet as OP was probably thinking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure they do. Whatever power you put into it will be radiated or conducted to the surrounding environment, which in this case is about 20kW, about enough to heat a house on a very cold Canadian winter day. I assume that the MRI has a power cabinet for current regulation and control of the pumps, and a computer cabinet for data processing and machine control systems. This is where a lot of the power will be dissipated. Also in order to stay superconductive, you need to cool the electromagnet with liquid helium (pretty fuckin cold, -268 Celsius assuming it is not pressurised). <del>Also superconductors are not infinitely conductive, and will heat up proportional to the power dissipated across it.</del> Wrong, apparently! Wikipedia agrees with u/automagnus! its the helium that will need to stay cool, and there is your major heat consumption :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the static field in an MRI is pretty stable once it's charged. Just keep the superconductors cold enough to superconduct and you won't need any additonal power to maintain the field.</p>
<p>We do that with liquid helium here on earth, but you might manage to get high temperature superconducting materials to work which would mean liquid nitrogen temperatures (still cold but way easier to get to).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is based on a wrong assumption though. The scientific consensus is that magnetic fields do not actually protect the atmosphere. Venus is closer to the sun than Earth, is smaller and has a thicker atmosphere. Yet the atmospheric escape rates of Venus are similar or even higher than the escape rates of Earth.<br />
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003206330600170X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003206330600170X?via%3Dihub</a><br />
The article you linked is based on some papers such as <a href="https://mgs-mager.gsfc.nasa.gov/publications/science_284_5415_acuna/science_284_5415_acuna.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> one, that are not up to current research. It is an understandable mistake as the concept that the lack of an intrinsic magnetic field, as it is the case with Venus and Mars, will lead to a higher ablation of the atmosphere by the solar wind, is sometimes still taught at Universities. However current research simply does not support these claims anymore.The paper is from 1998. Since then we have learned a lot from the Venus and Mars Express mission as well as several Earth observing missions. We now know that the interaction of the solar wind with our intrinisc magnetic field deposits energy which can lead to higher escape rates due to an expansion of the ionosphere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We have emerged from this transformation with
ample evidence and community acceptance that the iono-
sphere expands to the magnetospheric boundaries and
escapes continually into the downstream solar wind, its
composition and partial pressure varying with solar wind
drivers. Updated ionospheric models now produce the
observed heavy ion outflows from solar wind energy inputs.
We also have promising new or revised global circulation
models that incorporate the ionosphere as an extended load
within the system, and we are learning that this load can be
felt all the way out to the boundary layer reconnection
regions.  </p>

<p>Why does Mars have such a thin atmosphere? Well it is very small and low mass compared to Earth/Venus. Therefore its escape velocity is much lower, so particles can escape with less energy than on Earth. Furthermore the atmosphere is thin and Mars is farther from the sun. That means there are less ions in the atmosphere, since there is less ionization due to the larger distance and due to fewer particles that can be ionized. The atmosphere of a planet without an intrinsic magnetic field is protected by its induced magnetic field. The ions in the atmosphere start to move, and moving charges created a magnetic field. It can be shown that the ions in the atmosphere will exactly counteract the magnetic field carried by the solar wind, effectively shielding the atmosphere from the solar wind and preventing ablation.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Counterintuitively, the increased ion production still better shields the atmosphere from the energy carried by the solar wind; however, very little energy is required due to the low gravity binding the atmosphere to Mars.   </p>

<p>The whole field of planetary atmosphere/magnetosphere interaction with the solar wind is a very active field of study. It is a complex topic that is still relatively poorly understood since it is difficult to observe atmospheric escape rates and due to the magnitude of effects it is difficult to model. The paper, that the link you posted is based on, is a small workshop paper. It is a neat little idea, but it definitely should not be taken too seriously at this stage. Furthermore I question the effectivity of the proposed magnetic shield since the main reason for Mars thin atmosphere is its low mass. </p></div>		</li>
