<p>Most filters 'should' have a coagulant that traps most the cyrpto bacteria before the sand. I put Aluminium sulphate in the strainer basket during a backwash (the process of cleaning the filter) which then disintergrates and settles a top the filter sand. </p>
<p>Chemicals commonly used </p>
<p>Cholrine - Calcium Hypocholrite - the cleaning agent for most pools </p>
<p>Sodium Bicarbonate - Used to raise the alkalinity in pools, can also clean the pool, as in make tiles sparkle</p>
<p>Calcium flake - Calcium cholride - Used to raise the calcium levels in the pool</p>
<p>Co2 - raise acidity levels, maintain correct PH</p>
<p>Theres loads more, like Bromine &amp; Ozone, but the list above is what most modern pools will have in their plant rooms. </p>
<p>Now a days pool plants are being fitted with a high powered UV lamp, the water passes over and cleans the water, killing 99% of bacteria. Cholrine is used in conjunction. The main advantages of UV are that you use less chemicals, save money long term &amp; have  super clean pool water. Our combined cholrine dropped from 0.6/7 to 0.1/2, sometimes lower. </p></div>		</li>
