			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, it's lower back. If I sleep on my back, the lower back doesn't touch the bed surface and it gets pretty uncomfortable pretty quickly. It's really only a problem if i'm not in my own bed, or the bed is firm/hard. camping? I just sleep knees bent. Mostly tho I'm on my side if possible. I have a waterbed so I don't have to go knees up. </p>
<p>But yeah lower back is my pain. The wife, tho, has hip pain as well if she doesn't sleep on mostly stomach. If I've got bubble, she's got whatever would be the next step or 2 up... geodesic dome I guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a side sleeper and I'm wondering what the pillow between the knees is supposed to achieve. I usually stagger my legs with the one underneath in front of the one on top, so that I'm pseudo laying on my back (but I can't actually lay on my back because it gives me discomfort).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as i've gotten older (i'm 50) I find more and more it starts to hurt if I sleep on my side and don't cushion my knees. Only thing I can figure is it's the pressure of bone on bone that gets annoying.</p>
<p>I can use anything. even a folder up hand towel, but preferably a throw pillow.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP or fact checking but I'm pretty sure it's because sleeping on your stomach contorts your posture. When the body relaxes on its stomach, the head tends to droop lower than it should, and the back bows in the middle. It's worse for overweight people because your gut will exaggerate the odd angle. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm slender and when I try to sleep on my stomach it feels like it's being snapped in half. And I imagine I used to be able to sleep on my stomach comfortably because I had a gut which pushed my lower back back into alignment. You say the back bows in the middle on your stomach. But if you had a gut then it wouldn't bow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Reasons I've heard -- keeping your head turned that far for long periods isn't great for your neck.  If your mattress is soft you have a tendency to &quot;fish back&quot;.  Often stomach sleepers sleep with one or both arms above their head, which can pinch the brachial plexus and lead to problems.</p>
<p>I'm a long long time stomach sleeper, and the only problem <em>I've</em> really noticed is the brachial plexus.  Every night I half-wake up to throw an asleep arm down to my side, which I'm sure isn't great for the nerves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me tell you all about the consequences of my stomach sleeping. It started I want to say early high school, not sure if it was an emotional thing or what but I wasn't always a stomach sleeper. </p>
<p>-My jaw has shifted. It affected my teeth too, but everything was only on the side that I slept on. My bite didn't touch, until I switched to my back and gradually I am starting to bite properly. </p>
<p>-My tinnitus got worse (they think it may have even been the cause) </p>
<p>-My back when I wake up feels like I was beaten and really doesn't improve ever. I've destroyed my spine. Proper posture is painful. </p>
<p>-My neck is the same way - stiff, painful</p>
<p>-My face is SO oily. I recently started forcing myself to sleep on my back, and my acne has miraculously stopped coming around after years. </p>
<p>-My boobs used to hang in a much more attractive way - now they go off to the side since I basically force them to do that 7 hours a day. Not that anyone complains about them - but I do wish I could go braless again. </p>
<p>Moral is, don't do it. Force yourself to sleep another way. I recommend those contoured pillows because they're incredibly uncomfortable to sleep on your face, so you'll end up either on your back or side. </p></div>		</li>
