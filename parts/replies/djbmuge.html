<p>The Bitcoin paper solves an important problem in computer science called &quot;the Byzantine generals problem&quot;, which aims to achieve trust and consensus among two or more parties by using untrustworthy communication channels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was claimed in forum posts that &quot;Bitcoin's basic concept&quot; is capable of solving Byzantine Agreement. Later a paper by Miller &amp; LaViola argued a probabilistic solution for <em>computationally limited adversaries</em>, with <em>negligible probability in a security parameter k</em>, where the number of messages exchanged is O(n^(2) k) and running time O(n^(2) k) - no description as to how additional messaging or computation leads to a solution of BA.  A thorough analysis describing the relevant security properties has yet to appear.</p>
<p>I think it serves no point for this claim to be misrepresented in this context. It is irrelevant to the properties that prevent forgery.</p>
<p>You can read a more thorough analysis of Bitcoin-related claims in Garay, Kiayias, and Leonardos, &quot;The Bitcoin Backbone Protocol: Analysis and Applications&quot;, EUROCRYPT 2015 , where the authors begin by describing a randomised BA protocol on top of solely proof-of-work assumption for bounded adversaries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are currently (June 2017) no known collisions for SHA-2. Currently, the best public attacks break preimage resistance for 52 rounds of SHA-256 or 57 rounds of SHA-512, and collision resistance for 46 rounds of SHA-256.</p>
