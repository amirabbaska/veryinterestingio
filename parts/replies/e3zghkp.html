<blockquote>
<p>Robots will never be intelligent enough. They can't feel our emotions, they can't love, they can't consider nuanced contexts, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if you don't believe that, then you believe they'll inevitably surpass us in every way. We built stuff that can outfarm, outrun, or even (partially) outthink us. And soon, our robots will translate such spiders into human-speak.</p>
<p>And you will still be wrong.</p></div>		</li>
