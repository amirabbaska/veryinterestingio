			<div class="markdown"><p>It was also incredibly difficult to get soldiers to kill each other. Sometimes they might just intimidate the other unit and have them run away, sometimes units actually fought or stood lines against each other. Modern day combat is much easier to kill (albeit difficult mentally and emotionally) your enemy as you don't have to see them die in front of you, you can just shoot a weapon or a rocket and smoke them from 300 meters away. In ancient warfare and even in medieval warfare it could be very bloody, or it could be a standoff, or it could be just lines of men smashing into each other. </p>
<p>To the original poster, it's hard to get any type of historical accuracy from a movie, show or what have you because that's simply not exciting. Having people line up and smash into each other can be a very boring thing to watch in a theatrical sense. </p>
<p>To answer as well about &quot;uniforms&quot; certainly in the middle ages (and again even in the Roman and ancient era's) there were types of uniforms. But modern nation states did not truthfully exist in the sense that we see it until between the 16 and 1700s. Even then if you weren't in a capital (let say something like Paris in France) you probably didn't even understand you were &quot;French&quot; and you probably spoke a completely different dialect than lets say someone from the country. So these types of uniforms were normally crests, royal authority etc. Especially in the Middle Ages, when nation states didn't even exist and you had the Royal elite fighting because they could afford it and less because their king or governing official told them to. </p>
<p>To the original question, like the poster above me stated you fought the people in front of you. Lining up and attacking was something that they did and skirmishes were incredibly rare. Maybe tracking down your opposite or enemy if they decided to run, other than that many battles were concrete straight forward and one unit broke very quickly. </p>
<p>Fun fact why France wears blue (for the most part) is Napoleon decided to make his soldiers wear blue to make it easier to spot during battle. It made the French fighting for Napoleon have to be more weary of their enemy and to actually fight back because battles and fights were still extremely personal and it was still incredibly difficult to get someone to kill another person when it was that intimate. So creating blue uniforms made it an incentive to fight harder so they wouldn't get spotted or killed faster.</p>
<p>And please if anyone has more information or if I mislead people correct me! I graduated in 2016 with a degree in European History and am in Medicine now (Nursing) so my mind with history isn't where it used to be. Haha. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Also formations allow for interesting tactics like front 2 rows holds the shields while the row behind them poke with spears. Front holds the shields while rear rains arrows.</p>
<p>Unlike in video games, if you shoot arrows at a battle you are just as likely to hit your men in the back as their men in the shield.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting take on how armies used to fight. But does this only apply to European medieval combat? Because from what I learned, the Mongols fought vastly different. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It applies to basically all combat. The Mongols (and many others) did fight differently, but not that differently. They still mostly &quot;fought&quot; through seiges and dick waving. They still fought battles in formations; their formations were much looser and moved around a lot more, but you didn't get a big mess of 1 on 1 duels</p></div>		</li>
