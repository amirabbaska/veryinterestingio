			<div class="markdown"><p>I always wonder if the THC actually degrades over time, and if so how this affects the high. If I find a capsule of 5-year old weed, it's obviously going to be totally stale, but it still gets you high, right? Does it get you high the same was as when it was fresh (barring taste etc.)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't actually know really. I googled around a bit and the answer seems to be a bit varied as well. Lots of people have opinions, hard science is a little harder to come by. This seems one of the better sources of information</p>

<p>As best I can tell, it links up with what other people say - how it was stored is more important than time. You probably want to treat it like you would an aromatic spice - out of oxygen as much as possible, and potentially in the dark. With that said 1.5-2 years seems to be the best time period to smoke it in, beyond that and I imagine degradation of the organic material may become problematic even if its well stored. I'd assume after several years it would be running at close to half potency? Much less if the budswere damp at the start and end up growing mold</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That link is helpful, thanks for digging that up. I'm excited that we're still in an age where a question like this has yet to be nailed down. Idk too much about how organic matter breaks down; in my mind I always think of THC crystals like little pebbles on the bud, and I assume they just last forever, but who knows.</p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Definitely</em> in the dark. Light absolutely ages weed.</p>

<p>Actually, like wine, weed can be stored indefinitely in the proper conditions! Of course, those conditions are usually not present. But a cool dark place with the right humidity level does wonders.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Post-harvest treatment is critical, but I'd disagree with that statement. There are strains that are 20% CBD and 1% THC, and vice versa. Post-harvest treatment can affect the balance a couple of % but it doesn't get anywhere close to that variance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, good point. I phrased that really badly, I meant that in terms of the end appearance of the weed - how sticky it is, how much it smells, how much it gums up a grinder etc, how shiny it looks. Strain is 100% the most important factor when it comes to the high and the CBD/THC ratios, you're correct. Edited it to hopefully make it clear Im not referring to the psychoactive effects much when i talk about post harvest treatment. Thanks for the correction :)</p></div>		</li>
