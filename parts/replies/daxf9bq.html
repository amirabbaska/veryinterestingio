			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of misleading stuff mixed in with the good info here. Lets not to overboard with dramatization and trying to be contrary.</p>
<p>Evolution absolutely works towards a goal. The goal is perfect fitness in the environment. The direction of the process is such that every generation incrementally but stochastically (i.e with randomness) moves to better fitness where possible. This is the very definition and premise of natural selection! Saying that evolution is goal-less and simply is a process of 'change' is completely wrong and missing the point. It is a process of change leading to better fitness in the environment. Its not a matter of opinion, its the fundamentals of what evolution and natural selection is!</p>
<p>So given that, organisms absolutely will be at various levels of fitness, and hence could be said to be at different levels of advancement in their evolution. This is often masked by the fact that over millions of years the environment too changes, but if you look at any span of relatively stable environment, it becomes obvious that over millions of years and thousands of generations, organisms move from being poorly fit and un-advanced, to having advanced adaptations that raise their fitness in the environment. So yes, rice of today is more advanced and more fit than rice of 100K years ago in the same wet-fields environment they evolved in. Dolophins and Whales of today are more advanced and more fit in the aquatic environment than they were 40 million years ago when they still had legs they had to paddle with!</p>
<p>The issue comes when trying to compare organisms in different environments in terms of advancedments, which is akin to trying to compare if human hands are more advanced than bat wings. Well bat wings are advancing towards fitness in flying, and human hands towards dexterity. Comparing across domains increasingly loses meaning. On the other hand, you could still totally and very accurately compare different strains of rice for advanced fitness. You could compare rice with other grasses with a little less accuracy and meaning. You could compare rice with all plants with even less meaning, Or you could try and compare rice with humans, and have absolutely no meaning left at all.</p>
<p>(And btw, since its interesting, grasses are pretty advanced compared to other plants, and hence they have so successfully taken over most of the world. And in addition, some grasses like Maize have evolved an even more advanced form of phtosynthesis (C4) which enables them to use sunlight and water more efficiently to build mass. Rice actually isn't one of them (it uses the older C3 mechanism). And there's a huge global project going on to try and see if we can hack together enough genes to make a C4 version of rice which would be much more successful than regular rice, and could feed more people from less land and resources!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your input and would like to discuss some things, since I think there's misunderstanding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Evolution absolutely works towards a goal. The goal is perfect fitness in the environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That would be like saying that the goal of gravity is to attract objects, it isn't a sentient process, it's just something that happens, that's why it doesn't have a goal, because it isn't designed by someone. Biological evolution is the &quot;change in populations of inheritable traits over generational time&quot;, I explain more deeply <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/5fzjw1/i_have_another_question_about_evolution/daq4dx2/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/evolution/comments/5fzjw1/i_have_another_question_about_evolution/daq4e4t/" target="_blank">here</a>. You don't need a change in fitness for evolution to happen, simple neutral mutation is considered evolution (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral_theory_of_molecular_evolution" target="_blank">Neutral theory of molecular evolution</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The direction of the process is such that every generation incrementally but stochastically (i.e with randomness) moves to better fitness where possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evolution can move in any &quot;direction&quot;, it isn't necessary for it to move &quot;forward&quot; to be considered evolution, that's a huge hole in the understanding of evolution, to think it <em>has</em> to &quot;move forward&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is the very definition and premise of natural selection!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, this shows a fundamental misunderstanding, natural selection is the &quot;differential survival and reproductive success of traits&quot;. It <em>doesn't have</em> to improve the fitness, you can have natural selection by only purging the disadvantageous traits while keeping the mean constant but with less variation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Saying that evolution is goal-less and simply is a process of 'change' is completely wrong and missing the point. It is a process of change leading to better fitness in the environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Natural processes don't have a goal, they have consequences, we have a semantic disagreement here, you're saying that the consequence of the process <em>is</em> the goal of the process. The goal of radioactive decay isn't the formation of more stable atoms, the goal of gravity isn't the attraction of masses, the goal of entropy is to lower a system's potential mechanical work; natural processes don't have goals, they aren't sentient, they don't &quot;want&quot; to achieve anything, they just happen.</p>
<p>You don't need better fitness to consider that evolution is happening, a great example is genetic drift, where a tiny sample size from an original population can result in &quot;bad&quot; consequences, like the fixation of a complete disadvantageous trait.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So given that, organisms absolutely will be at various levels of fitness, and hence could be said to be at different levels of advancement in their evolution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, they will be at various levels of fitness, but you're missing out something crucial, a single trait doesn't dictate the whole fitness of an organism. Traits, and their manifestation, apport in different intensity to the fitness of an organism. Above that, the network of interactions with all the biotic and abiotic elements in their environment adds to the complexity of fitness.</p>
<p>What are you telling here is that &quot;greater fitness&quot; = &quot;more advanced&quot;, which doesn't hold up considering what I have exposed previously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is often masked by the fact that over millions of years the environment too changes, but if you look at any span of relatively stable environment, it becomes obvious that over millions of years and thousands of generations, organisms move from being poorly fit and un-advanced, to having advanced adaptations that raise their fitness in the environment. So yes, rice of today is more advanced and more fit than rice of 100K years ago in the same wet-fields environment they evolved in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only way to know, for sure, if there's a difference between the fitness of 100k yo rice and modern rice, would be to make crossed sowings, <em>i.e.</em> take modern rice and sow it at the environment from 100k y ago and taking 100k yo rice and sowing it at the modern environment, which is impossible. Change in traits doesn't strictly mean change in fitness, an organism can preserve its mean fitness and still keep changing each generation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dolophins and Whales of today are more advanced and more fit in the aquatic environment than they were 40 million years ago when they still had legs they had to paddle with!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there's a confusion from your side, evolution isn't only natural selection and natural selection isn't only adaptation, there's more to the story than that (see <a href="http://www.musicoflife.website/images/replacement.jpg" target="_blank">Extended Synthesis</a>, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04578.x/abstract;jsessionid=38B140B970C51810515748D7920E4C5B.f03t04" target="_blank">paper here</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The issue comes when trying to compare organisms in different environments in terms of advancedments, which is akin to trying to compare if human hands are more advanced than bat wings. (...) Comparing across domains increasingly loses meaning.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I completely agree with you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well bat wings are advancing towards fitness in flying, and human hands towards dexterity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I disagree in (a) the use of &quot;advancing&quot; and (b) the notion that they're moving to a fixed point (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exaptation" target="_blank">Exaptation</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>grasses are pretty advanced compared to other plants</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Replace &quot;advanced&quot; with successful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>some grasses like Maize have evolved an even more advanced form of phtosynthesis (C4) which enables them to use sunlight and water more efficiently to build mass. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>C4 metabolism is constrained by environmental factors, C4 metabolism is more successful than C3 metabolism <em>only</em> under a hot and dry environment. Yes, there's a difference in the efficiency in their use of water, but there's also a difference in their energy input, C4 needs uses more ATP and only happens at night (for more information, see <a href="https://www.werc.usgs.gov/OLDsitedata/seki/pdfs/IJPS_Keeley_Rundel.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there's a huge global project going on to try and see if we can hack together enough genes to make a C4 version of rice which would be much more successful than regular rice, and could feed more people from less land and resources!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much more successful <em>only</em> in hot, dry areas. That's important to keep in mind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a point where pedantry expands to a point where it overshadows the pursuit of truth itself, and it seems you have surpassed that point, so congratulations, I have no interest in arguing line by line about how you use words differently than everybody else seems to.</p>
<p>And just for others who are likely to be continued to be mislead by this.. He is saying above that Evolution isnt a goal oriented process by pointing at genetic drift etc. Well, thats why evolution and 'natural selection' are two separate terms. The vast majority of evolution happens via natural selection, and that is just as directed towards greater fitness as water in a stream is oriented towards lower lands. Trying to argue if water really has a 'goal' to reach lower land because its not a sentient thing trying to go lower, basically reeks of willful blindedness. </p>
<p>And he's basically doing the same kind or argument with each couple lines he can. Its sad really, but at least I hope seeing through it prevents some more folk from being unnecessarily confused.</p></div>		</li>
