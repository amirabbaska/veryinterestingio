			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you be surprised if I told you the Telex network was still alive &amp; well &amp; being used for financial &amp; legal transactions well into the 1990's?</p>
<p>A lot of older banks are still running VERY old infrastructure that they basically are terrified of fiddling with - it's very gradually getting migrated to newer things but you'd be surprised how much is 20-30 years behind the times. </p>
<p>There's a lot of old COBOL code still working, and surviving COBOL programmers are able to command huge fees to tinker in the ancient workings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While much of the older code definitely still exists, the banks do not run on &quot;very old infrastructure&quot; as you describe. This is big, very serious business that cannot sustain data loss or down time. Most banks refresh their hardware every 3-5 yrs and the latest IBM mainframes are far, far from old. Here is what banks run on today:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. While some Cobol code might be old, the infrastructure is always up to date for this kind of business. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>as an aside the # of transactions and the fact that these are old, discrete networks is partly why bank transactions still take days to validate. You're going cross network and the standards are all over the place.</p>
<p>Some of these systems are literally running 2+ decades old soft/hardware</p></div>		</li>
