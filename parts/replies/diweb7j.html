<p>Are we talking like the calorie absorption in a genetically similar population can vary by 5% or 50%?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bleh, you're gonna make me read it?  I skimmed it quickly and couldn't find a direct conclusion (CALORIC MEASURMENT DIFFERS FROM BODY MASS CHANGE BY X% WHEN MEAT IS COOKED, Y% WHEN TUBERS ARE POUNDED) without knowing the body mass of a mouse.  This little nugget stood out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We note that modern raw foodists who eat meat and high‐quality plant products experience such high rates of chronic energy deficiency, despite processing their foods heavily by nonthermal means (38, 39), that a majority of females experience subfecundity (39). This finding suggests that, in humans, the caloric gains conferred by cooking may be not merely advantageous but also necessary for normal biological function.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Savage.</p>
<p>Also weird that pounding meat (both raw and cooked) reduced caloric availability.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read that the 95 percentile in humans is +- 300 calories.</p>
<p>You line up twenty humans (same height, weight, activity and composition) and sort them metabolically. The guy at the front and the guy at the back differ by 600 calories.</p>
<p>If you feed those two guys the same diets and they have the same activity the guy with the slower metabolism is going to be surprisingly fatter after enough time. The thing about weight gain is that consistency is far more important than intensity. They might level off and achieve homeostasis at 50lbs difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a source for that about the difference being 600 (remember folks, those aren't the norm, you're likely in the middle somewhere an mot on the extremes)</p>

<p>But I don't think a 600 calorie difference is going to lead to a 50 pound difference. When I transition from bulk to cut I'll swing about 1,000 calories a day and only see a difference of about 20 pounds at most (average probably closer to 15).</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder how many young scientists went to university for four years to do that job?</p></div>		</li>
