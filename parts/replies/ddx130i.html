			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for this thread about Novamin and Arginine.  A periodontist friend of mine told me that if I have really noticeable tooth sensitivity, go for Sensodyne <em>Powered by Novamin</em> or Colgate  <em>Pro Relief with Arginine.</em>  She said do not buy other sensitive teeth toothpastes (even regular Sensodyne), especially not whitening ones.</p>
<p>I have been using these two types (alternatingly depending on which one is one sale as they are a bit more expensive) for several years now.  I actually really notice a different and in fact, I've gone about a week now without using them (ran out) and I notice a lot more sensitivity.  In my personal opinion, I would recommend either of these two.  It makes a real difference for me.  Maybe not &quot;I'm going to rub ice cream on my teeth&quot; but a lot less discomfort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you only have mild sensitivity it can make it so you don't feel that sensitivity at all. Or weaken the feeling. Cold water and ice cream don't bother me anymore. </p>
<p>E: results may vary, obviously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Backing the previous poster. It works <em>really</em> well for mild sensitivity. I started using Sensodyne because it is one of the few without SLS in it. No I'm not a nutjob worried about &quot;Teh checmicals!!&quot;. My mouth area was always dry, like peeling and ashy dry. Nothing I used would help. Finally one day a saw a post on /r/SkincareAddiction that my toothpaste may be drying the hell out of my mouth. Started using it, no more ashy mouth, problem solved. Didn't think too much of it.</p>
<p>About a year after I started using sensodyne I went on vacation for 2 weeks and instead of taking both mine and my SO's tubes I just grabbed his. About halfway thru vacation I noticed that my teeth hurt all the time when eating/drinking cold things I had to be super careful. Thinking back I always did have to be careful, could never drink anything without a straw etc.</p>
<p>TLDR: Shit works yo..</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not a toothpaste so you don't brush with it. You rub it into the sensitive areas. That stuff is fantastic. I was able to drink cold water, ice cream etc again because of it. Brilliant.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Repair and Protect uses NOVAMIN, which I believe is not approved by the FDA in the US</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't know if NOVAMIN is FDA approved or not, but since it is patented in the US it is not sold over the counter (OTC). Currently it is prescription-only. US citizens can, however, purchase toothpaste with NOVAMIN from outside the US and have it shipped to them.</p></div>		</li>
