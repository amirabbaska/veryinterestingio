			<div class="markdown"><p>Oddly the mass cansel out totaly when your in a hollow sphere.  When your near the circumference the mass below you is pulling more but there is more mass above you.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a hollow shell, we wouldn't feel any gravity anywhere inside the shell</p>
<p>Gravity is an inverse-square force, which means that the force of gravity is inversely proportional (gets weaker) to the distance squared.</p>
<p>Now, consider a close rod and a far rod that look the same length. If the far rod is double the distance to the close rod, then the far rod must be twice as long.</p>
<p>Now, consider a close circle and a far circle that look the same size. If the far circle is double the distance to the close circle, then its width must be double the width of the close circle. Thus, the large circle's area is quadruple the area of the close circle.</p>
<p>In other words, given an object's apparent area, the object's actual area is proportional to the distance squared.</p>
<p>Now, imagine yourself anywhere in the hollow space inside a hollow shell. Look at a patch of earth. Now, turn around. As long as the shell is completely closed, there will always be a patch of shell on the other side of the same apparent area.</p>
<p>Both these patches exert gravity on you. Remember that the actual area of the patch is proportional to the square of the distance. Furthermore, remember that gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.</p>
<p>Thus, the gravitational forces of the two patches are of equal magnitude, and cancel each other out. Therefore, you would feel no gravity in a hollow earth, regardless of your location.</p>
<p>This line of thinking forms the basis of Gauss's law for gravity and electromagnetism (both inverse-square laws).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes total sense! So for the mass of the ground above you to have any effect on you the earth would need to be missing 180 degrees of the sphere opposite you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>debatable, because if you chop off half the sphere, the center of gravity is just now in the center of the remaining half.  the dense half core would probably violently sink into the half</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the mass of the ground above you to have an effect, it just has to be non-uniform. The Earth already is non-uniform with it being squished and mountains etc. so it would have a small effect.</p>
<p>If you started out with a perfectly uniform sphere then any amount of matter taken off would cause it to become non-uniform and you would get a net force. Missing 180 degrees of the sphere would certainly have an effect, but so would much much smaller amounts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I were underground and Mt Everest were over me I'd see this effect a lot more than if I were underground in Death Valley because of the non-uniform density of Earth and the more mass that would be over me? Cool.</p></div>		</li>
