			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm intrigued.  I want to see an example of &quot;the best we can make&quot; now.  How many colors are attainable?  What refresh rates?  Resolution?  I think it would be really neat to see/use a screen that did not shower everything in light.  I mean I have a kindle, but that's one color and certainly not the best money can produce.</p></div>		</li>
