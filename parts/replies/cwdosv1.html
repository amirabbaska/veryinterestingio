			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, people also left the country... It's just a matter of how many went which way. But when generalizing, I think using the population growth as the guesstimate of under 10 year old youths works fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know what the education standards in Saudi Arabia are like? I ask because my parents work in another Gulf Country and they are told that the schooling system there is pretty terrible. </p>
<p>If the education level is poor and private sector jobs that they consider acceptable (i.e. not anything involving manual labor or anything which immigrants from the third world are employed to do) are limited, surely this makes the current situation even worse as there is no real alternative for them aside from relatively comfortable and well paid government jobs. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One can also wonder what sort of new non-oil mass economy is even viable there.</p>

<p>What about tourism, especially the Hajj to Mecca? It's not comparable to oil money of course, but it will probably still be a decent source of income when SA gets close to become a third-world-country.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well they already DO.  But Saudi govt only gets 7.5% of its budget from non-petro, including the Hajj.  They could get more income off it- but it would become more commercial.</p>
<p>I think it comes down to a lot of just not taxing <em>anyone.</em>  They just fund off oil.  That ride's hard to get off of.</p>
<p>Really there's a fantastically difficult problem with the culture.  A whole lot of them just expect to be rich and powerful just by birthright, an expectation which requires a huge tap of money pouring into the country.  That's a big hangover to wake up from a 60-year party.  </p></div>		</li>
