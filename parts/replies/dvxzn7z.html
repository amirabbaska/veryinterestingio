			<div class="markdown"><p>Things have been updated on newer classes. On the Virginia class, two senior enlisted, known as the pilot and copilot, take orders directly from the conn. Typically, the pilot drives and the copilot manages ballast and trim, though either control station can do everything and they work together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The top answer doesn't mention buoyancy control; your answer seems more thorough.</p>
<p>It seems like you could store water, pressurized air, etc in tanks and just force that out with compressors when you want to ascend.</p>
<p>I couldn't imagine getting by with planes alone as you might not be moving or have propulsion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On mission you use planes alone. Blowing tanks is extremely loud, and there are so many redundancies in the electric plant that losing propulsion is very unlikely. However, you're right in that one of the reasons to emergency blow is a loss of propulsion.  </p>
<p>Edit: since pressure affects surface area affects buoyancy, you do end up pumping off/bringing on water when you're changing depth, but it also has a lot to do with speed, pressure, temperature, and salinity. Pumps are used instead of pressurized air because they're quieter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also not use the pressurized air unless needed because it's limited and pressurized air might be <em>heavier</em> (denser) than many other places on the sub.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to change depth but stay submerged, you don't make any special changes to buoyancy in the tanks except for your regular comps or if the DOOW/COW think you're running too heavy/light. Pressurized air can be used to shift water around the trim tanks or force out to sea but it can be louder than the trim pumps. Subs are almost always moving, at least bare steerageway, in order to keep position or maneuver (at PD, you need to be able to get down quick and it helps to have some momentum on the ship).</p></div>		</li>

<p>This makes me wonder if the crew ever has a meal that causes a lot of methane releasing poos that messes with the balance.  I'm sure the pressure is always measured and adjusted, but I wonder if there are certain times that the balance has to be adjusted due to a lot of stinky poos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We had a broken sanitary pump our second deployment so we'd pressurize the tanks and blow them overboard, then vent the tanks inboard on the midwatch. Smelling the collected poop of 140 dudes daily for months is an experience I do not recommend.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never thought about methane! Mostly the shitter gets full and you have to &quot;pump sans&quot; (pump the sanitary tanks overboard) and also take water into trim tanks to compensate. Like I said, a complex dance. </p></div>		</li>
