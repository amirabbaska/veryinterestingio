I remember my teacher telling me that in schools her mother has gone to, there was a time where a holocaust denier pulled their kid from class the day of her visit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you are 25 or more there are a lot of chances you have actually met a person who was there in the 1940's. Your grandparents to start with. And I don't know about other but with the ones I met when they started talking about that time, you listen and don't fucking doubt it. Because fuck the look in their eyes, no one's a good enough actor to fake that. </p>
<p>Now that I see this generation passing, I'm afraid more and more people are gonna say it didn't happen or just forget about the lessons about war, and mess up the world again. </p>
<p>What I read on reddit is weird to me sometime because most of redditors are American. And Americans don't seem to have the same vision on war. That yellow ribbon thing is an example of what I think is weird. And I believe the American vision about war (and the support it gains) is because war never happened on your land (I know about pearl harbor but i m talking in general). </p>
<p>Seeing that a person would take her kid away from the story is one of the dumbest thing a parent could do, no point taking the kid to school if you don't want him/her to learn more than you. Let him make his mind at least.
I wonder how you could justify it ? Except by bringing out sophisms... </p>
<p>It actually is shocking to me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two main wars have happened on US soil: American Revolution and the American Civil War. War has happened here. The problem is that not only has the US not had a recent war, we have not had a modern war. Early rifles and cannons don't hold a cannon to weaponry used in WWI/WWII, both of which destroyed a fair amount of Europe. Modern weaponry is even more terrifying. But, while this does contribute to the view on war, it doesn't affect much on the holocaust view, in my opinion.</p>
<p>I have met only two deniers, so my personal evidence is limited, and bother denied for different reasons. One denied because the government is a deceitful, self-serving construct and its only goal is to use fear to get what it wants. Wants to fight Hitler? Hey, the Holocaust happened! Wants to fight in the middle east? Let's destroy our World Trade Center to get support! That kind of thing. She even went so far as to explain the photos as concentration camps in the US for Jews specifically to stage the photos... with real dead people. And all survivors were just in the US and didn't know it.</p>
<p>The other didn't believe anyone could actually be that evil. Not much fascinating to this one, just believed it was all made up to make Hitler look worse than he was to get support for war. Thinks no one died.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah the problem isn't ignorance, or distrust. We all have a healthy level of distrust. And we all are ignorant of something.</p>
<p>The problem is <em>prideful</em> ignorance: &quot;I don't know something and I will actively make sure to keep things that way&quot;. And a pathological level of distrust that is unhealthy locks these people in the eternal damnation of stupidity. Not the empty insult &quot;stupidity,&quot; the objectively factual determination that these people are simply dumb.</p>
<p>I mean we all don't know something. The best we can do is keep an open mind to the possibility we can be wrong. It's when you close your mind with &quot;I know everything I don't trust you and go away with your evidence&quot; have you become a genuinely, objectively dumb stupid person.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. There is a lack of <em>humility</em> in these deniers. </p>
<p>Like you say, the average person does not have time to get immersed in all of these subjects. As such, the reasonable position is one of humility and recognition of just how little insight one actually has, if one is not a student of the topic. For instance, in my mind, a reasonable position would be: &quot;I have not studied it myself, but have no reason to doubt the consensus of the people who actually have studied it&quot;.</p>
<p>I have, myself, not studied the holocaust, but know too little to make a claim that would counter the established consensus. I am also aware of the large amount of work that has presumably gone in to establishing this consensus, and realize that my own thoughts or musings on the topic are completely insufficient to question the veracity of the consensus.</p>
<p>The average holocaust denier, or moon landing denier etc., will typically lack this level of humility, and believes that they can themselves - based on comparatively very little amount of research - overturn the established consensus. As such, it is not simply the case of doubting the government, or historians, or mainstream media, but a failure to recognize one's own shortcomings and comparatively shallow understanding and knowledge, in comparison to the establish scholars, or experts of a field. More often than not, it is also the failure to recognize just how much work has been done to establish these things as truths.</p>
<p>I find that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" target="_blank">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> typically explains these deniers quite well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I foresee this as becoming more and more an issue of the world. as science and technology progresses the gap between the amount of education needed to understand and the layman is going to be so huge that we might get to a point where people distrust tech. Just look at how we perceive GMOs, would you eat and buy synthetic meat if it had the exact same taste and building blocks as organic meat? This was a conversation at work the other day and this woman, young (27yo), non religious would never eat that. i argued that it would be more humane to the animals, and it would likely be more healthy as there wouldn't be any tapeworms like the kid in Cali had in his brain.</p>
<p>Look at evolution, just yesterday i commented in a thread where someone obviously didn't understand the concept that all species derive from the same ancient species.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's what makes television such a dangerous tool in the hands of propagandists. A lifetime of being fed a narrative hardens a mind, and makes it rigid in the face of ideas that conflict with the established dogmas. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the only way we had to learn about things was through institutionalized schooling, text books, and other second-hand accounts, this would make sense.  But there is still a tremendous population of primary sources alive today; in fact, nearly everyone alive either witnessed these events, or is related by blood or by law to someone who witnessed them.  </p>
<p>While it's not technically impossible for several generations of people around the world to all buy in to the same lie and perpetuate it to future generations, such a scenario is vastly LESS plausible than hard-to-believe events like the Holocaust or moon landing.  The amount of effort just to coordinate the complicity of at minimum tens of thousands of people, and maintain that complicity for generations, is frankly staggering.  So it's not a matter of simply not trusting sources; you have to believe in a massive global conspiracy (at minimum) in order to cast doubt on these historical events.  Or else you have to simply fail to consider the true scale of what your skepticism implies, turning a blind eye to the large population of eyewitnesses to these events that still walk among us.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This holds true for almost all historical events.</p>

<p>Great point - and this is true for more than just history, too! Science, medicine, pharmaceutical industry, climate change, vaccines, GMOs... any field that requires highly technical education and training to properly understand will inevitably attract conspiracy theories from people who, to an extreme, distrust the &quot;establishment&quot;. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To point at the elephant in the room: religion/mythology.</p>
<p>They tend to be ignored or accepted by the ways one was raised or not. Since the vast majority of us live in countries with a christian background, we tend to view a certain mythology as historical (or not) and others as fictional, because we simply haven't been raised in the tradition.</p>
<p>I wonder if the fanaticism of later &quot;converts&quot; (this could be to any idea, most of which has been mentioned by other posts in this thread) has something to do with the rejection of their former beliefs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a New Zealander raised by secular parents with religious parents, I find it hard to believe that anyone literally believes the myths… I was christened as a baby to appease my grandmother, but that's as far as my religious experience goes.
Don't get me wrong, I find the warmth and generosity of churchgoers fantastic, but I can't believe for a second any of the countless people I have met would be any less moral or decent if they didn't have faith in a higher power.
It seems to be really different in America, I have never been looked down on for being atheist, and I can't imagine what that even feels like.
Maybe it's just purely an intelligence thing. Any christian I've talked to took about 2 minutes to admit that science has surpassed scripture, and that their faith in God isn't based on the bible, but in the connectedness they feel with something greater than themselves.
I think this is universal, for me, I don't have a need to invoke another variable, I'm glad I exist, and while I don't understand how the universe came to be, I don't think any of the creation myths make any more sense than 'given an infinite amount of time, every possible thing will happen an infinite amount of times, and we are in one of those times that produced the universe as it is right now, with humans here on a giant spacerock we call earth, thinking these thoughts'
Is that correct? Fucked if I know, fucked if humanity will ever know! But if your life revolves around a deity with no proof of existence, and you choose pleasing this imagined being over the real people who have real measurable impact on your life, then I really hope your 'god' exists, that he is as narcissistic as your holy book claims, and you managed to luck on to the correct interpretation of the correct translation of the correct recollection of the correct  dictation of the correct prophet for the correct higher power, because if you are just a teency bit wrong, you are just as fucked as I am. But at least I have a reason to justify why I don't hate anyone because a guy in a silly dress told me I must.
Wow, that ranted. Apologies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salient point. I am what many redditors would affectionately call a &quot;tinfoil hat wearing retard&quot;. </p>
<p>That said, many other people lumped together with me in that same box do exactly what you imply: blindly glom onto a secondary narrative following the rejection of their previous untenable position. </p>
<p>The problem being they attach themselves to &quot;bullet proof&quot; perspectives.  That's not to say they even remotely reflect reality, but that opposing knowledge comes from known liars. </p>
<p>A good example of this is defensive posturing. I can form an unassailable defense for the moon landing being faked using nothing but NASA approved data; but I can't prove it was faked.  These people take it on faith that they are correct while I view it as conspicuously unconfirmed. </p>
<p>From a neutral perspective, I can provide a compelling case to skip at least half of the recommended vaccine schedule using only the CDC pink book. </p>
<p>From a contrarian perspective, I can scoff that people believe the original holocaust story when mainstream historians have multiple times reduced death tolls and survivors have reported (and been verified) being treated quite well: performing in bands, having swimming pools, playing games, even having access to brothels!</p>
<p>I'd also ask any rational human being which is the cheaper method of exterminating a large amount of people in a time of war: transporting them across regions, housing them, feeding them, clothing them, providing them with entertainment and whores...  Or shooting them. </p>
<p>Or hell, even if you just had your heart set on giving them all one last train ride: why waste any resources at all afterwards when humans are perfectly capable of starving to death all by themselves?</p>
<p>History is written by the victors. I'd hate to see what the rest of the world would be saying today about the Japanese concentration camps had America lost the war. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a really interesting book by Michael Parenti called <em>History as Mystery</em>, regarding the recording of historical events as a political act in and of itself.</p>
<p>In it, he examines a few key historical events that are evidenced to have been recorded a certain way at the time for other reasons than accurate record keeping. He makes points about the kind of people who wrote historical accounts - generally the educated aristocracy or the devout religious. For instance, he challenges the idea of medieval Europe as religion-obsessed by using inquisition accounts of atheistic common people.</p>
<p>He also talks about a general who messed up in a war, leading to the death of thousands of men and literally replaced pages of his journal from an identical notebook so it wouldn't look so bad.</p>
<p>He generally includes multiple pages of citations at the end of each chapter. Some may scoff at the specific content or view it as some kind of partisan propaganda (as he is widely considered a liberal and socialist), but it's a riveting read and you come away <em>challenging</em> what you may have thought at school, rather than having adopted an ideology.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends. A lot of science denying people think that whatever they can't spell, then that stuff is toxic or unnatural. They lack knowledge in any type of science and they deny everything they don't understand.</p>
<p>Example: &quot;shampoos have toxins. Would you wash your kid with substances that you can't even spell, let alone know what they mean?&quot;</p>
<p>That's one of the views I read on a childrens' forum for parents who were urged to know what they're intoxicating their kids with: vaccines, shampoos, sodas etc.</p>
<p>If you also show them what a strawberry is made out of, they'll probably go crazy that the fruit is toxic too. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/sm3U5v0.jpg" target="_blank">https://i.imgur.com/sm3U5v0.jpg</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe Sigma here refers to a specific part of science. Parts that are a little less concrete.</p>
<p>Take evolution for example. </p>
<p>Or the stuff with the LHC. I mean, I have a bit of high school physics education, and I am above average interested in science-y stuff. I have read about it, but really, I have no fricking clue what <em>actually</em> goes on there, or how I would interpret it and get any kind of meaningful data from it.</p>
<p>Another example: You have no reason to not believe in gravity. However, if you tried to explain it to someone who was born and grew up in zero-G(space!), who do not have a relevant education, &quot;being pulled towards the ground&quot; would sound kinda silly, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Then again, some people are simply crazy/stupid/against the machine for the sake of it.</p></div>		</li>
