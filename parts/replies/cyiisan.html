			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this as well: there is also a cultural aspect to this system. For a long time (And even still to a slightly lesser degree), your children were your retirement. Culturally, it was the children's duty to take care of you in your old age. And culturally, it was your son that supported you financially.</p>
<p>So many people had kids they gave up for adoption because they were girls under the 1-child policy. People wanted sons because that is their long term plan for life. This causes a lot of problems with China's population becoming one-sided. Many families kept having kids until they had a son because they couldn't reliably trust the girls' husband to take care of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is also worth mentioning that the &quot;one child policy&quot; did not take effect until almost 20 years after 1960 (and had exceptions), so the OP's question has an inaccurate assumption embedded in it:

<li>September 25, 1980 was the official date though a voluntary program had started two years earlier. With a start population of approximately one billion.</li>
<li>Enforcement occurred unevenly with rural families not following the strictures.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It also was uneven with the rich. I Have a chinese friend who has three siblings: one born in china, he himself born in America, and teo more born in Hong Kong. If you really want a second child you could just take a flight out of the country and have a child there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. In the countryside, it was still easy to get around up to the cancellation of the policy in 2015. You could also pay a tax for each extra child you had, the amount depending on the province. Prosperous families in less prosperous provinces were able to afford multiple children completely legitimately.</p>
<p>Having a child in secret, then giving him/her up for adoption was also very common in the countryside, and a common way of circumventing the policy. My ex-girlfriend had two brothers in her family this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You also have to understand that the one-child policy will only begin to reduce China's population when the generation born before the policy begins to die, since every child born after is only adding to the pre-policy population.</p>
<p>The One-Child policy is catastrophic because 1 person has to support 4 grandparents and 2 parents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the one child policy plays out for different people in China depending on their income and where they live. Farmers that rely on their children were not limited by the one child policy nor were upper middle class families that could afford to pay the fine. When you think of a population of one billion, that's a lot of upper middle class people and farmers considering China was around 60% rural population. </p></div>		</li>
