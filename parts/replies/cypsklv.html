			<div class="markdown"><p>Another potential reason is that some of the involved gene regulatory networks are located on or have involvement with the sex chromosomes. A woman would have two X copies giving greater resistance to a damaged X chromosome component as they have a second, where as a man only has the one copy of the X chromosome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that is precisely why some recessive genes affect men more than women (such as baldness). The Barr body thing is random (if I recall correctly - there may be a few exceptions) so about 50% of your cells will use the good X chromosome and that's usually enough to suppress the bad phenotype. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For many genes. Not all x chromosome genes are inactivated. Moreover, inactivation is (mostly) random and cells are mosaic in this regard. Both copies will still be expressed, just not at once. Often, this leads less penantrance of recessive disease traits, but that depends on the gene and how it functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Elsewhere in this thread, /u/borophylle mentions Bateman's principle, which states that in general males have greater variation of traits than females. Is the redundancy in female XX chromosomes and the increased number of recessive traits possible in XY chromosomes the cause of this phenomenon? Do male genes simply have a wider spread of possible genetic traits (good or bad)? I suppose it makes sense for females to have 'safer' genes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>According to wiki it's the variability in reproductive success not variation in traits that is greater in males. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In general it is the case that they go along together, but in some species there are reversals where the female takes greater risks despite having redundancy in chromosomes. For example, female hyenas. You shouldn't attribute all of Bateman's principle to chromosome redundancy, but they are indeed related.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also been theorised that females have better social-imitation skills, and so some girls will cope so well by imitating 'correct'  behaviour that they'll be able to hide their symptoms. Therefore avoiding diagnosis at all. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the difference between &quot;social-imitation skills&quot; and just social skills? And isn't low social skills part of the diagnostic criteria for autism?</p>
<p>In other words, it sounds to me like those &quot;social-imitation&quot; girls that avoid diagnosis simply don't have autism.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this would be a decent example: everyone in the group starts laughing so you take a cue that you're <em>supposed</em> to find something funny. </p>
<p>Basically when you're imitating you're not actually reacting naturally to events happening like laughing at a funny joke, you more or less follow a script of how you're &quot;supposed&quot; to act.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>person A and person B both have autism</p>
<p>Person A hears a joke that's funny to socially normative people, but it, say, contained an error he focuses on; he doesn't laugh, and attempts to correct the person's speech afterwords.</p>
<p>Person B hears the joke, and has the same internal reaction, but laughs with the others because that's what that person's &quot;supposed&quot; to do.</p>
<p>They're both autistic, because autism is a chemical and neural problem; they handle it differently because of their intents.  Women are more likely to bear things like self-denial and other traits because of societal pressure (and to be more vulnerable to societal pressure, before that) in most of the world, so it lines up that people who would subvert themselves to do the &quot;right&quot; thing are more likely to be female, in this situation.  Same thing for cultural prevalence of ASD and collectivist societies, afaik.</p></div>		</li>
