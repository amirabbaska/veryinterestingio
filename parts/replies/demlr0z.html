			<div class="markdown"><p>So we pay for water but the system has to waste water at the end of the line anyway?</p>
<p>Why couldn't houses have a system of constant use? Like the toilet using a constant drain or something?</p>
<p>Speaking of... all the fuss about toilets using too much water, and whatever else, seems pointless if the system wastes it at the end anyway...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wasted water is both a bane and a necessity.</p>
<p>It boils down to the cost of doing business, really.  Water can't be allowed to be stagnant in the pipes, because once the leftover chlorine is all used up bugs can grow, so it needs to be moving and refreshed more or less constantly. </p>
<p>The municipality I work in is a seasonal tourist area, in the winter months the population drops to about 1/3 of the summer. so the water is not being used as fast by clients, but we still need to keep water flowing through the pipes. So we open up the bleeders wider in the winter.</p>
<p>The consumers can totally run water constantly in their own houses to ensure the pipes are disinfected, but the users pay for every drop that goes through their water meter, and in most places they pay for that water again because of sewage rates (you pay drinking water fees and wastewater fees on what goes through your drinking water meter, as it is assumed that whatever comes out of your tap goes down your drain eventually). </p>
<p>So wasting water is both unwise and unnecessary for consumers to do.  For municipalities it is a budgeted expense, just like barrels of chlorine, and necessary to keep the water and pipes safe, just like chlorine.</p>
<p>As for the fuss... if consumers are wasting waster (not 'using' it, like leaky toilets, letting the taps run, non-efficient toilets, etc) as well as the municipality then more water needs to be treated by the plant, which costs in materials and electricity and maintenance. Not wasting water saves the consumer 3 ways. Less drinking water fees, less wastewater fees and less tax dollars needed to make the extra water being wasted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't waste water. They use a predetermined amount of water for a purpose. That's different than every toilet in the system just running. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a black-and-white issue. Perhaps this &quot;waste&quot; is only 0.1% of overall usage. Also, virtually <em>everything</em> is about trade-offs, costs and benefits. There is a cost of some used water for the benefit of cleaner pipes and avoidance of a contamination outbreak (which has its own costs). It's fine to use water for things; you don't have to ration yourself to a gallon a day for drinking only and nothing else, unless you're in a place where it's so scarce that it's not even delivered in pipes.</p></div>		</li>
