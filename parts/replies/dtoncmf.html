			<div class="markdown"><p>That's sort of correct - two orbiting bodies at the same altitude in <em>circular</em> orbits will have the same velocity - however almost all satellites will have slightly elliptical orbits, with a higher altitude at one point in the orbit and a lower altitude at the opposite side.</p>
<p>Let's say you have two objects in the exact same circular orbit - if you accelerate one object in the direction it's travelling (a prograde burn), that will increase its velocity without increasing its altitude <em>on this side</em> of its orbit.</p>
<p>This, in turn, increases its altitude on the opposite side - so now it's going faster than a circular orbit at perigee, and slower than a circular orbit at apogee (the highest point).</p>
<p>So these objects will now have different velocities and different orbital periods, but the same altitude <em>at one part of their orbits.</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The idea here is that the near side would have had just as many impacts, but the really big impacts would have erased the smaller ones through the creation of the lunar maria.</p>
<p>Wherever you see a lunar maria is sign of an impact that was big enough to pierce the crust, and hot lava to spilled out onto the surface. That would have the effect of re-paving the surface smooth, wiping out any sign of previous impacts.</p>
<p>So, if one side has a much thinner crust, it's much easier to pierce, and thus much easier to erase signs of previous impacts.</p></div>		</li>
