			<div class="markdown"><p>His Footnote 4 drives me nuts, though:</p>
<p>&quot;If we let the energy blast the electrons apart at near the speed of light, we'd see that energy actually take the form of mass, as the electrons gained mass relativistically. That is, until something stringy happened.&quot;</p>
<p>For one thing, he's using the outdated concept of &quot;relativistic mass&quot; here, though that in itself is no crime.</p>
<p>The real problem is the implication that there's something special about a situation in which energy can &quot;take the form of [relativistic] mass.&quot; In fact, relativistic mass is just total energy measured in different units, so total energy E is <em>always</em> equivalent to a corresponding relativistic mass of E/c^(2), in much the same way that xº Celsius is always equivalent to (1.8x + 32)° Fahrenheit. They're just different ways of expressing the same quantity.</p>
<p>The wording he uses (&quot;take the form of&quot;) obscures that simple truth, and misleadingly calls to mind the conversion of kinetic energy to rest energy (mc^(2)), when it's really the opposite: rest energy (mass) of the &quot;electron Moon&quot; (electric potential energy, to be precise) is converted to kinetic energy of the electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No not at all. For example you can create an electron-positron pair, the positron being an positively charged anti-electron. Then you'll have more electrons than protons.</p>
<p>Likewise, quark-antiquark pairs, the constituents of protons, can be created individually from electrons.</p>
<p>There are lot's of different particles with different charges. You only need to make sure that the total charge stays the same, the rest is more or less up to you, although there are other additional conservation laws, and quasi-conservation laws. [Number of electrons minus Number of protons] is no such conserved quantity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We don't even know that the universe or the number of particles in it are finite, otherwise the question makes no sense. And there is always a possibility that far beyond the range of observable universe there are random unbalanced charges just floating around, even if this seems very unlikely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it is also because of the electric field behavior of dipoles correct? E is inversely proportional to r^3 when considering dipoles so from fairly short distances compared to gravity to other charged bodies it looks like the dipole isn't even there (or that it's neutral, same thing). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The total charge of the universe is zero, but it's not necessarily uniformly distributed. This means that there's no monopole field, and only leaves the dipole moments as the most far reaching electrical fields, which fall of much quicker than gravity. Therefore, on a sufficiently large length scale, electrical interaction plays no role whatsoever. Higher multipoles fall off even quicker.</p></div>		</li>
