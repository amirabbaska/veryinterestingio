<p>Such as: Do you feel remorse when you beat your wife?</p>
<p>That wasn't even the worst that I heard, but it stuck with me. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yep. Those are trick questions, notice there is absolutely no correct &quot;Yes/No&quot; answer to that one. </p>
<p>But a stressed out suspect may answer and now they say &quot;Ok we have a tape recording of you admitting you beat your wife and feel no remorse&quot; Would you like to sign a confession for a plea deal or would you like us to play that for the jury in front of your friends and family?</p>
<p>The correct answer when questioned by the police is &quot;I would like to consult with an attorney. Until such consultation I will exorcise my right to remain silent.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, and this is important:</p>
<h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toxIiMWQgKA" target="_blank">SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP.</a></h1>
<p><strong>NOTHING</strong> you say can be used in your defense. The police have years of training in how to make you guilty, you don't know this one magic trick, you are not smarter than they are.</p>
<p>Even if you are 100% innocent:</p>
<p>Shut the fuck up. Get a lawyer. Do as your lawyer says.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You also have to be willing to do the time in jail while they figure out what to do.  The thing that forces most people to talk is wanting to go home and hoping it all goes away.  Once you decide you're going to fight this, the rest of it will come easy.</p></div>		</li>
