			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a book called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Survival-Sickest-Surprising-Connections-Longevity/dp/0060889667" target="_blank">Survival of the Sickest</a> I think would interest you.   </p>
<p>The tl;dr is that in populations that are under constant pathogen challenge (think malaria in Africa, or tuberculosis in Europe) you do see changes in the genome to reflect it.</p>
<p>But the changes are not 'for the better'.  What is selected for is surviving long enough to pass on your genes.  So what we wind up with is sickle-cell anemia, which kills its homozygous carriers, and can cripple its survivors and shorten their lifespans, but also conveys resistance to malaria.   Or, in the case of tuberculosis, the cystic fibrosis gene does the same- kill its homozygous carriers, allow its heterozygous ones to live long enough to have children and avoid tb.</p>
<p>In both cases, the populations are more suited for living in their conditions than an outsider would likely be. But (unfortunately for us), 'more suited' does not imply 'more robust'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for your response. This is really interesting actually. I knew that sickle-cell anemia protected* against malaria, but I didn't know about cystic fibrosis (or at least the gene that causes it) and TB resistance.</p>
<p>Very curious thought, that evolution is only directly active (for lack of a better term) up until you reproduce, as the effects of genes on later life don't really affect your reproduction earlier on in life. That being said, I do remember seeing something about the purpose of women going through the menopause is to stop them being in competition with their daughters/females of the group, and enabling them to be the grandmother figure, and that this has a positive impact on survival.</p>
<p>Really interesting thought though. Thanks for teaching me!</p></div>		</li>

<p>This cannot always be the case though right? Surely all of us have ancestors that faced some kind of constant pressure and overcame it. Lots of people from Europe have leftovers of fighting the plague and are more robust because of it right? I just can't imagine we evolved to live to 80+ if evolving past a disease always crippled our life spans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally, we do often see resistance to endemic pathogens passed down from individual to individual, and in a perfect, isolated system, you would expect resistance to develop across generations, almost always approaching a limit mind you. </p>
<p>This would not affect evolution as a whole, however. The real world is a complex, dynamic environment, and the burden of these specific pathogens usually shift greatly over time, and the individual pathogens themselves change greatly themselves as well. Because of this, and many other factors, direct resistance doesn't build up linearly as we would expect in an isolated system. Some of these important factors include: the pathogen, the individual infection, climate and environmental factors, and just pure luck. The length between generations in humans is also a substantial factor as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I've said above to Baeocystin, this is really interesting, thank you for the response and for teaching me.</p>
<p>It's an interesting to think that while we can theorise a linear system of if this then that, in reality, the world being so complex, it very rarely adds up the same way.</p>
<p>Thanks again. Appreciate the response!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't the pathogens also evolve more quickly than humans?  Wouldn't that mean that they could adapt to a gradual build of resistance in the human population quicker than we can build it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is quite a bit of ongoing research on this. If you look up the Hygiene Hypothesis, the argument is that humans have co-evolved with certain parasites to the point where our bodies' optimal state should have certain parasites, in a similar manner to how we benefit from our gut bacteria. </p>
<p>This is especially prevalent in developed countries that emphasize hygiene. This is being looked at as one of the reasons that allergies seem to be higher in developed countries. The theory goes that our immune system evolved to always be ramped up to deal with these parasites, while the parasites would constantly be repressing our immune system, and a relative balance was reached. However, now that it isn't normal in developed countries to have parasites, our immune system isn't repressed any longer, and over-reacts to certain things, causing allergies.</p>
<p>There have been some interesting studies which intentionally infected people who suffered from extreme allergies with certain worms (with appropriate consent, and the worms I believe were chosen to no reproduce within humans), and they found that the allergic reactions largely reduced. </p></div>		</li>
