			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no absolute silence, things can get infinitely quiet but there is a maximum loudness</p>
<p>Air pressure is 14.7 psi(1 ATM) and the dB is based on the wiggle in that pressure. The loudest possible sound is ~194 dB and swings from 0 psi to 29.4 psi(2 ATM), any higher would require negative pressure so it goes from being sound to being a shockwave.</p>
<p>The quietest sound would swing from 14.6999....99 psi to 14.7000....01. You can add more 0s and 9s to describe an even quieter sound</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would be in a vacuum.</p>
<p>But basically, any time you see something in decibels (electronic signals can be measured in dB, too) you're seeing a ratio of two numbers, not a single absolute measurement</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If air is moving, it's making a sound. You can keep scaling that down more and more, but for there to be no moving air, you would either need to have no air or be at absolute 0 (where there would be no gases anyway). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Negative infinity would be no sound at all, whereas zero is a sound that is incredibly quiet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never been a mathy person growing up, so this may come off a little silly and offensive, but this sounds incredibly unintuitive. Was it a result of natural mathematics, or was sound somehow forcibly equated to the logarithmic scale? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Logarithms are not immediately intuitive. I hope this ELI5 on logarithms and why we use them is useful to you. It's a bit long.</p>
<p>Most human senses don't sense things absolutely. Human senses are relative, which is why logarithms are very useful for representing things in a similar way to how we perceive them.</p>
<p>Imagine a room illuminated by one small light. Turn on a second light. You've increased the amount of light in the room. You'll notice it. </p>
<p>Now imagine a room filled with 100 light bulbs. Turn on the 101st bulb. You've added the same amount of additional light to the room. But you won't notice a difference. Doubling the amount of light is noticeable. Increasing it by 1% isn't, even if you're increasing the total amount of light by the same amount.</p>
<p>Brightness level, sound levels, and sound pitch are not perceived as absolute values, but are perceived relative to each other. People notice the difference, not the absolute. This is why a logarithmic scale is used for sound levels. It's closer to how we perceive sound volumes.</p>
<p>For representing things like this, logarithms are very useful. Increase one number by a single value, you increase another by a multiple.</p>
<p>For a simple example, say we created a called U. This is a logarithmic unit. 1 U = 1. And every time you increase U by one, you increase the value by 10. This means that.</p>
<p>1 U = 1</p>
<p>2 U = 10</p>
<p>3 U = 100</p>
<p>4 U = 1000</p>
<p>This is great. Now we can easily represent values from 1 - 100000000 using only one digit. Scales like this are very useful for measuring things that can have a wide range of values. </p>
<p>The problem comes if you want to represent the number 0. Because 0 U =/= 0. It is 0.1. Every time we decrease the value of U by one, we divide by 10.</p>
<p>1 U = 1</p>
<p>0 U = 0.1</p>
<p>-1 U = 0.01</p>
<p>-2 U = 0.001</p>
<p>We can't actually get to zero. As we keep decreasing U we get closer to it. But we can never quite reach it. That is, unless you do it an infinite amount of times. Which is why we say that negative infinity U would be = 0. Same thing with decibels. Most volume sliders on audio mixers have decibel markings. At the very bottom is negative infinity decibels. Because that's how you represent zero sound using the decibel scale.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>3dB roughly doubles, not 6. Roughly as in using that rule gives you 30db as 1024× instead of the defined 1000×.</p>
<p>Had a good laugh here a few years back when a politician agreed with festival hosts to have a max 103dB output then wrote the proposed law as 100 dB because &quot;it's only 3 less&quot;. Yeah, that's the amps turned down halfway, you IDJIT!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doubling the sound intensity level is 3 dB, doubling the sound pressure level is 6 dB, and doubling the perceived loudness is around 10 dB.</p>
<p>There's a reason why I specified the sound pressure level, and not the intensity level or perceived loudness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Few remarks:</p>
<p>a) that's not a distinction you can assume people understand in an ELI5.</p>
<p>b) If you're explaining dB's logarithmic scale, which is based on intensity, you should stick to it imho, or atleast explain the difference to pressure levels.</p>
<p>c) Perceived loudness is technically in a dB(A) scale, very rarely in db(C), but really, that's not relevant to the question at hand.</p></div>		</li>
