			<div class="markdown"><p>You're misunderstanding how they work.  The brake cans are two separate chambers, there is no physical connection between  the two when the park brakes are released. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nabel_Abd-Ali2-UAQ/publication/309204281/figure/fig1/AS:418271707844609@1476735154853/Figure-1-Brake-Chamber-offon-5.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a very good pic of a brake can with the park brake released (right side) and the service brake applied. (left side)</p>
<p>You can see the park spring doesn't effect the application of the service side.</p>
<p>Edit: You are correct in that a loss of air will set the park brake, but brake applications are by pressure, not release.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your description of air brakes is wrong. The service brakes on a big truck work by using air pressure to apply the brakes and a large spring is what returns the brakes to their normal position. The parking brake, however, must be a mechanical brake that is released when there is sufficient air pressure. In most cases, a spring holds the parking brake on and requires 20-45 psi of air to release it. This spring is located in the brake chamber as opposed to the springs in the drum that pull the shoes off the drum.</p>
