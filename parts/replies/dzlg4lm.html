Will have to look into it more, but this helped a lot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking on this answer, yes, thermal expansion is related to heat capacity through their shared relationship with the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%BCneisen_parameter" target="_blank">Gruneisen parameter</a>. This parameter essentially quantifies how much a material's bonds differ from the behavior expected for a simple harmonic oscillator (ie, a spring).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It vibrates the same amount, it just expands less. If you draw a horizontal line through the curve and then find the midpoint between the two places it crosses, that gives you the equilibrium bond distance at that energy. If the curve is asymmetrical, that point will shift to the right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By my post, I meant the object would be more synchronized in vibrations and expand less because of it, but also have a greater detectable, macroscopic vibration to it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer, and, as a materials PhD, as complete an answer as I could give without digging into a QM book.  A bond can be represented by an energy over distance curve, and a lot physics comes into play shaping that curve.</p></div>		</li>
