			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. It is also worth mentioning that once you get used to high-framerate gaming (even 60 fps, not mentioning 120 and above), you <em>will</em> most likely notice that 24 fps is... choppy. No amount of blur will be able to hide it anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I recently got a 144hz monitor, sure it's nice and super smooth but it's not ruining 60hz for me, honestly the most noticeable difference for me was seeing twice as many versions of the cursor when on the desktop and moving the mouse really fast. Just like how getting a 4k monitor didn't ruin 1080p sure it has way more pixels but because windows sucks at scaling resolutions I have to use it in 2k. You should see the difference between them in person before you try it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm that it ruined certain games for me. I play a lot of strategy single player games and you really don't notice the difference between 60Hz and 144Hz. But on games like League of Legends where ping/FPS/framerate are a part of how you play it definitely will cause issues.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just played through bloodborne on PS4 and I own a 144hz monitor and a 1080Ti for PC gaming so I am used to maxing out the FPS in pretty much everything.  Going back to lower FPS games isn't all that bad and I think bloodborne is locked to 30FPS when it isn't going lower.  Yes, you can tell a difference between 30 and 60+fps but you always could.  Having a high frame rate monitor won't ruin lower FPS gaming for you.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And working behind a camera you get the opposite.  You can't STAND the look of high frame rate.  It looks so off and fake.  However I'd never want to play a game below 60fps and I do use frame interpolation for sports on TV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a professional cameraman but when I do have to film things, I always make sure it's 60 fps. 30 fps looks choppy, especially with any kind of fast movement, and I can't imagine why anyone would want that when there's a superior alternative. Like I said, it's only a matter of habit. I doubt that if cinema was born today, they would choose an artificially lower framerate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>CGI video is targeted for a specific framerate. If you increase the framerate at playback, it <em>might</em> reduce an effect we call &quot;ghosting&quot;, but it will also have the side effect of increase the speed at which the video plays. So if you double framerate, a two hour movie is now one hour long. Does it look better? Who knows. Can't tell. Everything's moving too fast. :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't know if it was researched or it's just someone feeling, but I also heard that need for higher fps may come from different level of engagement - when watching a movie it's just a passive experience, when gaming you are giving game an input and game reacts according to it and you feel 'the lag' much more.</p></div>		</li>
