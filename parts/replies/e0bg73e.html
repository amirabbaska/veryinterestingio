<p>On top of that, since the best way to prevent this idle power loss is to physically disconnect the battery, IR remotes can just use every single button as a physical disconnection, so the battery is only even connected to anything when a button is pressed. </p>

<p>Fascinating. Now I wish I was an electronics engineer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The easiest example of this is flashlights that twist on/off. When you twist it tight you connect the battery to the leads and when you lossen it there is now a gap between the battery and at least one lead. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Establishing the connection and leaving it connected with game controllers and bluetooth headphones is a very important point. In the case of game controllers, it's crucial that whatever action the user performs is communicated with very little delay, in the case of a PS4 controller connected to a PC, this is in the region of ~1.5ms, over 500 actions per second are possible.</p>
<p>If we compare this to a standard bluetooth remote (such as that with a fire tv or virgin media v6 box), it's acceptable to have a delay of a hundred milliseconds or more, so connections are made on demand, conserving a lot of battery.</p>
<p>(Modern controllers do not have physical on/off switches. Most of my BT devices do not, but my Bose external speaker will enter &quot;shipping&quot; mode if not used for a couple of weeks do stop idle power draw, requiring a USB connection to &quot;boot&quot; it again.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>i sure hope it's significantly less than that.</p>
<p>1.5 ms is an eternity for telecommunications</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You say electronics will always drain power which is true for almost everything, but any idea why my nintendo devices (ds lite, switch) can hold a charge for so long when they are off? Like i have gone years without using my ds and go to turn it on and it still be fully charged and i've also had my switch off for several months go to turn it on and it still be at 100%.</p></div>		</li>
