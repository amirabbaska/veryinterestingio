			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going into a psychiatrist next week to talk about getting meds for my ADHD. Was diagnosed last winter and had to go back to school, so I'm taking care of it now. </p>
<p>My understanding is that meds bring people with ADHD to a baseline level, but does tolerance to the medication ever fuck up how close to baseline that you get? Are concerns of addiction/tolerance to meds legitimate if you're taking the dose suggested by your doctor? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is little concern that you may become addicted at the recommended medical doses. However, tolerance is a real issue for some people (myself included). I had to raise my dose after a year on Adderall in order to get the same effect I had achieved previously. However, there are plenty of options and lots of things you can do to mitigate tolerance or increase the effectiveness if you feel like the meds stop working.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Shouldn't there be a little bit of a concern that after only a year you are already raising doses? What is the end game here? I don't mean to be a downer, but I can't help but draw parallels to opiate pain meds and our current fentynol crisis. Even the last sentance about other options or ways to mitigate tolerence seems like something a doc prescribing oxys would say :(</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with you as someone in their late twenties who just started on meds again(Ritalin). Been on Adderall and Ritalin all my life with some gaps in time where I didn't take any, the longest gap being 5 years. The instant release Ritalin and a schedule have helped me stay on task and I couldn't agree more with what you said.</p></div>		</li>
