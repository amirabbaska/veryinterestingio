<p>When a phage infects a cell, it can do two things; lysis or lysogeny.
Lysis is when it busts out of the cell, destroying it, releasing lots of little replicated phages out with it. Lysogeny is when the phage acts more passively, integrating it's DNA into the hosts, but not replicating. Lysogeny can happen indefinitely, where the bacteria replicates with the phage DNA fused into it. So the phage DNA is passed on to the next generation of bacteria, but no actual phage are produced.   </p>
<p>Imagine the phage DNA as a line - the genes at the front are usually the first expressed. So the early genes make a protein called cI. The presence of cI causes genes further down the line to create more cI. cI also prevents the Lysis genes from being transcribed, so it keeps lysogeny happening. </p>
<p>But cI has an enemy protein, called Cro. Cro antagonises and inactivates cI. Cro genes are also early genes, but it's presence doesn't cause more Cro to be produced. So in the early stages, lots and lots of cI is made, but barely any Cro. </p>
<p>When the cell realises there's a problemo, it produces RecA proteins. These are like little SOS signals, and carefully check the bacteria's DNA to make sure everything is alright. Think like border security on lockdown. The RecA spots the cI proteins, and starts to break it down. So now, Cro AND RecA are breaking down cI, until there's barely any left. Eventually, there is more Cro than cI, which tells the lambda that maybe it's time to get outta here. </p>
<p>The accumulated Cro causes late genes to be transcribed - this forces the bacteria to make copies of the lambda phage, it's DNA and outer coat. This is the start of the lytic pathway, which eventually leads to it busting out of the cell, spreading more lovely lambda phage to share with the world. </p></div>		</li>
