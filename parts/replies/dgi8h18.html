			<div class="markdown"><p>What can I do...? </p>
<p>Sometimes I'm great and fine, but more often than not I'm anxious and sick. For example, I had an &quot;attack&quot; that lasted during the past two days where I had constant waves of dread, anxiety, and nausea. And bear in mind, I can seemingly call on demand these three monsters any day at any time just by thinking of them... </p>
<p>It is always the worst at night, particularly with my nausea where I feel a clump and fullness in both my throat and stomach - A sensation of &quot;I just want puke&quot; - and so now I also become anxious with an overwhelming sense of dread whenever I feel this way, and it's often every day... I can't escape it. Some days I can eat, some days I can't, and some days only a little... </p>
<p>And this is just one example. Simple questions can bring forth this onslaught of demons...
&quot;Am I ok?&quot;
&quot;Is everything ok?&quot;
&quot;Do I feel sick?&quot;
&quot;Is my mind ok?&quot;
&quot;Am I going crazy?&quot;
&quot;Am I hearing voices?&quot;
&quot;Will I hear voices?&quot;</p>
<p>Those last ones sound crazy, but I recently dealt with my brother as he went through two episodes of psychosis where he started hearing voices. It's a long story and I was the one to help him and witness the look in his eyes... If you can even call them his eyes at the time because whatever the fuck that was, whatever took him over... was absolutely fucked. And he claims it's gang stalking and other people doing the voices. I know that's not true, but it doesn't help... And regardless, I'm his brother so what if it is genetic and I am in for the same doom...?</p>
<p>Please save me :/ I don't want to be here anymore... :'(</p>
<p>I once lived a life where none of this existed... I never once thought what I do now... Or knew of what was really out in the world....</p>
<p>How do you rid yourself of a thought? How do you get it out of your mind once it's there? Once you have thought it? These fuckers feel like parasites... I let them in and now they've latched on and are there for eternity...</p>
<p>Why did I start to think the things I do...? Why did my brother have to get sick like this? Why the fuck couldn't he just live a normal life so that these thoughts wouldn't enter... Fuck... It's been 4+ years of this... This isn't how I imagined my life, this isn't where I want to be... What are my options and what can I do...?</p>
<p>These thoughts are here... They've already entered me and I know they haven't left... what the fuck</p>
<p>Why can't I just live life like I did as a child and like I see everyone else in the world doing... It looks like they have it so easy... Like they never think as much as I do... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One piece of advice which someone once gave me was 'If you think you're going crazy, you're not.' Crazy people don't know that they're crazy. So you can eliminate that question.
You seem to have a really rational thought process and are able to articulate what's happening to you which is good. You've got a good understanding of it. Have you seen a doctor or tried any medication? Medication and seeing a psychologist changed my life, it could work for you too?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It sounds like you have the racing thoughts typical of many with anxiety, but no one around to tell you how normal it all is. So you're obsessing and giving them extra weight. Forcing a thought out doesn't work (&quot;don't think of a white bear!&quot;) but accepting it and moving on does. Some literature on the subject uses a great simple analogy: Your thoughts and emotions are clouds, but you are the sky. They drift in, they drift out; sometimes they seem to cover the whole thing, but they're not the sky.    </p>

<p>When you feel like this, look up Intrusive Thoughts, something almost everybody experiences but doesn't talk about. Stuff like hurting babies or jumping off cliffs. Our minds are ablaze with nonsense. Don't give it undue importance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Experiencing a close relative develop a psychotic disorder is a really heavy situation that I think would even be difficult for the most psychologically fit person. It might be a good idea to look for a therapist who can help you with your anxiety and other difficulties around it. Idk your financial situation, but if money is an issue, you can look for therapists who accept sliding scale payments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally felt as if you were diagnosing my anxiety issues to a T. That is so bizarre.</p>
<p>What would you suggest for assistance? I get these weird chest sensations that I begin to fully blow into thinking something is wrong with my heart and that I could drop dead at times. My gut also definitely seems to be a source of anxiety. The feeling of my diaphragm and feeling like it's poking my heart chambers. Constant tense muscles. It is definitely because I am too aware of internal/external factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the same same thing! As soon as you think of something bad it feels like your heart skips a beat (not in a good way) and then it makes up for it with one massive beat straight after? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called premature ventricular contractions. Your heart essentially beats slightly earlier, thus elongating the time in-between the next beat. Because of this elongated time, your heart fills with more blood, and because the heart is like a rubber band, it snaps back after a beat with more force, thus giving you sensation of a powerful heart-beat.</p>
<p>Sometimes they can cause a lower spam, sometimes they can suck your breath away momentarily. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get this, and you wouldn't believe how many people I've talked to and it turns out they get the same thing. It's basically extremely common but not everyone can feel it. It seems to be aggravated by stomach issues for some reason, but it's not dangerous. I hardly worry about it anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watch your stimulant intake, including caffeine and meds like Sudafed as it's a common cause of pre-ventricular contractions (PVCs). I was having them pretty frequently (and sometimes intensely!) and figured out my multivitamin had caffeine in it, which I was taking around the same time as my morning cup of coffee and allergy meds. Switching vitamins and spacing the other stuff out helped tremendously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this. I suffered from severe anxiety and depression, got really bad panic attacks and basically just stopped wanting going outside because of fear. Meditation, coupled with Yoga has saved my life. You will start to recognize negative thoughts, other thought triggers and learn to talk yourself down from that proverbial ledge. Practice meditation everyday, treat it like a skill and it will take you far.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you actually vouch for meditation? I've been told to try but the logic to me is that it keeps you grounded with thinking about the present, but what if it doesn't actually solve issues - ie what people think about me, what might be awaiting me, etc ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely try CBT. It's not always a cure, but it can get you through a nasty patch of health anxiety. Any sort of coping skills help, (as long as they are healthy), but CBT is multi-functional. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with panic disorder and severe anxiety, this is spot on. The 'being heavily in tune with your own body thing' is so correct. I'm always so paranoid about my breathing and if my body is functioning correctly. I end up hyper focusing on stuff like my throat/tongue/lungs which makes everything seem wrong even if it's fine.  </p>
<p>I've never connected it with my gut before though. I have a tendency to get nausea, heartburn and random upset stomachs frequently and I wonder if that has any connection to the anxiety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been having a lot of doctor appointments/tests for about 6 months to try to source out similar issues and they're zeroing in on my anxiety being the cause of the stomach issues. It's not 100% yet, still a few more tests, but...yeah. Anxiety is a bitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>a few years back before i ever started having anxiety issues i had severe stomach issues and got diagnosed with just about everything from ulcers to ibs. I had tests done and thousands spent towards it and in the end it was all just my anxiety. Now here i am 5 years later and my anxiety really never shows it self in my stomach any more(though it does through other things).</p></div>		</li>

<p>My weird obsessive anxiety is mental illness.</p>
<p>It's really funny because my anxiety is clearly a mental illness, but instead I hyper focus on my thoughts and sensory interpretation and convince myself I'm going crazy all the time.</p>
<p>I end up becoming afraid of my own mind. Panic attacks so bad I'd black out.</p>
<p>Much better now (also a fan of meditation), but I don't have the money to see a shrink, so I just keep chugging along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting to see what different people hyper focus on. My problem isn't that I thought I was going crazy, it's that I thought I was literally going to die. I'd start thinking about my breathing, the anxiety would kick in giving me shortness of breath, dizziness, thick feeling in the throat etc. which would make my anxiety worse which would make the symptoms worse; boom panic attack. This would happen multiple times a day. Luckily I have meds now so I don't get the bad panic attacks. I still have anxiety but it's much easier to control. </p></div>		</li>
