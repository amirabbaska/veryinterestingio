Certain actions slow time ( exercise, drugs ) because those actions turn off your prefrontal cortex which is what is responsible for your perception of time. What people on this thread have told you is all opinion based not from any sources. Steven Kolter is leading the Research Flow Genome Project and he recently did a podcast with Joe Rogan. If you are curious, which it seems you are, I would highly recommend listening to that episode it was very engaging and interesting. Also you wake from lucid dreaming because anytime you become aware of a flow state your prefrontal cortex activates and removes you from the flow state</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Once I get my laptop back on I definitely will. It's been almost a decade since I looked into it and much has progressed since then. </p>
<p>One day I do hope science gets to the point where it isn't just competing theories or speculation. </p>
<p>I didn't realize those actions actually &quot;turned off/deactivated&quot; the prefrontal cortex. I use to chase that feeling. </p>
<p>If anything it felt like everything was extremely heightened and my brain was working flawlessly. </p>
<p>I remember there was this test about it on Science Ch. This researcher dropped people from an extreme height into a net. He told them to look at this strobing watch that said a specific number - he would crank up the blink rate on it until it was too fast for someone to see. It turns out when the people were falling they could see the number. Like their perception became heightened and so everything seemed to slow down</p>
<p>So what's going on when people successfully lucid dream for some time? So essentially it's different from REM sleep? </p>
<p>I have done it, but not as often as I like. </p></div>		</li>
