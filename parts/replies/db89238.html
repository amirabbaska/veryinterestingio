			<div class="markdown"><p>Your post is really interesting, can you expand a bit on it? What do you mean by the earth had nuclear reactors and how would a primitive civilization harness the power from a natural nuclear reactor. Fire is obvious, stick meat over it and enjoy. How would you use a natural nuclear reactor for basic energy?</p>
<p>The second one is even more interesting but mostly because I don't understand it at all. Alkali metals are rare to find on their own but in a world with less oxygen they'd have plenty of pure alkali...to do what with? Light on fire? Rub together?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The natural nuclear reactors were really interesting.  Essentially, when the earth was young there was a much higher concentration of U-235 in the earth.  In a few areas these deposits became inundated with groundwater which began to act as a neutron moderator and a self sustaining fission reaction began to take place.  The water would boil away and the reaction would stop, when the deposits cooled the water built back up and the cycle repeated for thousands of years until the concentration of fissile material became to low.  Look up Oklo in Gabon, it's quite fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the Alkali metals.</p>
<p>I don't know much about batteries, but from what I understand the presence of free Lithium and free sulphur (something Earth also has) would allow voltaic piles with close enough energy density to Li-Ion batteries that they could undergo thermal runaway that causes battery fires in electronic devices.</p>
<p>This means intelligent life would have easy access to light materials that could easily be combined to produce an amount of useful heat that could be used for warmth, light, cooking and other work.</p>
<p>It would be as useful as fire, but it's a seperate reaction entirely.</p></div>		</li>
