			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's interesting because I recently met a fantastic guy who I get along really well with. We are the same age and we have very similar personalities. We both have depression, though I struggle with anxiety more. I'm an introvert and spent the majority of the past 10 years going to school, work, playing Minecraft and avoiding human interaction. He is an army veteran. I keep thinking about how we ended up with much the same thought processes after vastly differing life experiences. But I think up until the end of high school we were much the same. Separated parents. Moved a bunch. Drug abuse. It's a match made in heaven.</p></div>		</li>
