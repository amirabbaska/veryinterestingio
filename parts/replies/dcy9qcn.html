Wrap one hand like you're holding the throttle on a motorbike and clap it against your other palm. It generates a loud and distinct clicking noise that can be heard from a good distance away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>During the cold war, a geologist using sound to study the bottom of the ocean discovered an amazing undersea sound channel, something like 3000ft down, where the water conditions were perfect for reflecting sound, like a wave guide (think laser through a glass tube).</p>
<p>Through this channel, bombs dropped off the coast of Australia could be heard near Britain.</p>
<p>Based on this, the US set up a massive array of hydrophones all along the Eastern Seaboard, as well as other places in the pacific. It was called SOSUS.  They used it to track the Russians, because the Russian submarine propellers caused cavitation (formed bubbles that popped) which are relatively incredibly loud.  For over a decade we knew exactly where most all of their submarines were all the time, until a jerk leaked the info and the Russian's designed their propellers to be quiet like ours.</p>
<p>A side-effect of this, was a safety feature for sailors on life boats. In addition to having a package of emergency rations, they often contained packets of a few tiny steel balls.</p>
<p>These balls were hollow, and were designed to be exactly strong enough so that if you dropped them into the water they would collapse under pressure right at 3000ft.  This collapse would create a very loud click inside the sound channel, and the sailors lost at sea could easily be localized by the tracking system.</p></div>		</li>

<p>do you have any more info on these balls?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so at least in the United States Navy, we measure sound in ft/s</p>
<p>Average speed of sound in water is around 4850 ft/s </p>
<p>Salinity isn't the only thing that affects the speed of sound in water.</p>
<p>Temperature, salinity <em>and</em> pressure </p>
<p>For ever 1 degree change in temp, there's a 6 ft/sec change in sound speed</p>
<p>For every 1 ppt change in salinity there's a 4 ft/sec change in sound speed </p>
<p>For ever 100ft of depth change, there's a 2 ft change in sound speed </p>
<p>This is all public information, you can find a reference in the Fleet oceanographic and acoustics reference Manuel, also known as the RP33.</p>
<p>Note: it's not exactly 6,4 and 2. However those are the numbers used for quick math and are accurate enough </p></div>		</li>
