			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with him by saying that a Coulomb explosion will happen before the metal runs out of electrons. The smaller the particle (metal cluster) the more likely a Coulomb explosion becomes because the free energy difference of lattice formation is smaller compared to a bulk metal.</p>
<p>edit: I just did a little bit of research and Coulomb explosions can also happen locally with ultra-short high energy laser pulses. But it doesn't change my initial answer that in a bulk a Coulomb explosions will not happen likely. Before that could happen the metal will get the emitted electrons back, either by arc formation to the &quot;collector&quot; (the emitted electrons have to go somewhere) or by the generated electron gas itself. In that case you would generate a stationary (in time) electron density in the vacuum above the metal surface where the rate of electron emission equals the rate of electron absorption from the gas.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Yes, Coulomb explosion is a real thing but is unlikely to happen for a bulk metal. In any case, the metal would never completely run out of electrons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looong before this can take place, you will just not be able to remove more electrons.</p>
<p>You will need increasingly higher energy photons to be able to extract electrions from the metal (if they don't have enough kinetic energy after exiting a charged piece of metal will just suck them back in ), and at some point the absorption crossection (which drops with the photon energy to the power of -7/2 at the relevant energies) will get so low that its not effective anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does this theory change as you move toward the extreme end of the spectrum with very high energy (wavelength ~ planck length) light?</p>
<p>I'd imagine it either comes down to that last electron being impossible to remove due to the changing work function, or the electron just gets knocked out of the park.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Principally yes. In fact, the electrons have to go somewhere. An electron gas has relatively large energy (think of all the potential energy due to Coulomb repulsion) so in order to continuously emit electrons you need a collector. If you connect this collector to an electrode and you have an electrolyte bridge between the sacrificial electrode and the electrode connected to the collector, you practically have photoeffect-driven electrolysis.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, since that would involve having to lose protons IIRC.  You'd just end up with positively charged atoms.  Knocking a proton out of a nucleus takes much more energy than most photons are going to be putting out.</p></div>		</li>
