From the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A deeper literature review reveals earlier research into the gripping reflex (1930s) and their conclusions that it was indeed a lack of practice early on that reduced the appearance of the reflex. They raised the question 'What result would the practice of this function have on its retention?' They found with cultivation, four-day old babies could hold their weight for a periods of time ranging from seconds to a full minute.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good question. I actually did my graduate degree on this subject. While the palmar grasp reflex, a primitive type of cutaneously evoke grasping disappears during maturation, it gives way to volitional grasping, the type you would use to consciously hold an object. There is no evidence that the strength of the two would be very different, expect that volitional grasping would be maintained for much longer periods than reflexive grasping. </p></div>		</li>
