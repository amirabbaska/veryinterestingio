			<div class="markdown"><p>Iran has been mostly Shia for as long as we have been dealing with them. They just became fundamentalist like the Saudi's and many other Sunni nations. There is a civil war between the 2 sects and we have supported the Sunni side since they overthrew the Shah who the CIA put in place.<br />
&quot;Claims of side drilling?&quot; Well, that is a very interesting way to say what is pretty much known. We wanted to take out Saddam for a variety of reasons. A lot of very well connected powerful people and their industries made billions of dollars. We got him nice and lined up on the highway into Kuwait and made great show of force and destroyed almost his entire military force. WMD's was a lie to achieve the next set of goals. To really understand, look at who had bought oil rights in Iraq prior to our invasion and who owns those rights now. China and Russia lost their control and the western oil companies gained the control.<br />
One of the key triggers to all of this is petrodollars. Oil has been traded using US dollars pretty much since WWII ended. To understand how that keeps the value of our dollar at an inflated rate in the world, do some googling about petrodollar. Iraq, Russia, China and others were involved in switching the currency from petrodollars to accepting other currencies for their sale and purchase of oil. The impact of that on our economy would be far reaching. For the most part, a lot of our foreign policy is based on protecting the petrodollar, which is really a key facet in our economy.<br />
What we are told is mostly smoke and mirrors to distract us from the truth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge, the US was NOT supplying weapons to Iran.  I think Russia was playing both sides.  During this war, the Iraqis targeted and hit the USS Stark. They were considered to be our allies at that time.  There was the Iran/Contra affair.</p>
<p>I Volunteered to transfer to the Stark as a replacement for one of five people (There were 28 killed total, 5 whose billet I could fill) that were killed but was told that by the time my request got to BuPers, all of the positions had been filled. I was an E-5/DS-2 in the Navy at that time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under the Shah, we sold Iran a lot of weapons. They had US jets, tanks, etc. In the war with Iraq, getting parts was a real problem and a lot of people, made a lot of money selling them parts on the black market. When we started propping up Saddam, we sold him a lot of weapons, along with a lot of western nations like Germany, France and the UK.</p></div>		</li>
