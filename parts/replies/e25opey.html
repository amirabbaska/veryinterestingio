			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn’t properly diagnosed until my 40s. The first time I took the medication (like others on here, I take a relatively small dose), I just wandered through my house marveling at how quiet the world had just become. It was like a radio that had been on constantly was suddenly switched off.  Very startling and relieving at the same time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly how I perceived it as well. I felt like I'd been out in a howling storm, and I finally came in and shut the door. I could still hear it, but it wasn't overwhelming anymore and I could think. If I get hungry now, it doesn't feel like a hundred alarm bells getting louder and louder like it used to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also not diagnosed until 40s. I was utterly blown away and just kept thinking is this what life is like for “normal” people? Life changing for sure. Now that said I still have not been able to get over the hump of adding exercise, socializing, etc that would bring me back to some sort of normal but at least I feel like I’m at a much closer starting point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Undiagnosed until 23, had bailed out of uni, very a-typical presentation but now we've nailed it, and yeah like you said I just wandered around marveling at everything. It's a massive cliche but fuck I really felt like I was seeing things, like REALLY seeing them, for the first time. The white noise was gone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with this a lot. Im 21 and was recently (a year and a half ago) diagnosed with ADD. I did good in school cause I always easily grasped concepts so I never needed to study. Although once I went to college I failed 3 semesters because I wasn't motivated, didn't care, and just hated the experience. But once i started going to a therapist for issues such as focus, issues constantly lying for no reason, not caring, depression and so on, my therapist suggested possible add/adhd. I went to a psychiatrist and got diagnosed and prescribed Adderall. Since then my life has gotten a lot better. Helped me focus to get a new job that is paying way better then I could have ever dreamed of without going to school.
Not to say that it changed my life but it helps get over the hurdles I've always had.</p>
<p>Tl;dr
Life was going to shit, failed 3 semesters of college, went to therapist, therapist told me to go get tested, got tested and diagnosed with add/adhd, got medicated, life is better</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have the exact same history as you. Always did well in school because I simply didn't need to study to do well and then got a huge reality check in uni. I was seeing a therapist for memory problems and she suggested I might have ADD. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist but it's not until October, mean while I do almost nothing at work and spend all day at home watching TV and eating constantly. I know I should be doing much more with my life but for some reason I can't. I can't wait to finally go to the psychiatrist and hopefully get meds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you me? Except you figured it out much quicker than I did... was diagnosed this year at 36 after two college attempts and a string of dead end jobs.</p>
<p>For me,  Adderall is like having glasses for my brain... my brain was in a fuzziness of inattentiveness, easy distraction, and impulsive behaviors and the medication swept that all away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have experienced that too (after starting Parnate), but I think it was probably hypomania. How would one even go about differentiating those two? </p>
<p>I felt calm and confident and I had a sense that everything was going to be alright. I didn't feel overwhelmed by a thousand thoughts and problems to think of. I had exactly that thought &quot;is that what life is like for normal people&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might not be the medication itself, but maybe something RELATED to the medication.  Like I feel like crap in the evening if I get hyperfocused on work and dont drink enough water during the day. I feel a different kind of crappy if I forget to eat. See if you have any deviations on the days you take the meds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're crashing you should consider trying different medication or a different dosage. I took Adderall for most of my life (Can't right now because my sleep schedule in in serious flux) and <em>never</em> experienced these crashes people talk about. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This never happens to me if I slept 8 hours the day before and ate and drank enough throughout the day. 50mg Vyvanse.
Anything under 5 hours of sleep and I'm a emotionally blunted robot that crashes after a few hours when it normally lasts 10 hours and I don't even feel a comedown. Though if it's not at least 7-8 hours I definitely feel a &quot;crash&quot; at the end of the day. And may sometimes be tired in the middle of the day for a little while too. Good thing I have insomnia.</p>
<p>If I'm hungry I lose focus in favor of my belly.
If I didn't drink enough I'm uncomfoetable.

			<div class="markdown"><p>ADHD and ADD were rolled together, so not all ADHD people are hyperactive.   Instead of hyperactively seeking external stimulation, you just...don't.  Zone out and are gone.  I hate that they did this because I now have to clarify that I have the not-hyperactive attention deficit hyperactive disorder.  Doctor told me it's because the whole classification is in flux and the alternative was reclassifying it as not-depressed depression. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a few external symptoms of hyperactivity, the tapping and the butting in, but in my brain it's super inattentive.  Can get distracted, but it's the blanking out and having to figure out what I was saying or doing that's the worst.</p>
<p>I now get 9:30 until 18:30 of good concentration on Elvanse/vyvanse, and an hour of ok concentration after that.</p>
<p>It's like giving food to someone starving Vs someone who has enough.  The starving person can live and get healthy, the person with enough might get the extra calories to do a bit more or get a bit stronger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you take your vyvanse with?  If you are taking it with something acidic like orange juice or ascorbic acid it can shorten the amount of time the drug is in your system.</p>
<p>If you were to take something to make things more alkaline in your system, such as tums(calcium carbonate based antacids), it could (probably would) increase the amount of time vyvanse stays in your system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get a little bit of both. When I get into something, then I get incredibly hyperactive and everything just feels so intense, kind of, in a way. But during class or if I'm by myself doing something then I will zone out, or wander off thinking about something else and have a hard time paying attention. Like, we'll be talking about 2D kinematics in class and my brain will wander off and start thinking about how well my performance was on Overwatch last night, what game I want to work on, homework for other classes, and a thousand other things. Then I get lost in class. It's so frustrating not being able to think clearly, because I want to pay attention and try to, but it's like my brain is actively fighting paying attention and needs to always be thinking about something other than what's happening right in front of me.</p></div>		</li>
