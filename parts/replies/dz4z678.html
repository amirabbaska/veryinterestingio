			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to note, opposite to how sprinkler systems are depicted in movies as the whole floor or building coming on at once, they don’t work like this. Each sprinkler is an individual valve which only activates at a particular temperature, so they come on individually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's even worse, since those systems have pressure sensors they will still usually call the fire department automatically and if you're really unlucky, the one you opened up won't close so you'll drain all of the old stinky stagnant water in the system all over yourself and nowhere else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, they go off at much higher temperatures; according to t he fire safety training I had in my 90s job, most sprinkler systems have the temperature trigger so high t hat anybody actually in the room would be dead well before</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that sprinklers are to save the building.  Not you.  The temperature has to be hot enough to melt the plastic plug so that's pretty high.  160f based on my lazy research.  That won't kill you by itself right away, but the fire that's creating that temperature will.  Not to mention the smoke.</p>
<p>We used to drain our system yearly, but you can't purge the full lines.  No matter what, you will always have the really gross black sludge coming first.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is there a similar reason for our eyes watering when we get hit in the nose?
For example, I got my nose pierced and the eye on that side was tearing up so bad they thought I was crying. It was only that side though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's kind of concerning, any experienced professional piercer should know that eye watering is extremely common with nose piercings. Mine even warned me before. Weird.</p></div>		</li>
