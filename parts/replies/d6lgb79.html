<p>This gave me a major &quot;a-ha!&quot; moment!  I've always been stuck thinking of electrons as a finite particle that's so tiny that we can't observe it in the classical sense and so we are stuck just bombarding it with photons and making assumptions based on the interactions.</p>
<p>The deeper implication of what you stated (unless I'm misunderstanding) is that the electron cannot even be said to &quot;exist&quot; independently of our attempts at observation.  It's &quot;true&quot; nature is entirely obscured and we are stuck looking at the shadows it makes on the wall.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I understand what you are getting at, but trying to put it into words is making me not so sure.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, I would agree that the notion of &quot;exist&quot; is inherently tied to attempts to find hidden variables to explain some of the odd things about observations of quantum phenomena, and quantum &quot;particles&quot; don't seem to have properties that pre-exist in some determinate way outside of an observation.  But in another sense, it is super-existent.  The interference patterns in the double slit experiment reveal a kind of existence that is over and above our normal concept of &quot;exist&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So I take your a-ha and inquire: if you measure it, let's say, five times in a row, will you get a pattern or not? Because if yes, you kinda are able to say what it was like before the measurement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to expand on my &quot;a-ha&quot; moment (and try to put a really elusive concept into words).</p>
<p>So, on one hand, yes we can interact with the electron in a certain way to make measurements, but in doing so, we change it's &quot;trajectory&quot; in a way that makes it impossible to say what it will look like the next time.  That much is clear.</p>
<p>What I was getting at is one layer deeper.  The way I took jeongk's explanation was that at this level of QM, it's not just about &quot;measuring the location of a wave/particle&quot;.  What he was getting at is that aside from the interaction we see, we know <em>nothing</em> about the thing itself.  It could be that <em>nothing</em> exists outside of the interaction--or that it's &quot;true nature&quot; could be entirely obscured and the only thing we can say definitively is &quot;it interacts with photons in this way&quot;.</p>
<p>The analogy I was using was of a shadow on the wall.  We have a flame (photon) we can use to illuminate the object (electron), but all we see is a flickering shadow.  We can make some assumptions based on the shadow, but in reality, the thing itself is entirely elusive and may not actually exist in any capacity that we can comprehend based on the shadow it produces (as in, the photon interaction itself is what causes the electron to &quot;exist&quot; in a certain way to produce a certain interaction).</p>
<p>I'm not physics expert--just a pleb that had a moment of apparent enlightenment.  I could have also missed the point entirely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sort of. Its nature post measurement is fundamentally different than its pre-measurement nature. Consider for instance that we have a light detector beyond a metal sheet with two slits in it, and we fire a single (one) electron at it from a silver oven: we will see two spots on our light detector, as if it has gone through both holes (because it has). If we now put a measuring device at one of the holes, in order to determine which hole it is going through, we will see only one spot per electron. </p>
<p>How can this be? Well, it turns out that our intuitions about how the world works are wrong on many levels. Observing the electron in this case fundamentally changes it, collecting information destroys other possibilities. In the beginning, the electron <em>could</em> go through either hole, so it went through both. It existed in a superposition of probable states. When we observe its passage, however, the wavefunction collapses and it exists in a single, discrete state (passing through one hole or the other) in effect because, by observing them, we have rendered the positions exclusive of one another. </p>
<p>In essence, creating information destroys possibility, and conversely destroying information creates possibility. For instance, say we purify a sample of electrons for their z-spin, say all of them are z-spin +. Then, we filter them for x-spin, which is incommutable with z-spin-- what this means is, information about one of these properties excludes information of the other, i.e. we cannot know both with certainty. For instance, the uncertainty principle reflects the fact that position and momentum are incommutable properties. If we know one to precision, we can't know the other to precision. Anyways, if we filter the electrons to be z+, and then to be x+, you would say all the remaining electrons are both z+ and x+, right? Well, if we measure the z-states of the electrons after filtering for x+, we find something different: there are both z+ and z- states in the population. </p>
<p>How can this be? Z-spin and x-spin are incommutable, so when we measure x-spin, we destroy the information we had about z-spin. When we destroy this information, z- states become possible again, even though we had already eliminated all of the z- states. You can probably guess that if we measured x spin again after measuring z spin, we would see the x- states reemerge, as well.</p>
<p>This is all a lot to say: we can kinda talk about what it was like before the measurement. But the measurement fundamentally changes it. A(n over)simplified way of looking at it: before measurement, the electron behaves like a wave, post measurement, the electron behaves like a particle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it be better, then, to think of an electron less as a distinct, spherical particle with a specific mass, position, velocity, size, etc. and more as one would think of a field (e.g. electrical, magnetic, or gravitational), or to be even more conventional, a gas? In reading this thread, the analogy of thinking of an indivisible, non-uniform gas becomes more and more apt to me: you can't really say it has a <em>specific</em> position, more an area it fills, it has a mass, has no velocity (when using it to represent an electron orbital which is fixed-ish), and is non-uniform in density.</p>
<p>Is there a situation at the scale we are talking about where the electron does act like a particle? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/electron/electron1_1.htm" target="_blank">This site</a> has a great summary of J.J Thompson's experiments and deductions that led to the calculation of the electron's mass.  </p>
<p>The fact that electrons appear to be emitted from matter, pass through a vacuum (a wave needs a medium - e.g nobody can hear you scream in space), and have a calculable mass supports the idea that it is a particle.</p>
<p>I think the analogy of a gas isn't helpful.  A gas is just a distribution of particles in space - you've just pushed the particles under consideration to a of observational ignorance, but you're stuck with the same problem you started with when you start examining concepts in principle.  In principle, it seems like you should be able to know not only exactly how many gas molecules there are in a given volume, but also every property about each gas molecule.  So, in effect, the original problem has been found again (how to get a frame-by-frame idea of what is going on), except we now have that same problem multiplied by however many particles we're now considering at the same time, along with their electrons.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Right, at the molecular or atomic scale sure, but on the subatomic, does it ever behave like one?</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Nitpick: EM waves don't, because photons are weird.</p>

<p>That's why I also suggested a field, but fields in general are not tangible, comprehendable concepts to laypeople (and they have no mass). A gas, if we imagine it not to be a collection of distinct particles but an amorphous, indivisible &quot;blob&quot;, like we would treat gas on a macro scale, seems like a good analogy for a field, and thus a good analogy to an electron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This way of looking at it denies the wave-particle duality.</p>
<p>In truth (this may be too strong a word but bear with me), electrons do behave as particles under certain conditions, and do not behave like 'fields' (we would say waves) under certain conditions, and the opposite case in other conditions. They are not one or the other, but something more complicated (or, perhaps, simpler) than that. </p>
<p>A simple example: if we have a light detector beyond a metal sheet that has two holes in it, and we fire a single electron at this sheet, we will detect light beyond both holes, as if the single electron has gone through both holes at once (because it has). In this instance, it behaves like a wave, not occupying a particular position but a range of possible positions, it exists in a super-position of going through one hole <em>and</em> the other. </p>
<p>However, if we add a device to observe which hole it is passing through, now we will only observe one spot on our light detector, as if the single electron has only passed through one hole. In this instance, it is behaving in a more particle-like manner. Creating information about the system destroyed the superposition of states, and made the two states exclusive of one another. We would say that we 'collapsed the wavefunction' and now only have one possible state, with particular behavior.</p>
<p>Similarly, looking at electrons as being 'only fields/waves' that don't have a single velocity or position doesn't work because electrons do have velocity and positions. We can, for instance, measure the momentum of an electron to precision, or the position of an electron to precision (but not both, see the uncertainty principle). We can collapse the wavefunction to get at any of these specific parts. The problem (and this is <em>the</em> problem) is that, we can't fully collapse the wavefunction in both dimensions at once. Measuring both momentum and position ensures that both measurements have uncertainty, neither is to precision. In short, they <em>do</em> have these properties, but only so many (a commuting set of properties) can be certain at once. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In my mind the gas analogy works perfectly for this. Ignore the fact that gases are comprised of smaller particles and treat &quot;gas&quot; in this analogy as you would when talking about gas at the centimeter scale: an amorphous blob of stuff with mass, density, collective velocity, temperature, etc.</p>
<p>Firing an electron at the two slits unobserved, like firing a puff of smoke, makes half go through one slit and half go through the other. But at the scale we're talking about, observing this &quot;gas&quot; is like bombarding it with beams that compress it, push it, and concentrate it into a very small, almost point-like volume, which causes it to pick a slit and go through that one. This is collapsing the wave function.</p>
<p>Obviously it's not a perfect analogy, nothing is, but at least to me it seems better than one where the electron is thought of as a jumpy, skittish particle bouncing all over its orbital without rhyme or reason, because it's not that we can't measure the electron's position, it's that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4y4mq9/if_i_were_to_take_a_frame_by_frame_video_of_a/d6l9yn0" target="_blank"><em>it doesn't have one at all</em></a>. The puff of smoke analogy works better because a small volume of gas doesn't have a specific position either, it fills a volume, like an orbital, thus you don't get questions like the OP.</p></div>		</li>
