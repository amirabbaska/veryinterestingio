			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure you're being bombarded with replies but I'm curious about this bc my nan was recently diagnosed with dementia/Alzheimer's. No brain scan yet but there's been a noticeable decrease in conflictive function. While we've known something was going on, a few weeks ago a marked change occurred. She became extremely agitated, kicked everyone out of her room, got up when she wasn't supposed to, fell, demanded to change her room (she's in a nursing home), and accused everyone of leaving her laying in bed in a filthy diaper over a long weekend. She then called a family member whom she has an order of protection against, told everyone that my mother robbed her, and then couldn't remember why she was originally fighting with my mother. She calls daily crying, saying everyone is talking about her, they moved her room, she's going to lose her Medicaid, everyone hates her, she can't live... The list goes on. I know that her speech has been suffering (forgets names and proper words) but now I hear her trying to think of each word as she says it. She's having trouble with all of them. She can't remember why she's in the situation she's in. It just seems so sudden. Can dementia get bad that quickly? Have you ever seen someone who was on a slow decline just flip their shit like that and be full blown dementia? I was thinking it was vascular dementia since that is linked with strokes and she's had a few of them already. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strokes and TIAs can certainly cause a more marked decline.  In addition to that, people frequently have a threshold where they can cope and cover up the majority of their symptoms. Once they cross that point they quickly become unable to mask any of the issues that they have been hiding. In this event family notices the new symptoms that caused them to cross that threshold as well as all of the old symptoms that they were covering up in the first place.</p>
<p>A rapid onset of psychotic symptoms, like you are describing, could also be indicative of an infectious process (like a UTI or respiratory infection).  Small infections line this can cause bizarre and unpredictable changes in behavior and cognitive function.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. Like I said we all knew she had the beginnings of dementia. Looking back I could see how she would mask it for us, the grandchildren, but she didn't for my mother. My mother always insisted she was far worse than she ever showed us, and I attributed it to manipulation (bc my nan does want everyone to cater to her every whim). Now though she's utterly unable to mask it and doesn't talk to the grandchildren like children anymore. She talks to us like she was talking to my mother. Adult to adult. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh god she's had them ridiculously often. I think at one point they were checking to see if she had bladder cancer bc she was bleeding too. I'll have to check to see what came of it bc it was an ongoing thing for months where she went for tests almost daily. </p></div>		</li>

Weeks and he went to the doctors and was told he had a urine infection and was given anti biotics. But they haven't worked yet and he has been takin in for more tests. I really hope he's okay as my gran (his wife) is bed ridden with Alzheimer's just wasting away. I would hate for him to go like that too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>sometimes medications that a person hs taken for years can cause increase in dementia. as people age some  aren't able to filter the medication as efficiently and it builds up, depending on the drugs,  this could increase symptoms like dementia. if your g'ma is on medications that have side effects of confusion, (like pain meds)  it may be worth it to ask to have the dosage decreased, or have a lab test if possible to check the blood levels. sorry you are going thru this with your nan -  I hope things make a change for the better soon! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm Bipolar. I am fucking terrified of the prospect of Bipolar Disorder + Dementia or Alzheimer's. </p>
<p>I've been through a lot in my life and it's the only thing that legitimately scares me. I've put in so much work to be well and live a better life and the prospect of that all disappearing is just so...</p>
<p>Something. It's something. I can't describe it. </p>
<p>I feel like this is the only thing that would cause me to commit suicide later in life. I would rather be dead than go through that. </p>
<p>(This is not a statement of being actively suicidal at all today, in case anyone is interpreting it that way. It's just I'm Bipolar, I already have 7 suicide attempts under my belt from before I started recovering; so it's something I've thought about a lot already.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Facing the prospect of dementia is very similar to facing the prospect of death in general. Ultimately it is a terminal illness, and it can even be said that the disorder is worse/scarier than death in the end stages.</p>
<p>Good on you for taking your mental health seriously.  Try not to stress too much about it.  You sound like you're doing what you need to for now.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I think the popularity of zombies these days has a lot to do with a generation being forced to face up to senile dementia. We're not as comfortable just locking people away these days. And it's even harder for people that the cheery &quot;alzheimer's is like a fun second childhood!&quot; idea that the boomers trumpted so much on TV is so quickly destroyed by talking to large amounts of people who've had to deal with it in their family. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to understand there are two different types of suicide attempts, active and passive. Active are attempts in which you should die. Passive are putting yourself in positions to die.</p>
<p>My first and only active was putting a loaded 9mm to my head and pulled the trigger on a dud round. Couldn't make another active attempt after that. </p>
<p>Three rounds of Russian Roulette, two attempts at OD'ing on pills, and one attempt at suicide by other were the six passives that followed. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The progression is insidious. You would be surprised how many people do not get it formally diagnosed until it is really too late to take initiative like that, how many adult children are in denial and chalk up mom's forgetfulness to a variety of explanations. How many elderly people spend 3+ days in a hospital with no mention at all about cognitive loss, when dementia actually drives the bus. I work directly with residents in a nursing home and come across this way too often.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone whose parent is afflicted with early (67) dementia, but no signs of mental illness... my parent didn't really have any personality disorders other than being OCD about cleaning and laundry. During early dementia she was constantly doing laundry but neglected the cleaning - the laundry came to be something that was a little crazy because we never knew what belonged where and the end result was some items being stuck in a perpetual laundering cycle. (Had some pink things show up that started white).</p>
<p>Moderate stage = only doing laundry.</p>
<p>Late stage = not my mom. I have to constantly remind myself of this. I hate this disease beyond any other. It is cruel and unrelenting, and with no cure it just leaves family in this hopeless and hurtful place. </p>
<p>I hope your family is strong - my sisters have hoisted me on their shoulders and are carrying me through this the last couple of years, but the journey has been hard, I cry, they cry, we cry, and I miss my mom. </p>
<p>One of the most difficult things is getting your dad to take mom to get tested, accepting the diagnosis.. It is a recurring theme, but the aftermath is always varying based on the patient. I wasn't lying when I say I hate this disease.. I've said Goodbye to Mom, I'm going to have to do it again soon..</p>
<p>Hospice is a god-send for us, and I encourage you to engage them sooner than later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom was diagnosed with early on set Alzheimer's in her late 40s and it has been very hard for my family. The disease has progressed from to moderate-severe over the course of 4 years, and it doesn't get any easier. My mom was my best friend and seeing her so confused, anxious, and angry from not being able to figure out her surroundings is so sad to me. Alzheimer's is a rough disease :(</p></div>		</li>
