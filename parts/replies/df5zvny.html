			<div class="markdown"><p>Pepper is not added to every recipe. My chef yelled at me when I asked him why he wasn't putting pepper on fish. It was my first day at my first restaurant. Other chefs might disagree which is understandable. Pepper is added for flavor. There a different types of pepper though. Pink, green, black, white peppercorns which have slightly different flavor. different types of pepper are used in different recipes. Salt is added to enhance flavor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bill Bryson, in his book <em>At Home</em>, discussed salt and pepper. Salt is obvious, our body needs it, the taste thing, and its other usefulness in preservation. </p>
<p>But in all his research (and he does tons of research) he couldn't find a single concrete reason why pepper was the other spice, as opposed to the many other choices. Or why it's <em>only</em> salt and pepper on the table, without other options. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree that a source should be provided, a quick search on google scholar shows salt suppresses bitterness and enhances flavour because of it. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's interesting, but I don't think that fully covers the claim that salt amplifies all flavors. It does seem to be true, and generally accepted, I've just never seen the science explaining why. I was asking hopefully, not cynically. </p></div>		</li>
