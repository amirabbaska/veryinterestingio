			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost the same for me. Self employed did not file for 3 years.Got a bill from IRS for $50,000. Called them immediately Asked how they came up with the amount.The guy on the phone said &quot;We just made it up to get your attention ,how much do you think you owe&quot;? I told him I had no profit those years and owed nothing. He told me to send a letter stating no profit. I sent a simple hand written note/letter telling them I had not made a profit for the 3 years and did not owe anything. Within a month I got an official letter/bill with $0 balance.</p>
<p>Have had other little quibbles and always easy to fix. Never needed any legal or second party help.</p>
<p>Talk civil with them. The person on the other end of the phone is just some one going to work everyday waiting to go home like the rest of us.</p>
<p>Should have stated this all happened back in the mid 90's. Maybe it was easier back then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I drove to my local regional IRS office 3 or 4 times, spent a few hours with them to make sure my paperwork was square.  They appreciated my efforts &amp; took care of me.  I can't complain, since the mess was my own damn fault.</p>
<p>Relative to this post...just talk to the IRS for your tax issues, unless you have an accountant.</p></div>		</li>
