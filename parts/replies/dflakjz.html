<p>This is a common confusion.  It should be &quot;whoever&quot; here.  You're thinking that it's &quot;whomever&quot; because it's the object of the <em>to</em>, right?  But it's not.  It's the subject of <em>is</em>, so it has to be &quot;whoever&quot;.  The object of the <em>to</em> isn't just the one word; it's the entire clause &quot;whoever is at the office&quot;.</p>
<p>Remember, every verb needs a subject.  You can't have an <em>is</em> just floating around without a subject.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wrong. Subject of &quot;is&quot; = Whoever</p>

<p>Whomsoever - formal synonym for whoever. &quot;Whomsoever smelled it, dealt it.&quot;</p>

<p>Wrong. Subject of smelled = whosoever</p>
<p>Just hands off of &quot;whom&quot; if you can't understand how to use it plz</p></div>		</li>

<p>I only know this from learning other languages, such as German, where you cannot get this wrong without sounding very dumb. It matters a lot in German.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yup, I've learned German to a near-native level as an adult, so it's kind of funny when this guy tells me I &quot;don't understand basic grammar&quot; and comes at me with made-up terms like &quot;secondary verb&quot; and &quot;commanding verb&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Uhh... I'm pretty sure you don't understand basic grammar. &quot;Is&quot; is a secondary verb in that sentence. &quot;Give x to whomever&quot; is the core sentence, making &quot;give&quot; the commanding verb.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. I never give incorrect grammar advice.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;secondary verb&quot; or a &quot;commanding verb.&quot; You're just making rules up.</p>
<p>Here's an actual rule: Who vs whom for relative clauses is is determined by its role <em>in the relative clause</em>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Give the package to whoever comes for it. (Whoever is the subject of the verb comes, like &quot;He comes for it.&quot;)</p>
<p>I am happy with whoever wins. (Whoever is the subject of the verb wins, like &quot;He wins.&quot;)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Whoever baits a slightly different trap:</p>
<p>*If the front door swings open for Mr. Wilson it opens too for whomever else can hang on to those charismatic coat-tails.</p>
<p>The writer has been misled by the preposition for, which is normally followed by the objective case ('It opens for them'). But here for introduces a clause, and the subject of that clause should be whoever, not whomever. There is no doubt that whomever else is wrong here. It is equivalent to anyone else who, and whoever is necessary.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rule 1. The presence of whoever or whomever indicates a dependent clause. Use whoever or whomever to agree with the verb in that dependent clause, regardless of the rest of the sentence.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>Give it to whoever/whomever asks for it first.</p>
<p>He asks for it first. Therefore, whoever is correct.</p>
<p>We will hire whoever/whomever you recommend.</p>
<p>You recommend him. Therefore, whomever is correct. </p>
<p>We will hire whoever/whomever is most qualified.</p>
<p>He is most qualified. Therefore, whoever is correct.</p>

There is no exception or other possibility, a rare and enjoyable instance of consistency in grammar.</p></div>		</li>
