			<div class="markdown"><p>I think for purposes of running scientific experiments, etc. we would <strong>not</strong> want to redefine the &quot;Martian second&quot; as something longer than the standard second. (As well as for just conveniently shipping them standard clocks and other hardware.)</p>
<p>They should keep the standard units in their reference frame. And just &quot;sync up&quot; by adding a leap second every few decades. I mean, on Earth we already add leap seconds every decade or so and most people neither know nor care.</p>
<p>The difference is so small that it's no big deal on a day-to-day basis. As far as I know, NASA completely disregards this even for our nearly decade-long rover missions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty cool. When do we add leap seconds? Other than things like leap years or changing the time at winter/summer, I never heard of it.</p></div>		</li>
