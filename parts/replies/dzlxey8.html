			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation; thank you. About your side note, does it explain dark matter or dark energy? Isn't dark energy what's used to explain the expansion of the universe? I would think that would be implicated more w changes in the CMB. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>dark matter is the phenomenon that many galaxies should have flown apart instead of rotating (if they only have the mass of matter we see). So there must be another source of gravity, and we call it dark matter. (dark cause we can't see it and matter, cause that has gravity) Just keep in mind, that is just a name, it could be that it isn't even matter but our understanding of some law could be wrong (But that is unlikely as far as I know)</p>
<p>Dark Energy is the name we give the energy that causes the expansion of the universe to <strong>accelerate</strong>. We don't know yet what causes the acceleration.</p>
<p>Both terms are a placeholder until we find an explanation. CMB is used to prove that the phenomenon of dark energy and dark matter exist. </p>
<p>So, no it doesn't explain dark matter or dark energy, we don't have a recognized explanation yet. Boltzmann Equation is just one argument something like dark matter should exist.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just when I'm getting impressed with how much we know about the universe you have to remind me that we don't know anything about most of it (dark energy and dark matter, 90 - 95%?) and its 2 most important qualities - why it hangs together and why it is accelerating.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Could this be because there's some force that holds space itself together and the more it expands the weaker this force gets? Kinda like a piece of gum that you pull out and the longer it gets the less resistance there is. Or asked differently, do we know it's some kind of energy that causes this instead of some fundamental characteristic of space-time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The side note is about dark matter, not dark energy. Dark matter is just matter that only interacts gravitationally. Since the Boltzmann equations include interactions with both gravity and electromagnetism, it can fit the exact amounts of both normal (&quot;Baryonic&quot;) matter and dark matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had never heard of the Boltzmann equations, I was just making an assumption based on the CMB being the EM &quot;residue&quot; of the big bang moving farther away from us, not necessarily anything to do w hidden gravitational effects. I'll definitely do some reading about the Boltzmann equations, thanks for pointing me in that direction</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you mind checking my thinking on something:  Quarks interact with all four forces.  Electrons interact with only three.  Neutrinos interact with just two.  Its not so strange to imagine a particle that interacts only with gravity.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would be distinguish a giant blob of dark matter from black hole?  From our point to of view they'd both exhibit gravitational effects on light. </p>
<p>Also, wouldn't dark matter get mixed in with other matter and essentially be gravitationally bound, which appear to increase the mass of whatever if was bound up in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for cosmology specifically, but the Boltzmann equation with which I'm familiar is used to describe the statistical mechanics and evolution of systems containing extremely large numbers of particles. It's applicable to a wide variety of areas in science, including, apparently, cosmology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Boltzmann came up with statistical mechanics to describe entropy. It's essentially the second law of thermodynamics using statistics. He created this, because he wanted to come up with a mathematical way to prove that atoms existed. </p>
<p>Scientists at the time laughed at him. They were using philosophy to assume that Hertz's equations meant that the electromagnetic field is continuous. After constant rejection by the scientific community that atoms do exist, even going as far as trying to get a philosophy degree to refute their assertions, he eventually gave up. His mental health deteriorated, and he committed suicide.</p>
<p>Planck ended up using his equation to come up with the Boltzman Constant about 15 years after he died, which finds a direct relation between wavelength and temperature. Since wavelength would change as the Universe expands, all of this can be found out by simply looking at the CMB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that we know the age of the universe from the time that the universe became transparent to photons, before that may have been an indeterminately long period of inflation where the universe &quot;existed&quot; but space/time expanded much faster than the speed of light.  The result of that inflation would be the &quot;flatness&quot; of the current universe and it is perfectly flat beyond our current ability to measure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The universe is curved but the curvature is too small for us to measure.  For a VERY loose analogy think of the ripple in a pond from a pebble being tossed in.  The size of the ring makes the amount that any two-inch section of the ring is curved.  Our &quot;observable universe&quot; is the two inch section we're in the middle of but we can't tell how big the ring is. </p>
<p>To take it further, the splash of the pebble is the inflationary period that created the ring.  If you threw in a big rock instead of a pebble, the ring would be bigger after the splash.  If you threw in a basketball, bigger still.  If you threw in the Rock of Gibralter, that ring would be really really big after the splash and each section of the ring would appear straight, because the curvature would be so small.  That's us.</p>
<p>Our &quot;observable universe&quot; expanded from the size of a (something small) to the size of a grapefruit really quickly until it stopped &quot;inflating&quot;, but that &quot;grapefruit&quot; is just the part we can see -- we know there's a very very very much larger amount of &quot;grapefruit&quot; that is now causally disconnected from us because it's over the &quot;horizon&quot; (more than 13 billion whatever light years away) that we can see.</p></div>		</li>
