			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an OS design decision that prevents it, I believe, not the filesystem itself.</p>
<p>For instance, I'd guess you could format an NTFS volume on your mac and rename an open file.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the program that opened the file and the lock level it placed on the file. I have opened a document in notepad++ then renamed it (i do this a lot with html files) and it will say, &quot;this file is no longer available&quot; or something along those lines.. </p></div>		</li>
