			<div class="markdown"><p>This answer oversimplifies the role of Pharmac and mischaracterises the pharmaceutical market.</p>
<p>Firstly, you need to distinguish between on- and off-patent medicines. On-patent medicines have been developed and patented recently and are often, as you say, ludicrously expensive. This is to cover the research costs of pharmaceutical corporations&mdash;often hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;and also make them a startlingly large profit. (Maybe that's bad, but that's a different issue.) However, many medicines such as Paracetomol have existed for decades and many companies manufacture them. These generic drugs will remain very cheap, costing a matter of cents each.</p>
<p>The IP protections of the TPP will mostly affect on-patent medicines, by making their patents last longer and making it harder for generic manufacturers to break into the market. This will make drugs more expensive. But your explanation oversimplifies the way the market operates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the TPPA passed as it is now, it would make this practice illegal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is incorrect. Neither the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp-ip2/" target="_blank">IP chapter</a> nor the <a href="https://wikileaks.org/tpp/healthcare/WikiLeaks-TPP-Transparency-Healthcare-Annex.pdf" target="_blank">Annex on Pharmaceuticals</a> will make it &quot;illegal&quot; for Pharmac to act as a sole purchaser for the New Zealand public health market. The final version of the TPP will likely mean it will take <em>longer</em> for generic drugs to be available, and make it harder for Pharmac to negotiate deals with companies that benefit NZ health consumers.</p>
<p>It is correct to say that Pharmac will be weakened, and the NZ consumer or taxpayer will likely have to pay somewhat more to get the same medicines. But it is totally incorrect to say Pharmac will no longer exist, and claiming this would &quot;get rid of [New Zealand's] healthcare programs&quot; is an absurd exaggeration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this helps explain things much better. I was trying to oversimplify it because of the ELI5 thing...
I did exaggerate, that was wrong. I should have said, &quot;I feel like this will undermine other countries quality of healthcare.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're leaving out another big issue here, which is that the US does the majority of pharmaceutical research. When the US releases new drugs other companies in countries with more lax intellectual property laws will copy and sell generic versions of at bargain prices. This cuts out huge potential markets for the US pharmaceutical companies forcing them to charge more for their drugs.</p>
<p>These pharmaceutical companies aren't just staffed with Mr. Monopoly top hat wearing business men laughing at the poor sick people who can't afford their medicines. They're staffed largely with people who want to help others, but in order for them to keep doing this they need to make money. This <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2014/11/26/crisis-in-pharma-rd-it-costs-2-6-billion-to-develop-a-new-medicine-2-5-times-more-than-in-2003/" target="_blank">article</a> talks about how much it costs on average to bring a new drug to market, and how on average less than 10% of drugs that even reach clinical trials make it to market. It costs over 2Billion dollars to bring a single drug to market, not including the costs dumped into failed alternatives for the same illness. If the pharmaceutical companies have to make their money from just the richest countries on the planet the cost is going to be higher than if they could sell it to everybody fairly. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>And you think they would do this? They are a business, they are there to make as much money as possible. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>You are correct that US is responsible for the most drug research, slightly under half <a href="http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v9/n11/abs/nrd3251.html" target="_blank">47%</a>. But I cannot agree with you when you say that the issue is with countries with more lax intellectual property laws, copying and selling generic versions at bargain prices. That just isn't true. <a href="http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js6160e/6.html#Js6160e.6" target="_blank">The overwhelming percentage of drugs consumed are brand name</a></p>

<p>As much as I <em>want</em> to believe that is the case. It just isn't. The article you linked to was an opinion article, and when I looked at the facts behind their statements, their claims fell short. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.actupny.org/reports/drugcosts.html" target="_blank">The truth of the matter is that they are akin to &quot;Mr. Monopoly top hat wearing business men&quot;</a> and as much as I'm sure there are scientists out there that are working at these companies and wanting to make a difference. After working in the industry myself, I can assure you that research for the next life saving drug isn't what they are going to fund. What they are interested in is the next money making drug. To reference your opinion article, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlamattina/2014/07/29/do-drug-companies-make-drugs-or-money/" target="_blank">here is another</a>  </p>
<p>Like I said, as much as I want you to be right, you just aren't. Just last year they posted another <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/274572/gross-profit-margin-of-united-states-biotech-companies/" target="_blank">record profit</a></p>
