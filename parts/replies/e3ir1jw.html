			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. Also, aside from the actual ethnic composition it gives you, 23andMe also shows you relatives you have. I, an ethnic Pakistani (was put at 98% &quot;South Asian&quot;, hopefully it gets more detailed later), discovered that I share 5.19% of my DNA with an elderly half-Finnish lady living in England that I never knew existed. Using a family tree an uncle gave me I was able to pinpoint that my great great great grandfather was her great great grandfather, and I was also able to show her photos of him as she didn't know much about her Pakistani side. Pretty neat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think I've seen something like that on YouTube, but it wasn't Pakistani. I think it was an Indian who had a Finnish great great great grandmother. He met his 3rd cousin once removed, she was like 70 something when he was about 30. It's really fascinating, family trees. Now with DNA tests, it's even more fascinating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, what's the story? How did the Pakistani and the Finnish ancestor meet?  That had to be the late 1800s.  And there was no Pakistan then.   </p>
<p>Also, as someone who is also South Asian - does this test pinpoint specific regions in the area (like &quot;You are X% mostly from Baluchistan and Y% from Tamil Nadu?) or just, yeah you're 100% Indian.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did one because my father is adopted, but it reflected the genetics I knew about pretty accurately! My grandfather on her side is Lebanese and it told me that about a third of my DNA was Arab and Italian    and southern European, which is about right for a Mediterranean country. Obviously not spot on but they're really fun and interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For me it was fun finding people who are related to who you don’t know.  I’ve met several third cousins.  And my search turned up the fact that my grandfather’s grandfather was a civil war veteran.  We never knew that.  </p></div>		</li>
