			<div class="markdown"><p>It would really depend where you get your electricity from.   But you are right is will have a lower footprint regardless of source it just depends on how much.   I usually give this example.   I am lucky to live where there is very little fossil fuel generation.   Because of that the CO2 put out per kWh produced is very small.   So where I am if you drive a gas car 22,000kms (13670 miles) a year and it gets 8L per 100kms (30MPG) your car will put out 8800 pounds of CO2.   My EV driven the same distance will put out about 300 pounds of CO2 a year.    So a pretty massive difference.   This is why it is so important to get grids cleaner as it can mean a huge reduction in CO2 and other bad stuff being put into the air.   </p></div>		</li>
