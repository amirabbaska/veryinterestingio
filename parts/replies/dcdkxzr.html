<p>when it is in an excited state it is no longer a standing wave     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I understand that an excited state is not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_state" target="_blank">stationary state</a> and that stationary states are always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave" target="_blank">standing waves</a> but does not-in-a-stationary-state necessarily also mean not a standing wave (a travelling wave)?<br />
I would expect the confines of the wave in its excited state would still require the wave to be standing (or if not require, at least allow).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good Question. A stationary state is just a state that is time independent in all &quot;variables&quot;. (So solutions to the time independent Schr√∂dinger equation, more specifically eigenstates with eigenvalues). So a non-stationary state doesn't have to be a &quot;completely&quot; non-standing wave, it can be a standing wave that &quot;decays&quot;. That is still a non-standing wave, but it doesn't really travel away from it's expectation value.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Would that be like ... a W or Z boson that has no momentum and in its ground state, but decays after some time period?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excited states would be stationary if the atom were completely isolated from all other influences. In reality, the atom couples to the electromagnetic field, which is everywhere, all the time. Thus excited states can decay by sending out a ripple in the electromagnetic field. These ripples are photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what does this standing wave for a non-excited electron look like in the electromagnetic field (is that the quantum foam?)?  Is that wave responsible for preventing the electron from falling into the nucleus?  What produces that wave? Is it from the electron trying to fall into the nucleus and then bouncing back when it's at 1 wavelength away?</p>
<p>I'm a BSEE student with an interest in studying quantum (QED) in grad school and this interests me very much, but my knowledge is pretty limited and maybe wrong. </p>
<p>Edit: As an add on, are ferromagnetic atoms ferromagnetic because the unbalance in electrons causes an area that's &quot;low density&quot; on one side of the atom, causing it to be influenced to a greater degree by contrasting high electron density atoms? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer. I'd just like to clarify one small jump you made that OP may not be aware of. In the original question OP states</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the acceleration of a mass (and the change of direction is an acceleration) results in a change of kinetic energy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not actually the case from the classical perspective. If the acceleration is perpendicular to velocity (as it is with a circular orbit, for example) then the acceleration does not change the <em>magnitude</em> of the velocity, only its direction. Since kinetic energy is a scalar that only depends on the magnitude of velocity (and mass, of course) then the energy does not change either.</p>
<p>Now, when /u/Weed_O_Whirler says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the classical way we think of an atom (positively charged nucleus, negative particle in a circular orbit around it) would emit radiation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the effect being referred to comes from our understanding of electrodynamics, which tells us that accelerating <em>charges</em> emit energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, or light. This effect has less to do with the fact that the electron is an accelerating <em>mass</em>, and more to do with the fact that it is an accelerating <em>charge</em>.</p>
<p>At the risk of over-explaining, it turns out that accelerating masses <em>do</em> actually lose energy in the form of gravitational radiation. This effect happens even if the acceleration is perpendicular to velocity, but is almost unobservable. In fact we only <em>just</em> observed it experimentally for the first time a few years ago, though Einstein predicted it around 100 years ago, and it took the collision of two black holes (each with about 30 times the mass of our sun) for us to be able to see it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks a lot, this clarification was absolutely necessary, it's all about the acceleration of charge, not mass. I should have known this, because I am somehow working in the business of accelerating electrons to almost the speed of light and then forcing them to emit radiation.
Right now I am just amazed with the discussion and have a lot stuff to read :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does that mean electrons lose energy over time via gravitational waves too? Or is it only bigger masses for which that applies?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This applies for <em>anything with mass</em>. <strong>However</strong> electron orbitals are rather misleading as the electron doesn't really &quot;orbit&quot; the nucleus. Referring back to the answer given by /u/Weed_O_Whirler, the fact that the electron does not emit radiation tells us that it cannot be accelerating in an orbit. We can deduce from that alone that the electrons would not lose orbital energy due to gravitational waves.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably wrong, but could the changes in acceleration of an electron be too small to emit a photon, and therefore unable to emit energy? </p></div>		</li>

<p>You are correct that the classical way we think of an atom (positively charged nucleus, negative particle in a circular orbit around it) <strong>would emit radiatio</strong>n, causing the electron to decay into the nucleus. The fact that this doesn't happen means this must not be the correct model.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh. I kinda wish it had been explained to me this way in Chemistry class. Instead, the textbook just launched straight into Orbitals with relatively little explanation other than basically &quot;TL;DR: Quantum stuff&quot;. I was not ready for Orbitals to make any god damn sense at that point.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of this way when learning all chemistry concepts. You're taught simplified versions of things which build on each other. There's lots of points where you haven't had enough of the basics to easily get a true understanding of more complex explanations of concepts. Then eventually you get to a point where your professor will be like &quot;remember when you learned (insert overly simplified chemistry concept) in general chemistry? Yeah that's only like half true.&quot; </p>

<p>Even if it is more complex, I find that I understand things better if I know how they work rather than just memorizing &quot;sometimes&quot; rules.  I often took too long in math exams because I had to derive the equations that I was supposed to memorize, but at least I could.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For the purposes of basic chemistry Quantum Mechanics are not needed. Your desire for deeper understanding lead you to ask questions outside of the scope of the textbook.  It's not that the electron doesn't exist in orbitals. In a macroscopic sense for all intents and purposes it does.  On a quantum level however the electron is more of a function than an object as explained in the second paragraph of the comment above.  Not sure if I said that well but meh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thing is, if you don't have some actual EM background (as in, college sophomore/junior level) the whole &quot;charged particles emit radiation when accelerated&quot; thing is simply a random assertion anyway. It isn't obvious why accelerating charged particles emit radiation, and a chemistry class probably wouldn't have wanted to waste time on that. </p>
<p>(the reason is that it's simply an requirement from the fact that EM waves travel at finite speed and that E and B waves transform into each other. EM waves travel outward at the speed of light, and a change in velocity would change the propagation pattern, but that change would propagate outward at the speed of light, resulting in a pulse. The transformation property ensures that E and B fields still obey the wave equation no matter how fast the observer moves. For an indepth explanation you'll be learning about Li√©nard‚ÄìWiechert potentials.)</p></div>		</li>
