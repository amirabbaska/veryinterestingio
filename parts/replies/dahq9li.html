			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm a sailor, and boy, things can get stuck on ships... what you said is absolutely true. We had an electro motor which needed a bearing replaced. Thing was that it was completely stuck. Ended up using a torch, hammer, loads of cussing and magic did the rest.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's multiple things. Dirt or oil can be burned out that may be stuck in the nut and thread. Another thing is that even if a metal says &quot;stainless steel&quot; the purity levels of said steels are likely to be very different, and so different expansion rates come into play that allows for gap formation as well. Finally, when you heat the metal it makes it far softer. As a result, you can remove a bolt or screw and any previous resistance it would have had at room temp can be negated as the softer metal can be either compressed or bent to allow for it to be removed. All sorts of.forces come into play :)!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I routinely have to pull rusted as hell fan blades off of rusted as shit motor shafts and the best way I've found to actually do it is using a bit of sandpaper, a shitton of kroil spray and work it. Never even thought of using a torch but I may have to give it a try next time. I almost quit my job after battling a condenser fan motor for its blade for about 45 minutes at fucking 10pm on what was supposed to be my day off. Would you suggest heating up the blade and shaft first? The only thing that worries me is damaging the integrity of the fan blade itself as we quite often reuse them </p></div>		</li>
