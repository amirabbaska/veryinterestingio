			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's the thing that I find interesting, or perhaps odd then, with respect to entropy...</p>
<p>Given that over even an arbitrarily long period of time, the speed and energy of the particles does not tend to average, but rather there will always be some high energy and some low energy particles... Then it would follow that there a (barely) nonzero chance that those high-energy particles would tend to &quot;clump&quot; together, yes?</p>
<p>Say that there are ten trillion particles of gas in your closed system, where... say, 1/1000 of those are particularly high-energy. If you divide the area those particles are in into a thousand pieces, with the gas more or less evenly distributed in the area, and with each particle having an even chance of being in each of those areas... it would follow, then, that there is around a (1/10)^3000 chance of all the high energy particles being in the same area at the same time - a spontaneous hot-spot which would violate the idea that entropy always increases... And furthermore, since the probability is finite, then given an infinite amount of time, the chance of such a configuration happening approaches 100%.</p>
<p>Wouldn't that mean that the second law is guaranteed to be violated, if only you give it enough time?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The second law is a probabilistic law; entropy is not always <em>guaranteed</em> to increase. It's just much more likely to increase than decrease.</p></div>		</li>

<p>See, that's what I thought, but when things like the eventual fate of the universe are discussed, the fact that infinite time renders even prohibitively improbable events essentially guaranteed seems to be largely ignored in favor of discussion of entropy.</p>
<p>So I was trying to get at a better understanding of how exactly the two might interact... Though of course this scenario and the universe aren't really all that closely analogous, to my understanding... It was still a thought experiment / process with that kind of in mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off topic, but the phenomenon your describing is similar to how the universe is tending towards maximum entropy, however isolated pockets of lower entropy can, and do, occur. Such as our planet and it's in habitants. We are a living demonstration that, despite a general trend, isolated deviation from such is also inevitable. </p></div>		</li>
