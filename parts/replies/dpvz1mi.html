			<div class="markdown"><p>It does have to do with helium being a noble gas, but not because its lighter (which isn't true anyway). Helium holds its electrons closer to the nucleus because it has two protons vs hydrogen has one. That means it is more difficult to condense helium than hydrogen because the electron cloud around the nucleus of helium doesn't want to change shape as well as hydrogen's electron cloud. In each row on the periodic table, noble gasses have lower melting temperatures. Moving from bottom left to top right on the periodic table generally means lower melting temperatures.</p></div>		</li>
