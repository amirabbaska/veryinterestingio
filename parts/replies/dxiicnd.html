			<div class="markdown"><p>There is limited data on the possible neurological development implications of postnatal Zika infection cases, however, some general guidelines are provided by the CDC concerning seeing a pediatrician and just being cautious. (<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/zika/testing-follow-up/zika-in-infants-children.html" target="_blank">https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/zika/testing-follow-up/zika-in-infants-children.html</a>)
In my experience tourism areas (which most likely applies to where you will be going if it is a resort for instance) are most often buffered against mosquito populations to a degree as tourists do not like getting bitten (I conduct research in a tourism destination and have talked to others traveling for various reasons). This of course will not be the case if you travel outside of these zones if you, for instance, wanted to travel around the USVI. </p>
<p>The primary transmitter of Zika, Aedes aegypti, is generally most active at night and in the early morning but this does not stop them from being active throughout the day if this helps you plan accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see why it would be difficult to gain an accurate picture via epidemiology. Anthropology is an important subject, but the question is &quot;is Zika gone&quot; not &quot;how is Zika perceived&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a fair point however perceptions of the disease, it's usually asymptomatic nature, parallels with other vector borne diseases, the possibility of disease co-infenction (e.g. syndemics I'm on mobile or I'd provide one of many sources on the subject), all compound to influence epidemiological surveillance. In example, the Belizean minimum wage is roughly $1.60 USD but the cost of private Zika testing has been found in my field site to be $100 USD. With dengue being perceived as a worse disease individuals are opting for the dengue test over zika as they are seperate costs. individuals are also self diagnosing themselves and not getting tested because they don't want to pay</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see what you mean now. However, most surveillance systems rely primarily on syndromic surveillance, so the price of testing if not really an issue. There are surveillance systems in many countries of the region, such as Brazil and Columbia, and very organized systems similar to the ones in the US and Europe in the French West Indies and Porto Rico. </p>
<p>I don't mean to say that perception is not important, it can be very useful to design control measures for instance, but when we want to track a disease we need epidemiology, not anthropology.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If by &quot;how old&quot; you are referring to &quot;When we knew of this virus&quot; I would recommend you browse the World Health Organization's &quot;Zika Timeline&quot; as it provides a pretty concise answer to this question and also how it spread. <a href="http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/history/en/" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/emergencies/zika-virus/history/en/</a> Essentially, it was first identified in a rhesus monkey in 1947 coming from the Zika forest (where it got its name) in Uganda and it was then largely ignored in research until recently due to causal implications with microcephaly/congenital Zika syndrome. It is quite likely what we call the Zika virus has been around for a long period of time so that question is harder to answer if by old you meant the origin of this virus.</p></div>		</li>
