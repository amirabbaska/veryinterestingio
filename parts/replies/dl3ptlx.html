<p>Some people find that being too close to their parents eventually drive them nuts. They want to live a certain way or not have any limitations on their behaviors. But there's often conditions on having someone else's roof over your head and those eventually become too onerous. OP asked about this from an American perspective, and so it's quite appropriate that one of the key reasons is &quot;freedom&quot;. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not American, but this is so true. If I want to live with my parents it means any sock that is not within 3 inches of it's partner gets thrown away. Anything not bought by them and smaller than a mug must be out of sight when not directly in use. My parents are a bit nuts. Having my own place is worth every penny. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mom was nuts in her own way. She had to know where I was, who I was with, she wanted contact info for each person I was with and preferred to have their parents contact info AND addresses, what all the stops were that I was making and why, when I would be home, etc. Keep in mind...I was a kid that literally didn't do ANYTHING wrong ever. No drugs, no sex, no sneaking out, no parties, I took over all my bills and expenses at 16, took care of my own car and bought my own car, straight A student, etc. </p>
<p>She also had this nasty habit that if I left the house, she'd start rummaging through my room then call me 5 minutes later to flip her absolute shit over everything. Clothes not put away, she didn't like how many times I called my (gay) best friend in a week, she didn't recognize a phone number (spam call) on my phone list, she couldn't figure out the password to MY email or social media pages or didn't like what she read on it. </p>
<p>She also had this expectation that I needed to work literally every single moment I wasn't in class and I wasn't allowed to have fun, period. Why are you going to the movies for the first time in 3 years when your workplace is currently open? I had my schedule setup one time at school to where I had two nights a week free (Tues and Thurs free after 5...yay) so she signed me up for another class so I wouldn't get home until 10....which added up to me being at work or at school from 7AM-10PM every day of the week. </p>
<p>Honestly, if I hadn't moved out when I did, then I wouldn't have a relationship with her at all right now and there's still some bits about our relationship that is pretty unstable at times but I desperately needed MY space that she can't intrude into. She's still a bit hurt I won't trust her with a key, but I don't trust she wouldn't show up at my house unannounced to go through it while I'm at work.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think that's what a lot of people don't get. For a lot of people, they don't have a nice supportive home environment. Living with their parents is terrible.</p>
<p>My sister is getting closer to 40. Still lives at home. Has to pay a good chunk of her paychecks to live there (which changes randomly- to whatever my parents suddenly decide it will be). Plus obey all their crazy rules.</p>
<p>She works nights. Parents work days. But if they have something they want done... boom, they wake her up (during her sleeping hours) to do it. Doesn't matter what it is. Doesn't matter how unimportant. My dad decide he wants to make meatloaf and he doesn't want to touch it, she's going to wake up and help him because that's how it is. Doesn't matter that she pays to live there (and is trying to sleep because she's got to go to work in a couple hours.)</p>
<p>She can't have friends over. She can't go anywhere without permission. It's all the bad of being an adult and a child mixed into one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And also, living in your own place can communicate to potential romantic interests that you're responsible, can manage your own finances, and to a certain extent know how to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>No self-respecting woman or man will want to date someone that they have to babysit. Owning a place can be a huge indicator of personal responsibility and autonomy.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> So before I get burned alive at the stake, let me just point out that I said &quot;owning a place <strong>can be</strong> a huge indicator of personal responsibility&quot;; this doesn't necessarily mean that it <strong>is</strong> a sign, or that people who live with their parents are irresponsible.</p>
<p>There are plenty of responsible people who live with their parents. Many are at home due to extenuating circumstances (ridiculous housing costs in cities like LAX/SFO/NYC, or saving money while going to college or in between jobs), and many have reasons that actually reflect positively on their character (family is poor so they're helping with rent/mortgage, or perhaps <em>they're</em> taking care of <em>their</em> parents who might be retired or disabled).</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are plenty of people who live on their own who have no earthly idea how to take care of themselves, others, or their property. They miss out on rent, the place is decrepit because they never clean it up, they can't hold a job for more than 10 minutes, or they rely entirely on the hard work of a significant other. These people are a dime-a-dozen.</p>
<p>Not having your own place does not mean you lack responsibility, and having your own place does not guarantee it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While certainly a consideration to take, it doesn't always hold true and more importantly should not be the make/break quality. It very quickly borders on a completely unrealistic requirement that some use as a measure of being a &quot;suitable&quot; partner. In the age of ever-increasing student loan debt, staying with the parents can be a very financially responsible way to get out from under much (if not all) of that debt and set yourself up to be able to purchase a home/condo/apartment when it's best financially. </p>
<p>I have been turned down by a few possible dates purely because I have been living with my parents. They think that because I live there I am &quot;irresponsible and immature&quot;. Yeah I am sacrificing personal space and sure my parents will take care of some things since I am there. However what they don't see is the massive financial spreadsheet I run that makes sure my money is going towards my debt so that in a couple years I can buy a house without having to worry about student loans. </p>
<p>You can say &quot;oh its a sign of irresponsibility and lack of autonomy&quot; all you want, but anyone who casts off a partner because of their living situation alone without taking into consideration the full scope of what that partner is actually doing with their money is being more irresponsible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how well they know you when they first learn of your living situation.  If they're already interested and have experienced you as a responsible and mature person, it's far more likely they'll give it a chance.  If it's online dating and they see it in your profile before even talking to you, red flags go up and they'll just move on to someone else who's not saddled with that potential baggage.</p>
<p>And regardless of if you yourself are partner material, the side effects of living with your parents (little control over your living space, not much privacy or freedom, latent power dynamic from childhood) can be irritating enough to be a dealbreaker for a lot of people.  It's just not the type of relationship they want, and if they're not already invested in you, there's literally no reason for them to pursue it.</p>
<p>I lived with my parents until I was 30, and I tried super hard to date for the last 4 years of that - got shot down a ton over that and the assumption I didn't have much life experience and wasn't that mature (which was admittedly somewhat true).  But the &quot;living at home&quot; stereotype and attendant problems were totally real, and became a huge motivator to dig myself out of the hole I was in.  Most of it was solved when I lucked into a well-paying full time job: felt financially secure enough to move out and rent a place with my sister and a friend for a year; matured quite a bit; and met someone online and later bought a house with her.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Erm, no?  There's no responsibility to date anyone, so it's not irresponsible to not consider some people on a rule of thumb.  It makes their net a little smaller, but as long as their net is big enough to find <em>someone</em> that works for them, they're not missing anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed! I dated a guy who lived at home to save money and I'll never do it again. His mom cooked his meals and helped with his laundry. We had to spend all the nights at my place, because well... his mom was home. And after a while it felt like I was making the sacrifice. And seeing his mom taking care of him was such a turnoff. Once we went away together and he had to leave early because his mom was having someone fix the house and someone needed to be there when the carpenter arrived. Ughhh. Please, I'd rather date a guy who takes on extra hours at work or gets a side hustle to save more than a guy who lives at home with his mama. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing you mention sounds like a terribly big deal. If his mom is cooking a meal for herself and he's there, why not cook for him too? If she's running a load of laundry and can put his clothes in too, why not help get his clothes washed? If she can't be home to meet a carpenter who is working on their house but he can, why not be helpful to his own mother and be there for her? </p>
<p>You say <em>&quot;I'd rather date a guy who takes on extra hours at work or gets a side hustle&quot;</em> but I don't think you really understand what that means. More time at another job means less time he can spend with you, and ultimately you want more time with him, right? So if he's off at another job and not with you, you're not going to feel as apt to stay with him because now he's not around. You can't have it both ways. </p>
<p>I feel like you leaving him for those reasons is a sign of your own irresponsibility, but I mean that in a positive way. You have every right to do what you feel is best for you and clearly you felt there was too much of a sacrifice on your end. However I would advise you really look at that relationship and realize those issues aren't as big as you may want them to be. It should be the quality of character that defines your desire to be with them, not their current living situation. Just some food for thought. </p></div>		</li>

<p>There's a certain negative and slightly embarrassing status associated with living at home versus a more adult-seeming being-in-charge of your own surroundings when you're living in a bachelor pad or equivalent. It's doubly so when your peer group of friends or workmates all have their own places and you don't have the freedom to invite them over. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this part is bound up with money though. At least in my part of the country, the economy/job market is pretty decent and housing is pretty cheap, so if you're a young person from a middle class background and have successfully followed our society's template for being &quot;successful&quot; in terms of graduating from college, getting a job that's relevant to your degree, etc. you'll generally be able to afford the luxury of living in your own place, even if your student loan payments relegate you to a not-so-nice apartment. Conversely, if you are living at home for financial reasons, that signifies that things are probably not going according to plan for you. That probably isn't true in many places where adults living at home is the cultural norm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do know people who did that and it wasn't looked down on, but it was for maybe 6 months right after graduating college so that they could build up some savings, not for several years or anything like that. </p>
<p>Having said that, I think it comes back to money. You generally don't <em>need</em> to move back into your parents' house to cover student loans, so if you don't need to, why would you? Personally, I live in the same area as my parents, see them often, and have a good relationship with them, but when I moved back home for a summer during grad school when I had an internship in their city, I really didn't like living with them and having to deal with hearing, &quot;Have fun with your friends, but when do you think you'll be home? 11:30?,&quot; &quot;Turn down the TV, I'm trying to sleep,&quot; &quot;Bring that empty glass into the kitchen,&quot; &quot;No pressure, but we're going to visit grandma and grandpa this weekend...&quot; etc. all the time. Once you get a taste for living independently, it's no fun to &quot;regress,&quot; and most Americans would say that retaining that independence would be worth a decent level of sacrifice in other areas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just a social thing.</p>
<p>I'm a grown man, when I want to see my friends, I want to hang out with <em>them</em>.  Not hang out in a too-small bedroom in their parents house like we're ten years old, because his dad is sitting in the living room using &quot;the big tv,&quot; not to mention needing to watch what you say because they <em>might</em> not want their parents to overhear every little detail of their social lives.</p>
<p>Yeah, their parents are nice enough people and I'm happy to shoot the shit with them at a back yard BBQ or whatever, but we're old enough where the social expectation of hanging out is sitting in the living room drinking beers and talking about whatever the fuck we what.  Feeling like you're all still little kids is not a positive social experience for most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For one thing, you don't always get the chance to explain your decision. If you don't have time, or are not even present, people might just hear &quot;oh, so-and-so moved back in with their parents.&quot; They aren't hearing about the prudent financial reasoning, just that you aren't &quot;able&quot; to make it on your own, and have judged you for it.</p>
<p>Part of the reason is older generations' expectations based on their own experience. Recently, tuition has skyrocketed, wages have stagnated, we're just now coming out of a recession, and professional entry level positions are more competitive. The older generations had very different landscapes coming out of school (my dad's equivalent of an internship paid his tuition, living expenses, and left enough for savings. He had no frame of reference for dealing with student loans.) and base their expectations on what they went through. Their experiences and expectations have also been the ones portrayed in the media and directly communicated to the younger generation, influencing their expectations as well. </p></div>		</li>
