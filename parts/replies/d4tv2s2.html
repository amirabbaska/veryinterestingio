			<div class="markdown"><p>I am laughing right now. YES! Your dog knows how much you love them! I sort of spoke about this in one of the earlier answers, but dogs have hijacked the human oxytocin bonding pathway that is normally reserved for our actual babies. When you stare at your dog, both your oxytocin levels go up, same as if you pet them and play with them. It makes you both feel good and reinforces your bonding.  Does your dog ever stare at you for no reason? They are just hugging you with your eyes. If you want to read more about it, I wrote this article here: <a href="http://www.livescience.com/40065-dog-kisses-are-more-than-just-slobber.html" target="_blank">http://www.livescience.com/40065-dog-kisses-are-more-than-just-slobber.html</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm so happy that I saw this. I recently put my best friend down. I was so worried that she didn't know how much I loved her. As she was falling asleep for the last time, I just looked right into her eyes and she looked into mine. Im so glad that I was the last thing she ever saw. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This made me cry, but its beautiful.  My two dogs (brothers) are getting pretty old, they're almost 15, and I have been loving on them extra hard lately.  I too was worried they didn't know how much I love them and it makes me feel so much better to know that they can understand.  I hope your sweet baby rests easy.</p></div>		</li>
