			<div class="markdown"><p>He's talking about CO2 coming <em>out</em> of solution though, which, if there's basic ions in there other than the bicarbonate and carbonate ions, can potentially <em>return</em> the pH to higher than 7.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What this answer is missing is the role of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_anhydrase" target="_blank">carbonic anhydrase</a>, which is the enzyme that's <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19833970" target="_blank">responsible for the taste of CO2.</a></p>
<p>When carbon dioxide is dissolved in water, some of it reacts with the water to form <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_acid" target="_blank">carbonic acid</a>, which dissociates into bicarbonate and carbonate as described above. Most of the CO2, however, is just dissolved as CO2.</p>
<p>Then, when you take a sip of the drink, the water and CO2 come in contact with with the carbonic anhydrase enzyme in your mouth. This enzyme makes the water and CO2 react very quickly to form lots of carbonic acid (relatively speaking).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113831763" target="_blank">It's this reaction that causes carbonated water to taste sour.</a> Carbonic acid itself actually tastes rather bitter, despite being acidic, because bicarbonate is bitter enough to overwhelm the effect of the pH. But the chemical reaction converting CO2 and water to carbonic acid activates your sour taste sensors, so carbonated water is an interesting mix of sour and bitter.</p>
<p>If you ever have to take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_anhydrase_inhibitor" target="_blank">carbonic anhydrase inhibitor</a>, it will make <em>all</em> carbonated drinks taste horribly bitter, because it suppresses the enzyme that helps them taste sour.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbonation works by shoving a bunch of CO2 into water (more than will fit) and holding it in with the bottle seal.  When you open it, the CO2 starts to come out, but there's still some left, and it tastes weird.</p></div>		</li>
