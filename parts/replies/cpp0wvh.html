			<div class="markdown"><p>Triclosan is banned for consumer use/sale in Minnesota. I believe it is still used in healthcare facilities.</p>
<p>A few details and a <a href="http://www.minnpost.com/community-voices/2014/06/minnesota-ban-triclosan-may-have-broader-impact" target="_blank">link</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Triclosan may be absorbed and stick around in the human body. When they started seeing it show up in breast milk, people were concerned. Also apparently may sneak through water treatment plants.</li>
<li>Law doesn't go into effect until 2017, but most soaps sold here are already, in my experience, triclosan-free.</li>
<li>Minnesota was the first state to ban it. &quot;Pioneering research&quot; at the U of M, ladies and gentlemen.</li>
<li>The FDA has approved some products containing triclosan which will survive the MN ban. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When visiting my newborn son in the NICU, I had to follow a strict scrub in process.  What weirded me out was that I only had to do it once a day, no matter how many times I went in and out of the NICU.  I only needed to do a simple hand soap wash if I left and came back.</p>
<p>Now I understand why. TIL!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chlorhexidine is great for skin and surgery prep, but triclosan can be used for cleaning both skin and surfaces. Triclosan is still an important component of hospital cleanliness in addition to patient cleanliness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>maybe it is because triclosan is one of the most pollutants in european rivers and since 2014 suspicious to help growing tumors.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer to this question, which was about antibacterial (ie triclosan containing) soap - not regular soap, not alcohol-based hand sanitizers, which most of the other answers address. Why did I have to scroll down this far to see it?</p>
<p>Edit: in addition to being a suspect for causing resistant bacteria, triclosan has been shown to be not much more effective than regular soap, can have deleterious effects on delicate ecosystems, as well as possible effects on human endocrine system (including affecting your fertility), and is difficult to remove from our water system. It's not just in soap but commonly found in antibacterial clothing (ex: antimicrobial sports wear), shower curtains, bedding, and toothpaste and other dental hygiene products. It's ubiquitous, and it's not that great, and we should seriously reconsider its use. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to that. There is a direct correlation between rates of allergies in children and levels of triclosan in their <del>bloodstream</del> urine. While I recognize that antiseptics are one of the greatest modern inventions, bacteria paranoia has got way out of hand. Soap and water is probably good enough in 90% of scenarios.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On my local NPR station they interviewed a microbiology professor about this. He strongly recommended against using soap with triclosan.</p>
<p>A primary school teacher called in saying &quot;I need to seriously clean surfaces in my classroom, you just don't know what I have to deal with.&quot;</p>
<p>The professor said &quot;Well you have two choices: a surface coated with normal bacteria, or a surface coated with antibiotic-resistant bacteria.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
