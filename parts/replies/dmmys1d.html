			<div class="markdown"><p>So a better way to phrase the question is, &quot;Does meditation have any different effect on the brain than any other kind of activity?&quot;</p>
<p>Is there significant difference between meditation and just any information processing, like music or watching trees blow in the wind.  I don't know that you can really attribute &quot;changing the brain&quot; if it is the natural way the brain works for most things.</p></div>		</li>
