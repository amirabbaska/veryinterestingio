			<div class="markdown"><p>Higan does not replicate the SNES in the way that DICE does integrated circuit games. According to its author:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The compromise I have made was to craft a rough design that would be similar to the real hardware and to cleanly isolate each processor, sharing only the state that the real chips would share. While the goal is always to match the results of all operations on real hardware perfectly, my approach at least creates an emulated system that is virtually indistinguishable from real hardware. But unlike DICE, it is not a perfect digital form of the exact original hardware design.</p>

<p>Now, it's the next best thing to complete accuracy and perfectly suitable for enjoying video games. But the distinction is worth making.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah sure, but that’s unimportant. The end result is indistinguishable from the real deal, so why go further other than for the pure nerdery of it? </p></div>		</li>
