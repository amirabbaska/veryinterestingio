			<div class="markdown"><p>They have all kinds of different ways to test that stuff.</p>
<p>Remember - the treaty is against testing active nukes.  Take the core out and replace it with something benign and you can test the hardware all you want.</p>
<p>Testing the core on the other hand... that is something different.</p>
<p>As I understand it... the US gave up underground testing some decades ago.  We have some sort of supercomputer-server-farm set up to virtualize this crap.   This specifically has something to do with why we don't export some computer hardware....</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now we all know that taking the core out and testing the hardware can still freak the world out. It's literally happening now lol. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metallic plutonium has several different crystal forms with different physical properties. Over time the internal radioactive decay causes local defects in the crystal structure which can interfere with the &quot;pit's&quot; design. Think something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_pest" target="_blank">tin rot.</a> The actual details of how big a problem this is, and what they do about it, is very very very classified. But I know it's a concern, and one nuclear weapon designers are still doing whatever-something about.</p></div>		</li>
