			<div class="markdown"><p>What this guy said, with the following driving size...</p>
<p>OP’s question only addresses one of the factors driving transformer design, voltage (and the turn ratio to achieve it).  The main driver of size is Power, and the secondary factors are Voltage/Current (any 2 plus the turn ratio determine the 3rd).</p>
<p>More power = bigger core (huge chunk of heavy iron)</p>
<p>More voltage = more insulation</p>
<p>More current = thicker conductors to reduce resistance losses</p>
<p>Additionally, the bigger/more powerful the transformer, the more cooling it factors into the design, which makes things even bigger and unwieldy.</p>
<p>That’s the high points at least.</p></div>		</li>
