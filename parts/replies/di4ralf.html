			<div class="markdown"><p>The lack of national government control in Afghanistan's peripheral provinces comes down to lack of development. An illiterate tribal villager in a remote district of Helmand province has about as much exposure to the Afghan national government as a gas station clerk in ShitTown, Alabama has to the machinations of the US federal government. It doesn't mean the national government doesn't exist, it's really just a matter of practicality and varying levels of governance (local, provincial, national... etc) being in effect in different parts of the country. The cities are run like cities, the countryside is run like, well, the countryside. That being said, the current government is notoriously corrupt, and this goes all the way down to the local level. 40 years of war will suck the lifeblood out of a country. The Afghan intelligentsia, the educated class, has long been gone, but is slowly re-emerging with the latest generation. Although it is difficult to say how long this will last; many of the refugees washing up on dingy rafts in Greece over the last few years have been from Afghanistan. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't really address the political situation in the cities and areas that were under the control of the central government. The post is already pretty long, and OP asked about why Afghanistan is a hotbed of Islamic extremism, not for a complete history of the entire nation.</p>
<p>I don't know the entire detailed history of everything in the nation. From what I've read and the people I've talked to, it seems to be true that at least some of the cities were pretty modern, and the nation was arguably on the road to modernization. But that's a long road indeed, and there's no question that any modernization has yet to touch most of the tribal areas.</p></div>		</li>
