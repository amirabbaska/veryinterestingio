			<div class="markdown"><p>thats interesting.
Now let's say an ant can carry 50 times his own weight. If we make this ant huge (let's say to the human weight) he will be barely able to hold its own weight, right? Due to this law.
But what if we take so many ants that their total weight is comparable with human, will they still be able to lift 50 times more?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! But the reason you don't really see a huge host of ants just carrying off a tree or something is because you run into the square cube law again in a different way that limits them. In order for ants to lift something, they have to have as much surface area within reach of the ground as is needed to fit enough ants to lift it. So here, the ants are limited not by Mass, but by surface area. Because the surface area of something increases slower than the mass, the ants quickly run out of room to grab the thing to lift it. They could lift something comparable to the weight you mentioned if it had the right dimensions, however, such as a long thin rod laying with its length along the ground, or an even thinner flat sheet. Since most heavy things don't have dimensions that prioritize low density and high surface area, you don't typically see ants carrying heavy things through weight of numbers.</p>
<p>And you can't have the ants climb on each other to get more surface area because the ants below must then also carry the weight of the ants above (so you can't get a stack larger than fifty ants high, and the diminishing returns from this ant stack don't give enough surface area to make a huge difference)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they are all directly carrying, yes, but that would look like a <strong>giant</strong> flat sheet. If they, for example, took the shape of a human or even a human sized blob, then you can imagine each bottom ant is carrying all of the ones above him plus the object they carry. So, now you have a situation similar to before...the ants ability to remain in &quot;shape&quot; by holding onto each other or lifting each other is decreasing at a much faster rate than the size of the blob increases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My high school physics/math teacher actually gave us this is a problem to think about for the weekend. He just said &quot;what's the greatest size any human could ever be?&quot;. I didn't crack it on my own, but the square cube law has stuck with me since he explained it afterwards. </p>
<p>Another fun little question he asked us was &quot;what it is the only used power source that isn't sourced from a star?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's the answer? I mean, I'm not sure how far the thinking goes here. Like geothermal or wind energy are sourced from a star, technically. Because the Earth wouldn't be turning or have a molten core without stars. </p>
<p>Same for fossil fuels. Everything can ultimately be taken back to stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except for stars. Technically stars <em>could</em> source to other stars in some cases but since they form out of gases they wouldn't necessarily have to source back to a star. This seems like the simplest, most accurate answer to me. Tidal is a close second because, like you said, Earth &amp; Moon wouldn't be here doing what they are without help from a star. I believe this is where his teacher is trying to go with it though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The correct answer was tidal forces, the potential energy between the moon and the earth ultimately comes from the displacement of matter in the big bang. </p>
<p>Maybe not a 100 % solid answer as stars have formed the elements of the moon and put the orbits where they are now, but still a pretty interesting topic to think about.</p></div>		</li>
