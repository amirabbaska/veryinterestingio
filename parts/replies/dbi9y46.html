			<div class="markdown"><p>This is why both my father and mother had DNR orders registered with the hospital. My father, in particular, had been a semi-invalid for much of his life, and knew too well what invasive procedures would be like.  He wanted none of it.  </p>
<p>When I went in for emergency surgery, I also asked for, and received, a DNR order entered into my paperwork.  My husband was violently opposed, and we finally ended up putting my daughter on the paperwork as the next of kin because Hubby and I couldn't agree.  Part of this was because I didn't want to be a financial and emotional burden to my family,  and part was because I didn't want to undergo the advanced life-preserving procedures if they wouldn't really extend my life, but only my existence.</p>
<p>(Before being asked:  putting my daughter on the DNR orders was a compromise my husband accepted.  We figured she could be the voice of reason, and make a more dispassionate decision than my husband, by his own admission, could)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, spent two weeks in ICU drifting in and out of consciousness. AND I was restrained because apparently end stage renal failure causes me to assault anyone I suspect of &quot;holding me against my will&quot;. Didn't think it mentally affected me that much until my girlfriend and I attempted light bondage and I had a panic attack.</p></div>		</li>
