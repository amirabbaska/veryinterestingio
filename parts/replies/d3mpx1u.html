			<div class="markdown"><p>Well you are exactly correct. Now following this train of thought, what is causing this internal landscape to change? What sorts of new internal stimuli are being introduced to cause such a HUGE response. I mean when you think about it, there are many moving parts that are needed to cause a limb to move. There is a lot of energy (electrochemical to mechanical energy) being spent here and as we know, energy can not be created. So much energy in fact, Strongmen can pull planes and deadlift thousands of pounds. So where does this new energy come from? Obviously this extreme example is the result of a cascade of smaller events that increase exponentially as they make their way down the cascade pathway. But it all must originate at one singular location somewhere within the prefrontal cortex. So the question remains, where does this prefrontal potential come from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very interesting. Although the energy used in the strongmen lifting weight does not come from the prefrontal cortex, of course, it comes from the body's energy reserves that you previously ate. It seems like the prefrontal cortex can, with minimal energy, enable a huge expenditure of energy elsewhere... same way that with minimal energy you can flick a switch to start a train. You somehow enable available stored energy to do some visible action.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: I want to clarify that this is just me talking out of my ass and speculating what could be with the implied question: Could it?</p>
<p>You talked about willing the potential into reality, and creating the energy to start the cascade. But why cant the energy already exist, just in a different state?</p>
<p>Like a switch, or a scale. Of course we need energy outside the system to move a weight from one arm of the scale to the other or flip a switch. But in the case of the human brain, the AP of internal stimuli could flip that switch for us, meaning no new energy is created.</p>
<p>Where does the stimulus come from? From our sensors interacting with environment and our system. In the case of reactions from outside our system, the AP is provided by that same outside system.</p>
<p>In this case, our entire neural network is just a huge system of pulleys. Strings attached to each other in a super complex manner that interact with each other but can in a sense only be in a finite amount of states.</p>
<p>Pulling on one string may mean releasing tension of a number of different strings, pulling on one of those strings has a similar effect on again different strings.</p>
<p>External stimuli add energy to the system, but I guess there would be enough ways to get rid of that excess energy in human bodies, especially since its so miniscule.</p>
<p>Philosphically this would mean that we dont really have a will at all I guess. It would mean that the way the strings were pulled in the past influences how we react to things in the present, but ultimately it would mean everything we do is predetermined by the state we are in. If and when we do it just depends on the stimuli we receive.</p>
<p>Waiting 21 minutes to drink the water from the bottle you have been staring at would just be a consequence of the experiences and stimuli you have received throughout your life and you would do exactly the same everytime you would face this exact same situation at that exact point in time.</p>
<p>That would mean if we could replicate the state of your nervous system and the stimulus you received we could predict with certainty what reaction it would produce. Plus given the now altered state, with every new stimulus we could keep that prediction going, given we dont miss input that would change your state.</p>
<p>What im essentially saying is this: humans are deterministic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you stared at a bottle (probably lost in thought) for 20 mins... on the 21st your subconscious realized you're thirsty?</p>
<p>Could a lack of energy somewhere else (lack of water here) be like a negative to the positive of creating thought?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the idea of free will, at least as most people seem to define it, is nonsense. Your responses are to stimuli (as you suggested) and are guided by your genes and early childhood experiences neither of which you authored.</p>
<p>Perhaps consciousness isn't all that mysterious. Perhaps it's nothing more than the ability to provide a reasonable if not always optimal response to stimuli. Hand a newspaper to someone and ask them what they see and you'll likely get the expected response. Hand it to an ape and they will play with it. Give it to a bird and they might rip it up to line their nest. Another important aspect to consciousness is that is seems to appear when in things that are always receiving input. From the moment the bird is awake in the morning it's receiving stimuli and responding to it. However, there must be more to it than just this since a spider can also respond to stimuli and I'm guessing we don't consider them to be conscious creatures.</p>
<p>Are spiders aware of their surroundings or just responding to direct stimuli? I presume the latter. Birds on the other hand do seem to be aware of their surrounding which would qualify them as conscious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I guess one thing you might want to think about is why we are capable doing things that are bad/stupid/opposite to our instinct? I mean I have some pretty dumb things I did when I was younger, boys being boys and all, but right now I mean I could say burn myself with a lighter just to prove to you that I could. You know what I mean? Sometimes human behavior is very unreasonable. No?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I like to see consciousness as a sort of antipart to our primal brain. It's not beneficial for you to purely act on your urges, you need to have some sort of awareness of your actions so you know when to wait for a better time. Let's take the water bottle example, you may not want to go and get another bottle right at this time and therefore conserve your energy to use it later.
The fun part is then that different people have different amount of awareness of their actions. Could it be argued that the people with low awareness are less conscious and simply riding the urges throughout life without being able to be aware of them? </p></div>		</li>

<p>No, conservation of energy laws tell us that <em>in an isolated system</em>, energy cannot be created or destroyed. The human body is not in any conceivable way an isolated system, energy is constantly flowing into and out of our bodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only this is true, but it is why a computer, a human brain and even simple things like a water filter works. Energy flow shaped by a structure in order to generate work such as computing, thinking or making clean water.</p>
<p>I think in our computer age the concept of consciousness should no longer be more weird than the concept of software. Software too can be abstracted away so much from the underlying hardware one would think it's something special above the laws of nature. The reason we automatically think that is because we can't handle the complexity. And brains are even more complex than any existing software. </p>
<p>We may be also biased to think about consciousness the wrong way. Our minds are capable, but limited in many ways, most of which has to do with evolution shaping us to perceive reality not as it is, rather in way that facilitates survival and procreation in a social environment.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a pretty extraordinary claim. Do you have some source that even <em>suggests</em> that an act of will creates energy? I feel like that's something I'd've heard about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leaving thermodynamic criticisms aside, I don't understand why energy has to be created for this imaginary process to work. The energy for any action potential has to come from outside the body at some point. We eat food, last I checked. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This links to various studies on both sides of the current debate on consciousness. </p>
<p>One side says our awareness, our will, is an afterthought. One way to think about it is that our will is an effect of action and not a cause. Essentially the brain being aware of its choices happen after the choice has already begun to materialize.</p>
<p>The other side says that intent is a cause and the action is an effect. Meaning the &quot;decision&quot; activity begins before the &quot;action execution&quot; activity begins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a link to one study that examines the timing of intention and action. The phenemon you describe--that conscious intent arises after the fact--is really well-known (I first heard of it in a Scott Adams book in the 90s). This study simply examines this in 100 subjects who have taken a test to determine their impulsivity and correlates the timing to that measurement.</p>
<p>It in no way implicates, or discusses, thermodymics or the origin of energy in these signals. I'm really not sure why you think this supports your earlier statement.</p></div>		</li>
