<p>If you're forcing yourself to stay away, the survival &quot;assumption&quot; is that you're doing something important to your survival.</p>

<p>I've noticed the same when running. The first km or so the body is all like &quot;dude, if you're not hunting or being hunted, chillaxing on the couch would be <em>way</em> cooler now&quot;. </p>
<p>And after that it's all like &quot;okay, I suppose you know what you're doing&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>My brain just goes : &quot;Stahp. Please. I'd rather die than go on. I swear I'm serious. I'll kill us both if I have to do one more step. Alright, time to feel dizzy and make that stubborn head spin! And now, let's puke!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The wall&quot; isn't a psychological thing. It's a biochemical thing when you are running low on glycogen in the liver so your blood sugar drops and your brain is low on energy availability. It lasts until the body starts producing ketones via ketogenesis in the liver in order to feed the brain without glucose.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's also the reason you get sleepy if you're bored. Your body detects that you're in a period of &quot;down time&quot; where nothing important is being done, so it signals the urge to sleep so you conserve energy.   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Damn. That explains it. I could have had 12 hours sleep and be fresh as a daisy, but 15 minutes into a boring meeting, or Sundays where I'm dragged to the in-laws and have to sit and listen to women gossip, I am fighting to keep my eyes open.   </p>
<p>Doesn't help that I have the attention span of coked-up ferret. If I'm not busy and involved or invested in a moment, I'm quickly bored. </p></div>		</li>
