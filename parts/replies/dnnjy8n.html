			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes some animals shed tears. It is not necessarily crying though.  If you are asking if they get sad that is also a yes, though a lot of science people might say sadness is a human trait that doesn't relate to animals.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. I was wondering if chimps or gorillas cried. Then I wondered if any animals cry. Thank you for responding. Sometimes I think it's weird that humans cry. I understand the sadness, grief, etc emotions, but the fact that fluid streams from our eyes is so bizarre. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you know if in a case where an animal is obviously sad to us, like a dog whose owner has abandoned them or died, how is that non-human 'emotion' rationalised?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I personally believe that animals are fully capable of demonstrating emotions, though again some science people call this anthropomorphic behavior. I think it is taught to them to view it this way because it might make it easier to utilize animals for research if they don't have feelings, but that's just my opinion. </p>
<p>In the case you mentioned it can be rationalized that most pets are social animals who would live in groups, or at the very least benefit from the group. Initially the animal takes time to include you into their group now relying on you for pure survivalistic needs. But again I fully think animals can feel.</p></div>		</li>
