<p>Genious, I'll try that tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>There's nothing worse than a wet shower curtain hitting certain body parts! <em>shrugs</em></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another really easy way to prevent this is to get the back side of the curtain wet and stick it to the tub. The cohesive force of water is enough (from experience) to prevent this phenomenon. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno, when you get that blast of cold dry air blowing at your whole body from both directions, which speeds up the warmer the water is, you might reconsider your leg discomfort.  Why not just place a shower soap bottle (whatever kind, as long as its a little heavy) on either corner, atop the curtain and sitting on the tub wall, to pin the curtain in place? It will still deflect inward a little but not as much and no cold airflow will happen.</p></div>		</li>
