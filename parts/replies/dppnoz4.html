			<div class="markdown"><p>So the pills sort of trick our body into thinking there's already a baby in the making. It's awesome how the body works. Thank you for this detailed explanation. If I understand this correctly, the pill works like an estrogen &quot;bomb&quot;? Very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My stepsister was on the pill and had a DVT a couple of years back, needing a course of warfarin to break up the clots. However, she's the only person I've ever personally known to have a DVT, so I guess she's just unlucky.</p></div>		</li>
