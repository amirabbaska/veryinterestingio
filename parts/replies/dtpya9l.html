<p>IIRC being AWOL longer than 30 days turns into desertion which carries a maximum penalty of a death sentence.  They don't do it but it's there.</p>
<p>My first encounter with military law just before swearing in.</p>
<p>Guy was going on and on just before we took the oath and we were just kind of tuning him out.  Went like:</p>
<p>&quot;(Charlie Brown adult noises) ... or sentenced to death&quot;</p>
<p>Everyone: &quot;Can you repeat that last part...?&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: death penalty is reserved for war time, but yeah.  When was the US not technically engaged in a war for more than 20 minutes?  It's been a while.</p></div>		</li>
