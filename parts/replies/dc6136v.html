			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your effort in putting that comment together.  I am an Army medic getting out in 2 weeks.  I have three offers to continue working in medicine, two of which are through ambulance companies and one through The VA.  The points you touched upon definitely called out some issues with solid insight.  I can honestly say I would prefer to be an ER tech than a civilian emt. </p>
<p>The real kicker is being capable of much more than what my civilian credentials state.  As an EMT-B I would never be allowed to push narcotics / suture / chest intubation etc.  In the military,  we are allowed to do whatever the licensed provider feels comfortable letting us do; and has trained us to do. Going from one end and dropped to the other will be annoying, but gotta climb, I suppose.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your service. I understand your frustration. I work with several military veterans that were combat medics (EMTs) who had a much more advanced scope of practice than a civilian EMT does. Having never served in the military, with my only medical experience as a civilian EMT and paramedic, I was honestly surprised how much combat medics with an EMT-B certification could do. But if you think about it, it makes sense. It's faster and easier to train EMT-Bs and give them some advanced skills that are relevant to combat injuries than it would be to put everyone through a paramedic program.</p>
<p>It would be nice if there was a bridge program from combat medic to civilian paramedic. You guys already have a good knowledge base and experience with the skills that could easily be built upon. Hell, depending on what kind of tours you did, you may have seen more shit in the sandbox than I saw during my clinical rotations during paramedic class. </p>
<p>Could you use the G.I. Bill to help cover the cost of a paramedic class? I can imagine a combat medic getting bored quickly working at a VA hospital. There's just something about being out in the field in the shit that's more appealing than working inside a hospital.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate your support!  </p>
<p>I do agree with the logistics standpoint.  The military is a whole different ballgame in some aspects.  When I first got in after training I got pushed off to, &quot;the line,&quot; and picked up field experience there.  It's a good enough time depending on the kinda days your having.  Carrying the ambulance on your back eats ass in 100Â°F +, but it is what it is.  I would definitely say most medics hone their trauma skills / basic <em>basic</em> primary care at this point.  </p>
<p>Some medics stay at that level for years, others don't.  I got picked up on a clinical rotation and would screen patients / put in notes / etc.  Treatments are best learned in this setting due to the proximity of closeness to the PA-C/DO/MD.  The focus shifts from this dude's missing a key body part to this person needs to have that abscess drained, etc.</p>
<p>I think a bridge program is an awesome idea, it gets kicked around by the higher ups @ JBSA every so often but nothing really comes of it.  We can apply for paramedic school, but that carrot means a whole lot of stick most of times.  The GI Bill would cover paramedic school no problem, but I wanna go microbio and see how that lands me.  I truly enjoy being the first there providing care but the VA will pay more than ambulance companies I have the options to pick from.  If that means bed pans and I'm a nurses bitch: well hi, how high do I jump? </p>
<p>Edit: the parts where I was texting too fast to grammatically produce a coherent and flowing thought.  I.e., &quot;most of times.&quot;  Lolol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I've been on the job for 10 years, 8 as a paramedic. I work an average of 56hr/wk on a modified Kelly schedule and make just under $60,000 a year with no extra shifts. I am lucky to have a 10% matching 457b retirement account that is baller. Health insurance is covered for myself as well. My agency is a third party ambulance trust and is not for profit. We cover around 1,300 square miles and serve about 150,000 people. (American Mid-West, suburban and rural, outside a larger city) We run 12,000 calls a year with 5 24 hour units and the occasional extra 12hr unit for week days (yeah... we stay busy). We collect only $250,000 a year as a water bill collected subsidy for one of our units in a remote and rural town (this unit only runs 1.5 calls per shift on average, thus the subsidy. It costs roughly $500,000 a year to run an ambulance with a paramedic and EMT on board.)</p>
<p>We are super close to needing to collect a subsidy to help cover our operations for the rest of the agency... Cuts in Medicare and Medicaid have hurt us.</p>
<p>Here is the issue:</p>
<p>People are not ready to pay what it costs to run a decent ambulance service. Period. Whether we are talking about some tiny town or all the way up to federal subsidies. People just don't wanna! Police service is justifiable because we have been subsidizing it for hundreds of years. Fire Departments, not as long as Police but still quite some time. EMS is still considerably young compared to the other two arms of public safety/health. Herein lies the issue... slowly but surely, education levels, public knowledge of what EMS provides, and standardization will gradually increase the pay and benefits of EMS professionals. I believe in EMS as a career profession, not just some job. I LOVE my job, but that doesn't mean I haven't had some rough patches and questioned my career choices.</p>
<p>Until we start viewing EMS services as a basic right and privilege, things will basically stay the same. A Medicare for all type system is what we need for emergency care and preventative care. IMHO there should never be profit in the emergency care arena... ever. Now if you are some badass surgeon or specialist then by all means, make some cash!</p>
<p>Whew... thanks OP for posting this.</p>
<p>I feel like my first reddit post was a ramble, feels good to voice this stuff though!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are absolutely right. EMS is the baby of emergency services and as such it will take EMS a while to catch up to police and fire. Most people don't think they will ever need EMS, yet most people have called the police for one reason or another in their lives. Most people have insurance on their house in case of a fire. People seem to believe that they will need police and fire at some point in their lives, but most don't even think of EMS, let alone think they'll need it. </p>
<p>Hopefully some day EMS will be viewed/funded as a necessary public safety agency across the board in the same light as police and fire. Only then will we see things get better for EMS providers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While the education level of a Paramedic may seem relatively easy, you are still going to have to be the kind of person who can stick a plastic breathing tube in the right area of someones throat while they are bleeding to death on the side of the road.  After you do it once, you are going to have to be the kind of person who doesn't go home and immediately decide that you never want to have to do that again.  I think that is a rare quality.  </p>
<p>Medics around here get paid the same as night clerks at 7-11; I'm amazed they can keep anyone.</p></div>		</li>
