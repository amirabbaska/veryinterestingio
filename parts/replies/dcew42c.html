			<div class="markdown"><p>For completeness, I'll add that these products come with their own perfumes and scents that mask/replace the bad smells, and Lysol in particular kills the &quot;root cause&quot; of odors by killing the germs that generate them. </p>
<p>The human brain is conditioned as a survival trait to recognize stuff that changes way better than factor in stuff that stays the same. So we instantly recognize a whiff of a distant fire because it's something worth thinking about (food source? shelter? forest fire threat? hmm...), but we could sit right next to a smoky campfire and not really smell it at all. The smell's still there and it'll be on our clothes the next day, but our brain ignores it at the time because it's not as important as new smells that we might pick up.</p>
<p>The perfumes in these sprays helps with this by replacing the 'already existing' smell with a 'nice scent' smell, so our brain switches its attention to that more than the old one and it makes the bad smell less noticeable.</p>
<p>Disinfectant sprays tackle the source of the bad smell directly by killing the bacteria on surfaces that digest foods and give off stenches. They won't help with a skunk's spray because that's 100% chemical, but they will help with, say, a fabric that's had some food juices spilled on it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and fun fact about all of this-- Febreeze was first put on the market with very little scent, since it's &quot;secret sauce&quot; was some kind of new-and-or-improved chemical compound that pulled odors out of the air.</p>
<p>They marketed it as an odor remover, and it barely sold. They almost pulled it from the market. Turns out, people <em>want</em> their spray to have some kind of &quot;fresh&quot; scent in it-- simply removing smells wasn't enough. They had to increase the amount of perfume in it &amp; switch up their marketing strategy.</p>
<p>I've definitely read a more thorough and better-sourced article on this, but this is the best I can find right now and is accurate IIRC-  <a href="http://geekrebel.com/2012/03/marketing-the-febreze-story-marketing-the-feb/" target="_blank">http://geekrebel.com/2012/03/marketing-the-febreze-story-marketing-the-feb/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just read about this in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg (HIGHLY recommended)! Turns out they were also marketing it incorrectly. As r/mac_question said, it was almost pulled because it was only sold to eliminate bad odors. When they started marketing it as an air freshener, to be used after cleaning was done,  sales skyrocketed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup!  In their first public uses, people eventually forgot to use Febreeze because they didn't have a &quot;clean&quot; smell to associate with, just a &quot;non smell&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>(This is a somewhat educated guess as I don't know the specific manufacturing process for Febreze.)</p>
<p>Scent molecules are generally released over time by an evaporating droplet that is a carrier. They are not contained 100% in a spray by themselves. Something else - burning candle, alcohol aerosol spray, waxy powder - carries them into the air as it &quot;evaporates&quot;.</p>
<p>So you squirt the stuff, and tiny droplets of carrier liquid full of both neutralizer and scent molecules are sprayed out and evaporate. This gives off an immediate blast of scent molecules and trapper molecules both, and then some of those scent molecules are affected by the trapper molecules but others get to your nose. </p>
<p>Eventually maybe a lot of the product's scent molecules ARE neutralized, but you still get that immediate hit of fresh scent.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When Fabreeze first came out it didn't have a perfume. It eliminated odors but since the user was &quot;nose blind&quot; to them they notice the absence of the smell. This made it seem like the product didn't do anything and so it did not sell well as a result. It took the company some time to figure out why people didn't like the product. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're not, instantly. </p>
<p>The perfume component of the spray does a fantastic job of immediately masking/replacing the original odor while the chemical trapping aspect eventually does its work. So we get the impression it's working really fast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is some excellent engineering of a chemical product! Never thought about how the timing of the two separate effects of febreeze is key in its effectiveness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fairly likely. The odor-eating compounds don't just disappear after a few seconds, they continue to remain in the air, being circulated by ambient currents until they settle out of the air on to the ground, adhere to a surface (like walls or your clothes) or are blown out a window or vent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. A disease is transmitted by a very large collection of molecules in the form of a bacterium cell or virus particle. In order to effectively neutralize it you'd have to capture or coat the entire thing (something you can't do with a simple molecule that's small enough to itself remain airborne) or poison it. </p></div>		</li>
