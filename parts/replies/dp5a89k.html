			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. We're made up of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, magnesium, boron, chromium, cobalt copper, fluorine, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, selenium, silicon, tin, vanadium and zinc.
The hydrogen in you was created during the big bang, and boron is created from cosmic ray fission. So no star stuff required so far. The carbon comes mostly from low-mass stars. The oxygen, fluorine, sodium, magnesium, and selenium come entirely from big massive stars. Manganese, Iron, zinc, and copper all come mostly from white dwarfs, although some comes from massive stars too. molybdenum and tin come from the merging of neutron stars. all this is to say that at a minimum you're made up of a low mass star, a very massive star, a white dwarf, and a <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/10/merging-neutron-stars-generate-gravitational-waves-and-celestial-light-show" target="_blank">neutron star death spiral</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is not much, and unfortunately not terribly interesting. Vanadium in the form of an aqueous vanadate is used to selectively inhibit certain enzymes that break down ATP to ADP. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So it would be a minimum of three stars?  All of the elements on Earth could be formed from three first generation stars, one of which went nova, and two of which collapsed into neutron stars and later underwent a collision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I am doing the math... universe is like 14billion years old, earth is 5billionish?</p>
<p>pretty tight window for all of these elements to exist in maybe 8 billion years considering this can be the lifespan of some of these stars that need to form, live, and die for our elements to exist now...</p>
<p>not doubting the science, just boggling the mind I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We could probably figure out all the different &quot;types&quot; of stars that contributed to our system's formation by using analysis of materials as you suggest, but that still won't give us a good sense of the <em>minimum number</em> of stars because the types are not discrete; that is,  there is a decent amount of overlap between types</p></div>		</li>
