<p>If it does, Iâ€™m sure the damage from exposure would greatly outweigh the advantages of vitamin D production. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would most likely facilitate vitamin D production. However, as stated, it would do much more damage in the form of eye damage or what is effectively a sunburn, however with proper safety procedures none of the above are applicable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traditionally mercury arc lamps were used as <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ww1scientificadvances73/miscellaneous-advances/sun-lamps" target="_blank">&quot;sun lamps&quot;</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the winter of 1918, it was estimated that half of the children in Berlin were suffering from rickets- a disease where bones become soft and deformed. At the time, the cause was not known, although it was related to poverty.</p>
<p>A doctor in named Kurt Huldschinsky  noticed that his patients were very pale. He decided to conduct an experiment on four of them, including one known today only as Arthur, who was three years old. He put the four of them under mercury-quartz lamps which emitted ultraviolet light. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's right, those arcs would get the job done. One way to know that is true is because welders if not using proper protection can get a tan similar to what you get from sunlight. Tanning is also mostly caused by UVB rays, so just as you would tan from a weld arc you would also get extra vitamin D production. </p>
<p>But of course this UV component is also the reason why it's important to protect yourself from this light in the first place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes; people get what's called welder's tan. That said, it's damaging just as the sun is, so protective equipment is worn by many/most of the time; no damage, but also no Vitamin D production.</p></div>		</li>
