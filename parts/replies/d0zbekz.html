			<div class="markdown"><p>A double-precision floating point variable (the most commonly used data type to represent real numbers these days) has a precision of 16-17 digits. Since the value of pi is hardcoded and not computed on the fly, there's no harm in making it as accurate as the data type allows, even if this level of precision is rarely useful in actual computations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but in a relatively unnecessary way. The most precise numbers are always used because of the accumulation of error in calculations.  It it not calculation intensive to add several digits to the end of pi.  Remove as much error as possible since you're going to be getting a lack of precision in plenty of other places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read that you only need the first 39 digits of pi to calculate the circumference of the observable universe to an error less than the width of a single hydrogen atom. So I imagine after ten or so digits (like other commentators said) it wouldn't be useful anymore :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last year we got a really close approximation to pi. </p>
<p>3/14/15 at 9:26. </p>
<p>IIRC, we won't have this combination for a hundred years. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Why?</p>
<p>We could use 31.4.16, or 31.4.1592, too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We all know ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) is the most superior date format. That would place the next pi day on 31415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164-06-28. It'll be a bit of a wait. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Take pi to several (i.e. &gt;n) digits:</p>
<p><code>actual_pi = 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399</code></p>
<p>Take pi, rounded to n digits (i.e. 10 digits)</p>
<p><code>rounded_pi = 3.141592654</code></p>
<p>Take a diameter (say 100km=100000m).</p>
<p><code>D = 100000</code></p>
<p>The error in your approximation is:</p>
<p><code>D*actual_pi - D*rounded_pi</code></p>
<p>In this case, the error is -4.1x10^-5 m, or roughly half the width of a human hair when calculating the circumference of a circle 100km across.</p>
<p>So no, you don't really need that many digits.</p></div>		</li>
