<p>You just blew my mind. When you view the Middle Ages in this way it suddenly makes so much sense it's crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For a significant period of time during the middle ages Western Europe was rather preoccupied with death. Think about it. In the space of a few centuries you get the great heathen army invading modern day England. There's the mongol empire. The crusades. The plague wiping out a significant portion of civilisation.</p>
<p>They don't call them the dark ages for nothing. Much knowledge was lost. Much war was waged. Disease and famine ravaged the lands.</p>
<p>There was a whole genre of allegorical art that revolved around reminding people that they were all going to die. A lot of these pieces depict death as the grim reaper interacting with horrified people. The message being that death is the great equalizer. Rich or poor, villain or saint. Before long all lie in the ground.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We idealize that dark ages as a literally magical time</p>
<p>While also looking to the future as a devastated wasteland that we are sort of intrigued by</p>
<p>What is it about an unstable world that we put so much fascination in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rome (the city) at its peak had a population of ~2 million. After its fall, the population dropped as low as 20-30 thousand.</p>
<p>Compare Detroit, which also had a population of ~2 million at its peak, but fell &quot;only&quot; to 600-700 thousand.</p>
<p>What happened to Rome was ~20x worse than what happened to Detroit, and that's just one city in a thousand mile wide empire, with a much larger sphere of influence. It truly was post-apocalyptic. Civilization had collapsed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, for a decent analogue you can probably look at the worst of the post-colonial African countries today. </p>
<p>Think about it: foreign conquerors come in, bring with them clearly superior technology and organization, use it to their own benefit, the natives mostly only see any of it when they are oppressed by it, except for a few. Then the empire wanes, the conquerors leave, the assimilated natives leave with them, the rest have no ability to sustain the outposts of civilization and likely wouldn't want to if they could - remember, they've only really seen it when it was oppressing them and are likely glad to be rid of it. </p>
<p>[A lot of Dark Ages Europe even had law systems that consisted of a mishmash between Roman law and old tribal customs; some places even had almost Zimbabwe-style ethnic laws against the descendants of the former oppressors] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Germanic_law" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Germanic_law</a>) - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigothic_Code" target="_blank">and then in Spain this was done away with again, declaring everyone to simply be &quot;hispani&quot;</a>. Sometimes it seems as if literally everything has happened before. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well and also the fact that there were basically art schools during the Roman period where people learned to sculpt. Those closed down as the empire weakened. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A similar story: When western trade with Asia became big, Europeans considered Chinese are primitive, because it didn't look like the, at the time, photorealistic art of Europe.</p>
<p>The Chinese, on the other hand, saw European art as primitive, because it only depicted how things LOOKED, not how they WHERE.</p>
<p>So, it's all a matter of what one want to achieve.</p></div>		</li>
