			<div class="markdown"><p>Chicken pox is a type of herpes virus. Much like herpes I and II it goes from the skin to the nerves where it integrates into the DNA of those nerves.</p>
<p>In the case of type I or II herpes, reactivation results in the general affected skin area. Chicken pox is interesting because of where you get it, it goes all the way to the spine and hangs out in dorsal root ganglia which is where the sensory cell bodies are at, adjacent to the spinal cord, integrating it's DNA there. When you get shingles/zoster, the virus travels out of one dorsal root ganglion and affects the entire area that is innervated by sensory nerves coming from that vertebral segment, aka a dermatome (<a href="http://tlccrx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Dermatome.jpg" target="_blank">http://tlccrx.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Dermatome.jpg</a>).</p>
<p>So you'll get your shingles along a single dermatome, and generally only on one side of the body.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh, when I got shingles on my tailbone I thought it was a cluster of acne.</p>
<p>I drank a fifth of Jack and squeezed it till it &quot;popped&quot; and blood started pouring out, dark blood.</p>
<p>Then it turned into a giant abcess that got infected.</p>
<p>In the future, do I just ignore it or go to the doctor? I'd rather avoid getting my wallet gouged by a doctor (American).</p>
<p>I was twenty-two when this happened, and I get it almost every year around Christmas. Can stress be compromising my immune system to cause this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Go to the doctor. Get a script for high dose Valtrex. At the first sign of the rash start taking it until it goes away. There's also a vaccine you can get which can reduce the # of outbreaks/severity</p>
<p>Don't ignore it, if it spreads or gets farther along before your immune system can catch it, it can damage your nerves, leading to permanent pain in that location among many other complications. </p>
<p>And yup, stress can cause it to flare up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Medical student here btw, I'd see a dermatologist next time it happens. That doesn't sound like shingles. It would be very odd if it were.</p>
<p>You should not be getting shingles every year. It rarely comes more than once. Twice is very very rare. Three times is extremely rare.</p>
<p>You should not be getting shingles at 22. I'd expect to see it in the 50+ population. It's not impossible, just very very unlikely.</p>
<p>You should not be getting shingles right around your tailbone and nowhere else. The way dermatomes work, see my earlier post for a diagram, is it'd either be all down your leg and all up in your butt/gooch/crotch. There is no &quot;just tailbone area only&quot;. It'd also be only on one side of your spine.</p>
<p>No, this actually sounds more like Herpes Simplex II, aka genital herpes.</p>
<p>Herpes II doesn't just have to be on your genitals. It can, like the shingles/zoster virus, chill in any sensory nerve ganglia. It just most commonly affects the sacral ones (ie all up in your genitals, but your tailbone is also totally free game here), based on how it usually gets spread. Likewise hepes I is likely to infect people's mouths and chill in the nerves that supply the mouth area.</p>
<p>Chicken pox isn't localized though, it goes everywhere on the skin, and therefore will reside in entire multiple ganglia and remain dormant, only to come out and infect most of the dermatome, in a characteristic large stripe on one side. Herpes I and II, being local infections, only go back to those specific nerves supplying the skin of that local infection site, and when they re-emerge, they will reemerge to that same local spot.</p>
<p>So if you got it on your tailbone, it will come back on your tailbone.</p>
<p>Next time you get it, you can get it tested to be sure exactly what it is. My money's on herpes II but there's other things on the table it could be.</p>
<p>Absolutely go to the doctor about it. If it's herpes II, outbreaks can be controlled pretty well. Over half of adults have hepes I. About 1 in 6 have herpes II. Most don't know it. It's extremely common. Having said that, if that's what it is, you should tell your sexual partners about it. But it's less a big deal than most people make it out to be.</p>
<p>If you have already been to the doctor and the tests from the blisters came back as VZV (varicella-zoster virus, aka the chickenpox/shingles) then I would be delighted to be proven wrong here, but as I've said my money is on HSV-II (genital herpes). Like I said the doc can tell you which and treat/control accordingly. It's something I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: I don't think you have shingles. I think you likely have herpes simplex II or an unrelated skin condition. And I think the next time it happens you should get your ass to the doc so they can tell you what it is.</strong></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I see no good reason why it couldn't hit the trigeminal nerve as well.</p>
<p>It's likely that the viral genome is encoded into many many sensory nerve cells as chicken pox affects such a large area of the skin to begin with. Point being though, shingles/zoster usually forms an outbreak along one dermatome. Not that the virus only chose to encode itself in that one anatomically-defined group of cells, but that it re-activates within a single ganglion, leading to the unilateral dermatome effect.</p>
<p>No reason why said ganglion couldn't be the trigeminal one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've got scarring on my forehead where the lesions were and it's more sensitive to touch.</p>
<p>What is more worrying is I read in the paper some years after the outbreak that because of where I had it occur, the blood vessels would have also been weakened.  This means I'm a third more likely to suffer a stroke than normal.</p>
<p>It was really uplifting to read that bit of research whilst I ate my breakfast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same here. Spent five nights in the hospital on IV antivirals. It was behind my eyeball so there was concern of permanent damage to my sight. Luckily it was treated immediately enough and no damage was done to my eye. Are you still experiencing post-herpetic neuralgia? It's been exactly a year for me, and the irritation on my forehead can be unbearable at times. My neurologist said it can last forever and I have tried medications as well. Nothing seems to help. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad you got through it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I've not had any postherpetic neuralgia.  I developed shingles when I was 18 so I think that helped fight it off.</p>
<p>I've still got scars where the shingles lesions were and those spots are definitely more sensitive but no unbearable irritation :(.</p>
<p>I hope it lessens over time for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is anecdotal, but the few people that I saw that had shingles all had some form of either major stress or emotional trauma. One was a woman who had just lost her adult child, another was going through a divorce, third had a terminally sick family member. </p>
<p>Extreme stress can lower a person's immune function, so it corresponds with what you said about a that being part of the mechanism of the reactivation of the virus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stress is also cited as a factor that can cause shingles outbreaks, independently of immune system changes. Stress can cause changes in how the body reads DNA, so I would assume that this is what leads to the outbreak when it is stress induced, but I'm not sure that anyone knows the exact reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 23F and just had my first outbreak of shingles a few months ago. I first contracted the chickenpox when I was 1, then again after I turned 7, and 9. Diagnosed with hay fever at 7 but I'm starting to believe something else is wrong with my immune system. However I kept denying my recent outbreak was due to emotional stress until I read this :) I have permanent nerve damage and just started wearing lidocaine patches. A few doctors have said that I'm an outlier because my body never learned how to fight the virus, and may have an immune disorder. My question is is my chicken pox/shingles problem &quot;normal&quot; or do I need to learn how to just manage my stress and better? Should I actually waste my time and money and go get tested for and immune deficiency? Is this Hashimto's? I haven't had an immune system low this bad since I was in elementary school, but I contracted Whooping Cough last April and since I've gotten over that, I've been having a lot of sickness issues. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I were you I'd probably see an immunologist. It's unusual for a healthy person to get chicken pox 3 times. The fact you're getting things like whooping cough may also be indicative of this.</p>
<p>It's always good to manage stress because high stress causes a decline in immune function. But just going by what you posted here, I think further evaluation would be beneficial. The presence/absence of an immune problem would probably go a long way towards doctors trying to figure out some way to help you. </p>
<p>Stress could be an issue, but that's kinda a cop out diagnosis IMO if you don't explore other avenues. </p></div>		</li>
