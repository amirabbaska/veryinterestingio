			<p>It means that what you paid 10cents for 50 years ago you pay 10 dollars for today. If Wages don't match the ludicrous inflation we are fucked and the peeps who buy physical assets before the &quot;crash&quot; (they knew was coming) get richer and get more. Everyone wants to keep maing it about tuition, this is a problem that goes back over a hundred years.</p>		</li>
