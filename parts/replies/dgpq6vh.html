<p>State is a synonym for nation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just to point out a flaw, this isn't true.  State refers to the boundaries and government.  Nation refers to the people.  There are stateless nations like the Kurds.  There are states with multiple nations like Israel.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, not semantics.  There's a very big difference from the cultural entity of a nation and the political entity of a state.  A state is specifically a political and geopolitical entity, whilst a nation is a cultural and ethnic one.  To say otherwise, would be nothing short of an incorrect statement and does effect the analysis of OP's comment.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree, I think it's fine to live life being ashamed of what your ancestors did. Thankfully there is no evidence of slave ownership in my family history, but I live in the only country that has dropped an atomic bomb on anyone else. I'm deeply ashamed to call myself an American because of that. Our government has time and time again broken treaties with the natives of this country, after killing them and forcing them into Christianity, while our country is founded on religious freedom. I don't think about these things on a daily basis, but they disgust me any time I do. But they won't make me leave America. In fact, I will spend my life fighting to make sure it doesn't happen again. </p></div>		</li>
