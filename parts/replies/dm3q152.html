<p>Also, people now travel more.  All it takes is one infested person taking a hitchiking pregnant bug into their hotel via luggage and the cycle continues.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>unfortunately the heat treatment is fairly erratic in efficacy, because it's really, really incredibly difficult to get a uniform temperature throughout a room or building, and bedbugs are really good at finding the tiny cool spots and hanging on - or fleeing inside of the insulated wallspaces and returning once the heat normalizes. </p>
<p>(professional) chemical treatment, along with a customized treatment plan (whether to keep or remove harborage points, whether to use diatomaceous earth in addition to the chemical treatment, when to put on mattress encasements, that sort of thing) from a pest control professional is the best available option at this time. </p>
<p>unscrupulous pest control agencies will tout the heat treatment because it's expensive and flashy, but from what I've been told and seen, it's not as effective over time, and certainly not as cost effective. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First thing I tried, took down the population a good chunk but they just adapted to climbing the walls and curtains to get around it. Little bastards are resourceful and I also think it's more to do with the building itself being quite infested so regardless how much I've done to proof/treat my room and appt of them, there will always be more just down the hall. </p>
<p>Thus far the only thing I can guarantee to kill them dead the first shot is rubbing alcohol in a spray bottle. one douse and the bugs quite literally fold in half. The downside is that it only works on the ones I find and I imagine for every 5 I do find there are 5 times that that I just don't find. Otherwise I find that the highest heat cycle of the driers helps for your sheets in preventing nesting/resting areas for the bugs. (be prepared to gag when you see a bunch of bug carcasses fall off your sheets. Horrifying site the first couple times.)</p>
<p>We've also had the building exterminator in three times, once was a preventative dusting when we first moved in which was exclusive to sprinkling some of the dust under the fridge and behind the toilet, (Which at that time roaches were our bigger concern, combat gel took care of those crawlers nicely though. That was an overnight pest extermination. Haven't even seen one since.) Then we got them back to check once I started noticing bite marks, all that was was an eye opener as to what the bugs looked like and where I needed to look for them because the exterminator didn't do much that day. The third time was a spray treatment which was effective that day but within the week they were back in full force.</p>
<p>As it stands I sleep in sweat pants, tucked into my socks, with my shirt tucked into the waist and either a long sleeve overshirt or a sweater. (Not fun in this summer heat.) And all that's really done is limit where I'm getting bitten to my forearms and neck. When the biting first started they had torn apart my legs and waist so I had to do something. I'm half way embarrassed to wear shorts as there are still scabbing marks from all the early bites. I didn't know/have the restraint to not rub the bites then, learning curve was harsh. side note for those reading who may be in a similar struggle, rubbing alcohol for me is the best thing to rub the bites with. Takes down the swelling within hours and the bite marks are much more minimal than not using it, as well if that doesn't work speak to a dermatologist about creams/ointments.</p>
<p>Thanks though concerned redditors, for hearing my plight. May new knowledge be revealed so as to put these pests into the ground permanently.</p></div>		</li>
