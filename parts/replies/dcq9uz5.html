			<div class="markdown"><p>Very similar. It's usually brought down to the freezing temperature in a machine like <a href="https://www.google.co.jp/imgres?imgurl=http%3A%2F%2Fus.flukecal.com%2Fsites%2Fflukecal.com%2Ffiles%2Fimagecache%2Fproduct-detail-zoom%2Fassets%2Fproducts%2F9210.jpg&amp;imgrefurl=http%3A%2F%2Fus.flukecal.com%2Fproducts%2Ftemperature-calibration%2Fits-90-temperature-standards%2F9210-mini-triple-point-water-mainten-1&amp;docid=XAQjuojySIi-xM&amp;tbnid=50jRXflo5z4pQM%3A&amp;vet=1&amp;w=327&amp;h=288&amp;hl=en-jp&amp;client=safari&amp;bih=460&amp;biw=320&amp;q=9210%20triple%20point&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf5YSYyNTRAhUOh7wKHV8nBeEQMwgbKAAwAA&amp;iact=mrc&amp;uact=8" target="_blank">this</a> and then taken out when ready and it looks like just a liquid, but what we do is &quot;break&quot; it.  Which is just taking the cell gently and tipping upside down and back up and you'll see ice start to form and spread throughout the liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you  for explaining.  i know know the what, but not the why? I have to say that image link led me down a rabbit hole to things i had absolutely no idea about. And after reading i truly remain in the relative same state. I have no idea what you do that you understand it so thoroughly, but i feel kind of simple now. Love to learn though. </p></div>		</li>
