			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought that the 2k series were abreviated that way due to being made by one of the 2k game studios. I don't play sports games so that was just my assumption.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The very first were NFL 2K and NBA 2K for the Dreamcast, developed by Visual Concepts, published by Sega Sports, and released in late 1999/early 2000.  It was a cool way to abbreviate &quot;2000&quot; at the time.  Every year since then, the 2k1, etc. has just gotten more stupid.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that's not it. It wasn't named because the studio was 2k. They wouldn't have called it &quot;NBA Respawn 17&quot;  if that had been the studio name. </p>
<p>The studio was named AFTER the sports games they were put in charge of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The publisher is 2K, which came from the name applied by the original studio behind the sports games, Visual Concepts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get what you are saying, I just never payed attention to a sports game until after that one nba game that marketed having sweat.</p>
<p>On a side note, &quot;NBA respawn 17&quot; sounds like it has potential. Maybe something like that football game with steroids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The video game series from 2K sports popularized it and it just became part of pop culture to do 2K17 and the rest. It's also way smoother sounding and faster to say 2K than 2 thousand. Social media like Twitter where flow and word choice help your tweets bang, 2K stuck. If you're an active user on Twitter, you know anything that's big on Twitter becomes big in real life not too long after, especially words and wording. </p></div>		</li>
