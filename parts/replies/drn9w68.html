<p>For four dimensions, there are infinitely many ways to do so. These are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_R4" target="_blank">Exotic R^(4)</a> spaces.</p>
<p>Somewhat relatedly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture" target="_blank">Poincare Conjecture</a> (proved by Perelman) says that if a 4D object &quot;looks like&quot; a sphere, then it is a sphere.</p>

<p>I know what I'm spending the rest of my Friday night doing: going down a Wikipedia rabbit hole! Thanks for the reply. One of my favorite electives was combinatorial topology, but we never touched on the Poincar√© conjecture. Perelman seems like an intriguing person, beyond his significant contributions to math.</p>
<p>Can you recommend any other introductions to Exotic R^4 beyond Wikipedia? The wiki article is terse.</p></div>		</li>

Though, it might be easier to start by making sure you know what a &quot;Smooth Structure&quot; is, by looking into manifolds, and I think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_stability_criterion" target="_blank">Exotic Spheres</a> are similar but easier (not sure though).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly the references and sources section of Wikipedia articles can send you to some pretty credible published sources. Otherwise, you can literally Google scholarly articles for whatever topic you want to learn about. I think it's a good way to get into the habit of using reliable information from published sources instead of referencing a vague Wikipedia link in a paper or project, for example. It is especially effective to find math related articles or journals since they don't often become obsolete, so there are a lot of them online.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a technical discussion about it <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/47569/what-makes-four-dimensions-special" target="_blank">here</a>. But I've heard it said that dimensions less than 4 are too constrained to allow for anything interesting to happen, and in dimensions bigger than 4 there is so much room that you can do anything you want, so everything is easy. I'm not a low dimensional topologist, so I can't really provide more insight than that.</p></div>		</li>
