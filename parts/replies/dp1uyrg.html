<p>So if Cl- anion were to oxidize giving up its excess electrons to form Cl2 gas, the Cl2 would then reduce by snatching back up the electrons much much faster than the water possibly could, reproducing the original Cl- anion and affording no change in the system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So does this imply that it does occur, although on an insignificant scale?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is very likely that if you have a cup of saltwater at least one Cl2 molecule will form from it. I donâ€™t know the rate constant of the reaction to say exactly how much will form in a given time frame but yes, it will occur in negligible quantities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reaction I've  written in my OC with Cl- being oxidized and water being reduced cannot happen normally <em>unless energy is added from an outside source</em>. This is because the gibbs free energy (deltaG) for this reaction is non-spontaneous (deltaG = +).
If you want to know more about gibbs free energies I can explain in depth, but I'll skip that here for the sake of longevity. It suffices to say that reactions where deltaG = - happen on their own, and reactions where deltaG = +  require input of energy.</p>
<p>We know the deltaG = + because the Voltage of a cell (Ecell) is directly related to deltaG by the equation..</p>
<p>deltaG = -nFEcell</p>
<p><em>By this equation all you need to see is that Ecell and deltaG are always opposite in sign.</em></p>
<p>And our Ecell can be obtained by simply subtracting the reduction potentials I gave in my OC..</p>
<p>Ecell = reduced - oxidized = -0.83 - 1.36 = -2.19</p>
<p>Since Ecell = - ... deltaG = + !!</p>
<p>deltaG = + is what tells us that the reaction will not occur on it's own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are these reduction potentials your discussing abbreviated by ORP ? If so it's a very common reading in water treatment many of our PlCs (programmable logic controllers) use. Most operators have no idea what it means but they know where the readings are supposed to be and adjust chemical feeders and and flow valves accordingly.  Personally I like when you can directly see the parts per million readings as I have a much better grasp on what that means. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, ORP is one name for the reduction potentials. I believe the common terminioligy is standard reduction potentials. </p></div>		</li>
