<li>performs frequency analysis </li>
<li>gives you the most common elements back </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In writing articles, it's just like writing an essay, you have and introduction, the body expanding on it and the conclusion. </p>
<p>It's pretty easy to cut out a lot of the stuff and still get the gist of the story, without explaining it. By comparing the conclusion and the introduction, you would be able to get a good basis of the message the article is getting across, without having all the details. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an engine that would be really easy to plug-and-play for success in subjective terms, then look for common calculable trends in those that fare well and poorly to a human reader.  I think a lot of us are curious about those next steps of refinement--steps I'm sure some of these algorithms have taken.  Can anyone share them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right: it could not come up with the new phrase &quot;performs frequency analysis&quot; as the GP's manual tldr used. That is indeed the most frequent idea, but as those exact words aren't used, it wouldn't get there automatically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>articles tend to restate the most important information a lot.</p>
<p>ie, the person in questions name will show up a bunch of times; &quot;Obama said&quot; &quot;president Obama&quot; etc. mostly associated with details. then writers relate the facts to each element, so those facts get restated in relation to the detail. where the two meet is the meat.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would bet the measure is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf*idf" target="_blank">tf-idf</a>. If that's the case, the answer would be &quot;both the website and the web in general&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>You check the website to see which words are important in this document</li>
<li>You check the web in general to see which words show up often (for instance, &quot;the&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have both measures, you combine them and end up with a list of words that are important in this text in particular, but not important in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you chose &quot;the&quot; just because it's an obvious choice for a common word, but I should point out that in frequency analysis algorithms like this, words like &quot;the&quot; are usually removed from consideration. They're called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words" target="_blank">stop words</a> and are ignored because they give little to no information on the actual content of the sentence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be self-contained to that website. I didn't write the algorithm so I'm not entirely sure, but since I've never seen comments summarized I believe that SMMRY also uses just the body of the article for ranking more specifically. This is so that words that might be fairly unpopular on a more global scale (let's use gene for example) can still rank high in relevant articles (a genomics article).</p>
<p>Hope I explained this well, I just woke up so might be a bit all over the place. Let me know if there's any more questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt this since the most popular words in any article will simply be articles. Unless they have a very extensive and well tuned stop word list, they probably use tfidf. Its not that bad to pre process wikipedia into a idf table that you can just do lookups on when running the algorithm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the cutoff for the highest ranking sentences arbitrary, like &quot;take the first 5% and then fuck the rest,&quot; or is there some methodological approach to it? I imagine something intuitive would be like a sort of differential equation thing where you just see where the distribution of points just suddenly changes to a flat part of the curve more quickly, assuming it would even be on some sort of curve. It could, theoretically, be on a totally chaotic distribution, with the first sentence having 100 points, the second 99 points, the third 14 points, the fourth 13 points, and the fifth 1 point.</p>
<p>I guess even then you could approximate a curve there.</p>
<p>Umm...yeah, tldr my question is when do the sentences stop?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at the <a href="http://smmry.com/api" target="_blank">SMMRY API</a>, it looks like that's a parameter you put in to the algorithm. By default the algorithm returns 7 sentences, but you can specify more or less. I wouldn't be surprised if more sophisticated algorithms trying to achieve the same task use your approach or a similar one though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You can do a decent enough job 80% of the time pretty easily.</p>
<p>You can have a very complex algorithm and get a good rate on 90%  of the cases if you are very good and work really hard. </p>
