			<div class="markdown"><p>I split my knee open on the neck of my bmx bike when I was 12 . . . 40 years ago.  For years it looked like I had an extra pair of lips on my knee (about 1/2 inch long and 1/4 inch across). Then it started to fade, and now it is really not noticeable. There is no longer a bump at all only a thin line is visible.
Recently a few friends have also mentioned that their childhood scars are fading away.</p></div>		</li>
