			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly! It's darker because it's generally thicker and denser, so less light gets through. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>In general, the gross composition of cow's milk in the U.S. is 87.7% water, 4.9% lactose (carbohydrate), 3.4% fat, 3.3% protein, and 0.7% minerals (referred to as ash). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has fat in it, but milkfat is ... milkfat. It's not butter until it's extracted from the milk. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, I said at first that it's a lot of fat particles. Someone else complained that &quot;fat particles&quot; sounded gross so I edited it to be a bit nicer, 'cause I don't want to turn people off from drinking milk. I'd say it's fine for an ELI5. </p></div>		</li>
