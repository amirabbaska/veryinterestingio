			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last paragraph makes me chuckle, because I can tell who in my family is walking around the house or who has just come home by the sound of things like that. </p>
<p>I can tell who is walking down a hallway by the sound of the pattern, speed, and heaviness of footsteps. I can also tell who's leaving/approaching/entering the house by the way their keychain jingles. When I get my oil changed and I'm sitting in the waiting room, I know when my car is ready because I can hear <em>my own</em> keychain jingling as the tech brings my keys to the register. I once asked friends online if anyone else can tell key jingles apart, and someone commented, &quot;You have dog senses!&quot; I guess I do. I grew up in a household with 6 people and could always tell who was who without seeing them and without hearing their voices. It seemed normal to me until I stopped and thought about it recently.</p>
<p>One more note, I wonder if a dog's tongue is used to detect texture, the way an infant's tongue is. Baby humans put things in their mouths all the time in part because they get more detailed texture information that way. Perhaps part of why dogs lick so many things besides faces has to do with that as well?</p>
<p>*Edit to add one more thing - nowadays, I can tell who is outside by the sounds and body language of my dogs. They react differently depending on if it's a stranger, a stranger with children, a stranger with dogs, or a family friend/extended family member. Then for family members who have lived in our household at the same time as them before, each of us elicits a specific combinations of responses. It's hard to explain, but if I'm home alone and someone walks down the street or parks in the driveway, I can tell who it is by watching and listening to my two dogs. The levels of excitement, the squeaks vs barks vs other sounds, where they position themselves in anticipation, etc. all give clues to who or what it is they see.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>out of curiosity: do you happen to have poor eyesight?</p>
<p>i have very poor eyesight so i could never tell people's faces apart from afar so i instead noticed that i would distinguish them by the way they walked and details like that, and i'm also much more sound-sensitive than others in my family that can actually see things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope, nearly perfect eyesight, actually. I guess I just have sharp senses. I'm also a super taster (not as fun as it sounds.) I'm more detail-oriented in general, and I know such traits are often found side-by-side. It makes me suspect that these things may be related to how information is filtered and processed in the brain, more than anything else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm the same way, poor eyesight and all. I used to go extended periods without glasses or contacts and I had to learn those things too. To be honest in many ways I prefer to not wear them. Not because I feel lit heightens my senses, but because I kind of prefer to see less detail unless I'm driving or watching TV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's it. When one of your senses are weakened, generally your other senses try to make up for that. With glasses and my right eye not even able to read the top letter of an Eye Exam anymore, I'm really dependent upon my recollection and sound queues. My peripheral vision doesn't tell me anything (glasses, and the area under arm is just a blur) so I can hear slight sounds and feel presences near me to know to move out the way at a packed mall or something. Gained this above and beyond spatial awareness that none of my friends have.
But also I've seen cases where one sense being gone does nothing. Because hearing is extremely important tomrhythm and placement and whatnot. I got to RIT that has a large NTID school. And some of the deaf or mhard of hearing students never take note of where they are and you are constantly dodging around them when rushing or long boarding. Which confused me because I assumed deaf would mean their eyes are really trained to noticing movement and their surrounding</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is. It's just that there's people who don't look into those things as much, and who then act surprised when someone can do it, thus giving the people who do it the impression that it's abnormal. </p>
<p>To be fair though, it's a spectrum, to be able to differentiate between a large number of similar people is a much higher &quot;level&quot; than differentiating between two or three family members, which is more common. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I come from a large family, and I guess it's a contributing factor to developing these senses. We even played around with it. Close the door the way Dad does, drop your keys on a specific spot and stay in front of the door instead of walking in? See everyone rushing in, thinking Dad's home.</p>
<p>I went back home recently, and with my brothers' growth spurt, I can't tell them apart now, and the whole apartment's sounds and balance is a bit changed. It's interesting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog loves licking my feet, legs, arms, etc. I always assumed it had to do with my natural salinity, because even when I'm not sweating he's usually trying to lick me. He recognizes me way before he licks me. </p>
<p>Also he sleeps by my side every night. But he's the type of dog where if he got loose in the front yard he wouldn't hesitate would instantly run away from me and explore as much as he could. He does listen to me when he gets loose though. It might take a minute or two but he'll eventually come back to me.</p>
<p>Then one night I was getting home pretty late and I had had a little bit to drink and I was super exhausted. Before I went to sleep I decided to give him (Rollo) a walk. After his walk I sat down on the patio and leaned against the outside of the house and I must have instantly passed out and slid down the wall so thag i was just lying on the patio floor. I woke up a couple hours later to Rollo sitting right next to me barking at the door to the house where my dad appeared. Apparently Rollo had the chance to run away free in those couple hours I was out cold but instead chose to sit and guard my unprotected, passed out ass and even tried alerting my family that we were outside and something wasn't normal. Ever since then he's been getting a much more sizeable portion of treats a couple times a day and I still let him guard me while I sleep each night.</p>
<p>I guess my point, or my question, from all of this was: how did he know something wasn't right? Was it just because I was outside or could he maybe taste the alcohol in my sweat (though idk why alcohol would be a concern for a dog)? And why didn't he just run away like he always tries to do?</p></div>		</li>

<p>He knew you walked weird, your speaking was likely a lower tone and a loss less dynamic (or more?) in volume. You were acting weird, didn't respond to his body language like you usually do. Something weird was happening and on top of that you completely dropped your guard while you were outside and stopped responding. He knew you weren't safe and unable to protect yourself and his attempts at waking you already failed, so he stopped and called for help! How would someone come to protect you if they didn't know your location?</p>
<p>Rollo has got your back :) You are important to him, so much that you were his focus for hours.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog and I recently moved out of my parents house. Since I don't have a yard I can let her roam freely in, she gets super excited when she realizes that we are going back to visit home. She starts whining like a mile before we even arrive, and jumps over the front seat of my car to get out because she can't wait any longer for me to open the back door. It's incredible. She seems able to recognize the surrounding areas or perhaps the pattern of car movements? (I always take the same route back home)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a dog that does this. We have a couple of places that we visit fairly often, but they are hours from where we live. </p>
<p>It seems like as soon as we get on the same street as our destination my dog is more alert and pawing at the doors/Windows.</p>
<p>I had thought it was just because we were slowing down and making more turns, but when we make stops along the way he doesn't do that.</p></div>		</li>
