			<div class="markdown"><p>Most western aid that goes into birth control goes into religious or abstinence based programming which is incredibly ineffective. The programs that are effective tend to focus on sexual health all around and address other highly stigmatized areas like hiv/aids so they get less funding, or in some cases go unrecognizrd because certain places don't like to admit they have problems and there is a lot of stigma.</p>
<p>This isn't true every where of course, and maybe things have changed since I studied this kind of stuff in college. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Through a healthcare economics class we learned that education plays a huge role, but mostly when females have access to education. When females have this access they are more likely to use some form of birth control also many will focused on a career which leads to having babies later on in many cases or none at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I give to a charity called Health Poverty Action. They are all about basic healthcare, mainly for women and children, in developing countries. They offer health education and medical care that tends towards empowering women (eg, campaigning against FGM and repairing fistulas which occur during childbirth and which lead to social exclusion if not treated and repaired).</p>
<p>Just wanted to give them a shout out here, as they do good work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just wanna piggy back off this comment to say also in a lot of poor countries, children will help you with money. They will help with work, get their own jobs, help support the family. As countries become more wealthy and the culture shifts, children become an expense rather than a commodity.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the best explanation to a westerner. Educated middle income families consider the expense of a child in their family planning and don't really see a child as a potential financial asset in their elder years as western countries have social security safety nets set up for the elderly, not to mention retirement investment accounts such as 401s and other assets and even pensions if anyone still has those. In western cultures it's typically understood the parent will leave something behind for their kids, whereas non western cultures depend on their kids for support in their elder years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Id like to point out that birth rates go down as income levels go up. So as standards of living eventually improve in the 3rd world the birthrate will come to match that of the developed world. </p></div>		</li>
