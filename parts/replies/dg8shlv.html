			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm autistic and have the exact opposite of this issue. I'm extremely aware of my surroundings all the time. And on the rare occasion that I do stim, it's either as a calming action or to help focus better, but I wrote a more detailed version of that below.</p>
<p>Anyway, for me, my skin is ridiculously sensitive to touch, annoyingly so. The amount of pressure applied to my skin is a major factor. Light pressure and things barely or gently touching me is pure, uncomfortable, itchy hell. To the point of it being capable of causing anxiety attacks. So blankets or quilts with any weight to them are the only things that don't make me want to claw my skin off when I'm trying to sleep. So it's not so much about spatial awareness as it is about needing pressure applied within a certain threshold in order to be comfortable. At least in my case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this, there is research that suggests that persons experiencing autism have a malfunction of the inner ear which contributes to the deficits in spacial awareness. This is thought, by some, to be the reason swinging/rocking can be calming as it would provide the same feedback you were addressing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with this theory. I have high functioning autism and an acutely aware of my surroundings and my position in space.</p>
<p>It has been described as having hightend senses, but I think it's just that most people are able to tune out and ignore most sensory input, and I can't.</p>
<p>When I'm in a stressful environment (usually caused by over stimulus) I create ordered sensory input as a way to override the other input. Think of it like punching yourself in the arm; you don't notice the pain in your foot for a while.</p>
<p>I would love to say more, but I have difficulty communicating. I'll try to answer questions, it just might take a while.</p></div>		</li>
