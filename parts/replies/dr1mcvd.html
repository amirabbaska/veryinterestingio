			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, in livestock situations the current thinking is that the blood frenzy killing is mostly due to it just being too easy for these predators to kill all the chickens/sheep/whatever. There is no equivalent situation in the natural world for them where they have such an easy time.  They are dialed up to slaughter what they can when they can. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suprised I had to go down as far to find foxes - but it's mainly the vixens.  A fox will kill one or two chickens for food, but a vixen will turn a chicken coop into some kind of bloodbath worthy of a horror film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and you can tell when it's a dog that's gone on a killing spree in the chicken coop. Every chicken will be dead. Hate to break it to ya, but I'm thinking ol' dogo is the sleeper in this thread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Had a lynx do the same thing.  He broke into the chicken coop, killed all my sitting hens, piled them in a corner, then ate at least two.  Got so bloated from doing so, he was unable to get out the way he'd come in. </p>
<p>All my hens were already dead, so I just opened the gate and let the big guy out of the coop.  <em>Very</em> gingerly, I might add. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Were you done with Hen farming for good or something? Would seem like either killing it, or capturing and sending it far away would be kind of necessary to keep the guy from constantly repeating the same trick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Foxes will get in and kill many chickens.  They just don't take all of them.  It's hard to say if they plan on returning to get them but in the meantime the owner has found them, or if the fox didn't plan on returning at all, but they will kill every chicken in the coop if they can.</p></div>		</li>
