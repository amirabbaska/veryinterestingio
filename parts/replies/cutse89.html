<p>Reuters (fd: I work for Thomson Reuters, though not in the the Reuters arm) presents a lot of long form articles that other media organizations can pull a short sound bite or more pointed written piece from. This is often easier to digest than a detail heavy report and your local CBS/NBC/FOX affiliate also has a lot of news to cram into 30 or 60 minutes which is where the majority of people get their news. </p></div>		</li>
