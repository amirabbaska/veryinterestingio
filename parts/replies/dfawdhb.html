			<div class="markdown"><p>Are you two talking about the same thing? If I understand /u/RobusEtCeleritas correctly, he is saying that under a certain energy the two particles will &quot;bounce off of each other&quot; unless tunnelling happens. </p>
<p>On the other hand I think that you are talking of the possibility for two particles to go through each other, without neither colliding or bouncing, thanks to quantum tunnelling. </p>
<p>Am I understanding the two of you correctly or is this nonsense?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're understanding me correctly, and you're also understanding <em>my understanding</em> of OP correctly, but these are really just the same thing. &quot;Going through each other&quot; is just scattering at low impact parameter with a scattering angle of zero degrees. This is entirely possible, as we're talking about quantum mechanical waves rather than billiard balls.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds almost like how a computer handles collision detection.  If two objects in a simulation travel towards each other fast enough, they will clip through each other without registering a collision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the energy window where fusion reactions mostly occur in stars. You get it by taking the convolution of the probability of tunneling with the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for kinetic energies of nuclei in the star.</p></div>		</li>
