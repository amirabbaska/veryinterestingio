			<div class="markdown"><p>The good news is, about half of the oxygen in the world is produced in the oceans by phytoplankton and algae species, not trees.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the oceans are also dying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Supply and demand. If there is a demand for the wood, someone will supply it. If there is a demand for the products produced by the farms made possible by clearcutting tracts of land, then someone will supply it. Telling Brazil to stop cutting down the rainforest is like telling Saudi Arabia to stop drilling for oil. If you want it to stop, you have to replace the demand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not because of oxygen. Trees don't actually do a whole lot for the global oxygen levels, it's mostly done by algae in the oceans. Still, the rainforest is an important ecosystem worth preserving, just for a whole host of other reasons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The same thing when burning body fat. It was a weird thought for me that when you lose weight, you actually lose it through your breath rather than via excreesion. </p>
<p>Also, plants do the same thing, but in reverse. They take in CO2 from the air and expel O2. The carbon atoms that is left over are what the structure of the plant is made of. I always assumed that plants were made of something from the dirt, but turns out they mostly only need roots and such for water and for trace minerals. </p></div>		</li>
