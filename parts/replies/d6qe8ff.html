			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a common misunderstanding that comes from confusing pigments and wavelengths on the electromagnetic spectrum. The mixing of pigments will not result in the same colors as the mixing of light. You have to remember how light works, and how pigments work. A blue pigment is blue because it absorbs all light that is not blue. It only reflects the blue light. So, throwing a mess of pigments together results in dark brown or black because it is absorbing almost all of the light hitting it, not reflecting any one color substantially more than the others. However, light doesn't work that way. Mixing many different colors of light together results in white light. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>drives me nuts how all thru gradeschool they kept telling you the primary colors are &quot;red yellow and blue&quot; which is really just a bastardization of cyan magenta yellow.   They really need to separate luminal primary from pigment primary</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's closer to white than it is to brown. Really it's <em>creme white</em> or <em>light beige</em> in tone. </p>
<p>Edit: So really what I'm getting at is that it's too light to be brown and too dark to be white, but still probably closer to white. </p></div>		</li>
