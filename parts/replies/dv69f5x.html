			<div class="markdown"><p>I was actually at a consumer level recycling depot yesterday and they had machines that you just insert the can or bottle into a slot and it detects what it is and takes it to the back where it sorts it into different bins. Apparently the only facility like this in quite a large area and itâ€™s a bit of a research project for the company but it looks fucking cool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ROI is quite good as the labour costs involved in manual sorting are quite high.  Aside from the speed gains, there's a high burnout rate for labourers which means a lot of administrative overhead to deal with the turn over.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know, but there are a bunch of plants that use their system. They are all in high-wage countries (the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the USA, Japan, Finland, Australia and France), but I don't see a way of telling whether there are countries where low-wage workers end up being cheaper.</p>
<p>In their page on the US plant they mention as one of the advantages a reduction in labour costs and their page on the Dutch plant mentions reduced dependence on sorting personnel.</p></div>		</li>
