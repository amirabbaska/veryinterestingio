<p>1) Media incompetence</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you chose the wrong word here. This presumes the people recruited to work at these media companies are idiots when I don't believe they are. They are <em>choosing</em> to offer the version of the news they are. For the  majority, maximum profit is the end goal. The problem is that shit news delivers maximum profit because more people watch shit news than real news. </p>
<p>Let's say there are 3 news sources and each person only watches one. The first station says conservatives are right and liberals are wrong, the second says liberals are right and conservatives wrong, and the third objectively reports when liberals are wrong and when conservatives are wrong. A majority of people will pick one of the first two.</p>
<p>The people that seek out truth and information believe everyone wants truth and information but some just don't have the time or effort to search for it... so we assume that if it's handed to them on the news or facebook/twitter, they'll want it. But it takes effort to consume news that contradicts your opinions and views. For some people it takes a lot of effort. Some people will always choose the path of least resistance. </p>
<p>The media is just giving those people what they want because they get what they want in return. If truthful quality information were profitable, every news company would be fighting to be the most accurate. I'm sure you know people among your own family and friends that refuse to acknowledge reality even if you deliver it directly to their inbox in easy to consume form. </p>
<p>I honestly don't know if I entirely blame these media companies. Giving the majority of the consumers what they want is not wrong in and of itself. The only way to make people want accurate news even when it conflicts with their opinions is to not have the other kind of news available. Pretty hard to justify saying Fox or MSNBC are not allowed to say and do the things they do if we want to tout freedom of speech.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I wonder if you could ELI5 these (in like one line each). I know a bit about the first one and nothing about the rest.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Dozinger, an American lawyer, sued Chevron on behalf of Ecuador for polluting their rain forest, won, and was awarded $8.6B in damages. Chevron admits to polluting the rain forest, but appealed arguing that $8.6B was too much and there had been bribes and shit to the Ecuadorian judge to get such a high ruling. US district court ruled in favor of Chevron and blocked the fine. That's where we're at now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bit more complicated than that.</p>
<p>Years ago, Texaco polluted the rainforest a bunch. Then Ecuador nationalized the oil industry. But, they made Texaco pay a bunch of money to clean it up first. They did, then the Ecuadorian government said &quot;good enough, cya.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, the Ecuadorian national oil company kept pumping there and polluted it again.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, Chevron bought Texaco.</p>
<p>Ecuador figures, &quot;we can get a bunch of money from them&quot;</p>
<p>They hire a lawyer who does a bunch of shady stuff including bribing judges, and comes up with a ruling with a really large fine.</p>
<p>Chevron, having never had any operations in Ecuador, and knowing full well that Texaco had cleaned up the site to the satisfaction of the government at the time did not owe anything, sued them back. The US government said, yep, this trial wasn't fair. We're not going to collect from them for you. If you want it, you have to give them a fair trial.</p>
<p>This is important because, as Chevron doesn't have any assets in Ecuador, Ecuador can't actually take anything from them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aleppo: Aleppo is the largest city in Syria, and for about 4 years now, has been in the midst of a protracted fight. You can read more <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/city/aleppo.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Automation: I'm assuming he's talking about robots replacing human workers? Kinda vague. </p>
<p>Berta Caceres: Berta is an Honduran environmental activist who was murdered. Honduras has a sketchy record with environmental activists, and many of these crimes go unreported or just aren't investigated. The Honduran government has special interests. </p>
<p>Crimea Peninsula: Russia illegally annexed Crimea. </p>
<p>John Ashe: An Antiguan diplomat who died a few months back after suffocating from dropping a barbell on his throat while bench pressing. Now, many people believe he was somehow murdered by an affiliate of Hillary Clinton, but that is patently false. He was not even going to testify against her. He had begun pre-trial proceedings for his corruption trial. Read more <a href="http://www.snopes.com/un-official-john-ashe-killed-the-day-before-he-was-to-testify-against-hillary-clinton/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>As for the Scotland Estates, I have no idea what he/she is talking about. It could be Trump-related, or they could just be trying to make the list a little longer. I couldn't find anything on Google. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post.</p>
<p>The media panders so much to the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>Presidential elections have come down to who squabbles better than the other and what smears don't stick as much and is generally all about the people not the politics.</p>
<p>It's celebrity culture that has led to this IMO.</p>
<p>Look how many are voting for Hilary just because she's a woman and the amount who side with her just to have anyone but neo-antichrist (impression fuelled by bias media) Trump win. The amount of people voting for Hilary because of her policies is IMO likely a lot less than those voting for her for the above two reasons and that's a problem since leaders should be elected not because heir the lesser of two evils or because they look a certain way but because of what they plan to do in the role for the betterment of the country</p></div>		</li>
