			<div class="markdown"><p>Mythbusters got 11 times by using a football-field sized piece of paper and a steamroller, Britney got 12 using a ~1.2km long piece of toilet paper. Some students in about 2012 did 13 by doing essentially the same thing, just with more toilet paper. I guess someone could do more if they were willing to get even more paper, but I think the exercise has already become pointless</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suffice to say that even if your paper was the size of the solar system, you would still end up with a stack of single atoms before long. You'd have to split them to keep folding it, and you still wouldn't be close to done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quickly taking u/soulreaverdan 's calculations, he came up with 5,250, 000,000,000 pieces of paper required to have enough atoms to go across the width of the observable universe. </p>
<p>With a standard a4 paper size with an area of 0.6237m^2, that gives us a total paper area of 3.27*10^11 m^2. </p>
<p>For reference, that's a paper roughly the size of Norway, if you can somehow manage to fold it so perfectly that the paper becomes a single atom thick.</p>
<p>Edit: not molecules, atoms. No idea how you'd fold a paper so hard you'd split up it's molecules to individual atoms! </p></div>		</li>
