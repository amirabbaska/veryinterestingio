			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, it’s under a couple miles of rock, so there’s gonna be a lot of pressure.  The issue with this type of volcano is all that dissolved gas in the magma, and that’s not going anywhere, either.</p>
<p>Just like how soda will happily stay in the bottle if you leave it alone, so will the magma.  It’s full of dissolved gas all the way down, so the only theoretical answer is to suck enough heat out of the thin layer of rock on top that it “freezes” another layer of magma below into rock, and then repeat that until you’ve got “enough” rock, however much that is.  Then, since those new layers of rock are still being heated by the magma below, you’d need to keep refrigerating it to keep the rock solid.  Which we could at least think about doing if this were 60 feet across, but the caldera is 60 MILES across.</p>
<p>Don’t worry, the chances of an eruption anytime relevant to human civilization are pretty small.  It typically erupts every 600,000 to 800,000 years, and it’s been 640,000.  So it’s due about now, where “now” is a 200,000-year-wide window we’re 40,000 years through.  It’s looking extremely likely that we’ll either advance enough technologically to prevent/control/ignore an eruption, or destroy ourselves some other way, long before this is an issue.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is this kind of cyclical (as you imply) or more or less random (as in, no matter how long since the last one, the chance of one in the next 1000 years is always about 1/700)?</p></div>		</li>
