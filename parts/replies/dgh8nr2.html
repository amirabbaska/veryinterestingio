			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the thing I have had a scan to check for appendicitis not sure if they would look for other stuff but that's why I was confused that it took for them to be concerned only because my heart beat was so faint but during one my pregnancies they made it seem normal to have a heart beat like that specifically kept asking if I ran marathons cuz that's a thing  </p></div>		</li>
