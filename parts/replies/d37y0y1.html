			<div class="markdown"><p>The ideal machine to measure such a small change would be a zygo. It uses a laser beam and interferometry to determine the planarity and thickness of optical glass.  I use them to measure optical etalons.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Friend of mine let me take a look at an AFM he was using for one of his grad classes, and while the output was cool, I wouldn't want to mess around with it. He mentioned what a pain in the ass it could be, though I haven't used one myself, so it could just be user error / experience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the glass thats actually wearing, it's the coatings on top and generally SEMs and optical profilometers are used to measure the imperfections. Usually in the nanometer range.</p>
<p>Edit: screwed up micrometer and nanometer</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe, technically. Don't wait for it. Taking off a few atoms, or even a few hundred atoms, is almost meaningless compared to the number of atoms in the window. You'll need a number with 25 places to count them. So that's a difference of at least 22 orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>Edit: You'll likely deposit much more grease on the window than you could ever retrieve in window matter.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Your hand is covered with a lot of substances that are deposited on anything you touch - skin oils, dead skin cells, bacteria, and other matter that you have touched or has landed on your skin.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you look at even a smooth surface at the near atomic level it will appear almost geographic, with peaks and valleys and canyons and ranges. If you rub it hard enough, odds are one of the same features on the surface that is being used as the abrasive  will line up with a corresponding feature and something has got to give, a small part breaks off, and now you have a small sub micron speck of silica atoms lodged between the ridges of a keratinocyte on your finger...or more than likely a keratinocyte from your finger is ripped away and left behind on the glass hanging from one of those little molecular mountains </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Practically, no though.  Especially regarding the finger vs. glass factor of wear... The difference between the hardness of a glass screen and your finger pad is enormous. Couple this with the relative smoothness of glass screens, you have almost nothing to wear against. </p>
<p>You can very easily and crudely test coefficient of friction by rubbing your finger on the screen glass, and then doing the same to a counter surface. Notice how much slower the heat buildup (on glass) is against another visually  smooth surface. Sure there's heat capacity, coatings, yada yada - if you're making those arguments it means you already get the gist. </p></div>		</li>
