			<div class="markdown"><p>we'd be dead due to the immense gamma radiation it would release. it would be powerful enough to override the magnetic bubble our sun protects in from cosmic radiation, and it would be enough to push radiation through the magnetic field.</p>
<p>We would see auroras worldwide, and while I dont think the earth would die right away, long term, very few species would be able to procreate and there would be massive die-offs. anyone who didnt immediately suffer ill effects from gamma radiation poisoning would certainly feel them at some point later with all sorts of cancers eating them alive.</p>
<p>1 light year would result in catastrophic damage to the solar system and cellular division would be completely halted on earth. most people would be dead in a month or two, unless they were in a lead vault, even then, there wouldnt be much left as even seeds (unless protected) would be sterilized by the gamma rays.</p></div>		</li>
