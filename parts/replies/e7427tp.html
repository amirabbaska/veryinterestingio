			<div class="markdown"><p>Emergency services have a dedicated trunk line. All 911 calls are routed through a local exchange and come over analog and overflow either goes on hold or routed to nearby county/city. Analog phone is used because of reliability. So bandwidth isn't an issue as it isn't routed like a traditional business/residential service. </p>
<p>I used to have to occasionally find old calls at the department I worked at. The quality was good but we were also a larger city with a newer system. My guess is the compression some departments use to store recording as everything recorded in that room has to be stored for up to 7 years depending on state and local laws. </p></div>		</li>
