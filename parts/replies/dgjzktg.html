			<div class="markdown"><p>So where do the chemicals go after that? When you release the chemicals from one muscle why do they not attach to the next muscle they find and cause a contraction/knot there?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As OP said, muscle contraction is dictated by a balance of sodium and calcium in the muscle cells. To contract, calcium is let into the cell by a calcium transport channel. To relax, calcium is then pumped out of the cell by separate type of active (consumes energy) transport channel. When a muscle knots, something is stopping the Ca from clearing out. When the knot is released, pressure forces a relaxation reflex which allows the old blood (with the elevated Ca levels) to be forced out and new blood to enter, restoring resting levels of Ca in the muscle fibers. </p>
<p>TLDR: It's carried out by the bloodstream. Other muscles won't then knot as they have to allow the Ca to enter for initial contraction</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How long you hold it can vary. When you first push, pain response will be high but the longer you stay on it the pain reduces which allows you to push deeper/harder. While you hold it, you'll start to feel the tissue soften and the pain response continues to lessen. Depending on the location and the tolerance of the person being treated, you could hold anywhere from a minute or 2, to 5 or more. When I hold them for the longer time, I will probably shift slightly as one spot starts to loosens off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry for jumping in and asking this but I have what feels like a lump almost on my left quad. I had been inactive for a few months and then started working out again. My legs felt tight at the beginning but now they have loosened up and its just that spot and my calves feeling tight. Any idea what might be causing it?</p></div>		</li>
