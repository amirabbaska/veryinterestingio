			<div class="markdown"><p>So there could be other galaxies outside the &quot;walls&quot; if this sphere, we simply could never interact with them? If you were to somehow go 20 billion light years in any given direction- where would you end up? Why can't we observe that far?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can't observe that far because light hasn't had time to reach us yet. If the x signal is 2 light years away, but only started being produced 1 year ago, we have another year before the signal gets to us. Similarly, the stuff is too far away for the light to have reached us yet</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if I'm imagining this correctly- in six billion years, for example, we would hypothetically be able to &quot;see&quot; a 20 billion LY wide universe? And in sixteen billion years, a 30 billion LY wide universe, and so on?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do have some idea, actually. We expect that it would look basically the same on large scales. If there were a dramatic transition, we'd very likely see edge effects near the edge of our observable universe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, at least, it would still be possible to have a finite mass in an infinite universe. You'd just need the density to decrease at a fast enough rate the further out you go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of opinion because we will never ever know for sure as we can't see beyond the edge of the universe created by the finite speed limit. The argument for an infinite universe is understandable since you'd have to argue our position in the universe is special otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't there topological solutions that simultaneously allow the universe to be finite yet not have any special position?</p>
<p>E.g.: Similar to how there is no centre to the surface of a sphere. You walk far enough and end up back where you started.</p></div>		</li>
