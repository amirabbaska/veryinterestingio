			<div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons.  Listeria has been mentioned already.  Potato Salad is notorious for causing food poisoning due to Staphylococcus aureus Enterotoxin.  If the salad isn't prepared with clean hands/utensils, and (especially) if it's not kept refrigerated, Staph bacteria--which are fairly common in the environment but not too dangerous--will have a chance to grow and begin producing the toxin, which is what makes you <em>really</em> sick.  </p>
<p>Salmonella that are pathogenic have evolved such that they become activated to infect the small intestine cells only after they detect the acidity of the stomach.  </p>
<p>Cholera bacteria are killed by stomach acidity, but when infection occurs, enough survive the low acidity, either because of a high initial dose and/or poorly treated drinking water. </p>
<p>Viruses that cause sickness such as norovirus are extremely resistant to low pH and even mildly resistant to bleach, which makes sickness outbreaks on cruise ships even more problematic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to add: The enterotoxin can remain toxic after all staph bacteria are dead. Even well-prepared food that had a lot of staph on it before cooking can still cause trouble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Waste producing bacteria don't <em>infect</em> you at all, since they're not alive. They poison you, there's a big difference. And to answer your question most of it is going to be absorbed in the early gut, in the jejunum, and a bit of it even in the duodenum and through the stomach lining.</p>
<p>Listeria was a poor example though, as that one actually tends to infect you (the toxin gets destroyed in the stomach). Staphylococcus would be a better example!</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>This is poorly phrased, although not outright wrong. <em>Bacteria</em> are alive. <em>viruses</em> are not.</p>
<p>Both of those things can cause infections. The toxins might be what causes the symptoms experienced, but both do cause infections.</p>
<p>Now, in many cases, the toxin is in the food before it is eaten, even thought the bacteria are dead; however, any of those bacteria are capable of causing infections should they be alive.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great comment but I want to clarify that Listeria monocytogenes doesn't produce a toxin. Listeria is actually pretty heat labile , but is highly virulent if it does survive. That's why listeriosis outbreaks are associated with ready to eat foods (cantaloupe, ice cream, packaged lunch meat) where nothing is heated. </p>
<p>Consuming a toxin would be associated with Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, or Clostridium botulinum, among others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, he is incorrect in almost all cases pertaining to Listeria that I'm aware of. Listeria's most common pathogenic route is uptake in the intestines, in which it is able to slice into and rupture cells by altering pH. </p></div>		</li>
