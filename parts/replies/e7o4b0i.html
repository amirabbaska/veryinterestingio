<p>Bear in mind most modern &quot;anti-tank&quot; projectiles use kinetic energy, explosive-based projectiles like HEAT and HESH are more often used against softer skinned vehicles, structures, or infantry. Some countries, like the U.S. even fire canister shot. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. When trying to punch through heavy armor, an explosion isn’t typically what you want. Instead, it’s often better to have a hardened round moving at a much higher speed. Rather than trying to knock the armor around with an explosion, you just punch straight through with enough force that the armor can’t spread out the impact enough to prevent penetration.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>APFSDS rounds are great because they aren’t defeated by anything on the tank other than the thickness of its armour and the angle at which it strikes, keep in mind, they can go through 600mm thick steel at least. HESH and HEAT rounds are defeated by reactive armour and the wire cages you see on vehicles. However, if one manages to connect with the side of a tank where that defence isn’t present, it’s most likely going to penetrate and someone’s dying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HEAT rounds are still used against tanks. They are defeated by reactive armor which is common on current tanks though. You'd never use HEAT against infantry. It would be very ineffective except at very close range. And it's not very effective against structures either.</p>
<p>HESH is defeated by spall liners which pretty much every tank has now. Effective against structures though. Not effective against infantry except at very close range.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call either round &quot;explosive-based&quot; since their final mechanism of action isn't an explosion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HEAT is mainly still handy for not needing any velocity to function. The same HEAT payload works exactly the same whether it's fired out of a tank cannon at supersonic speed or simply glued to the target. That's why we still use it in various kinds of missile carried by light vehicles and infantry-carried weapons (including bombs and man portable launchers like LAWs, RPGs, and Javelins) - no matter how fast it's moving, it works just as well.</p>
<p>HESH does need velocity, which is why it's only used by tanks, and most modern tanks are loaded up with regular kinetic penetrators instead.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>They are preferably not used against modern tanks. Besides reactive armor (which can be countered by tandem charge warheads) HEAT warheads are more vulnerable to close-in-weapon systems and almost all composite armor has excellent resistance to HEAT. Many countries use dual-purpose HEAT warheads in place of HE or canister, and these are effective against infantry. I included structures in reference to HESH. It is not as effective against infantry as HE but it's a still a large explosive charge and thus effective against infantry. </p>
<p>Finally both rounds are &quot;explosive-based&quot; because their terminal effects requires an explosive in their warhead to detonate. We don't say &quot;HE isn't explosive-based because most aren't killed by explosion but the fragmentation.&quot; </p></div>		</li>
