			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, uhh, you had me goin’ there for the first part, but the second half kinda threw me. </p>
<p>It’s definitely true that some questions asked on this sub can quickly be googled, and the answers to them are relatively straightforward/easy to understand. </p>
<p>However, the flip side of the coin are the posts asking about legitimately complex and/or obscure things that laypeople would have a hard time figuring out unless they spent a bunch of time and effort on it. One of the all-time top posts about gluten intolerance is a great example. </p>
<p>This sub is not just about answers, and it’s not just about discussion. It’s about explanations, oftentimes coming from experts in various fields, that act as a sort of fast-pass to little bits of enlightenment. Google can obviously provide the <em>information</em>, but not always the <em>understanding</em>, which is what most folks are actually seeking. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I try to keep that in mind whenever anyone asks me a really simple question.</p></div>		</li>
