			<div class="markdown"><p>The sound waves travel through the cold air; when they encounter the hot air, this represents a change of medium, and the waves may change direction, that is, they may be refracted and reflected, allowing them to go back into the cold air and continue traveling. This process (series of reflections) may continue until the energy is completely dissipated; then the sound just dies out.</p>
<p>By the way, in your title the correct spelling is &quot;<strong>affect</strong> the distance&quot;. Usually you need to use &quot;affect&quot; when it's the verb, and &quot;effect&quot; when talking about the noun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's similar to a ray of light refracting when it enters glass.  When the soundwave travels,  and it hits a layer of air with a different temperature(and thus different properties) , it changes direction,  sometimes it bounces back,  going back and forth between the ground and the second layer of air.<br />
This also happens to light,  that's the explanation for mirages.  The different air layers &quot;bend&quot; the light,  and you see an illusion. </p></div>		</li>
