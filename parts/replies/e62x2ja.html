<p>Think of it more like both copies of the gene producing their own proteins in varying quantities and the resulting combination of proteins produces a trait.  In the case of a simple dominant-recessive trait, that could mean something like having an allele that makes a black pigment and an allele that produces no colored pigment, but there's enough black pigment made that the organism's body ends up looking black.  In that case, the black trait is dominant but both copies of the gene are still functioning.</p>

<p>Wow! I never understood that this was the mechanism. Such a clear explanation. Thankyou for sharing!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference between &quot;dominant&quot; and &quot;recessive&quot; alleles is actually super intuitive because it always works like this. Basically, if a particular allele results in a gain of function like producing black pigment or increasing the expression of another gene, it's going to be dominant because you only need one copy to start seeing the effect. However, if it's a loss of function, such that it stops producing the pigment or stimulating the other gene, just having one allele isn't enough, because the other one is still fulfilling that function. This would be a recessive allele, because you would only see the effect of it if both copies of the gene had this mutation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that in reality not all cells in the body have the same exact DNA due to mutations. Research has actually shown that all of your brain cells have unique genomes.</p>
<p>&quot;many types of mutations occur and accumulate during normal brain development, 'such that every cell in a person's brain, in fact, has a unique genome,' said Evrony, who obtained his M.D. and Ph.D. from Harvard Medical School&quot;

			<div class="markdown"><p>At the ELI5 level, though, every cell has the same genome. The mutations and genomic changes that your link is talking about are very small -- a few thousand mutations per cell out of the 3 billion basepairs in the genome. It's not unimportant, it's just that to a first approximation, every cell has the same DNA. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may also worth noting that splicing can occur. That even tho the cell has the same set of DNA it can produce different proteins. That happens by cutting out parts of the RNA that is created from the DNA template. The cutting is fone by proteins that are specific to the cell-type/place in the body</p></div>		</li>
