			<p>This completely ignores the underlying issue.  Since 1970, real wages have actually decreased in the US.  Automobile prices have increased greater than the rate of inflation.  House prices have increased at a rate FAR greater than the rate of inflation.  This means that when adjusting for inflation, big ticket items like houses and automobiles have gotten more expensive and wages have decreased.  Throw in the recession and the increased cost of education, and you have the &quot;poorer generation&quot; answer pretty well understood.<br><br>Discussing the underlying cause of the real wage problem is more difficult.  I would suggest that the increased cost of healthcare (along with the increase in employer health benefits) and the decrease in the manufacturing economy are some of the primary contributors.</p>		</li>
