			<div class="markdown"><p>So all photons are in every place they will ever be at the same moment in time? or rather, they just exist in all the locations they will ever be found as far as they are concerned, as there is no time for them?  So whats happening when we see them apparently move through time?  And how can they move, if they have no time - but.. cause-and effect are a thing, so they must have been there&lt;- before they were here -&gt;?</p>
<p>Or is it just us, we move around them, but 'around' them in this case is 'forward through time' and that gives us  different 'perspective' on the shape they all form through space ?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No it just means that from the point of view of the photon it gets absorbed at its destination the moment it's created, because something moving at light speed does not expierence any time.</p>
<p>We see them moving though time because we're moving at very low speeds.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>

<p>WRT us, photons are moving at speed of light so they don't experience any time. I agree. But WRT photons, we are moving at speed of light, so are we not experiencing time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I was explained it was that space and time are the same, so if you travel more through space, that is, more through space relative to time, you are travelling less through time. If you travel at 100% through space relative to time (light speed) you are travelling 0% through time, relative to your self.</p></div>		</li>

<p>By Theoretically I hope you mean in the scientific sense meaning supported by volumes of emperical evidence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a conclusion based on our understanding of relativity. As long as our understanding of relativity is correct, the conclusion is correct. In other words it's reliant on the theory of relativity which is backed up by volumes of evidence.</p>
<p>More specifically you can see the result by plugging the numbers into the <a href="http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/HEP/QuarkNet/time.html" target="_blank">Lorentz time dilation equation</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to think about this</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since time is always observed in relation to the speed of light, if you are traveling at the speed of light, no time ever passes (theoretically)</p>

<p>Are you a physicist? Is there a /r/AskPhysicists ? I want one.</p>
