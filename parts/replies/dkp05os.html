			<div class="markdown"><p>Without looking this up for reference, there is a decay chain where radon gas decays by alpha emission twice, ending up at lead-214 and bismuth- 214, which will decay by beta emission. Radon gas comes from the decay of thorium which the earth's crust is loaded with. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, Thorium's half-life is roughly 14 billion years.  So this isn't a decay chain whose principle source will become exhausted. </p>
<p>Whatever the rate of Helium production from current thorium is across the Earth - in a <em>billion</em> years it will still be producing Helium at 95% of the current rate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are four decay chains that have beta-decaying isotopes in addition to alpha-decaying isotopes. I only simplified to explain how helium is created through radioactivity, in case the OP thought we were continually using up the helium that remained from the creation of the earth or universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually never thought about constant production from radioactive decay. Nice thinking. It's not like I deal with this stuff every day or anything. </p></div>		</li>
