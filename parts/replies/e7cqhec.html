			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, linearity only gets you to a vector space. Wanting to be able to prove much useful gets you to topological vector spaces, but you're still not at Hilbert spaces. You can still do spectral theory in Banach spaces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youâ€™re right. I should add that completeness is a key ingredient then, indispensable in systems of infinite dimension.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, even including completeness as a requirement still includes Frechet spaces (topological vector spaces which are metrizable, but whose topology may not come from a norm, and which are complete with respect to this metric, e.g. the class of tempered distributions) and Banach spaces. The topology being generated by an inner product is the feature which distinguishes Hilbert spaces from these. </p></div>		</li>
