			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I remember waiting half an hour to download a song, and that was fine. </p>
<p>Now I get frustrated AF if a media-rich page doesn't load and display a fraction of a second after I click a link.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say so. Many past frustrations are gone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spending hours freeing up that last <strong>KB</strong> of conventional memory is long past</li>
<li>So is worrying about having enough RAM at all. At 16GB I've yet to find something I need to do that would need more than that. If that ever happened, I can upgrade to 32GB.</li>
<li>So is waiting for things to download, in general. 56K was waiting for everything. 100Mbps is waiting for very select things. If I download a movie I can download it faster than I can watch it. </li>
<li>Downloads in general are quick and uneventful rather than stressful events where I might end up wasting 3 hours if it fails</li>
<li>The disk isn't slow anymore with SSD</li>
<li>Backups are far easier because I can use the network rather than tons of floppies/CDs/etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I would say the point is that things indeed get better.</p></div>		</li>
