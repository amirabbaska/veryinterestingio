			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between <em>frequency</em> and <em>pitch</em>: frequency is a property of a periodic signal, whereas pitch is a quality humans perceive in sound. They are closely related in that if a person hears a purely periodic signal, generally the higher the frequency the higher the pitch they will perceive, but the two are very different beasts. Most of the sounds you hear that you perceive as having a &quot;pitch&quot; don't even, in the strictest sense, have a well-defined frequency. This is because they aren't actually periodic but rather <em>quasiperiodic</em> - they repeat, but not exactly. This is certainly true of the human voice. Two people can disagree on the pitch of a sound. In fact, pitch cannot even be captured as a simple number of Hertz. One famous demonstration of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepard_tone" target="_blank">Shepard tones</a>, which are a sequence of tones that sound to most human ears as though they are forever increasing in pitch but which actually repeat and therefore stay within the range of hearing (kind of analogous to the Penrose staircase that looks like it's always going up). </p>
<p>Understanding the human perception of pitch, and of sound in general, is the subject of <em>psychoacoustics</em>. Like most things involving the brain it's a field that has more questions than answers. I don't know of any peer reviewed research into OP's specific question, but it is something that fascinates me and I am confident the answer is in the positive: differences in perceived pitch between the self-perceived live singing voice and its external perception through recordings is a genuine, practical problem for at least some singers. The reason I'm so sure is through self-experimentation. I'm aware of the rules against anecdotes in this sub, but I hope explaining a specific experiment that people can try and reproduce themselves is acceptable, in the absence of any peer-reviewed papers on the subject.</p>
<p>I wrote an app for recording and playing back the voice and comparing it to a reference pitch.^* You can achieve the same with any recording apparatus and a well tuned instrument for the reference. I sang through my range slowly, note by note. For each note I played the reference pitch and then sang the note (not at the same time as the reference pitch was sounding) listening carefully for the pitches to match. For each note, I repeated playing and singing as many times as I needed to be certain that the pitches matched exactly. Once I was done, I replayed the recording and listened carefully. For two notes around the middle of my range, F# and G below middle C specifically, my sung note was very clearly flat relative to the reference pitch. I've since repeated the same many times with those particular notes and my results are always the same. The sung and reference pitches sound identical to me in my head, but in the recording I can hear a very clear difference between them. Similarly, I can produce a sound that matches the reference pitch in the recording but in order to do it I have to sing in a way that sounds distinctly sharp to me live. I've since been paying particular attention in the choir when singing those notes and it often does sound like &quot;someone's singing out of tune&quot; at those times. I'm having to come to terms with the fact that that someone is probably me :-)</p>
<p>Why this happens I can only speculate, and this sub isn't for speculation so I won't! All I will say is that pitch perception is perception, and perception is mysterious.</p>
<p>^* I won't name it as I don't want to fall foul of spamming rules and you don't need it to replicate the experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read my other post if you'd like a possible explanation for why the pitch produced by some resonating thing can be different in different locations surrounding it...</p>
<p>tldr, the energy is traveling through some medium before it reaches any given person's ear, and it doesn't necessarily travel through the same mediums. and the pitch can change if there is a change to that medium while the sound is traveling through it (water sloshing in a metal bowl is an example.) in a live singing context, the air pressure between the mouth and the microphone is affected by strenuous vocal effort, while the pitch traveling through the bones of the jaw doesn't experience any such change.</p>
<p>i've experienced this a lot due to yawning while listening to very familiar music. pitches can shift drastically from that.</p></div>		</li>
