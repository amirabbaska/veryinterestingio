			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a note: obfuscating JavaScript is not where the security of ReCaptcha comes from; the security comes from its (ostensible) ability to distinguish human use patterns from programmatic use patterns. So it's not really &quot;Security by Obscurity&quot; in the usual sense. The obfuscation is just intended to raise the cost of analysis, not to be the source of the security in the first place.</p>
<p>Of course in the end captchas will always be a race: the better they get at distinguishing human behavior from programmatic behavior, the better people will get at programming computers to behave like humans, and so they'll have to build a better captcha, and so on. The obfuscation doesn't change this fact, it just tries to slow down this inexorable process as much as it can.</p></div>		</li>
