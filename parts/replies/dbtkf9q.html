			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually I have heard that a &quot;rich person&quot; hangover cure is falling asleep at home with an IV.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/05/got-225-these-guys-say-they-can-cure-your-hangover.html" target="_blank">Here's a CNBC link about it</a></p>
<p>I kinda wanna try it, but at the same time, what the fuck are you doing with your life if you're falling asleep with an IV every night. I wouldn't want to turn into Michael Jackson, ya know?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was in hospital for pneumonia I had a saline drop for 4 nights straight and damn did I wake up refreshed and hydrated it was amazing. So on my last night there I asked for one and the nurse declined but said it was the first time anyone ever requested one. Those things are epic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A guy i know went houseboating, fell off boat drunk and got ran over and the prop cut up his feet. Another boat picked him up had nurses on it and they had ivs for hangovers! They wrapped up his feet, got him to an ambulance. </p>
<p>Would love an iv for hangovers now, drinking heavy only ~5 times a year at 30 is so painful. Worst hangovers ever. Not expecting new years day to be great coming up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually once had a first aid instructor who was a paramedic for a while. He said while he and his buddies were in school and had access to IV's and stuff, they'd get drunk off their asses and then they'd IV each other before they went to sleep. Said they never woke up hungover, but more often than not someone would piss themselves in their sleep</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've described a coma.  Usually the brain atrophies in such cases if the patient is comatose for years, like Terry Schaivo.  If someone doesn't wake from a coma in a few days, they almost always are labeled as being in a persistent vegetative state.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I normally sleep about 6 hours.  But some rare occasions when I get the chance I like to sleep 14-16 hours in a day.   What I have found is dehydration / being feverish is what makes me feel &quot;bad&quot; and wanting to sleep more.   When I wake up during the normal 6-8 hour period and look in a mirror, look normal.  But when I sleep longer than 8 hours, my face will be flushed red, I will feel warm to the touch, and I feel really dehydrated.</p></div>		</li>
