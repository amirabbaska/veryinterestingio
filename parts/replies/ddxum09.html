<p>There is way more Carbon than say Silicon which makes it more LIKELY to be used in a system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While this is true in the universe in general, it's a poor argument for Earth, since we've got about 100 times more silicon than carbon on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon is far from the only element that can form bonds that result in molecules that extend into the 3 dimensions; easy examples nearby C on the periodic table: B, N, Al, Si, P, S can all form molecules that extend into three dimensions</p>
<p>ex: BF4- tetrahedral, NR3 tetrahedral, AlH4- tetrahedral, SiH4 tetrahedral, PO4-2 tetrahedral, SF4 see-saw</p>
<p>&quot;Carbon also has an equal number of &quot;extra&quot; electrons from the next lower electron shell (S1) as it does &quot;missing&quot; electrons from its next higher full electron shell (S2, P2). This means that not only is it incredibly electroneutral, but it can be altered equally to the left and right by bonding it with a more electronegative (which will steal electron density) or electropositive (which will donate electron density) functional group........&quot;</p>
<p>This is true of all elements if you pair them up with the &quot;right&quot; corresponding electronegative/electropositive element. So.....</p>
<p>edit: another way of saying my point about electronegativity is the scale is only in comparison to other elements, C is only electroneutral in comparison to itself, just as N is only electroneutral in comparison to its self. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct, excepting a couple of things.</p>
<p>I stated that carbon was the smallest, and thus the most abundant element that extended in 3 dimensions. Its a wombo combo of the two effects at once. Boron of course would be the exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Maybe I should have talked more about Boron and Silicon having... odd bonding patterns, and their semi-metal nature? That would have made a bit more exclusivity and possibly answered the question better.</p>
<p>I think you misinterpreted my statement of electronegativity. My point was that with regards to its outer shell conformation, it has a sort of inate fluidity of electronegativity. It's shell conformation wants as many more electrons as it wants less.</p>
<p>Obviously this isn't entirely true. The nucleus is going to exert more pressure to acquire more electrons via sharing (and thus conforming more to an sp orbital system) than it is to just completely losing an electron. But in it's normal environment, carbon can easily adopt both partial negative and partial positive charges.</p>
<p>But yeah everything you said is completely correct.</p>
<p>But I think we are on the same page of the same book, just reading it in different languages.</p></div>		</li>
