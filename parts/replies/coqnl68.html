			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the insight regarding sulfur etc.
What are your thoughts on Seafoam detergeant?
I drive an iron block turbo Volvo. 190k and the factory boost setting is a measly 5psi. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, I bet you haven't replaced a single head gasket yet!</p>
<p>I did some reading about it, and aside from amateur videos and advertisements I couldn't find anything about Seafoam that told me what it used to do what against what.  In chemical terms, what is a catalyst for what.</p>
<p>As a dealership we stay away from recommending additives to users:  most every problem that a driver will encounter can be remedied by adhering to the proper oil change intervals.  Your engine oil has a TON of engineering placed into it, with detergents, emulsifiers, acidic neutralizers, and much more, designed to prevent the sorts of problems that Seafoam is advertising it fixes.</p>
<p>If you think your head gasket can handle it see if you can find an old mechanic around who doesn't mind rigging up your sensors to up your boost.  The two you need to adjust are the turbo compressor intake temperature sensor and the fuel temperature sensor, if I remember correctly (doesn't work on the newer Cummins is why I am not sure any longer).  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually did the head gasket a year ago, also had the head surface missed and the valves adjusted.</p>
<p>I'm planning on putting a nicer intercooler in and turning up the boost! All I need to do is truck the waste hate actuator into thinking that the boost is lower than it is. It's a $30 part that is installed in the vacuum hose to the waste gate actuator.</p>
<p>I want a Cummins 4BT for Christmas...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget to add 'with proper maintenance/frequent oil change intervals'. Because if you get any dirt in these new engines con rod bearings you are in big trouble: the bearings are not nearly as soft as they were in the old engines like the N14 for instance. No imbedability whatsoever.   On top of that, with exhaust gas recirculation levels being increased we are seeing a lot more carbon packed pistons and polished/lobed liners, and also dirtier oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Us diesel is 15 ppm vs. European 10 ppm standard. Unless you count germany which only gets down to 6-9 ppm because of taxes.  Not really that much difference in us vs european sulfer levels. Increases soot in the oil comes from egr systems, which many engine manufacturers have gone away grom in favor of DEF. And cj4 is for a new standard oil, not that big of a deal. Just better oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that the CJ4 oil is low ash oil. Ash was used in CI4 oils to combat or neutralize acidity caused by the high sulphur fuel/combustion products that slipped past the rings and ended up in the pan.  </p>
<p>Soot in the EGR system is just unburned fuel and particulate matter. EGR will continue to play a large part in reducing emissions until they can really improve the DEF system like you say. EGR is used to reduce sky rocketing combustion chamber temperatures caused by two or more flame fronts colliding, which in turn reduces the NOX generated.  </p></div>		</li>
