			<div class="markdown"><p>So if you put a phone that was connected to wifi into a waterproof case and fully submerged it into water it won't connect? Also, is this just for water or other liquids as well? I assume liquids with different properties would change the result. </p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://www.vias.org/wirelessnetw/wndw_04_07_02.html" target="_blank">That's a myth</a>. Water operates at the frequency imposed upon it, which in the case of a microwave might be ~2.4ghz. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we're talking about free electrons stopping/weakening the signal, does that mean  de-ionized water would weaken the signal no more than, say, a piece of glass (assuming no free electrons there)?</p>
<p>I understand that isn't really applicable in real life scenario because water always has impurities in it</p></div>		</li>
