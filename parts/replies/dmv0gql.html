			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Herbs from hot, dry climates (rosemary, thyme, oregano) are loaded with defensive volatile oils. These herbs keep well, and their leaves have a waxy coating to prevent desiccation that enhances their keeping qualities.</p>
<p>Flimsier-leaved herbs that don't have to fight drought so hard lose their volatile oils very quickly (parsley, basil, tarragon, etc.)</p>
<p>Dried cilantro shouldn't even exist, you're basically sprinkling ashes into your food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so it's better to dry flimsier herbs since it helps to preserve them?
Btw,speaking of volatile oils,does that mean that they lose their smell quickly too?</p></div>		</li>

<p>I guess that explains why that restaurant-size container of dried parsley I have in my cupboard is only good for giving dishes visual appeal, because I sure can't taste it in anything.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note that that does not work with all herbs. Some herbs lose potency in the drying process because some of the flavor molecules evaporate away or denature.</p>
<p>Cilantro is an example of a herb that is pretty useless dried.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no. Different herbs are going to contain different amounts of water. Basil contains a lot of water and there's a significant flavor difference between dry and fresh basil. Rosemary does not contain a lot of water, and you can generally use rosemary dried or fresh on a one to one basis (by leaf, not by weight). In all cases of fresh herbs, you can greatly increase the flavor by mechanically breaking them down, either by finely chopping/mincing of muddling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So essentially, a dried herb isn't a watered-down herb.  Just like if drink a shot of whiskey with no water it's going to be stronger than if you put a little bit of water in it.</p></div>		</li>
