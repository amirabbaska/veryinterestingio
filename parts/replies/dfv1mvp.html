			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. The quote I posted comes from a pdf on <a href="https://emfscientist.org/" target="_blank">https://emfscientist.org/</a>, which was promoted in a small conference organised by the Medical Association of Athens(Greece). The conference program included subjects such as the effects of EM to people with Electromagnetic Hypersensitivity... I am truly scared by what I am reading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly enough I got caught up in an EHS &quot;debate&quot; today based on the Cress/WiFi experiment in Denmark. The world health organization has a useful primer on <a href="http://www.who.int/peh-emf/about/WhatisEMF/en/" target="_blank">EM-radiation and EHS</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They also have <a href="http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs296/en/" target="_blank">this amazing article</a>, from which you can use this amazing quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The symptoms are certainly real and can vary widely in their severity. Whatever its cause, EHS can be a disabling problem for the affected individual. EHS has no clear diagnostic criteria and <strong>there is no scientific basis to link EHS symptoms to EMF exposure.</strong></p>

<p>People who claim EHS really do need to be in the care of a good doctor. More correctly, a good psychiatrist. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slow down there. Depending on the band it can be both correct and incorrect. The sun's radio waves are magnitudes weaker than human standards, else radio's would be jammed by day (like IR <em>is</em> jammed by day).</p>
<p>The quote is broad and mostly wrong, but OP is specifically asking about RF.</p></div>		</li>
