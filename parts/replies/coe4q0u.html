			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you pull a punch on what is the truth?</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it was the very hard and diligent work of a few people who just happened to be slaves. They really liked ice cream.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could easily skirt the issue by saying &quot;through agricultural advancements&quot; or but just saying it was &quot;labor-intensive&quot;</p>
<p>A component of teaching history is being able to articulate truth though story. It's like how when we refer to Native American cultures, we call their religions &quot;myths&quot; as if it goes without saying that their beliefs are false. Yet we would never say that about the puritans who fled to America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can write a good article about the history of the colouration of vanilla while intentionally omitting unseemly details about how it was harvested. NPR just favours the honesty and good history over avoiding discomfort.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The article goes into this whole slavery thing but never fully answers it's original question. Why do we see vanilla as white?</p>
<p>If the early line about it being a common flavor is, in fact, the answer, the rest of the article is totally irrelevant and just a vehicle for the author to rant about racism in history. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree the article did a poor job of actually answering the question in the title of the article, if you're going to talk about the history of any New World spice, slavery is going to come up at some point. It's unavoidable, and the article didn't seem to stress that point much more than it had to. It only mentions slavery in two paragraphs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I thought natural vanilla didn't hold up very well to drastic temperature changes and artificial vanilla extract was actually preferable for a finished product because the aroma comes through properly.. </p>
<p>This is when compared to using beans vs extract. Everything I ever looked at said the flavour from the actual beans breaks down easily when cooked. So maybe it's white because it's made with extract primarily?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've never heard of that, though I wouldn't be surprised. Vanillin itself was isolated in the late 1800s, so I imagine the whiteness of vanilla-flavored foods was already pretty established in the Western world before its introduction and heavy use. </p></div>		</li>
