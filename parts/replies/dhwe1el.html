			<div class="markdown"><p>Broccoli used to be much more bitter in the past, but I think newer cultivars are less so, brussels sprouts are though, at least the bottom and the hearts. This can be mitigated through cooking process and seasoning. But yes, they tend to be bitter. Bitter vegetables is the primary reason we have the concept of kids who hate vegetables.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That, and overcooked brussels sprouts and broccoli emit a very foul odor. I love broccoli, but if I accidentally cook frozen broccoli in the microwave too long, I wouldn't even force my dog to eat such a thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just a little bit.</p>
<p>You can cook the bitter out of broccoli if you throw it in boiling water (with some chicken soup bouillon added for taste) for 3-4 min. Cook more than that and the broccoli loses its crunch.</p>
<p>Also to some kids broccoli has a weird taste to it - like how some people taste soap when they have cilantro. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also never thought of broccoli as bitter. I've loved them my whole life (while things like coffee and hoppy beer took significant warming up to). Well, there seems to be a genetic component to whether we can taste the bitter compounds in broccoli and brussel sprouts (<a href="https://gimletmedia.com/episode/6-broccoli/" target="_blank">and more generally vegetables in the Brassica genus</a>).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Brussels sprouts taste absolute bitter but broccoli doesn't taste bitter to me. Neither cooked nor fresh.</p>
<p>I do believe broccoli commonly sold in Germany does not taste bitter at all since I've never heard about someone IRL saying it tasted bitter. I only hear about that on here.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically your taste buds, especially the ones which taste bitterness become less effective as you age.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point that taste buds decrease in effectiveness is true, but that doesn't mean that you'll automatically like beer.</p>
<p>Personally, I think beet tastes weird, and I'm not going to drink it, where there are other choices of beverages that are better tasting. </p></div>		</li>
