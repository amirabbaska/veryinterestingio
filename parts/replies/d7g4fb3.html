<p>Centripetal force  = ( mass * velocity^2 ) / radius</p>
<p>So the force is inversely proportional to the radius.  But you want to know about angular velocity.  Well, say you have a 1kg mass at 1m/s at a radius of 1m.</p>
<p><code>Fc = (1kg * (1m/s)^2 ) / 1m = 1N</code></p>
<p>To keep the same force at a shorter radius, make Fc a constant and look at velocity.</p>
<p><code>1N = (1kg * ( V ) ^2 ) / 0.5 m</code>
<code>V^2 = 0.5 (m/s)^2</code>
<code>V = sqrt(0.5) = .7m/s</code> roughly.</p>
<p>In the first case, you were travelling 1 meter of arc per second, and now 0.7.  Going slower, right?</p>
<p><code>ArcLength = r * theta</code>, so <code>theta = ArcLength / r</code>.</p>
<p>In the first case, you needed to rotate by 1 radian per second to achieve the 1N force.</p>
<p>In the second case:</p>
<p><code>theta = 0.7 / 0.5 = 1.4</code></p>
<p>By decreasing the radius, the angular velocity increases to maintain the same force.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Yes, a smaller ring turns at a faster angular rate to achieve the same force.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, much more simply, we could substitute angular velocity * radius for tangential velocity. This yields</p>
<pre><code>F = m * w^2 * r  </code></pre>
<p>where <em>F</em> is centripetal force, <em>m</em> is mass, <em>w</em> is angular velocity, and <em>r</em> is radius</p>
<p>From this we can see that in order to maintain a constant force, we must increase the angular velocity if we decrease the radius.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side-question: At what distance from the surface of a Halo ring would I start to feel the effects of it's spin on me if I were approaching from the center? It has an atmosphere, would that be enough to catch me and pull me to the surface, or could I hang indefinitely, suspended while it spun beneath me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Being outside of the atmosphere, the Halo's rotation would basically have no effect on you, only it's mass's attraction would make you travel towards it. But as soon as you'd get in contact with it's air, friction would take care of you and you'd start following the rotation, to then progressively get pushed by the centrifugal force.</p></div>		</li>
