			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I know, there is one species of penguin that throws itself off of a cliff in order to die. I don't know the rest.</p>
<p>There are also some species of birds that stop eatting altogether and others that throw themselves into the river below their hanging nests.</p></div>		</li>
