<a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/bYy5pOa" target="_blank">Chipmunks</a> and <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/Xc1QTk8" target="_blank">mice</a> are really both pretty cute animals, but since mice like to live in our homes, many find them disgusting.</p>

I mean cockroaches <em>do</em> infest unclean places but they also can thrive in basically any environment so it probably has little to do with where they actually live (anywhere) and instead more focused on where they're perceived to live (dirty places) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We moved into a house and a few months later there were cockroaches. We were mortified because they are associated with being dirty and messy. We weren't and couldn't figure out where they were coming from. Turns out it was the area environmentally that was the problem. </p></div>		</li>
