			<div class="markdown"><p>So, visible light passes through water, strongly enough that we can easily detect it, and gently enough that it doesn't burn our eyes out.</p>
<p>From your explanation it does seem like other waves on the spectrum are too harmful / useless, but evolution is so incredible that I wonder what eyes / light sensory organs could achieve in less optimal environments...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be possible to use the destructive properties of high UV to create an optic sensor that relies on the destruction of molecules to detect its presence. The destroyed molecule has different chemical properties from the intact molecule. The problem here is that you would either have to rebuild the molecule in place or bring in a replacement molecule. This will result in a slower response time than the way our eyes work now. It would also require more energy to maintain than a passive molecule.</p></div>		</li>
