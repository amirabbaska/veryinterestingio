<p>I understand that 0!=1 but that explanation leaves me confused. </p>
<p>0.5! is less than 1 (0.8862...), so there's less than one way to organize 1/2 object. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Non-integer factorials don't exist.</p>
<p>They invented an extension called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function" target="_blank">Gamma Function</a> but as another poster said, that doesn't mean anything combinatorially.   But interestingly, this extension does hold for the OP's question.   0! = Gamma(1) = 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about this explanation. I would respond to the question &quot;how many ways to organize 0 objects&quot; as that there are no ways to organize 0 objects, therefore resulting in &quot;it's undefined&quot; OR then 0. 1 does not even come to mind here for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically, you can organize 0 objects. There is the concept of the <em>null</em> set, or empty set. It exists. It has a size (cardinality) of 0. Any null set is the same as any other, there is only one null set.</p>
<p>To put it in more &quot;real world&quot; terms, take a tennis ball tube with colored balls. If there are three different balls stacked inside, the number of ways I can arrange them is 3! = 6. If there are two different balls stacked inside, I can arrange them in 2! = 2 ways. If there is one ball inside, I can arrange it in 1! = 1 ways. If there are no balls in side, I can arrange that in 0! = 1 ways. The tube still exists, it just doesn't have any balls inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Then if you merged the empty tube with another with two balls you get to use the empty space to get 6 possible arrangements?  Because otherwise those explanations still don't make sense to me,  you would be arranging the tube itself not its contents.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imo, a good analogy is to imagine a string and a couple of differently-colored balls that are to be put on that string. The string's end's are not tied together. Then, when you have n of these differently colored balls, how many different strings can you get when you use all balls? Exactly n!. And this still works when you don't have any balls - you only get one possible string in that case, so 0! = 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way: you want to figure out the number of combinations you can make at subway. You have 5 types of bread, 6 types of meat, a dozen veggies, and... Oops!  All of their sauces are expired, and the truck doesn't come in until tomorrow. But this problem doesn't need to collapse, because there is still one possible combination of sauces: none at all.</p>
<p>Yes, I know this problem doesn't use factorials, but it's a simple example to introduce the concept when you have what would be a permutation of a number, but that number is 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. Every book i have ever read that mentions this has said this is simply a convention that is followed. And the rest of the math relies on that being the convention.  </p></div>		</li>
