			<div class="markdown"><p>Getting student loans discharged in cases of permanent disability is a real bitch, too. My MIL is in the process of that now.</p>
<p>First, you have to get social security disability. Only about 17 percent of people are approved on their first application. </p>
<p>Then you file an appeal. When that appeal is denied, despite a stack of paperwork from your physician detailing your medical issues and usually forms from family and friends detailing how much assistance you need in daily life, you get scheduled for a court date. The process of application and appeal took 2 years in my MIL's case. Luckily she still was getting long term disability insurance payments from her former job, or she'd be screwed. The entire time, she's making payments on her student loans.</p>
<p>Getting the court date can take up to a year. When you finally go, it can still take months for you to get a decision from them. You have about a 50/50 shot of getting approved at a court date.</p>
<p>And then after that, if you're approved, you still get to make payments on your student loan debt! You have to be on social security disability and pass your first case review saying that, yeah, you're still disabled and can't work, before you can apply for student loan discharge. This is 3 years or so after you're approved. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My personal Sallie Mae loans is on a dynamic interest rate because I make a very small payment on it every month while I'm still in school. It can increase or decrease across the span of the repayment period (I think 10 years, maybe 20)</p>
<p>My interest rate is 2.06%-6.8% (currently about 2.2%). Compare That with the federal rate of 4.8ish, it's a hell of a lot better than federal. I can definitely tell I'm used to browsing /r/explainbothsides because this completly biased answer really appalled me. They aren't horrible, it just can be if some people don't make financially responsible decisions. </p></div>		</li>

<p>(0) Do anything you can to avoid or reduce the loan in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is extremely important. In retrospect, with a little guidance and a lot more discipline, my wife likely could have avoided hers entirely. </p>
<p>One of the best things a student can do for their financial future is to learn how to live as comfortably as possible with as little as possible during the financially risky college years. </p>
<p>Plenty of subs on here that can help with that actually. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My student loans are through Sallie Mae. Payments started a year after graduation, but I was able to stop making payments while I waa in grad school, and I believe during the year that I was teaching but my husband was still in school.  This was 10-12 years ago, so maybe things are different now, but the process was super simple. Now I'm almost done paying them off (about $5k left)  and I have zero complaints about the process. Low interest rates, easy payments, and decent customer service. </p></div>		</li>
