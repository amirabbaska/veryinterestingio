<p>It's all individual variation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially you become desensitised. I drink coffee a lot and decided to stop for a week, a week later I had a strong espresso and it hit me as hard as the first time I drank coffee, because my brain went “back to normal” and so I was no longer as desensitised. This is quite a basic explanation, but gets the point across.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. There are transport proteins for removing adenosine from the extracellular space. In addition, there's a barrier between the extracellular space in tissue (eg. nervous tissue in the brain) and the lumen (interior) of blood vessels.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When your cells need energy, they break down ATP molecules, which release energy and a few byproducts, including Adenosine. Over time Adenosine builds up and binds to its specific receptor telling the body to become tired. </p>

<p>This doesn't make any sense.</p>
<p>ATP is not broken down to adenosine for energy use, it's broken down to ADP or AMP (plus phosphate or pyrophosphate). In addition, the receptors we're talking about face the extracellular space, while metabolic ATP usage is intracellular. And adenosine doesn't easily cross the cell membrane (that's why you have transport proteins to reabsorb it). In addition, adenosinergic/purinergic signalling is actually often achieved via excretion of ATP, which is only subsequently hydrolysed to adenosine by an ectonucleotidase.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Purinergic signaling can be achieved through excretion of ADP also, which is the result of ATP metabolism for energy. I believe that under heavy energy consumption there's a rise of ADP levels which causes more pronounced purinergic signaling but I might be wrong since I can't find a souce to back my claim.</p></div>		</li>
