<p>Tim Robbins froze in Mission to Mars. Is that complete BS?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it (which I may not) in the very short term you're actually more at risk of <em>heat stroke</em>, since your body is still generating and radiating heat, but it has nowhere to go since the open space around you acts as an insulator; there isn't much around your body to take all the heat you generate.</p>
<p>You'd be dead long, long before you start to get cold, I think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, IIRC from what I've read, there is nothing to take the heat out of you (such as cold water or even cold air), so your body will just naturally dissipate heat.  This could take a long time to actually cause serious harm from cold. The freezing immediately in space is a Hollywood invention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, you would lose heat quite rapidly simply through radiation - assuming of course that you're shielded or far away from the sun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. You won't freeze. </p>
<p>Space isn't cold per se, because it's almost entirely vaccum. There is nothing to lose heat to through conduction. </p>
<p>Eventually your body would freeze dry. But that would take a long time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Water has a very high heat of vaporization though, and you'd certainly be losing a good deal of it through all of your mucous membranes. That'll chill you pretty quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And that's because there's no conduction or convection. Your body has to lose the heat via radiation, and that's a slower process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd add that explosive decompression (like instant loss of suit or airlock pressure) probably differs slightly. The experiments done on animals involved a vacuum chamber that takes time to depressurize. Instant decompression is probably a lot more violent.</p></div>		</li>
