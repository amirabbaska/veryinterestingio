			<div class="markdown"><p>Dogs can get what is called &quot;Canine Cognitive Decline&quot; (CCD), which can reasonably be described as a form of dementia. It seems to be correlated with the development of amyloid plaques in their brains, which also occur in human Alzheimer's Disease (AD). However, human AD is also associated with the formation of tau tangles in the brain, which have never been observed in dogs.</p>
<p>There is some evidence that being a neutered male increases a dog's risk for developing CCD and for it progressing more rapidly than in intact males. More recently, there have been studies about dietary interventions that have shown beneficial effects on CCD progression. Those results have made their way into some commercially available dog foods at this point.</p>
<p>The University of Budapest has a group studying cognitive abilities in older dogs as part of their &quot;Senior Family Dog Project&quot;, so you may also want to look into their work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certainly, some dogs get dementia and experience significant cognitive decline with age.  The degree to which most dogs experience cognitive decline during aging is still unknown and is something we will assess during the longitudinal study of aging in partnership with our friends at <a href="https://www.dognition.com/" target="_blank">Dognition</a>.  </p>
<p>Rapamycin has been shown to improve cognitive function during aging in mice and to also protect against Alzheimer's disease in mouse models.  We intend to test whether rapamycin can improve cognitive function during aging in dogs in our next phase (phase 2).  This phase which will study 50 dogs over a 1 year period was recently funded by a grant from the Donner Foundation.  </p>
<p>We don't know yet when the long-term intervention study will start.  This depends solely on when we have funding for this study.  Our hope is to eventually be able to perform a 5 year rapamycin trial with several hundred dogs to look as broadly as possible at the effects of rapamycin on healthy aging. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If dogs can get concussions, I now feel bad for years of watching The Puppy Bowl. </p>
<p>But I it does make me further ask, Are some dogs mentally ill? I know scientists argue about whether Dogs are capable of emotion, so I think it leads to the question of if they can have a mood disorder. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The part of our brain that is responsible for emotion is an evolutionary older part of the brain shared by most, if not all mammals. I don't think there is much room for argument about whether or not dogs experience emotions. Most animals it is easy to see that they experience fear, and we see lots of examples of other emotions too, from pleasure seeking to grieving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dog brains are not fundamentally different from human brains, so it is fair to assume that they are susceptible to at least some degree of mental illness, though how comparable to mental illness in humans that is is debatable. If you are interested in the topic, I would recommend the book &quot;Animal Madness&quot; by Laurel Braitman.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my staffie might be immune to concussion. I once saw her run head first into a concrete stair (she stepped on her leash). Continued like nothing happened. :p</p>
<p>But seriously though, I would assume they can get them.</p></div>		</li>
