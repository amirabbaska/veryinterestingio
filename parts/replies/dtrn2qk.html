			<div class="markdown"><p>I realize this is now a civics-ish question, but do those barrier islands extend the existing territory of a country that much farther out into the ocean?  I seem to recall that being an issue off the coast of China recently: they're building man-made islands which extend China's jurisdiction into what was international waters in an effort to control shipping routes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Barrier islands are usually really close to shore so it usually fairly obvious who they belong too (like the Florida keys for example).... I'd expect for the vast majority of those two thousand islands there was little to no dispute over ownership</p></div>		</li>
