			<p>I live in Las Vegas.  Some older houses have swamp coolers instead of AC.  Someone told me that swamp coolers can only cool structures down about 15-20 degrees below the outside temperature, so once it gets over 105-110 here (which is about 2-3 months), the &quot;cool down&quot; effect from a swamp cooler is not that noticeable and its still too hot in the structure.<br><br>I have a storage at a storage facility.  They use a swamp cooler; I think because its a lot cheaper to operate one than constantly burning electricity to use AC.  Our electricity rates here are very high thanks to NVEnergy (relative to other SW desert cities), so that may play a role in that as well (When it is 110+, our AC here goes almost all the time; even if you have your AC set to a low 80's temp).</p>		</li>

			<p>I usually go to Vegas during the high summer heat (late July to early August) and just being in the pools makes it feels nice until you get out and are dry within a few minutes.<br><br>The worst temps I got in Nevada was when I was visiting the Hoover Dam and it was 114 degrees out with 10-15 MPH winds...it felt like a convection oven.  In the 10 minutes I was outside my top lip dried out and I had to be putting Chap Stick all day for the next week.  During those times leaving a nice air conditioned casino at midnight means walking into 100 degree weather at night.  I love the place but to live there, no thanks!</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Where do you use them?<br><br>It needs to be dry heat. If it's humid, there's little room for water to evaporate, and also a cold humid room is not exactly pleasant (you can actually feel pain in your joints). <em>EDIT</em>: in fact if it's humid a de-humidifier can provide a lot of comfort alone, even without air conditioning.<br><br>The main advantage of evaporative AC is that it's much cheaper, and doesn't need a huge appliance outside.</p>		</li>

			<p>Variations have been used forever. As someone else said, swamp coolers have been in use for a long time. A lot of houses also used similar concepts for cooling; there used to be 'house fans' which were basically giant fans in the attic which would draw cool air from the ground, up through the rest of the house (these were sucking air and pushing it out the top of the house, rather than pushing it in). Houses used to be built with through and through designs so that you could open windows in both ends and get air flow, and you'd have wrap around porches to create extra shade.<br><br>The real answer to your question of 'why don't we do things like this' is electricity. It's cheap as hell, ubiquitous, and allows constant thermal regulation regardless of set up, which in turn allows the maximization of living space. Plus for things like air conditioning to work, you have to seal the house, which inherently fights natural air flow systems like this.  And people don't want bugs, dirt, dust, animals, or people to be able to access their home through venting systems, which vastly decreases the function.</p>		</li>

			<p>Not sure- I live in the UK where cooling isn't generally a problem, but I see a lot of stuff online about &quot;swamp coolers&quot; and such like.<br><br>We used to have a wet bulb hygrometer which used this principle the other way- by measuring the difference in temperature between a dry thermometer and one wrapped in a wet cloth you could calculate the air humidity. On dry days the evaporative cooling effect of the wet cloth would be better so that side would read a much lower temperature, on humid days there would be little cooling so the thermometers would read similar values.</p>		</li>

			<p>But it's really the same phenomenon - take cold stuff, insulate it and move it to warm place. Conversely in a modern heat pump, take ambient temperature stuff, evaporate it causing local cooling, pump the gas to a place where it's condensed, condense it, heat exchange brings it to ambient temp, return to cooling site, repeat.<br><br>Each case is adiabatic, the movement of a local concentration of temperature which doesn't match the temperature of its surroundings and without the exchange of heat with its surroundings. The latter case allows heat flow through gas expansion and compression, the former through movement of an insulated vessel. </p>		</li>

			<p>Heat from the surroundings (e.g. ambient/room temperature) would have to transfer to the ice to melt it. There are 2 primary modes to transfer heat: conduction (through contact) and convection (via a moving fluid such as air or water).  Sawdust and blankets both block convection, as no moving air contacts the ice to warm it up.  Also, they are very poor conductors of heat, so they prevent thermal energy from reaching the ice. As an illustration, blankets and sawdust feel warm to the touch because they do not conduct heat well; in contrast, things like metal feel cold because they conduct heat well, and pull heat from the part of your body in contact with them (until the metal warms up). Your body is warmer than room temperature, so the metal is 'cold' relative to your skin.</p>		</li>

			<p>the same way you don't freeze when you wrap yourself up in blankets, only the sawdust is much thicker and very fluffy.  Air can't penetrate all the way through the sawdust and so the warm air outside can't add energy to the cold air inside.</p>		</li>

			<p>An Englishman proposed building an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Habakkuk" target="_blank">aircraft carrier made of pykrete - ice and sawdust</a> - during WWII when steel was short in supply. It would have melted more slowly and been much stronger than regular ice.
