			<div class="markdown"><p>It is much easier to ship virtually anything by boat than by land.</p>
<p>Today this is because you need only a handfull of people to bring a massive container ship from the eastern to the western hemisphere and vice versa.</p>
<p>Back in the day you had a boat that ran on wind power compared to small carriages that &quot;ran&quot; on horse or ox power (or camel or whatever was appropriate for the region).</p>
<p>But aside from the lower costs of the energy you need to transport the goods, the costs for the people involved is a very big factor. I've got no clue about how it was back in the day but today the cost savings on a ship compared to land bases transportation are enormous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Heat from the surroundings (e.g. ambient/room temperature) would have to transfer to the ice to melt it. There are 2 primary modes to transfer heat: conduction (through contact) and convection (via a moving fluid such as air or water).  Sawdust and blankets both block convection, as no moving air contacts the ice to warm it up.  Also, they are very poor conductors of heat, so they prevent thermal energy from reaching the ice. As an illustration, blankets and sawdust feel warm to the touch because they do not conduct heat well; in contrast, things like metal feel cold because they conduct heat well, and pull heat from the part of your body in contact with them (until the metal warms up). Your body is warmer than room temperature, so the metal is 'cold' relative to your skin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are three actually. Radiation, like the sun on your face and the source of most of the energy ever on this planet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the same way you don't freeze when you wrap yourself up in blankets, only the sawdust is much thicker and very fluffy.  Air can't penetrate all the way through the sawdust and so the warm air outside can't add energy to the cold air inside.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An Englishman proposed building an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Habakkuk" target="_blank">aircraft carrier made of pykrete - ice and sawdust</a> - during WWII when steel was short in supply. It would have melted more slowly and been much stronger than regular ice. Apparently Lord Mountbatten, his patron, prepared a demonstration in which he shot a block of regular ice and a block of pykrete. The bullet ricocheted off the pykrete and grazed an admiral's trousers</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, it would have melted.  There were of course elaborate plans to use a massive refrigeration system, but the cost in metal and industrial tech was higher than a regular aircraft carrier which was much more practical to propel.</p>
<p>Mythbusters did try it.  They found newspapers were far stronger reinforcement than wood pulp.  They make a skiff and sailed in waters just above freezing.  But it really didn't take long for the melting to set in.  Their 2&quot; thick hull was basically dissolve into wet pulp inside of an hour.</p></div>		</li>
