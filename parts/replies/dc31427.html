Apparently fresh out of the womb babes smell awesome to him lol. He literally held my son and smelled him for a good hour when he first held him. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Babies DO smell awesome for the first month or so.  Well, except when someone (other than me!!!) needs to change their dirty nappies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But they do! The top of small babies' heads smell like a mix of freshly baked bread and mushrooms. I've tried to analyze the smell of my own kids and that's the closest match I came up with. Sweet and salty and just addictive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tried smelling (clean) babies my friends have had - at best they smell like a bit musty, at worst like sour milk. Don't get it. </p>
<p>However, my cat smelt AMAZING to me as a kitten. I just wanted to smush my face into his fur all the time. </p>
<p>So i think somewhere my hormones got mixed up and i am secretly a cat. Haha</p></div>		</li>
