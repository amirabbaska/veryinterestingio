			<div class="markdown"><p>98 to 100 is ideal conditions at rest. Here in Colorado were often 94-96 So you'll see a lot of masks during Broncos games. </p>
<p>As blood moves through capillaries in your lungs at a resting rate, it has time to reach 98-99 %. If it is moving faster due to increased heart rate, it has less time to be exposed to oxygen in the lungs, and O2 sats will drop. We compensate by increasing respiratory rate, but the o2 helps aid that compensation. </p>
<p>Also when were exercising, O2 can get used up quick. When it gets used up, our muscles being to use anaerobic respiration, which results in the formation of lactic acid. O2 supplement helps stave off this process. </p>
<p>Some of this is oversimplified, and I'm dredging up A&amp;P as best I can without looking shit up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Increasing O2 inhaled does have a pleasant feeling associated with it. That said: 100% O2 is damaging to lung tissue due to free radicals, and inhibits exhaling CO2. I've wondered if it's a placebo tank.</p>
<p>-I taught lung physiology at one point and have no idea why they have O2 on the sideline. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's probably not a placebo. It's just absolutely not 100% oxygen they're breathing in, just a lot more oxygen.</p>
<p>You also don't put 100% oxygen into an oxygen tank unless it's laboratory grade oxygen and that stuff's prohibitively expensive. Welding, medical, and aircraft oxygen are roughly 90% purity with the primary difference between the 3 being allowable contaminants (though they are all produced with the same process because not avoiding known toxic contaminants doesn't drop the price enough to justify producing only welding O2 when you could be selling to 3 markets) and the chain of custody on the tanks to ensure they haven't been contaminated by leaving them open when depressurized.</p>
<p>You don't get 100% of the contents of the tank unless your mask is sealed with a check valve and then vacuumed between breaths. Masks used for gas delivery almost always have open holes and therefore mix the gasses from the atmosphere with the gas out of the tank constantly.</p>
<p>It also doesn't inhibit exhaling CO2. CO2 transfer from blood to lungs is accomplished via diffusion. Diffusion occurs faster when the difference in concentration is higher. The difference cannot possibly be higher than when one side is at 0%. The apparatus you use to accomplish a 100% oxygen environment could inhibit exhaling somehow though.</p>
