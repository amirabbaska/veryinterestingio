<p>It depends on the water content of the fruit. When water freezes, it expands, so when the water in the cells of the fruit freezes, it breaks through the cell membranes. This can be seen when you freeze and then thaw a high water content food such as strawberries; you'll be left with a squishy mess when you defrost them.</p>
<p>So the amount of damage depends on the water content. Melons will be affected more than strawberries which will be affected more than bananas, which are affected the least because they are only 75% water. As an example, nuts would hardly be affected at all.</p>
<p>So you do diminish the nutrient content of the bananas used in banana ice cream, but not anywhere near as much as the bananas used in banana bread (cooking does far more damage than freezing, including the causation of autoimmune reactions).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hm... just breaking open the cells won't automatically change the nutrient content. I suppose if you let the water drain away it would, but that's not a given.</p>
<p>Breaking open the cells this way could release enzymes that would change the nutrient composition though. But I'm not aware of such a situation with bananas.</p>
<p>Garlic is an example of such enzyme release. When you crush a fresh clove of garlic (freezing would probably work as well, freezing garlic is just unusual), an enzyme is released that produces the sulfur compound allicin, which can also break down into various other sulfur compounds. These compounds are pungent, and this system is the garlic plant's defense mechanism against certain pests.</p></div>		</li>

<p>True. Even I cannot find any sources linking to why Banana specifically sweetens up when frozen. I hope we can get an expert or some reliable resource. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was about to suggest that the starch in the banana is converted to sugars in cold temperatures, as is the case with e.g. potatoes^1. But apparently a ripe banana contains only ~1% starch compared to an unripe banana which is around 70-80% starch^2. On the other hand, most bananas sold aren't really truly ripe^3 (i.e. brown skin) so it might still be a contributing factor at least.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a homebrewer I can guide you in the rough direction, although I'm afraid is outside my deeper science knowledge:</p>
<p>Known science: Bananas contain a lot of (alpha) amylase, which is one of the enzymes which break down starch into sugars. This happens naturally during the ripening process. </p>
<p>Observed Data: If the banana is damaged the process happens much quicker, whether bruised mashed or frozen. I always assumed this was because this damage was breaking down whatever barriers naturally controlled the ripening process, causing the rapid increase in the glucose levels.</p>
<p>This also works if you mash bananas with other starchy foods. I'd love to see a proper study on the process</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I blend fruit/veggies for relatively low-effort snacks and/or meal replacement.  I do all the legwork (peeling, cutting, cleaning, etc.) one afternoon and then freeze the &quot;fruits&quot; of my efforts.  When I am ready for a snack, I take the frozen goods from the freezer and pop them directly in the blender.  I do not strain the result; I drink it all.</p>
<p>My question:  does this affect the nutritional value?  Yes, the fruits/veggies change texture a bit during the defrosting process, but I am blending it all the same.  Is there a major change in nutritional value between that and if I were to just blend them without the freezing?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how quickly they freeze, there's the chance that there will some disruption between the various nutrients from each ingredient. It's not likely that it would have much more of an effect than the digestion process has though (since they'll all end up in the stomach anyway).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How about calorie count and effective sugar content? Does the process change how and what gets metabolized? Basically I'm wondering if eating a super-sweet thawed banana is about as fattening as a bland fresh one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In total calories, there's probably not much difference. For diabetics, a quick load of sugar is not as good as a drawning out the carb load in less of a spike. Some starches like potatoes and rice don't digest well for humans if they aren't cooked.</p></div>		</li>
