			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I'm convinced now that wasps and hornets are a necessary evil.</p>
<p>That said, what kind of impact are we making on the ecosystem by simply killing them around the house, especially with pesticides? Should we just leave them bee (pun intended), or is it okay to control the population and keep the numbers to a minimum? Also, is there a more sustainable or green alternative to killing them by &quot;shooing them away&quot; somehow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Killing them around the house is fine; it's you vs one type of wasp, which keeps the natural balance.  Using pesticides to kill them however... you're possibly killing off all sorts of other beneficial insects as well.  Not generally a good idea.</p>
<p>For the common wasp, the best alternative to killing them AND their nest is to just not leave any food out that they might be attracted to.  Open garbage is a wasp magnet, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our policy at home has been, knock their nests down from human structures especially by doors where they are likely to sting people. Otherwise, leave them alone.</p></div>		</li>
