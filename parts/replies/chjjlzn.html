			<div class="markdown"><p>Another interesting fact regarding metamorphosis in lepidopterans(as opposed to Odonata): They do not have to emerge from the pupa right away. The metamorphosis stage can be used to extend the period of time after the caterpillar completes its stages of life for a number of years.</p>
<p>There are species in the deserts of the SW USA that will wait until environmental conditions are ideal before emerging (pupal diapause). It can take a number of years before the desert is wet enough to support another generation of caterpillars. An example of this would be a pupa of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodoxus_y-inversus" target="_blank">Prodoxus y-inversus</a> which, after being collected from the wild, waited 19 years before emerging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense. Of course, on the flip side there are also obvious advantages to having fairly similar young and adult forms, namely that the adults can raise and take care of their young.</p></div>		</li>
