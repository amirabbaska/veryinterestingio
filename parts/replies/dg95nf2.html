			<div class="markdown"><p>Opinion has always been that way. It's just more prevelant than it's been in the past once again, trusted news sources like NPR and a preponderance of print establishments are readily available. and to be fair, at least CNN says it's opinion. They don't try and hide it like fox and other unmentionables.</p></div>		</li>
