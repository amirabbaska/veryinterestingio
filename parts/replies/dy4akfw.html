			<div class="markdown"><p>Some starting points:</p>
<p>Go hang out on /r/rocketry.</p>
<p>Read the amateur rocketry mailing list.</p>
<p>Read Sutton's <em>Rocket Propulsion Elements</em> . Read Huzel &amp; Huang's <em>Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines</em>. Do the exercises.</p>
<p>Go play around with RPA, Propep, and similar programs.</p>
<p>Take chemistry, physics, and calculus classes.</p>
<p>Go design a rocket engine. Building it in hardware is good, but if you just want to look knowledgeable on reddit then some spreadsheets are a good start.</p>
<p>As you read about things, run numbers yourself. Notice when something surprises or confuses you. Check the numbers. Figure out why they are that way. If you think the professionals are wrong, figure out why. Sometimes you're just wrong, sometimes they had a design constraint you didn't realize existed.</p>
<p>If you have more specific questions, ask away.</p></div>		</li>
