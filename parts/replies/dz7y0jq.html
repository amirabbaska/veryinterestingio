			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're playing back on a 2.0 system or headphones, there should be a usable fallback audio track as well. Not all of us can afford a proper setup, either due to monetary or living space constraints.</p>
<p>If I can't hear the voice because their whispers are overpowered by the rumble of an engine or something equally silly on screen, I consider that a bad mixing. They can set the dynamic range for the rest however they like, but at least make it so that I can hear the <em>voice</em> first and foremost without straining, no matter what speaker set I use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not that this is a solution to the problem but some formats, including everything on HBOs streaming site, have a caption setting called replay that will make the captions automatically turn on when you replay a section you've already watched. So if you miss something and rewind 10 seconds it will automatically turn captions on for those 10 seconds and then turn them back off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would be nice and easy solution if the hardware (often the TV) downmixing to 2.0 let you change levels from the incoming channels. Like give the centre channel a boost over the others. I know some TVs and home theatres have a “night mode” that seems to do something like this but it’s not common enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some tvs and receiver systems have the option to compress dynamic range, making audio sound around the same volume. This is probably what your night mode is doing.</p>
<p>Certain filters on PC like LAV give you the option of controlling the volume of mixed channels (center,surround,LFE) in addition to compression/normalization, but I've never seen in on a regular home theater system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can do this on a channel specific volume level already on amps (mine is 20 years old and has it), normally used for setup and forget but possible each movie too. I have my centre 2db louder coz smaller centre (into music more than movies) and MY HEARING IS LESS THAN GREAT. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an option to compress volume in my smart TV and I imagine it's present in most TVs, not sure what the name is tho, it's basically the same as the option in Windows that's called &quot;loudness equalization&quot; (I think).</p>
<p>It obviously takes away from the intended experience, but if that variation in volume annoys you I imagine that option is available in your TV too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An audio compressor/limiter is one of the most commonly used tools in audio production.  You can find component audio compressors pretty cheap, if you're running your sound out through another system.  I assume they don't like it when you link to products on here, but you can find really nice rack-mount compressors for around $400 or cheap-o &quot;get the job done&quot; compressors for $60.  I have often fantasized about adding a component amplifier, just so I could have some in-line dynamic processing on my TV.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why can't we just have separate audio streams for music, sfx and voice like video games do? Crank voice up to 11, keep music and sfx at 2 so we can still hear what is happening even when the toddler is sleeping in there next room? This shouldn't be something that requires hacker level frequency filtering, and it shouldn't be left to what some Smart TV manufacturer figured was a good compromise.</p></div>		</li>
