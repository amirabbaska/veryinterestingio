			<div class="markdown"><p>If it were really in deep vacuum, then no, but interplanetary and interstellar space still has a little dust and gas in it (made of ordinary matter). It's not much, but it's enough that we would be able to see the radiation coming from its annihilation with anti-atoms on the surface of the anti-asteroid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does anyone have a convincing argument why the universe can't be partitioned into hemispheres of half matter and half antimatter with a void between the halves which was annihilated long ago ?  If it all looks the same, how would we know that some distance stars are not actually antimatter stars past the void in the opposite hemisphere ?  </p>
<p>Basically, the answer to the question of why the universe is made of matter, is in fact that only half is matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. The reason we believe that there is not some large region of the universe made out of antimatter as you describe is this: Since we observe no annihilation signal from a boundary region where antimatter meets matter, any large antimatter region out there must be not only completely isolated, but stationary. That is to say that all the galaxies and dust that gets hurled around by chaotic gravitational dynamics and supernova shockwaves etc. are not allowed to mix the matter and antimatter.
A second point is that because the speed of light is finite, looking at things far away is kind of equivalent to looking back in time. Thus, if there was some time in the history of the universe where matter and antimatter was annihilating a lot, we would see that happening at a certain distance from us, detecting photons that have spent all the intermediate time travelling across the universe to meet us now.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand it there is not any really good agreement over why we have more matter than antimatter.</p>
<p>If there had been equal amounts of matter and antimatter you'd expect to see evidence of that in ancient explosions and energy releases, but we don't, therefore something happened very early on to lead to this unbalanced state.  This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry" target="_blank">Baryon Asymmetry</a>.</p>
<p>There is a really interesting thing that <a href="http://www.physics.org/article-questions.asp?id=121" target="_blank">D and K mesons apparently do where they can switch back and forth between matter and antimatter</a>, but the transition is slightly favored for the transition to matter.</p>
<p>There are a lot of people thinking about this question and they've been doing so for a long time.  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2015/12/31/why-are-we-made-of-matter-and-not-antimatter/#3d3ce1cc6aad" target="_blank">This Forbes article is a good overview of the issue</a>.  The same author, Ethan Siegel, has a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/ethan-siegel-172073460/starts-with-a-bang-3-why-is-there-more-matter-than-antimatter" target="_blank">longer and more detailed audio article on the topic</a>.</p></div>		</li>
