			<div class="markdown"><p>can you still catch tb from dead tb bacteria??  I came across the dump from an old tb hospital from the 20's.  I didn't think it could pose a danger (other than broken glass) until I read this</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on how long they've been dead, I'm sure there's a very small chance that you could develop some symptoms, but there's no way you could possibly get the actual disease unless living bacteria enters your body. </p>
<p>Of course, an old dump from a TB hospital may still contain living bacteria - many pathogenic bacteria can survive outside the human body for quite some time. Not sure how TB compares in that way, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;M. tuberculosis can survive for months on dry inanimate surfaces. M. tuberculosis can survive in cockroach feces for 8 weeks, sputum on carpet (19 days) and wood (over 88 days), moist and dry soil (4 weeks), and in the environment for more than 74 days if protected from light (possibly longer if in feces.&quot;</p>
<p>If it's been dumped for more than 4 months, I'd say you're in the clear. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took microbiology this summer, so it's not like I'm an expert, but I don't think Mycobacterium tuberculosis produces endospores. Other species of Mycobacterium do...I think we did an acid fast stain of M. smegmatis and saw the endospores, though! </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No you can't get it from a dump site. For tb to transfer someone needs to cough a droplet into the air. (A droplet can stay in the air for hours). You then need to inhale it and it has to pass through the mucociliary clearance mechanisms of your respiratory tract to set up shop. There have been case reports of it becoming aerosolized from an abscess to healthcare workers but those types of infection are rare. Wear a mask and the risk approaches zero.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, there is no permanent cure. Periodic rounds of alternating antibiotics was the recommendation for a long time. Treatment of symptoms seems to be more common now. The best thing to do is get 21 days doxycycline asap. Don't let anyone talk you into a shorter treatment or tell you it's not common in your area. Florida doctors STILL often deny it's here. It doesn't have to be a bulls eye rash.</p></div>		</li>
