			<div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon you're referring to typically only occurs with very pure water in a very smooth container with no contaminants.</p>
<p>Having literally anything in the water that is not smooth prevents this buildup of heat beyond the boiling point--a teabag would qualify.</p></div>		</li>

<p>the water can actually reach temperatures above the boiling point</p>

<p>Not if there's a tea bag in it from the start.</p>
<p>The question is about the tea bag's warning.  Your scenario has nothing to do with the <strong>tea bag</strong> being exposed to microwaves.</p></div>		</li>
