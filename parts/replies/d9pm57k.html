			<div class="markdown"><p>Let me help you feel even older. In the amount of time since Shoemaker-Levy, I was born, went through primary, secondary school, then got my degree in Computer Science and I am now working as a web developer 1.5 years out of school. In short, the event that you remember like it was yesterday is the time span of my entire life.</p></div>		</li>
