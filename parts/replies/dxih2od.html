			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem is that we really don't know yet, as Zika is still so poorly described in the literature. It doesn't seem that there is any long-term effect from acute infection among adults, but the effects of congenital Zika syndrome still need to be studied. The most recent outbreak will give us a lot of opportunity to document patterns among the cohort of children born with congenital Zika syndrome as they grow older. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last I heard (probably two years ago), it wasn't known if a mother who had recovered from Zika could still pass it on to a fetus. Is more known about that?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I heard that the congenital Zika syndrome might be more related to the pesticides used to combat mosquitos in indigenous areas of South America than actually from the virus itself. </p>
<p>I seem to remember a large contingency of infected mothers in the US Virgin Islands where they don't use said outlawed pesticide and none of the children had birth defects. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A major long term rare effect of Zika is Guillan-Barre syndrome or progressive loss of motor function in the limbs.  Other than that there aren't too many long symptoms known yet besides the ones often talked about in neonates.</p></div>		</li>

<p>People who have been infected once, often asymptomatically, will be immune from future infections (unless the virus mutates significantly).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How about women who got infected, and then got pregnant many layers later ---  will the baby inherit this immunity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Immunity inherited during gestation generally lasts about 6 months. Permanent immunity does not occur this way, hence why we still have to vaccinate kids for, for example, pertussis or measles even if the mother was immune.</p>
<p>Put simply, the infant immune system doesn't get trained during gestation/lactation, merely sheltered long enough to start learning on its own.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the child's immune system learn from the mother's immune system?  If a virus was intercepted by the mother's immunity  (and from my not complex understanding of immune system) and now in the process of killing it with T cells, could a baby's own B lymphocytes/antibodies come across it and get information to learn how to fight it later?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There are mechanisms at play that may be undiscovered or are simply not well understood. </p>

<p>There's another very recent study on the linkage between the infant's mouth and the tissue around the nipple itself. I can never remember the name of the study when I need to cite it though. </p></div>		</li>
