<p>I've never had a turkey survive to adulthood so I dunno if they do or not.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Given that ostriches are ratites, which are on the opposite branch from neoaves, it is very likely that head freezing is ancestral and has been lost/partially lost in some species, rather than being of more recent derivation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gp_c-b-pSkI" target="_blank">always</a> do it, though, which is what I meant by &quot;consistently&quot;.  I suspect the turkey in your video is foraging, while the the one in mine is just strutting, and that's the reason for the difference.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but the fact that they do it at all means it is likely it came from a common ancestor rather than arose independently. Also, wild turkeys seem to do it more than domesticated turkeys, in my experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9hqgm1RhPQ" target="_blank">Tinamou</a> also do a head freezing thing, so it seems likely that the head freezing thing is ancestral, as tinamou are as distantly related from pigeons as possible but also show head freezing.</p></div>		</li>
