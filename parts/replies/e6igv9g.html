			<div class="markdown"><p>I did say that nocireceptors are all anaesthesia /needs/ to interfere with. That sounds rather severe, but it sounds like multiple nerve pathways are experiencing interference in your case. Anaesthesiology is far more complex than black and white, though, and I'm more knowledgeable about the nervous system side of it. </p>
<p>Also, that really sucks. Have you talked to the anaesthesiologist (or related doctor) about it? Sometimes you kind of have to pry a more scientific answer out of them than &quot;you're not gonna die.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
