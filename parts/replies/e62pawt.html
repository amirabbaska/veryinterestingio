			<div class="markdown"><p>Those solar panels are presumably used to power electrical devices - doesn't the operation of those devices ultimately just convert the electricity they use to heat?</p>
<p>I have an appliance that consumes 300W of power, doesn't it eventually radiate 300W of heat?</p>
<p>Wouldn't the solar radiation absorbed by the solar panels just be radiated by some other object? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On the other hand if we were expecting to see planetary cooling on the same scale as expected warming that would be a nightmare. It would destroy food production and cause massive famine. </p>
<p>Edit: I’m remarking on this as an abstract idea and not attempting to defend warming as a good thing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then.... it would be possible to go TOO far the other way, yes? Although that said, we should be lucky to keep temperatures stable, let alone start cooling it down. And by the time global cooling is an issue, perhaps we'd have other options?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rumour has it that Ontario is in a state of power surplus. We reduced our energy use and increased our production via solar panels.</p>
<p>So now, we actively dump power from solar panels into the ground because there's too much of it being produced and they don't need it in the grid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t think it’s that straight forward. People use an average temperature increase often to showcase global warming, but the real effects/drivers are more localized changes and disruptions to environments - some areas may be cooling, some experience no <em>net</em> change in temperature, some may experience transformations completely unrelated to temperature. </p>
<p>In the case of solar panels we may seem to be “balancing” the aggregate trend, but we may also be causing a localized change to a historic natural process or cycle that could have unforeseen effects. From my perspective, when it comes to climate change, one of the better things we can do is avoid upsetting natural equilibriums altogether</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be at the top. Everyone in this thread seems aware that there is a tradeoff, but without estimating the magnitude it's useless. This is the actual answer to the question.  </p>
<p>Also, 3 years is a perfectly acceptable payback time, but if people find that too high, we could focus on installing solar in locations that already have low albedo.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately the most effective places to install solar - deserts - have rather high albedo. But still, with proven net benefit after as little as 3 years, we're not really losing much.</p>
<p>Edit: deserts have high albedo, not low.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Really? I'm not of the average of all deserts but it seems to me that deserts have pale soil which is higher albedo, right?  </p></div>		</li>
