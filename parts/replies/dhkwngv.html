<p>You like A, and search for A. You also like B and search for B. Person 2 likes and searches for A and B as well but also searches for C. Maybe person 1 will like C as well, let's show it to them? </p>
<p>Unfortunately we really aren't that different from each other like a lot of people would have you believe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That stuff never works for me, online in general or some companies in particular. </p>
<p>Netflix is the worst, could not come up with a good recommendation for me if their life depended on it (e.g. pushing horror when the only &quot;horror&quot; I watch is iZombie, which I watch for the humour and the acting), pushing foreign-language stuff when the only &quot;foreign&quot; material I watch is from the uk, failing to notice that I follow certain actors, not &quot;edgy buddy cop with a female lead&quot; or whatever bs way the american film industry likes to greenlight/make/market their &quot;product&quot;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My biggest qualm is just the breadth of any given category. Shows with a &quot;strong female lead&quot; ranges from shows like Damages and Madam Secretary, which are very serious and involve women who kick ass. And then there are shows like Gilmore Girls. While Gilmore Girls is a fine show, I'd describe those characters more as people who get steamrolled by life, rather than <em>strong.</em></p>
<p>&quot;Workplace TV Shows&quot; includes everything from the very serious West Wing to the shittyish West Coast Choppers to the foreign comedy IT Crowd.</p>
<p>They aren't grouping similar shows.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting for people reading the above comment that Target infers that someone is pregnant based on their specific purchases at the store, which probably shouldn't be terribly surprising.  There's a fairly specific pattern or cluster of purchases one makes in preparing to have a kid or at a given stage of pregnancy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember about this story years ago, it was a correlation of specific purchases but they were not baby or pregnancy related in any way. So not pregnancy tests or maternity wear, etc., things that would be a fairly straightforward predictor. </p>
<p>That was what made it feel especially &quot;uncanny valley&quot; territory. It was something like cotton balls and a certain brand of lotion or something weird like that. The correlation was so strong that they started sending baby promo stuff to women who did not yet know they were pregnant before Target dialed it back (realized that women were so weirded out by it that it was counterproductive).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's things like purchasing lotion in the past, but switching to unscented lotion and certain vitamin supplements. Stuff that showed a pattern  to have happened with women that later started buying diapers and baby food.</p>
<p>The idea was to entice the expecting mother to keep shopping at Target because pregnancy (and parenthood) involves lots of household purchases and they hope to create customer loyalty.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's what I've read, but there was a time frame when target started sending me ads of all this baby stuff, and I've never figured out what they were looking at.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I work in ad targeting. I know what you are watching on your tv and that its you because its on your wifi so we have it cross referenced with your phone and laptop.</p>
<p>Also we have your purchase history sold to us too. Its fudged so as not to allow 1 to 1 matching but i probably could get it pretty close if it was actually worth it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, IP address and MAC address + info on software/hardware/history from browser and apps?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah, so this is the &quot;non-personally-identifiable&quot; information that is &quot;aggregated&quot; that I read about in EULAs?</p>
<p>Can you give me a hint on how the path from browsing to purchase is stored? Or is it just a single &quot;clump&quot; stored in a massive database?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Site tagging. Its generally stored as a clump because overall behavior is what wed model. We could get down to cookie id / device id we just generally dont.</p>
<p>But also your credit card sold us you purchase history. </p>
<p>Edit: for the first we mostly just care its you. We already have all that history through web tagging.</p></div>		</li>
