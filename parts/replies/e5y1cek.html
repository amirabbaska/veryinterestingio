			<div class="markdown"><p>I just looked it up and 1 bar of water is roughly 10 meters, or 33 feet.  According to Google, the lowest barometric recorded from a hurricane was Wilma at 882 millibars, which would translate to about 4.3 feet.  Not saying you're wrong, but that's probably one of many reasons like temperature and waves from the wind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe he means 1 atm of absolute pressure, not gauge pressure. 1 atm of absolute pressure is (by definition and under normal weather) at the surface of the water. 10 meters under would be 2 atm of absolute pressure or 1 atm of gauge pressure.</p>
<p>So what he's suggesting is that because the pressure at the surface of the water decreases (because the air pressure above decreases), fish go deeper in order to reach normal water pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kinda depends how you define inland or coastline but 16 miles (26km) from Trinity Bay and 40 miles (64km) from the Gulf of Mexico. Most of downtown is about 30-50 feet (9-15m) above sea level, but there are lower areas.</p></div>		</li>
