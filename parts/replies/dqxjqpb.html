<p>If y'all have other relevant questions, feel free to ask me. I'm still just a student working in someone else's lab, but I've spent a bit of time reading up on this. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I'm a layperson but surprised to read /u/albasri's comment that there's no consensus. I remmeber reading that the consensus was that because exposure to sunlight(UV light?) is necessary to make eyes stop growing, lowered exposure from more time indoors looking at screens was resulting in people's eyes growing slightly too long, which was causing myopia because the eyes .would be slightly too large and distorted within the socket.</p>
<p>Did something happen to disprove this?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, but there was never a full consensus to prove this. </p>
<p>Most current research seems to suggest there is an effect from sunlight and UV radiation, but we're still teasing out the details of how that effect works. It seems that sunlight helps with delaying or preventing the onset if myopia, but does not prevent it from progressing or worsening. </p>
<p>To further reduce the consensus, several researchers (including some of my colleagues) have not let go of the 'near reading causes nearsighted-ness' ideas. They feel we need more repetitions the studies cited above to prove that there is no connection between the two. </p>
<p>I cannot for the life of me find the article I want link (I'm on mobile right now). I'll try to come back and link it later from my computer. </p></div>		</li>

In fact studies have shown that under correction or over correction of the spectacle prescription can hasten myopia progression</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well.... sort of.</p>
<p>What that training does is help the <em>brain</em> to get better at interpreting results. It does not help the physical structure of the eye to better focus the image on the retina (cause of my- or hyper- opia). </p>
<p>OTOH, there is a well-known and well-regarded physical therapy for myopia called orthokeratology. But the vast majority of people are far too lazy to do it, so most eye care practitioners neither offer it nor know how to adminster it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was thought that there might be an effect of close-up work (books, computers), but the effects are small or non-existent according to some of the studies linked in the article. ... Some very recent work (again, linked in the article above) suggests that what matters is time spent outdoors. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'll be honest, that really sounds like splitting hairs.  &quot;It's not that continually focusing close to yourself causes nearsightedness, it's that you're not focusing all the way out for enough time.&quot;  I know there's as subtle difference between focusing at 2' and focusing at 10', but I would still roll that all up into &quot;If you don't exercise your eyes by focusing to long range, they end up unable to correctly focus to long range&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not about exercising eye focus, it's about increased light levels outside.
Outdoors is MUCH brighter than indoors, and the extra light has hormonal effects on eyeball growth and shape, which effects the ability to focus.
<a href="https://www.noao.edu/education/QLTkit/ACTIVITY_Documents/Safety/LightLevels_outdoor+indoor.pdf" target="_blank">NOAO reference on light levels</a>
From that reference:</p>
<p>Outdoors:
Full sun is about 100k lux, a bright day not in full sun is about 10k lux, and an overcast day is about 1k lux.</p>
<p>Indoors:
A typical home is 150 lux, a well lit office is about 500 lux, and a workshop for very detailed mechanical work is 2k lux.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3742730/" target="_blank">Here is a paper on the effects of light on eyball growth</a>
This is just my first hit on a quick google search. Someone who studies this stuff could probably give better references.</p>
<p>The evidence we have suggests that at least 3 hours a day at 10k lux is a &quot;protective&quot; amount of light exposure, which usually happens outside. Intense indoor light might also work, but you know, studies are ongoing and science is never finished.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But then wouldn’t it mean that people living similar lives in, say, Dubai will have less cases of myopia than Helsinki? Even if they both spend equal amounts of time inside and outside, the one in Dubai will inevitably get exposed to more and brighter sunlight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The “time spent outdoors” theory doesn’t have anything to do with the amount of time spent focusing on near or far-away objects, it has to do with sunlight exposure. There’s some hormonal response that occurs in the eye when it’s exposed to sunlight that prevents the eye from elongating into the classic myopic shape, and that process is being prevented by modern humans’ indoor lifestyles, or so the theory goes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, very interesting.  That's a completely different mechanism, and pretty much invalidates my entire objection.</p>
<p>On the other hand, IIRC sunlight has a pretty good association with cataracts, so...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For this theory, is the sunlight-induced hormone presence due to the sunlight being <em>bright</em> or due to having specific (ie UV) frequency components not found indoors.</p>
<p>ie. to replicate the effect indoors, do you get UV lights or super-bright lights?  Is this at all linked to the Vitamin-D production pathway?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I disagree that this is a subtle difference. If someone asks &quot;does reading damage your eyes&quot; the answer is probably not. Close work does not <em>cause</em> myopia. That is, it's not about how much time you spend focusing near or far, it's a different mechanism</p></div>		</li>
