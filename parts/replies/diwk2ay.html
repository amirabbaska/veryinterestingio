<p>If the tether was quite long compared to the radius of the ship, you might begin to experience quite a lot more than 1G, and you might not have the strength to pull yourself in. I don't have the physics skills to calculate the actual numbers, tho, just the knowledge of the basic principles.</p>

<p>It's simpler than you might think.  The g-force from the rotation is proportional to the radius, and to the square of the rotational speed (rpms).  Since the station isn't speeding up or slowing down in this example, you get a simple linear relationship between radius and g-force.  If you double the radius, you double the force, and so on.</p></div>		</li>
