			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, just to add something I find interesting... I always thought the winter sky (from NA) had brighter stars because of some &quot;crisp winter air&quot; phenomenon. Nope. It's because in summer the earth is between the sun and the center of the Milky Way so the night sky is basking in the light of all those stars, causing the ones we can pick out to seem more faded and making some invisible. In the winter the sun is between us and the center, so the night sky is pointed out towards the void where there is less light &quot;pollution&quot; from our galaxy. So the stars in the night of winter seems more crisp. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, the crisp winter air thing is also a real thing.   Colder air hold less water.  Dryer air obscures less.   There's just less in the air to get in the way. </p>
<p>They both help in winter. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true. But before looking into it I had figured that the air was at least 90% of the explanation. But it's more like only 10% lol. Or whatever percentage, but not the main reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered this: Becasue orbit around the Milkey Way is 230 million years (give or take a day), what's the reference point? How can we even know the length of time consiering our species is so young? </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The reference point is a year. 31,449,600 sec.  more or less.    Or other galaxies if you want to... you know... look at something stable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can we even know the length of time considering our species is so young?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Math.  We know how much stuff is in the galaxy and where we are in the orbit around the core. We know how orbital mechanics work and can do the math. </p>
<p>Fun fact: We've been around the galaxy 11 times since life began on Earth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to measure an orbit's time long, you basically only need to know the distance between milky ways core and us because if you assume that the we are in a stable orbit the distance of the center of gravity is enough to calculate the rotational velocity (think of satellites, it they are in the same orbit (same height) and have a stable orbit (stay that way for longer time) they all move exactly at the same speed. That way you can position satellites in a few feet distance of each other: as long as their orbit stays stable, they will never collide</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can we know for sure that our orbit has/does remain stable? As we rotate around the MW we come closer or farther to other galaxies, don't we? Isn't it possible that their gravity would have some kind of effect on our orbit around the MW's center? </p></div>		</li>

<p>They also move around like how our sun slowly orbits the galactic core... but MAAAAN is that a lot slower in comparison to a year.</p>

<p>220 million years, roughly.</p></div>		</li>
