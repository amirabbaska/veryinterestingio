			<div class="markdown"><p>You are exactly right. They have become the biggest payout to the &quot;advisors&quot; selling them and one of the most expensive retirement vehicles. The department of labor fiduciary rule was a step in the right direction regarding this. Individuals that sell annuities at many places aren't registered investment advisors. They do not have securities licences and are not understand finra or the sec supervision. They are just a bunch of insurance agents charging people through the nose for annuities. It was a shame to see the dol rules pushed back. It was putting these insurance agents out of the retirement scam business.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There were aspects of the DOL ruling that I really liked and some that I didn't. Annuities do serve an important purpose, but only when they're used correctly.  The response several firms used to adopt the fiduciary responsibility was to limit the investment options down to a handful of proprietary investments, which is still not in the clients best interest. </p></div>		</li>

I remember hearing about that the day after I had to sit through the most boring 8 hour CLE legal seminar on elder law. Boy, as soon as they heard the word lawsuit they refunded every penny in investment and early term fees.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. Financial firms were also selling toxic securities they knew were &quot;bullshit&quot; to people claiming they were solid investments. These are just a couple examples and it still baffles me that Wall Street apologists still blame the financial crisis on poor people that bought houses they couldn't afford...</p></div>		</li>
