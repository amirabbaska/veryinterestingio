			<div class="markdown"><p>So I have a question.</p>
<p>How come in any folder, two files can't have the same name. But in the recycling bin, it doesn't matter?</p>
<p>You can have two thicc.jpg 's and the recycling bin doesn't care.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The recycling bin is another user experience thing. It's not an actual folder/directory. It's there for the average user who understands windows folders so they don't have to learn some new complicated concept. At its core, the recycling bin is a collection of references to deleted items. The computer says &quot;ok there was a file at this location with this name on this date.&quot;</p>
<p>From there it starts to get really technical about how different filesystems handle operations differently. Ext4, commonly used on linux systems, doesn't have a concept of a recycling bin. Deleting a file simply marks that memory location as writable. Windows is more lenient to the user.</p></div>		</li>
