			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll give the colours thing a go. From what I remember the colour we see something as is the colour that the object best reflects. If a ball is red, that is the colour in the spectrum that is best reflected off of that ball. So when light shines on that ball, red is the colour that is returned to our eyes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's assuming that dark matter even exists. Dark matter as we know it serves to fill the gap between the theory and what we observe. It is possible that gravity behaves differently at large scales and our theory is just off. Dark matter currently exists to validate the current theories that we have about gravity, but is by no means a sure thing.</p></div>		</li>
