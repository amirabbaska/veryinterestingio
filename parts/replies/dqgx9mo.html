			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to piggyback on the top answer, but if anyone's interested in impacts other than carbon footprint, here's an answer I wrote further down:</p>
<p>I wrote a paper that's open access, which you can find here: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745</a></p>
<p>The TLDR is that solar is good in terms of climate change but generally less good in terms of other impacts. Overall it's typically not as good as wind or nuclear power. However, bear in mind two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Impacts are very dependent on location. E.g. solar installed here in the UK is worse than in Nevada or Spain because the impacts are all up-front but you get much more energy output in sunny countries, therefore better impacts per kWh.</li>
<li>Solar technology is moving fast. I actually have some updated figures that I'd love to share with you but they're not published yet, so they're not peer-reviewed. Reductions in impacts in the past few years have been considerable: about 50% reduction between 2005 and 2015. So for instance I now estimate a carbon footprint of about 45 g CO2-eq./kWh for a UK installation or 27 g in Spain. This contrasts with the figure of 89g you'll see in the paper I linked.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: my first gilding - thank you! I'm not sure how interweb gold works, but hopefully I can turn this into a golden, diamond-studded pimp cane in the style of early-2000s Snoop. For science, obviously.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Thank you everyone for your replies and input on my question. To be clear, I wasn't asking the question to defend or endorse any type of energy production. I know they all have pros and cons and I've learned a lot about solar and nuclear energy from this post. Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well like many industrial processes there are some fairly nasty chemicals involved, so to an extent we're relying on good regulation. There have been a few cases in China where various toxic spills have occurred from solar plants (e.g. see <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/08/AR2008030802595.html?referrer=emailarticle" target="_blank">here</a>). </p>
<p>There are also some issues with specific types of solar power, e.g. CdTe cells or CIGS cells, which contain cadmium. As you probably know, Cd is very toxic. There's currently a lot of work going on to eliminate Cd from all consumer equipment, so this should be solved in time.</p>
<p>In context though, it's important to remember that all of these impacts tend to be minimal compared to the environmental and health implications of coal power. So as long as we're replacing coal, it's still easily a benefit. And, of course, solar isn't much different to many other high tech industries, so it's not like the issues I mentioned above are uniquely problematic.</p>
<p>EDIT: a few people below are correctly pointing out that CIGS is copper-indium-gallium-selenium. However, normally there is cadmium in the buffer layer. There are basically 4 layers: molybdenum -&gt; CIGS -&gt; cadmium sulphide -&gt; doped zinc oxide.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, true as far as it goes, but it needs to be put in context.  If the toxic waste from solar panel manufacturing is dramatically less dangerous that the toxic waste of burning coal, it'll still be a huge net benefit to deploy lots of solar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We make some panels <em>from</em> highly toxic and carcinogenic compounds(aka waste). So yes, in some cases. But remember the amounts in play are fairly small (something like ~2 mm^3, or 110 mg) per CdTe panel. Other manufacturing processes have more or less risk depending on materials used and recycling procedures. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i've wondered about this in regards to the batteries and fuel cells being used for electric and hybrid vehicles as well. i haven't actually looked into it, but i read somewhere that the batteries in these things have the same carbon footprint as a car over like 9 years. that seems high, and i have to wonder if that's like the average including big giant trucks commuting on I-35 in rush hour traffic, or like, some average figured on a mid size sedan driving some reasonable distance not in rush hour or something.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The Union of Concerned Scientists has a good lifecycle analysis for electric cars you can read <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.  (Warning: PDF)</p>
<p>The chart that most directly answers your question is on page 3.  Long story short: As of 2015, the battery does add a little to the emissions created when building the car.  A little.  Not anything like nine years' worth.  It takes an average EV about 4,900 miles of driving before it's break-even with an average gasoline car.  Every mile after that is in the EV's favor, and on average (even when grid-powered) the EV has about half the lifetime emissions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's an important question. I'd say that the impacts of batteries in electric vehicles are important but often overstated. E.g. bear in mind that, even in a car with a very large battery like a Tesla Model S, the battery weighs about 500 kg, which is maybe a third of the car's total weight, and you're saving various metals that would otherwise be required in the engine, gearbox, etc. Most of the weight of the car is the same whether it's electric or otherwise: steel, aluminium, plastics. Granted, batteries contain some slightly exotic materials, but for instance they're only about 1% lithium, so again it's often overstated.</p>
<p>Here's <a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-full-report.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> looking at these kinds of questions. There's certainly a lot of literature on this stuff but it seems that the scientific community is struggling to keep up to date with the ever-improving battery chemistries, manufacturing methods, etc. so we're chasing a moving target.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Over what period of time is that CO2-eq./kWh? I would have figured that the costs for CO2 would be relatively stagnant after creation and installation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, pretty much all the impact is up-front: raw material extraction, manufacture, installation. But of course CO2 persists in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, so it's still contributing to the cumulative problem of climate change. In this case we basically add up the entire greenhouse gas emissions over the lifespan of the installation (assumed to be roughly 25 years) and divide those emissions by the amount of electricity generated by the system in that time.</p></div>		</li>

<p>1) It's a very low yield power plant in terms of power production per unit of flooded area</p>
<p>2) The flooded area is extremely rich with organic life, which now gets trapped at the dam, decays and off-gases into the atmosphere </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't really analyze the net impact of carbon sequestration of the area, and they don't analyze external carbon dioxide at all - these sediments would flow downstream and interact with ecosystems there, which is not considered, and they give only token consideration to the carbon performance of the ecosystem before the dam was there. It certainly relates to local carbon dioxide emissions, but says absolutely nothing about relative net carbon dioxide impact due to the construction of the dam, which was the intent of the paper. Since the primary action of the dam is to trap sediments which then decompose, this is essential to providing any such analysis.</p>
<p>Seriously, what happens to the organic solids swept downriver? I assume they enter riverine, estuarine, and marine ecosystems, and unless those are known to sequester the vast majority of carbon dioxide (which I doubt), this data doesn't mean what it's being presented to mean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be the top voted answer. While this data only looks at CO2, it demonstrates actual numbers and isn't just guesswork on the ecological footprint based on arbitrary dollar value.</p>
<p>Other data I've seen compares strongly with this data on other ecological matters, though I don't have any of those sources with me anymore.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that despite the popular idea about nuclear power being environmentally harmful and deadly, it's actually currently one of the safest and greenest solutions, compared to all other sources including solar power, as demonstrated by these and many other data.</p>
<p>Therefore, solar is a good environmentally friendly solution but nuclear power is greener, from start to finish, per kilowatt hour.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yup, among people who look at data and aren't ruled by the 24-hour news cycle, Nuclear looks to be an excellent transition technology with several variants and approaches that (properly)
make most of our reactors look like antiques. </p>
<p>PWRs also are just fine in the ocean (this coming from somebody who is an absurd nerd for sea life)...and WAY better than acidification ...the damage to pteropods in particular is pretty disconcerting. </p></div>		</li>

<p>To be fair most nuclear reactors are antiques. That is a testament to their durability and reliability. They can run for decades.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It says a lot to how the narrative is controlled in the media and politics that this issue gets almost completely ignored. Certain groups like to pretend like the &quot;science isn't in&quot; usually because it was cold one day and they brought a snowball to the debate or some such nonsense, or like we can simply reverse &quot;warming&quot; through some creative geoengineering. Acidification is real, cause irreversible damage, and happening <em>right now</em>, but fighting this nationalist tide and getting anyone to acknowledge that there are important things happening outside your borders is an uphill battle to say the least.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ALSO worth mentioning that coal power releases WAY more radiation into the environment than nuclear because the exhuast carries a lot of radioactive material into the atmosphere whereas nuclear traps and contains it all.</p>
<p>Even in the case of a meltdown and Japan-style leak there are fewer cancers that result from nuclear than coal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to keep in mind that nuclear power is not viable outside of 1st world nations because of the high up front cost and the massive amount of infrastructure.

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent point.</p>
<p>However, is solar actually any easier to maintain than nuclear once built? I would think a third world country without industrial power would have problems supplying the necessities for either one and would have to trade for the supplies.</p>
<p>Though there is more of a political problem for nations that aren't already political powers. The US essentially martials the world's nuclear program, and pretty much refuses to new nations to develop their own. Look at North Korea and Iran. The US government had a tantrum when they began developing nuclear facilities...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How so?</p>
<p>Governments around the world have had to funnel tremendous amounts of money into solar and wind power just to get the technology and infrastructure to where they are today so that it's become cheap enough to actually supply meaningful quantities of electricity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, numerous nuclear power plants have been been up and been supplying us with vast quantities of power for a long time, for decades. The largest blockade for them, by far, being political advocates who still to this day believe it's a dangerous and &quot;unclean&quot; technology.</p>
<p>The only reason these governments even started to invest in solar and wind was because the pushback against nuclear was so strong that they couldn't move forward with projects at a reasonable pace.</p></div>		</li>
