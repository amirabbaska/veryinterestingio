<p>Muscle Soreness is really just light pain - mild discomfort caused by disturbances in your nerves electro-chemical balance</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can you say more about this? I have a neuroscience background but very little knowledge about how that pertains to broader physiology. This sounds very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your nerves sense by measuring the difference in voltage between the outside of the cell membrane and the inside. The voltage difference is created by the na-k pumps which keep the cell at the right osmotic pressure (in practically all cells) and for nerves, keep it at the right pressure and the right voltage potential; one side has a slightly higher concentration of positive ions, meaning there is a relative difference in voltage. When that voltage gets disrupted, your nerves signal pain. The bigger the disruption, the more nerves signal pain and the stronger the response in your brain.</p>
<p>So lets think about what tissue repair, be it muscle or otherwise, does. It takes materials, sometimes dissolved in the blood and sometimes wrapped in carrier cells/packages and moves it into cells. That movement is across cell membranes, which have specially formed 'ports' designed to accept those materials. Good deal right?</p>
<p>Well it turns out most of the raw materials a cell uses are pretty big - a sugar molecule is roughly twice the size of potassium, and probably 4-5 times the size of sodium. But sugar is <em>the smallest</em> of the materials crossing the cell membrane. Amino acids are hundreds of times larger, and the mechanisms that transport them across cell membranes tend to leak. The waste created in tissue repair also tends to leak, and some of that waste has both a charge to it <em>and</em> isn't something that your nerves are built to capture (to restore their ideal resting potential). this build up of waste (which is continually being cleaned out and pushed in by tissue growth) is a mild disturbance of the mechanism your cells use to signal pain. It's not a bad cut, and it's not always in the same place, but it is noticeable. With how important insulin is in signalling cells to accept raw materials and get rid of their waste, that such a disturbance (driven by exercise) creates a delayed light pain (soreness) is expected.</p>
<p>Basically, if your nerves are your 10 year old son you've tasked with spotting cop cars while you drive, tissue repair (and thus muscle repair) creates a lot of mustangs and chargers that <em>look</em> like cop cars, but you know they're actually not. If you exercise enough, he gets better at not giving false alarms.</p></div>		</li>
