			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yeah it has to put energy into the system but it doesn't have to throw something out? If 2 large stars in a binary system encountered a smaller star couldn't that be captured while only affecting their orbits some? or some sort of collision?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Triple systems are unstable. It is true that one way the triple could become a binary is through two stars colliding, but that is very rare -usually one star will escape. It does happen though - massive &quot;blue stragglers&quot; are thought to result from the collisions of two smaller stars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well not necessarily, like a triple system that is a binary + a star, no? Like could a star enter a binary system of two much more massive stars in a way to be captured in an orbit around them?</p></div>		</li>
