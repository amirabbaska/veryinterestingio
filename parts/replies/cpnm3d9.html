			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, bulimics intentionally give themselves diarrhea?  I've never heard about this before.  Doesn't that negate the whole idea of eating disorders being a way for sufferers to attempt to control something in their lives?  After all, diarrhea has its own schedule and cannot be controlled.</p></div>		</li>
