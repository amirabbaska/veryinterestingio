			<div class="markdown"><p>To put it in perspective, the B53 bomb built in the Cold War has a 8 megaton yield. Aka 8,000,000 tons of TNT equivalent. The MOAB the US dropped last week has a 11 ton yield. So we are multiple orders of magnitude more powerful. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>11 Tons as in 22000 pounds of TNT.</p>
<p>There is a difference to be noted as the rating is in the total energy released. The MOAB is designed to generate a strong pressure wave that destroys the surrounding area. Nukes release much more energy but in the form of radiation that incinerates the surrounding area. Of course there is also a huge pressure wave associated but that is only a portion of the effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there a heat difference as well?  As in the heat flash and the temperature of the fireball created after detonation are much higher than they would ever reach with a conventional explosive?</p></div>		</li>
