			<div class="markdown"><p>In a word: Communication.</p>
<p>Most of the aircraft in the sky (in the US) aren't commercial aircraft - they're people out there who enjoy flying. This means that their goal isn't just to go from point A to point B. As a result, their movement is difficult to predict unless you're on the other end hearing &quot;Okay, I'm going to practice simulated emergency descents in location X&quot; - if you have a human on the other end who hears this, they can say &quot;okay, people should probably stay above altitude Y in location X - it looks like planes A, B, and C are in that area so I should let them know.&quot;</p>
<p>A robot, on the other hand, has two difficulties here. One: they need to identify that the plane is doing simulated emergency descents in location X. It's unclear how the robot would hear a human say that and then know what they're talking about. Two: They need to relay that information to all the other aircraft in an efficient manner, some of whom may need the robot to read back what it is that they said because radio communication is sometimes static-y.</p>
<p>Even if you could make a robot that identifies the situation and sends out a communication, you would still need a human in the booth to field questions from pilots who need information. Pilots need to know, for instance, what altitude the cloud cover is over at location X and how far that cloud cover extends (some pilots cannot fly through clouds, it requires a particular training, so this can be very important information). A robot that relies on voice commands from people would be extremely inefficient, which would clog up the radio waves - have you ever called a company that has a robot walk you through a series of menus? It takes forever.</p>
<p>A last point: Whatever robot you make needs to be compatible with all current planes, pilots, and current ATC systems or else you just regulated thousands of people/planes out of the sky which they're going to be none too happy with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And despite how &quot;good&quot; Google Home/Assistant, Alexa, and Siri are at recognizing voices and providing accurate responses, think about how much they really suck.  How often do you find yourself repeating the same basic phrase/question to your home automation or phone before it understands you?  Or, how often does it provide you with irrelevant or incorrect responses?  Now, try it with an Italian, Indian, Chinese, or Arabic accent.  Now do it in an emergency situation with an engine out and alarms going off... and you get Siri replying back, I'm sorry, I can't help with that.</p>
<p>And these are some of the best AI that are available and they are quite terrible at it relative to a human.</p>
<p>It's referenced here all the time, but read the SR-71 blackbird story about where the crew got an ATC to actually crack a smile and you'll begin to understand what these guys routinely do a hundred times an hour all day every day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ATC humans are there for the edge cases.  The boring stuff can be understood by software.  Interacting with humans in strange situations requiring judgment calls is hard to deal with.</p>
<p>It's already complicated when you need to get 6 aircraft lined up to land, with different speeds each aircraft like to fly--- but this is the kind of optimization problem computers can excel at.</p>
<p>But then you realize one of the guys is a student pilot and won't be able to give you the same speeds on descent that someone really experienced in type could.  Then someone else tells you they have a radio navigation failure and can't do a certain procedure.  Someone else wants to be expedited because they have a passenger in duress in the back-- how should this be prioritized compared to the other stuff?  A helicopter asks to enter the airspace to perform photography in ____ general area-- can you negotiate with him in terms he can understand about what he can and can't do?  Then a pilot has a real emergency, and desperately needs help--- you clear out traffic from in front of him and offer him suggestions on things he could do-- runways he could make, what vector to turn based on the actual failure he has, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I flew out of an international airport in my skyhawk once.  Got airborne, and noticed my voltage was dropping.  Dang.  Alternator failure.  I requested clearance to land, and the tower was like </p>
<p>&quot;Is everything okay?&quot;</p>
<p>me: &quot;Just an alternator failure.   I probably have half an hour of battery left.  No big deal, just ought to land.&quot;</p>
<p>Then maybe 30 seconds passed, and a different voice said </p>
<p>&quot;Okay, we're switching to the light signals.  No need for further transmissions.  Waggle your wings if you'd like to declare an emergency.  Don't worry sir, we can have a truck with foam down there in a minute flat.  We've cleared the pattern, make a direct approach and land at your discretion.  If you come to a stop before you reach the jetway, we'll get a tow truck out to you ASAP.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, honest to god, they started flashing a green light at me.   </p>
<p>I got the impression they were having a slow day and the new guy was being drilled on emergencies.   But I doubt there's any software that could have done all that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh I bet.  And I'm sure mr radio guy got bonus points for recognizing that radio broadcasts drain my battery faster, and instructing me to no longer reply to his transmissions.   When I touched down and he offered me progressive taxi, though, that was a bit too much!   ;-)</p></div>		</li>
