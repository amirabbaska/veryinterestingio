<p>even from a purely aesthetic perspective original simulation does look better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Question... if I can see the black hole from that distance/perspective--assuming I'm in a spacecraft with amazing life support capabilities but mediocre thrust--am I going to be sucked into the black hole?  </p>
<p>And would getting to a higher orbit require more energy than a similarly sized but less dense object?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One is not sucked into a black hole any more than one is sucked onto a planet. If you are stationary above it you will likely fall down. If you enter orbit above it its just like any orbit.</p>
<p>Black holes are very dense, but weigh less than the stars they were made from. So, think of it like if our Sun became really small and stored producing light, but has the same gravitational pull: out here we wouldn't notice a difference, but really close you have the event horizon.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;similarly sized but less dense&quot; means it has less gravity. So yes that affects the energy required to get to a higher orbit. </p></div>		</li>

<p>A spinning black hole actually looks non-spherical, it gets deformed into a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/PajDVOE.png" target="_blank">weird-looking kidney shape</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Never knew that actually, that's really interesting! Only thing I knew about rotating black holes is that you can actually attain a stable orbit inside the event horizon, something you can't do in a non rotating one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never get that last part, if nothing can ever go in from an outside observers pov then why do we see it as black and not the colours of everything on the surface of the event horizon?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's just called black because no light escapes it, you'd never actually see it since it bends light around itself and any light that escapes would probably be horrendously red shifted. It's not actually black but can be considered as such because it produces/reflects no light.</p>
<p>Edit, I should clear up that any light that escapes and is red shifted would have to be just outside the event horizon or further. No light leaves the surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons, first being that the light right on the horizon is still there, the gravity is so strong it can't actually reach your eyes for you to see it.</p>
<p>The second being that any light too close to it is red shifted, meaning visible light's wavelength is stretched into infrared, microwave, or radio waves; which you can't see even if they reached your eyes.</p>
<p>Edit: Light and other light speed stuff accumulates at the event horizon of more active black holes, so if you fell into one you would be vaporized at the event horizon from the buildup of heat and other energy. So the light is there, but it takes it awhile to get away from the event horizon if it's right near it and moving away from the black hole. Also I just remembered you need to be looking at stuff straight on when it's near the event horizon to see it if you can, because any light moving at an angle relative to the event horizon isn't moving fast enough away to get away from the black hole.</p></div>		</li>
