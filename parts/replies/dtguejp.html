			<div class="markdown"><p>Then why do most people have a &quot;gap&quot; in their singing voices between their normal chest voice and their falsetto voice? If the movement of the larynx is continuous (I.E. more positions than just &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;) why is there this gap?</p>
<p>And more importantly, why does falsetto SOUND different than a chest voice? And why can some people sing the same notes in falsetto and chest voice and the notes sound different? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can practice the gap away, and go straight from full register to falsetto. Also, the way i understand it, is that those mucus membranes are smaller, and therefore they vibrate faster, which in turn makes the pitch higher.</p>
<p>Edit: Oh wait, my comment doesnt make sense in the context. Read the comment below if you dont understand mine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In going from normal to falsetto, you are changing the mode of oscillation of your vocal folds. In going from one mode to another as you tighten them you will get an zone of instability where they dont know which mode to follow - this is the gap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so horrendousously wrong I don't know ow where to begin. So those African ladies with long necks where they stretch them out with rigns now have super low voices? Adult female sopranos, usually much larger than children, can actually sing HIGHER than most children...</p>
<p>LENGTH AND THICKNESS OF VOCAL FOLDS. Just like a guitar strings or piano string, or marimba key, determines higher or lower (no references because sorry...it's just wrong). Vocal folds are just vibrating like strings basically.</p>
<p>When you stick you chin out it makes your folds more tense, which raises them in pitch slightly...it ain't your &quot;neck length&quot; whatever that means. Sorry to be a dick but this is big-time wrong.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is ELI5 dude, relax. Don’t get fixated on the word neck. Larynx size plays the biggest role in voice quality because a bigger larynx allows for bigger, thicker vocal folds. While their is no room for large, thick folds in a small larynx. </p>
<p>Also, I didn’t say tall people have low voices. I said they “often” do. It’s a generalization with the capacity for exceptions, and we all can think of an exception. I can myself.</p>
<p>And it’s okay :) I forgive you for being a dick. Just read slowly and more carefully next time and you’ll avoid these awkward situations. </p></div>		</li>
