<p>The Internet age, nothing disappears. Seems almost juvenile to even try that. </p>
<p>Now to stop data gathering, that's a different issue, so I see your point. This administration could be trying to do both. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can say &quot;nothing disappears&quot; but it's not that easy. I while back I attended a seminar discussing the data-management techniques they were using to upgrade the archive of Landsat images, which go back to the seventies and were mostly stored on magnetic tape.</p>
<p>Long story short, it costs a lot of money, time, and effort to serve that data to scientists who want to study this and that about historical land types/plant types/use types. Without funding, it's a race to download petabytes of archives and get them up into some other host, and keep them up. (Which is actually something that's happened recently, over just these fears.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Nothing disappears&quot; is a cautionary note, not an assurance. You should be cautions with what younput up because it might be around forever. That doesn't mean it's necessarily the case. Esepcially with large archives of data that aren't widely mirrored or easily reproduced.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's harder than it sounds when you have TBs(or more, probably closer to petabytes) of data, some(most) of it not on publicly available websites. </p>
<p>They're not cached/backed up like say, an image on Facebook. It's too big. If you take away the gateway in front, it gets enormously harder to access (hence the rush to download/back up).</p>
<p>Part of the reason they're even on government servers is how difficult it is to host that data.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this is a stupid question, but isn't every other first world country watching this stuff pretty closely?  I get that it sucks that the U.S. has to slide backwards, but other countries are picking up the slack right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to be cynical to think that way. All available evidence supports the hypothesis. They have actively stated they don't believe in climate change and don't want to document it. It's just an accurate view.</p></div>		</li>
