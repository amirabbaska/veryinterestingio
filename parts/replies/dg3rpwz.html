			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing you can do that can impact global-scale ocean warming and ocean acidification is to persistently push for political action on climate change, which is harder than ever in the current US political environment but still really really important. Press your politicians, educate yourself on ocean issues, talk to people about it. </p>
<p>On a more local scale, communities can act to reduce the local-scale threats and stresses to marine ecosystems (like coral reefs) by things like reducing pollution and sediment/nutrient runoff from land, adopting sustainable fishing and seafood-buying habits. These measures do not change the global impacts to the ecosystems, but they do give the species in the ecosystems their best shot at tolerating/adapting/recovering from the global impacts. It's like if you're going to battle against a monster (climate change) you want your army in the best health possible, and not sick from things that you DO have the capacity to change. It's not a solution to the big problem, but it's a way to reduce the damage from the big problem and buy time to solve the big problem.</p>
<p>You can also support the research that is looking at how to identify the most resilient corals and use them in ecosystem restoration, or similar things in other kinds of ecosystems - either by more political action to save the budgets of science agencies and programs (like NOAA, the National Science Foundation, the Sea Grant program), direct crowdfunding of research (which is becoming more common), or supporting NGOs that fund this kind of research. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The cause is global warming - and, honestly, there is nothing that anyone can do - the warming that will largely kill off the world's coral reefs is already baked in - even if we turned off every coal- and gas-fired power station today.</p></div>		</li>
