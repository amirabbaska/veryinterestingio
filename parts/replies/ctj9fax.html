			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed.  Think of all the New World infections that jumped to humans for the first time when we settled the Americas - consider Chagas disease, coccidiomycosis, borreliosis, and others.  These are agents that didn't evolve to infect humans, but our immune systems aren't evolved to defend against either.  Some reptilian infections like salmonella can be passed on to humans; I'd be surprised if there weren't some reasonably aggressive pathogens capable of killing humans out there. It's dangerous and presumptuous to assume we have more sophisticated immune systems than mammals of the era.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the difference is that the new world americas already had humans so there was an environment in which human-targeting viruses/bacteria could evolve. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These infectious agents were already evolved, mostly to target other mammals - deer, rodents, bats. It should be noted though that bird infections also can be transmitted to humans and dinosaurs would have been physiologically similar to present day birds...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd think at least a few nematodes or bacteria that evolved to just gnaw through flesh (dinosaur or whatever) might have a good chance of doing serious damage to a human, since our immune systems would probably have never seen them before, but this is a guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Our immune system is a lot more adaptive than you might think, and I suspect that our reaction to &quot;large&quot; parasites would be much the same as it is now, inflammation. Our first lines of defense work pretty much the same way against any infection, and parasites are somewhat easy to recognize unless they've specifically evolved to hide from our immune system.</p></div>		</li>
