<p>This. The entierty of Eurasia (including northern Africa) was extremely active in terms of war and trade. The turnover rate was huge - if you weren't among the top technologically, politically and economically you were gone. This surley must be one of the main reasons why Eurasian civlizations eventually ended up expanding into and subjugating non-Eurasian civlizations, rather than the opposite happening. </p></div>		</li>
