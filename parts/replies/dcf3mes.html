			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thought I'd chime in with a bit about Refeeding Syndrome. </p>
<p>The risks and triggers are less than you'd think. It's usually defined as starvation for just 5 days or &gt;10% weight loss rapidly. </p>
<p>In a hospital setting in the UK the people who typically end up Refeeding seem (in my experience, anyway) to be alcoholics (poor nutrition in a liquid diet, separate from but often alongside Wernicke's), people who are nil by mouth (bowel obstruction etc) or who have been unable to feed themselves at home (too sick,  anorexia etc) or have lost the weight for a metabolic reason (or advanced cancers). </p>
<p>Insulin levels drop, cell metabolism (and gut function) goes into a power saving mode. Bear in mind that your cells are constantly moving things back and forth across their membranes. </p>
<p>Anyway, physiologically, it's a combination of electrolyte disturbance and red cell dysfunction. </p>
<p>Electrolytes are the salts in the body and blood and are needed so that cells will work properly. </p>
<p>You measure the blood phosphate of somebody starved, it'll be normal because the body tries to maintain normal levels in the blood, but the total body phosphate will be low. Other electrolytes that drop are calcium, magnesium and potassium. They all have important functions (making energy, moving stuff into and out of cells) that cause various body systems to misbehave. Very low potassium will cause odd heart rhythms and cardiac arrest. </p>
<p>When you start feeding someone, insulin spikes and the gut starts up. All those miniscule resources of electrolytes are needed in the cells rather than the blood serum and get pulled intracellularly. </p>
<p>Blood levels drop and can't keep up with energy demands. Chaos ensures. </p>
<p>It can be controlled though: keeping a close eye on electrolyte levels, replacing them as needed. Typing up vitamins such as thiamine before starting a feed and during starvation and slowly reintroducing food. </p>
<p>Edit: this showed up in my feed and I thought it was an askscience rather than an ELI5, I've tried to explain terms but if anyone wants more clarity on anything let me know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Potentially, often related to nerve damage. In starvation the body breaks down muscle, then fat (why starvation diets are crappy), then other tissues. It tries to preserve the brain and nerves till last, because it's capacity to regenerate them is very limited. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man. You'll have to google yourself as I'm on my phone but there was a study done (Norway?) on this. Basically results suggested that males who went through famine just before puberty produced offspring for several generations who were LESS likely to developed diabetes or heart disease. </p>
<p>It was very interesting stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not really sure if there are permanent effects, though I'd imagine that there'd would be because during starvation, your organs will shrink, your skin dries and cracks, you can get multiple heart problems, your kidneys can stop working completely, your muscles will atrophy, among other things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about back then, but now, we have IV drips that supply enough nutrition to get the body working near acceptable levels, then we would slowly feed them more and more. I would think they just fed them really slowly and upped the amount gradually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  There are two forms of nutrition support, total parenteral nutrition (nutrition from a IV) and enteral nutrition (nutrition from a tube usually  inserted in the nose or mouth that goes into the stomach or small intestine).  In my hospital if we suspect someone is at risk for refeeding we will slowly advance their nutrition support to their individualized goal over the course of 72 hours.  While this is going on we check their bloodwork and electrolytes every 6 hours and give them electrolytes supplements if needed.</p></div>		</li>
