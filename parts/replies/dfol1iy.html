			<div class="markdown"><p>The German &quot;von&quot; and Dutch &quot;van&quot; may be the same preposition (of/from), but in names they have very different meanings and origins.
In Dutch &quot;van&quot; in a name often indicates location, as you say. However, in German the &quot;von&quot; was a privilege of nobility until 1919 (with some exceptions of course, especially in northern Germany,  i. e. close to the Netherlands). The &quot;von&quot; was what is called an &quot;Adelspr√§dikat&quot; (a sign of nobility) and indicated association with an important lineage, not necessarily a location. Take for example the poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. He was born a common citizen in Frankfurt in 1749 as Johann Wolfgang Goethe (no von). He was made a nobleman in 1782 by Kaiser Joseph II, which added the &quot;von&quot; to his name.
Interestingly the nobility does have an additional way to indictate location in a name, namely with &quot;zu&quot; (to/at). So someone would be called  &quot;von [family name] zu [location]&quot; or &quot;von und zu [family name]&quot; if the person is living in the family's traditional location. </p>
<p>The virtually exclusive use of &quot;von&quot; for nobility also explains why names with &quot;von&quot; are much less common in German than names with &quot;van&quot; are in Dutch. </p></div>		</li>
