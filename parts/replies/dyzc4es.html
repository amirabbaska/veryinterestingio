			<div class="markdown"><p>Digging deeper: we have schemas for tons of different types of memories, including motor. When your brain wants to do something, the planning part (prefrontal cortex) talks to the motor part (precentral gyrus). The motor part then tries to relay this information to your muscles. Before it can do this, the motor regulator (basal ganglia) either promotes or inhibits these motor inputs. I’m no expert, but I would guess the basal ganglia play an import role in adapting existing motor schemas to new situations. I’m sure the coordination center (cerebellum) also plays a major role. Damage to the basal ganglia causes movement disorders like Parkinson’s or Huntington’s. Cerebellar damage causes intention tremor, which is exactly like having damaged motor schemas (I try to point at an object but my finger doesn’t oblige). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An additional note: It's not actually that difficult to estimate the throw in most cases. Yes, the trashbag might irregular in shape and have uneven weight distribution, but if it's heavy enough it'll fly pretty much the same as any other non-aerodynamic, dense object (i.e. the normal parabola). It only gets really difficult when it's a very light object, there's strong wind, or the object has a shape that significantly affects aerodynamics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Likely not, the same way we can’t look at a brain and say ‘here is a memory of his white cat’. We MIGHT be able to say ‘this guys has a large (brain section) so he probably had a lot of things he was coordinated with, but there isn’t a way to tell if it was throwing, swimming, running, juggling, or underwater basket weaving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not with any meaningful degree of accuracy, as a motor pattern is, if I had to compare it to something, more like a memory.  It's a learned series of coordinated movements across thousands of motor units.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no way to read someone's brain like that.  </p>
<p>You can tell by looking at a skeleton if someone threw a <em>lot</em>, and infer accuracy from that, but you would really have no evidence of that.  </p>
<p>You could also look at a body and determine if the person could throw faster, things like longer moment arms around joint levers, direction of pull of muscle attachments, things like that.  But once again, you wouldn't really have any evidence of accuracy, only a <em>potential</em> to throw faster.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense, thanks for the answer. btw, what are memories? Are they electrical signals (as opposed to physical structures)?</p></div>		</li>
