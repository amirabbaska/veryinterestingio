			<div class="markdown"><p>...First of all let me just congratulate you for genuinely catching off guard... that's not something that happens to me every day online. Ok yes... wow... honestly I have no idea. I'm not sure if anyone has done a uh... a nutritional analysis of human eggs. I would of course point out (what I suspect you know) that they are <em>very</em> small; in essence you'd need quite a few women's lifetime output for an... omelette. </p>
<p>That said, I'm pretty sure (based on what I know about the human ovum) that it would lack the key properties of chicken eggs. Human eggs don't have albumin, a &quot;yolk&quot;, lecithin, or anything you expect from eggs in the culinary sense. The human egg doesn't carry its own food with it it; that's provided by the uterine lining and placenta. Really, when we eat eggs, we're not <em>mostly</em> eating the little fleck of genetic info, but the large &quot;food store&quot; for growing the baby outside of the mother.</p></div>		</li>
