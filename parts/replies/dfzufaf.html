			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the inconsistency of grade names &quot;Achieved Standard&quot; and &quot;Standard Exceeded&quot; quite irritating.  The words are in a different order!  It would be more intuitive to call it &quot;Exceeded Standard&quot; and give a letter grade of &quot;E&quot; instead of &quot;S&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grade school had Es instead of Fs so as to not harm a child's confidence by telling them that they failed (which they really did fail).  I'm not sure if this system works I just thought it was odd even at a young age that the school would do everything in it's power to not let a child know they failed.</p></div>		</li>
