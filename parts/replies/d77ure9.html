			<div class="markdown"><p>It's no more surprising than the fact that a general integral is uncomputable or a general integer polynomial equation isn't solvable even numerically, any sufficiently general problem isn't decidable. The fact that there is no algorithm in general tells us nothing in the specific case, particularly since there is already ample numerical evidence that the gap exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's more than that. I should preface this by saying that I haven't studied the paper, I just gave a cursory overview. They say that they provide specific examples of theories where the existence of the spectral gap is undecidable, which means that it can't be proven one way or the other based on the axioms (they don't specify which axioms: I assume ZFC). </p>
<p>If this were to happen in the yang-mills case, it would basically mean that ZFC is not enough to explain reality, which I believe would be pretty unsettling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, yeah, but what they prove is that they can encode arbitrary Turing machines into their physical theories. Then ZFC can't decide whether or not the machine that searches for a contradiction in ZFC halts. </p>
<p>This is still surprising, but the idea of &quot;you can encode powerful computational processes into definitions of physical theories&quot; is -- at least intuitively to me as a lay person -- less surprising. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would it indicate that ZFC can't explain reality? You can easily construct undecidable problems in ZFC. E.g. Turing machine termination or equivalence. </p>
<p>Edit: in fact, looks like that's exactly what these guys did. <a href="http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2586" target="_blank">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2586</a></p>
<p>This paper doesn't say anything about the relationship between ZFC and reality. It's just a nice reduction from Turing machines to an infinitely repeated lattice of finite-dimensional hilbert spaces and hamiltonians binding adjacent spaces. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was at a conference last year where one of the authors spoke on this, it seems very interesting (although I'm a mathematician, the physicists in the room seemed less impressed/didn't like the heavy logic).</p></div>		</li>
