			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not smart, but what I got from this is that when you bend it, you flex what makes the plastic plastic, and the bits (polymer chains) line up differently in the plastic, which causes the light to reflect differently from the material.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got a piece of plastic that's a certain color. When you stretch it, it causes the stuff it's made of to crystallize, which basically means the molecules in the plastic become really organized all of a sudden (thanks to the way you're bending it). This process causes the plastic to reflect back all light hitting it (too organized and rigid to soak in any light or color), making it appear white.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plastic is made up long, narrow repeating chain chemicals (called polymers).  Some of these chains are aligned (crystalline) and others are jumbled together like a plate of cooked spaghetti (amorphous).  When there are enough aligned chains, that the groups are the same size as the wavelength of visible light, they scatter light resulting in the plastic becoming opaque.  When there are no aligned chains (all of them are jumbled together) the plastic is clear or transparent.  When you bend plastic (or heat it to the right temperature) you force the chains to align which creates the opaque, white chains.  </p>
<p>Since you specifically asked about colored plastics.  Colored plastics have a small amount of pigment mixed in with the plastic that reflect only a portion of the visible light (in their color).  The same bending causes chains to align occurs, but in this case you create many new aligned chains that scatter all colors of light.  All the new chains you create scatter far more light than the pigment is reflecting, so the color changes to white.  Sort of like if you had a small colored flashlight in daylight, even though you have a colored light, it's so much less bright than the sun, it becomes very hard to see the small amount of reflected colored light.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 answer, messy hair can look dull, but when you pull it straight it can look better. </p>
<p>Plastic is a pile of crystals and other junk in a mess that looks clear or whatever color it is, when you bend it it pulls it straight changing how it looks in that area. </p>
<p>Here's another example, static on the TV looks like nothing till you line a bunch of the black /white up then it forms lines. </p></div>		</li>
