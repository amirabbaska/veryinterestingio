			<div class="markdown"><p>Like Bacardi 151, Wild Turkey 101, etc?  Yes, I think that's the idea, though not sure it would really be of note at a lower ABV, typically they try to market the higher ABV liquors.</p>
<p>Not sure why OP says that most flavored liquors are 35%, a lot of schnaps, cordials, etc are much lower - 12-20%.  You can drink schnaps straight over ice.  You can also do that with many liquors, but I mean you could have a few full rocks glasses of schnaps and not be totally on your ass at the end of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically the lower ABVs are classed as liqueurs, due to the alcohol content, but with flavoured spirits are usuall 35, while the non-flavoured version is 40% . I'm talking vodkas and rums/spiced rums.</p></div>		</li>
