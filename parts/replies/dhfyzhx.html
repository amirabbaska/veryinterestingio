			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, gluons should contribute to the spin. I should note that the linked Wikipedia cites sources with conflicting results regarding how much different effects contribute, so I will defer to any experts here who can comment on the current status of this problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert in this subject matter but I have explored the proton spin crisis out of a lay interest and my understanding is that there are actually a multitude of experiments now all designed to test this specific question (how much does each type of parton contribute to the proton's spin) and many of the finished experimental results so far are actually just straight in conflict with each other lol.  :|  I believe that does explain the conflicting results on Wikipedia:  the results available are simply in disagreement about the proportions right now.  Just about the only thing they do all seem to agree on is that it's not 100% from the valence quarks.  Maybe there have been more developments I'm not aware of though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So in the most basic sense, is it correct if I say that whilst (in the Bohr model) exited states of Hydrogen are increased potential energies of the electron, exited states of baryons have higher energies in the form of mass (due to E=mc^2)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are not mutually exclusive. An excited hydrogen atom has a slightly larger mass than a ground state hydrogen atom due to E = mc^(2) too.</p>
<p>And some of that extra energy in a delta baryon is potential energy from the interactions betweens the quarks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the kinetic energy of the electron also contributes to the total energy. To be very precise, I would say (in both the Bohr model and full QM) that the excited states in Hydrogen are due to a a decrease in the kinetic energy but a larger increase in the potential energy. For the Hydrogen atom you can prove that in going to an excited state with extra energy ΔE, the kinetic energy decreases by ΔE but the potential energy increases by 2ΔE to make up the total energy shift (this holds exactly in the Bohr model, and on average in real QM).</p>
<p>In a generic situation you don't always know &quot;how much&quot; energy is going into kinetic versus potential or other forms without doing the specific calculation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>exited states of baryons have higher energies in the form of mass (due to E=mc^(2))</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The excited baryon states are also due to kinetic and interaction energies of quarks and gluons etc. But all energy takes the form of mass. A Hydrogen atom in its first excited state is actually more massive than a Hydrogen atom in its ground state, and and both are lighter than a free proton mass plus a free electron mass.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wait, why have I never heard that before?</p>
<p>So the binding energy between a proton and an electron in the ground state, which you can calculate using only the Coulomb potential, the centripetal force and the Bohr radius, is ~-13.60 eV. And this energy corresponds to the mass the Hydrogen is lighter than the sum of the masses of the free particles?</p></div>		</li>
