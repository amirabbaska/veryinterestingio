			<div class="markdown"><p>Great post. One thing to add; Reddit's user culture encourages that type of clickbait, since people vote based on the headline instead of the quality of the article. </p></div>		</li>

<p><strong>Research Paper</strong>: A might affect B given conditions C, more research needed.</p>
<p><strong>University press release</strong>: There is a chance that A might effect B.</p>
<p><strong>Associated Press</strong>: A might affect B, according to University scientists.</p>
<p><strong>Mainstream News</strong>: A affect B ! Scientists says so!</p>
<p><strong>Buzzfeed</strong>: You won't believe what miracles A can do!</p>
<p><strong>Facebook</strong>: A cures everything. The cover up from the government !!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget the YouTube video where they guy who claims to have the cure passionately insists he reason he can only do a YouTube video for the truth is because of Big Pharma and guvment coverup. THAT is what seals the deal for my FIL and SIL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, my Facebook is littered with &quot;Cancer cures they don't want you to know about&quot; the most popular of which is cannabis. Apparently the government and big pharma know that cannabis destroys cancer but can't make money from it, which is why it is illegal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ugh. One of the worst was this picture of a girl with tape all over her face and written on the tape was some nonsense about how big pharma has a cancer cure but wants you to suffer. I was really disappointed in every who shares that. Cmon, your source is a girl with tape on her face. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth to mention that things that eventually work out are things that are fruit of years of work, like CRISPR. You hear about it. Is it miracle? No. Do they know how it works? Kinda. How long will it take to develop cancer cure trials? Years, if it even turns out to be effective.</p>
<p>What I mean is that the real breakthrough doesn't happen on reddit, Huffington Post or Daily Mail. It happens in the lab, on pages of academic papers and every once in a while it will be mentioned in Nature, Science Daily or Medical Journal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is one thing that really annoys me about r/science. The top posts generally source from 3rd party news sites and it takes extra effort from readers to evaluate claims. Granted the OP usually posts a link to the relevant paper, but why not do that in the first place?</p></div>		</li>

<p>all the rest will come after years, if it even gets to human trials.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor can be the difference between clinical and statistical significance.  A trial can determine that an intervention is effective 99.9% of the time, but only increases your life span by 0.01%. A reporter may pick up on the high confidence level in the result, and ignore the fact that said result will not have a meaningful impact on anyone's condition. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, or the possibility that the results are statistical flukes. With a confidence level of 0.01, you will (in theory) see a false positive once every 100th trial. Thus, news papers, Reddit, etc. will report the one, magnificent finding that might just be a false positive, and fail to report that there are - in fact - 99 other trials who have shown no support for the hypothesis. </p></div>		</li>
