<p>They learned the sport but never had the skill set to match their mind.</p>

<p>Or as they are taught in basketball: You can't teach height.</p>
<p>People can fully understand the game, and they can understand the human body, yet they cannot play at the competitive professional levels.</p>
<p>There are also many fields involved. Even if they don't play the game a trainer who studied sports medicine and athletics can train how to move or act in ways that reduces strain, or ways that help endurance, or exercise programs that build up specific muscles or have other benefits. Another trainer who knows the game well can offer insights to moves and actions that are within the rules but not commonly played or are physically difficult, working with other trainers to turn the actions into muscle memory.  Repeat for various other fields and you get a small army of trainers for the high performance athlete.</p></div>		</li>
