			<div class="markdown"><p>From <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/quantum/radfrac.html" target="_blank">this calculator</a> a relatively small bead in a vacuum (~1 cm^2 area) in a 1000W microwave would heat up to ~3644K = 3371 C. There should be a thermodynamic limit as you decrease the size, but I don't recall how to easily estimate it.</p></div>		</li>
