			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why there is #1 diesel and #2 diesel. #1 diesel is for cold weather and you can't even find it in warmer states. #2 diesel is what you'll find everywhere from Florida to Washington. Then there is &quot;off-road&quot; #2 diesel which is dyed red because the Federal excise tax hasn't been paid on it so it's supposed to only be used for equipment like bulldozers. (Home heating oil is #2 undyed diesel.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even winter diese does gel if the temperature is cold enough (below -20Â°C). There are more cold resistent forms, but this is mainly a problem for Canada, Russia and Scandinavia.</p></div>		</li>
