			<div class="markdown"><p>I think stuttering has a lot to do with how your emotions are. One thing I noticed that whenever I stutter, I tend to be intimidated, nervous or self conscious about something. I guess when I'm feeling this way, my emotions tend to overtake my speech, my motor skills and way of thinking. </p>
<p>Then there's also how I don't know how words are correctly spelled. So, my mind tends to get creative with how it's supposed to be spelled and thus I end up miss pronouncing the word completely but I catch myself midway of it and I just end up tripping over the whole word at the end. </p>
<p>Recently I can't, for the life of me, say &quot;inevitable&quot;. Just recently I learned how to spell it correctly but I still trip saying the first four letters of the word. </p></div>		</li>
