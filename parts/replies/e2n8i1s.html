<p>If it turns by 1 degree, after 60 miles it will be 1 mile laterally away from where it should have been. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except the ship is guided by natural currents,they are predicted based on observable data  a 3 degree change is simple math. If the captain gets all his mates to agree with him that the ship can go 400 million miles an hour it does not actually happen.</p>
<p>The economic functions nothing like that. If everyone <em>thinks</em> that company is shit, or macroeconomically the economy is shit, guess what happens? It magically happens everything is shit.</p>
<p>The economy is not natural it is entirely man made and controlled by man don’t give it the same standing as physical reality.</p>
<p>Edit: downvotes? If you really think that the economy is not influenced by how we feel about it, you are not thinking much about it. </p>
<p>The weatherman can’t make the weather change no matter how hard he tries.</p>
<p>What would happen if someone like Warren Buffett said the economy looks like it’s in awful shape even if not the case? You can bet that will change people’s perceptions and if it does it to enough people it will happen.</p></div>		</li>
