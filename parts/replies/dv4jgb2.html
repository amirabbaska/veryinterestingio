			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Could that also be caused by other stimuli? Like can a really intense sound or smell trigger a seizure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Epileptic checking in here. Myoclonic jerks are right up that alley. When my seizure threshold is low and I'm watching TV I often &quot;jerk&quot; a part of my body in reaction to something about to make a sound or change... a falling vase or slamming door for example. I &quot;jerk&quot; right before I hear the sound or see the effect that I'm anticipating. It might seem like everyone does this but it's FAR from just a flinch and I have absolutely no control over it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>if you don't mind me asking, what does it feel like to have a seizure/deal with epilepsy? it seems to vary a lot but is it generally like fainting? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Vibrations, rapid change in temperatures and spicy foods have also been know to trigger. Everyoneâ€™s brain is different and there are also other factors such as sleep deprivation, dehydration, blood sugar levels etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I had one of those on a train...but it's light filtering through foliage that causes the most problems. Early morning drives are a nightmare. They don't have to cause a seizure, but it makes me feel weird. Also, those tonic jerks before falling asleep, anyone else get them?</p></div>		</li>
