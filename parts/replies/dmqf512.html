			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what it means, and it's also why waves are noticeable mostly in the coast: as the wave approaches the shore and depth decreases, the front of the wave slows down, while the back is in a slightly deeper area, causing it to move faster. </p>
<p>This difference in speeds between front and back causes the rear end to reach up to the front, stacking the water up to form tall waves. </p></div>		</li>
