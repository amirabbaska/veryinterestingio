			<div class="markdown"><p>:&lt; We witnessed this with one of our ducks. His mate was a chicken (He really didn't know any other ducks as he was a solitary duck on our farm). He went everywhere with this chicken. He didn't even go onto the pond because that meant straying too far from this chicken. He would bathe in the cow's water tub as the chicken pecked at the dirt below it and enjoyed the dust piles in various parts of the farm. One day the chicken died. Duck was heartbroken. He would follow along the other chicken but you could tell the bond just wasn't there. This other chicken resembled his chicken. I'm not certain he committed suicide but one day we found him without a head. A wolf probably got him or something. Dunno. I miss that duck. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, man, it's part of the majesty of nature.   Sometimes, when a duck decides it's time to go, it just....  *pop*.  You know.  Takes it off.   It's powerful, and sad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ducks are very social creatures. They are also prone to rape. I've seen male on male duck action and even necrofilia after an unfortunate accident that left one of our ducks unable to defend himself... They always crowd around when one of their buddies is raping another duck. Ducks will fuck anything. Don't trust a duck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They should really capture one of those penguins and give it a medical exam to see if there are any significant biological differences between it and the <em>normal</em> penguins.  Maybe a switch that can be detected by a brain scan flipped in his brain.  Or maybe it was hormonal.  Or maybe it is just an unexplainable phenomenon.</p></div>		</li>
