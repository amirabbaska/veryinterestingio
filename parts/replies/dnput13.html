			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kinda complicated, but I'll try to explain as best I can.</p>
<p>In this context a &quot;datum&quot; is a specific, individual <em>thing</em>, a <em>set</em> of measurements or reference points. He mentions 2 datums specifically: the 1922 Tidal Datum, and the North American Vertical Datum of 1988. To make things worse, I think each measurement within a datum is data. Lexically this is a straight-up reversal of the common definitions of <em>datum</em> and <em>data</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think this helps me any. I totally get why &quot;datum&quot; is used. I, too, would call one of these marks a datum. What's confusing me is &quot;datums.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't the individual entries be called data points? And a collection of data points is a data series? And datum is a collection of data series'?  Seems like it needs <em>to be</em> standardized.</p>
<p>Edit: Added 'to be' for all the cunning linguists out there</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because 'data' in English is typically used as a mass noun (sand, sheep), not a countable noun.  It doesn't make grammatical sense to pluralise &quot;datum&quot; as &quot;data&quot; when there are only a few of them.  </p>
<p>No, I don't care what the Latin is.  Come at me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am impressed this answer included the planned datum switch in 2022. I wasn’t alive in 1988 but gaging from reading fema studies and reports, it’ll be about 2030 before we have truly made the leap to the new datum.</p>
<p>Also worth pointing out, some places use a modified vertical datum. It’s been a few years since I have read reports and studies with this information but flood studies in Harris County, Texas (Houston) have a special modified NAVD88 because the land has sunk considerably and it’s not localized to a small area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In detail which datum (both in the vertical and horizontal sense) gets used by different groups is a real tangled little web. While US federal, state, and local agencies tend to produce maps using US specific datums, I would say in the academic scientific community (or at least geology, not sure about geographers) it's much more common to use global reference frames (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System" target="_blank">WGS84</a>). As long as everyone is good about indicating which datum (and projection) things are in everything is fine, and generally now as everything is available digitally as georeferenced products the datum and projection information is bundled with the data so it's simple enough to reproject data into the coordinate system of your choosing.</p></div>		</li>
