			<div class="markdown"><p>Just because there is no department of desalination research that doesnt mean theres no research for desalination. Theres a couple government programs and you bet theres universities and private companies doing their own research. And in places where its needed much more they likely also do a lot of research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The majority of the effort will almost certainly be spent finding ways to preserve and re-filter water once it has been desalinated. Desalination is energy intensive no matter how it is done. Energy is something that Mars doesn't have a ton of (solar panels are heavy). Preservation will be more efficient, and desalinization may provide a small supply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fresh water is scarce in California and in the Middle East, so desalination plants are coming online there or are already online.</p>
<p>Desalination on a large scale is not common knowledge, moreover it's expensive, energy-intensive, and has high maintenance requirements.  The technology could stand to be improved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other major problem is what to do with the waste brine. Once you separate the salt and the water, and keep the water, you have to do something with the surplus salt. You can't just put it back in the water where you got it, and the transportation logistics of getting rid of that much brine simply makes it more effective to get your fresh water from other sources. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's large scale in Australia. Last I checked Australia got about half it's water from desal, and the other half from groundwater replenishment.</p>
<p>Edit: just checked, it's actually 41% desal, 42% groundwater and 17% surface water. However by 2030 the plan is to get it to 50% desal, 50% groundwater.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Desalination may not be that difficult, but it's very costly in terms of energy, and there's no way to bring that cost down. </p>
<p>It's not possible to make it less costly because there are intrinsic limitations. It takes a lot of energy to separate salt ions from water because there's a strong electrical attraction that keeps the ions dissolved.</p>
<p>However, there's no reason why water should become scarce on earth, other than political reasons. The biggest use of water, by far, is in agriculture, and the solution is very simple: grow food where rain is plentiful, build industries where rain is scarce. It's the farming subsidies for irrigation in arid lands that make water scarce.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>$.</p>
<p>Right now it would be near impossible to justify a desalination plant because of how expensive it is.  You can't make any money doing it because your end product is water.  Water has a serious pricing issue.  Commercial buyers pay next to nothing for fresh water and that won't change until it is too late.</p>
<p>Just look at California.  It may already be too late to avoid catastrophe.  It might not be, but the point is that it's taking the threat of catastrophic failure to spur action.  Enough people knew what was happening but preparing for the future is a hard sell to the modern world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned CA. A desalination plant is imminently beginning operation there. The company behind it is preparing another large project in the U.S.  </p>
<p>It's expensive, but nowhere near as financially impossible as you say. </p></div>		</li>
