<p>I find it somewhat of a 'mind blow' sometimes to consider the fact that the tastiest types of food - say, sweet things - are only the tastiest as they were the rarest but otherwise most valuable types of nommage on the savannah. Honey is a nutritional goldmine if you're an early Hominid; but how do you encourage early man to endure the bees? Have evolution make it god damn tasty, s'how. </p>
<p>Likewise, I enjoy the idea that we have a taste for many varieties of herbs and spices as a great deal have various antimicrobial properties and therefore provide low-key medicinal benefits (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5486105/" target="_blank">source</a>).</p></div>		</li>
