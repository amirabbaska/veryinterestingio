<p>the 0.9^2 is actually the ratio which i didn't see</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm quite sure nothing noticeable would happen to you. You simply don't absorb that much energy from individual particles. They may knock out a few proteins, but it's entirely feasible that they even pass through individual cells in your body without even killing Them.</p>
<p>Look up Anatoli Bugorski, a physicist who stuck his head in a 96GeV proton beam. The accident occurred in the 1970's, he survived and evidently is still alive today. What caused the damage that did happen in this case was the sheer <em>number</em> of energetic protons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1r2gwb/if_something_as_small_as_an_atom_shot_through/cdjaj1n" target="_blank">answer from a similar AskScience thread</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the situation isn't as clear when the incident particle has enough initial energy to pass through the target.  Even if a particle passes through the target, much of its initial energy may be deposited in the target material along its path.  The rate of energy deposition (called the <a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/reviews/passagerpp.pdf" target="_blank">stopping power</a>) as a function of depth within the target is described by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bragg_peak" target="_blank">Bragg curve</a>.  As an approximation, the shape of the Bragg curve depends mostly on the species and initial energy of the incident particle, and on the density of the target.</p>
<p>The rate of energy deposition by a particle generally decreases for shallow depths as the particle initial energy increases.  Thunderf00t has an excellent video describing this effect (the pertinent discussion is towards the end of the video, but the whole video is relevant):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6v8MtuVdU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj6v8MtuVdU</a></p>
<p>For very high energy, the thickness of a human body may be a very small portion of the maximum radiation depth, and the stopping power in this depth range would approach zero as the particle energy increases.  So there exists a threshold energy above which the particle actually does less radiation damage compared to (comparatively) lower energies.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a very low probability that it will be able to interact in the time it has. This is the case for ionizing radiation as energy increases. Absorbed Dose is <em>higher</em> at <em>lower</em> energies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I figured I'd ballpark the crossection to see if it even would interact. </p>
<p>I approximated a human as a bag of water (meatbag), and the particle as  Barium at 300 GeV.</p>
<p>Used<a href="http://journals.aps.org/prc/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevC.10.167" target="_blank"> cross-section equation for elementary particles</a>,  ~5 millibarns (yes it's a real unit for an area, something something broad-side of barn door)
number density of protons in water: 1 cm^-3 of it would contain 6x10^23 /18 ~ 3x10^22</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_\(physics\)" target="_blank">n*σ=μ
</a></p>
<p>3.33x10^22 *5.39x10^-27 = 0.00018 cm^-1</p>
<p>So you either need roughly a thousand particles to pass through you for roughly one to interact or you put a thousand people in a line and one of them will statistically interact with the nucleus.</p>
<p>Give me a should if I did a blunder in this here math</p></div>		</li>
