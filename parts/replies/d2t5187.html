<p>But, that's not what happened, so we can only speculate.</p>

<p>Certainly true, but easily within the realm of possibility! If you think about it, the hurdles that had to be overcome to build a rocket to reach space were more in the realm of engineering and applied science rather than in basic research, and it's totally believable that a civilization could figure out how to build the materials, manufacture the fuel and perfect the design for a rocket long before figuring out relativity, since it has little bearing on any of those things. </p>
<p>On an unrelated note, I've always found it fascinated that relativity and quantum mechanics were basically born together, even though they were based on unrelated observations and experiments. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, quantum mechanics would have stagnated pretty quickly without relativity, since it wouldn't really be able to explain much besides toy models. It would be able to qualitatively describe something sort of like hydrogen, but it wouldn't quite match observations.</p>
<p>Kind of makes you wonder if relativity would have been discovered along that route if it hadn't already been before. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was thinking about this recently due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4hl8fl/can_permanent_magnets_be_explained_through/" target="_blank">this thread</a>, and specifically <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4hl8fl/can_permanent_magnets_be_explained_through/d2rd496" target="_blank">this post</a>, which I responded to arguing that quantum mechanics started when people tried to combine statistical mechanics with Maxwell's equations (the latter can be considered the impetus for relativity). It might be interesting to also wonder why electromagnetism and statistical mechanics had revolutions during a similar period of time. I also wonder if statistical mechanics alone would have been enough for people to start to ask questions which would require QM, but I can't think of a good example right now.</p>
<p>There's also a chance that all of these &quot;coincidences&quot; happen because experimental sensitivity for one field coincides with sensitivity in others.</p></div>		</li>

<p>While that's true (blackbody radiation), the tipping point was when Einstein successfully applied Planck's trick of quantizing the energy of light to explain the photoelectric effect, and while we can use stat mech to describe the detailed picture of what's going on and the probability of absorption and all that, it wasn't really the original emphasis. It's entirely plausible that QM could've arisen from the photoelectric effect first, before blackbody radiation had been explained. Still fascinating, though, and I think it's probably true that at the very least they would have figured out that Maxwell's equations + statistical mechanics fail to accurately describe the real world, making the subsequent discovery of quantum mechanics almost inevitable.</p>

<p>You mean stat mech without e&amp;m? I suppose applying statistical mechanics to ultra cold systems could have lead to QM without going through e&amp;m, but without a firm grasp of e&amp;m I don't think it would be possible to actually perform such experiments. Interesting thought, now I'm curious, too!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's also the case of Vulcan, the planet that was supposed to be between mercury and the sun. I don't understand the physics of it particularly well, but basically mercury was off by a tiny margin from the orbit newtonian physics would predict, implying that there was another planet there. People looked for the planet for <del>a couple of centuries</del> [EDIT: 80 years], but obvs, since there was no planet, nobody could spot it. Turned out that this was actually just because gravity was bending space.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's a really disturbing example because Vulcan was a problem for about 80 years, between the 1840s when it was first theorized, and 1915 when Einstein solved it in a footnote. It was, furthermore, a really big problem. If Vulcan didn't exist, then it meant there was a problem with classical mechanics that anybody with a telescope could look up and observe. You might have expected this kind of contradictory data to spur a rush of theorization, a real drive to see what the problems were with classical mechanics.</p>
<p>In reality, there were a bunch of attempts to find it, but on the whole, the physics community responded to this planet-sized hole in the fundamentals of classical mechanics with a shrug. Presumably, if an Einstein hadn't come along, it would just be another spooky bit of data, known only by nerds and cranks, and we'd all remain confident that classical mechanics was the be-all and end-all of motion. By 1915, it was pretty clear there was no planet there, but Vulcan's non-existence wasn't spurring anybody on to theorize.</p>
<p>PS: had a little look, was wondering why Einstein started working on the theory of relativity - from what I can see, it <strong>was</strong> discovered empirically, and it was <strong>experimental results</strong>, especially the very famous (at the time) Michelson-Morley ether experiment that provoked Einstein to work on the problems he did. Einstein described the theory as analytic, and was a hardcore empiricist for his whole life. </p>
<p>PPS: also, anybody who has a bone to pick with the preference journals have to publish postive results should note that the M-M experiment was a null result. </p>
<p>PPPS: u/MaceWumpus pointed out that I've contradicted myself in regards to how long Vulcan was around for - it's 80 years, not 200. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This isn't really accurate. Le Verrier postulated that the existence of Vulcan in 1843, so it had a maximum life of about 70 years. In reality, though, it wasn't taken nearly as seriously by astronomers as the mythology suggests. Simon Newcomb (the most important gravitational researcher immediately pre-Einstein) didn't take it seriously, and with good reason: Le Verrier's numbers <em>only</em> work if you don't into account the effect that such a planet would have on the other bodies of the Solar System. By the time of his 1895 publication of <em>The Elements of the Four Inner Planets and the Fundamental Constants of Astronomy</em>, it was extremely clear that neither Vulcan nor a number of other proposed solutions would work. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the point that Vulcan, existing or non-existing, is a solution for an observable problem in classical mechanics? I mean, regardless of whether you take the 'planet-solution' theory seriously, you have to take the challenge to classical mechanics it has been called in to solve seriously.</p>
<p>As I see it, whether or not the planet is actually there or not isn't very important.</p>
<p>PS: thanks for pointing out the chronology error.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This should be top comment. Because of that example and soooo many more, e.g. Satellites gps,, the &quot;space age&quot; and modernity as we know could not have preceded theories of relativity. </p>
<p>Side Note: That said I think science generally works this way with everything/ most things. We come up with theories and then we test them. Or technically hypothesis toward theory via observation then application of, as technology. </p></div>		</li>

If you spin the wheel fast enough so that the window moves out of way before he light returns and you know the window size, wheel speed, and distance to the mirror you can calculate how fast the light is moving.  You need a big disc, and long mirror but this is how it was done in 1849.</p>

<p>8 km?! How was this possible? He found an unobstructed 8 km path and somehow precisely set up the apparatus and aimed a light source bright enough to be seen by the human eye after attenuation over such a long distance? </p></div>		</li>
