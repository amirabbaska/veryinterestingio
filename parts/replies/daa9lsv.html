			<div class="markdown"><p>In ELI5* terms, Facetime - because it's totally controlled and restricted to Apple devices - takes advantage of a special computer chip to record the video before it sends it over the internet. Skype on the other hand can't assume the chip will be there on either end, so it records it in a different way that's available to everyone.</p>
<p>In most situations, Facetime will have better video quality because of that special chip.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, not dismissing your explanation, just for ELI5 it's worth simplifying it a bit. &quot;Hardware enabled HEVC Codec&quot; wouldn't parse for the majority of non-technical people.</p></div>		</li>
