			<div class="markdown"><p>You are pretty close, but I have one small thing to nitpick about. A wave does not need to have equal fall and rise times to be considered a note. Take for example the sawtooth wave, which is often used by synthesizers, and even bowed strings create a waveform similar to one. And there is also the asymetric square wave, again easily created by synthesis but also made by free reed instruments like accordions.</p></div>		</li>
