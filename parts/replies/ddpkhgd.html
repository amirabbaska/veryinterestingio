<p>An important thing to note, and some will already know, is that Intuit DOES provide free filing. The catch? They make you pay to have that information prepared for your state returns, which isn't covered by the Free File Alliance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This seems to have changed this year. I used H&amp;R Block's online filing and both state and federal were free, whereas in the past I had to pay for state. It looks like Credit Karma is also doing free state+federal, and possibly other companies too. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can confirm this - I used Intuit to file taxes for myself, and another individual. I paid to have prior year returns available, but for the other individual, it was completely free - federal and state (CO), both e-filed.</p>
<p>This was not the case last year when I also used Intuit, and had to pay extra for the state filing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably because restaurants operate on low profit margins, with the exception of pizza.</p>
<p>By forcing tips to cover pay, the business owner isn't paying as high in taxes. Payroll has to match federal tax.</p>
<p>A normal restaurant may operate on a 10% profit margin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I haven't tried it (yet) but I think this is our starting point.<br />
Once you &quot;START Free File Now&quot; it gives you some &quot;Free File Software Offers&quot; which seem to be the companies affiliated with the &quot;Free File Alliance&quot; and their respective parameters for qualifying, e.g. what your income cap and below needs to be, perhaps age, etc.  </p>
<p>If you try this out or have before and feel you have something note, please lemme know. I think I'll roll the dice on it.</p></div>		</li>
