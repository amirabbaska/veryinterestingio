			<div class="markdown"><p>IDK why these get passed customs, but there are two eastern european markets near me, ones called UkraineMart and one is called European Delicious(within two blocks of each other), and both stock the imported European style kinder eggs. So it's not impossible to find them in the US.</p>
<p>I haven't really gone to any other european grocery stores but I'd imagine that others have them as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you'd have to physically search a package to find them, and the vast majority of packages entering the US aren't physically searched. But if they DO find them, they will seize them and there can be a fine of up to $2500 per egg. Apparently US border agents seize tens of thousands of them per year (though don't typically fine unsuspecting travelers with a couple as a gift).</p>
<p>I did send one by mail to an American one time, and it arrived just fine - I knew they weren't available in the US, but at the time I didn't realize they actually cared about people sending one as a gift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really begs the question, why didnt they just modify the design to comply with the law, like their knockoff competitors did? The US is a pretty big market to ignore and the cost of new machinery would quickly be returned by the increase in sales. </p>
<p>Edit: To those pointing out the &quot;begs the question&quot;, it's perfectly cromulent and it's staying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer. </p>
<p>Imagine you are making internationally collectible things. You are known the world over for your smart design, your timeless humor, and there is an entire world out there willing to collect your things. Mind you mostly european style things, like the smurfs, or </p>
<p>Kinder eggs are a standart. That's it. Their humor works in every country, and they are generally understood. </p>
<p>Now, imagine one country , where a competitor, Mars food company, banns your stuff, after heavy lobbying. Mind you, they don't ban it out of human kindness, thy ban it because they wanted to bring their version on the market. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/us/giants-in-candy-waging-battle-over-a-tiny-toy.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm" target="_blank">http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/28/us/giants-in-candy-waging-battle-over-a-tiny-toy.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm</a> </p>
<p>Mind you, you don't understand the idea. usually, in europe, and the rest of the world, the parents are not retarded enough to disregard the warning label, which states, in bright white, for children 3 and older. Neither are the children equipped with maws powerfull enough to suck down a whole egg, and those that are are told not to. </p>
<p>Now, while the competing companies fight over who gets to put which licensed character in a ball shaped object, you have a choice. </p>
<p>Redesign your eggs, redesign the warning labels, redesign the toys, just to make it safe for the american market? Where you would have to competre with american only companies? </p>
<p>Or, hold a giant middle finger up to the north american corruption and trade protectionalism that is the FDA, sell tons of the eggs to canada and mexico, and trust that your ban will stand as a beacon of a quality product that refused to be dumbed down, plus will establish your product as a high value high quality european style luxury good, the &quot;cuban cigar&quot; of chocolate snackfoods? </p>
<p>Subtle hint: </p>
<p>Children under 3 years of age should neither have the purchasing power nor the possibility to wolf down an egg whole and without adult supervision. If they are in the process, gently tell them not to, or take the egg away from them. It's called parenting for a reason, you know. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was on an episode of Shark Tank a few days ago... so the company that came up with the knockoff/non-embedded ridged capsule version has a temporary patent on that design... but it is only good for another 18 months or something. So soon enough, I am sure Kinder will be modifying their design just like you suggest :) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The law, which is very old, was made so that food manufacturers couldn't artificially raise the weight of their product by hiding non edible but heavy objects inside the food.</p>
<p>It was never meant to protect people from accidentally eating toys it is just being abused by the Mars company which did not want the competition from the extremely popular Ferrero company in the USA.</p>
<p>So now we're all the subject of jokes about Americans being too stupid to handle Kinder eggs when really we're just being screwed over by a big corporation abusing laws in order to stifle competition.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The solution is of course law reform. This isn't hard to fix - nearly every developed nation has managed to legislate for food safety without banning kinder eggs.</p>
<p>So really the reason Americans are the subject of jokes is because when a big corporation abuses laws, you don't fix your laws.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why would they change the law? To them it would open up the possibility of companies padding the weight of their product AND allow a non American company to compete with existing American ones.</p>
<p>No one would be willing to lobby for that since there is nothing to gain from it.</p>
<p>It's idiotic but nothing is going to change until we get rid of the lobbying system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Excellent answer. I would like to add that they are not only illegal to sell, but even illegal to import etc due to being embargo - very strict. The embargo was lobbied into law by Mars, Inc (Mars Snickers etc) to hinder their competitor.
Kinder egg caused only three fatalities in 40 years according to Wikipedia, which is a pretty low chance of injury considering the billions of Kinder eggs which have been sold around the world. More people die from legal smoking in 10 seconds.
When Nestlé tried to introduce (the similar) Magic chocolate balls in the US, Mars was instrumental in promoting civil action to prevent the marketing of this product.
One story about people travelling into the US from Canada who packed 10 Kinder eggs in their luggage for their children (all over the age of five) for Easter. Customs and Border Protection not only confiscated the Kinder eggs, but also fined the family $1,200 [£787] per egg, or $12,000 [£7,870] total.
The real reason is hence, not due to safety conserns or choking hazards, but due to market strategies bought into law by influential corporation.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Kinder Surprise was created in 1974 and the American legislation rendering them illegal originated in 1938. </p>
<p>I'm going to judge your comment &quot;bullshit&quot; on the basis that the Mars candy company does not have a machine that predicts the future, nor did they have a hand in the creation of the FDA (the legislation that created the FDA is the same legislation that outlawed nonfood objects in confectinaries). </p></div>		</li>
