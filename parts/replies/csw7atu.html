Your everyday rice farmer or 20 year old office worker that stares at their stock price app all day can't short stocks, the goverment has many restrictions that don't allow it except for experienced, professional investors.  Most people can only invest on margin.</p></div>		</li>

<p>They all pretty much knew somebody who put $1K into the stock market and made $10 million in 90 days.</p>

<p>Umm, what?? I'm calling BS. I'm going to need to see an example of this type of stock? Even from $1K to $10K would be extraordinary in 90 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They bought and sold repeatedly on a daily basis or multiple times a day. They'd take 1K and invest it in a company that was doing an IPO that day. It would shoot up 1000%. They would take that money and invest it in another IPO. It would shoot up again. It's a situation where you feel like you can't lose until you invest in a new company and then it just drops to 1% of the original price a few minutes after you buy it.</p>
<p>But yeah, there is no single stock that goes up that much. It's a buying and selling repeatedly process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably mainly because the options of short selling has been useless. I've heard frustration of real traders that has millions lining up in short selling, it was so goddamn obvious that the pricing is crazy high. I mean without increase in performance those stock raise hundreds to thousands percentage in value. </p>
<p>Can't find the article written by the people on the field that has been very frustrated that they can't short sell or only able to shortsell very little (thousands to their millions) and wait to make out like bandits, but here's another article that highlight that short selling has been useless in Chinese market because it's new and the government still doing funky things with the market and regulation </p>

<p>They wanted to ease the market but the effect is that everything just falling down like sudden diarrhea.</p></div>		</li>
