<p>That's taken from 3km above the surface and looks much more clear than the photo of Rosetta.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some educated guesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Philae's camera may not be properly calibrated to the current conditions yet.</li>
<li>That first photo is shot almost directly into the sun (all that lens flare at the bottom). Hard to get good detail if you're overexposing that much.</li>
<li>Onboard computers might have sent a degraded version of the photo to leave more bandwidth for important landing telemetry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can't find <a href="http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Rosetta/ROLIS" target="_blank">too much data</a> on the camera on the ESA site, but it's supposed to be capable of high-resolution imaging.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember someone from ESA saying on the stream that the picture is blurry because the probe was spinning: it's motion blur. It was rotating at 12 revolutions per minute, and they had to have the lens open for 600ms because of the darkness. This amounted to about 5 pixels of blur.</p>
<p>When the probe is attached onto the Chur-Gera comet, the pictures should be a lot better.</p></div>		</li>
