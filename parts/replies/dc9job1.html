			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks very much for the answer! I do have one question though:</p>
<p>What applications do you see this having in the near future? Like, in the next 5 years?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I see a lot of hype articles about the future.  People are predicting that this is going to lead to humans evolving, designer babies, super-crops, super-viruses, extinction level events, you name it.</p>
<p>I think a lot of it is overblown.  Not all of the ideas, mind you, but some of them are very exaggerated.</p>
<p>Let's take human modification.  Cool as it would be, the simple problem is that the CRISPR/Cas9 system only works on one cell at a time.  This means that you can edit a human as a zygote (a fertilized egg, which is then implanted via in-vitro fertilization), but you can't do much for adult humans.  Some early treatments have taken white blood cells out of an adult, used CRISPR/Cas9 to modify them, and then reinserted them back in the individual.  That's about the best you can get for targeting adult humans.</p>
<p>The &quot;designer babies&quot; idea is definitely possible... but it's still unwieldy and super expensive.  Remember that this will ONLY work with in vitro fertilization, and even though CRISPR lets us make more precise cuts, we don't really know the effects of inserted genes.  While this could help parents who carry rare genetic diseases have a healthy child, we can't point to a gene and say &quot;Oh, this one makes you smarter if you have it.&quot;  Those sorts of genes don't really exist, not in the way that pop science and popular culture claims.</p>
<p>I haven't even mentioned off-target effects!  Chinese researchers recently made headlines for performing CRISPR on human embryos (that were going to be destroyed anyway, none of these were viable even from the beginning).  They found, on average, <strong>72</strong> off-target effects - &quot;misses&quot; from CRISPR where it cut in the wrong spot!  That's not enough accuracy to really guarantee that a CRISPR-modified baby won't have some serious things wrong with it.</p>
<p>I think that CRISPR will really lead to some big strides and successes in fields where genetic engineering is already gaining traction - microbial synthesis and activity being one of them!  Think about if we could insert genes in bacteria like E. coli to let them grow insulin, drugs for rare diseases that aren't currently cost-effective to produce, anticancer drugs, bioplastics, and so on.  Think about if we could engineer microbes to break down plastic into reusable fibers, digest styrofoam, extract carbon dioxide from the air and turn it into fuel for us to burn in our cars.  </p>
<p>Those, I believe, are where we'll see the real innovations from CRISPR, at least in the next few years.  Microbes are dirt cheap, can be destroyed if the engineering process doesn't work, and there are very few ethics laws pertaining to them.  Plus, as single cells, they're much easier to target with CRISPR-assisted modifications.</p>
<p>Microbes, that's my bet.  The (near) future of genetic engineering is in microbes, and to a lesser degree, plants.</p>
<p>(Ninja edit: sorry for the long-ass answer!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry about the 'long-ass' answer, I would prefer detail! I really like your answer, and I agree that designer babies are overblown, not to mention the ethics... but thanks! The CO2 bit sounds like it could be huge in the coming years, so I guess we'll wait and see! Thanks again!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just so you are aware, that is exactly how we already do produce the vast majority of synthetic insulin. The rest however, definitely an excellent future step.</p>
<p>Regarding the &quot;prohibitive cost&quot; and &quot;we don't know what that gene does&quot;, crispr allows us answer the second question at a much lower cost than any other method because of its simplicity. If we could grow in rapid succession bacteria, or even up to small mammals, we can rapidly develop our understanding of what exactly is junk and what is not, what A does, what A does in conjunction, or without, B. </p></div>		</li>

<p>What if you combine it with something that's really good at infiltrating the body and can hijack cells' reproduction to replicate itself, like modified HIV?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wanted to touch up on human applications for gene editing technology. Although, editing human DNA can help cure lots of genetic diseases, it's not as easy as all these CRISPR articles make it out to be. I work at a gene therapy company, focusing on curing genetic diseases by basically the same approach. CRISPR isn't the first gene editing technology that has come into our hands, there are plenty of other methods that researchers have been working with for decades and there are a lots of obstacles that we need to overcome before we can even apply it to humans.</p>
<p>As for near future applications, I don't think anything will happen except for more research. Just like any other drug manufacturer, companies working with CRISPR technology will have to deal with the FDA before they are allowed to edit genes in real people. This means they need to provide data showing that CRISPR is cutting correct genes and not anywhere else, which is one the biggest challenges facing the industry. You hear a lot about how CRISPR was able to edit the specific region that scientists were aiming for, but they don't tell you about the other parts of the DNA that might have been altered. They also need to show the FDA that cells remain healthy afterwards, which means a lot of different assays for cell characterization and gene expression. The whole process needs to be laid out in front of the FDA showing that there aren't any adverse effects. Once they get the okay from the FDA, the company will be allowed to start clinical trials on patients to measure the short term and long term side effects, safety, and efficacy of the drug (genetically engineered cells are considered drugs). There are 3 phases to the clinical trials and the whole thing can get shut down by the FDA if one part of the process wasn't good. It can take 10 to 15 years (maybe more) before a drug is commericalized. It is a very lengthy and expensive process, which is one reason why your drugs cost so much money. Since the company isn't able to sell anything until approval form the FDA, they aren't seeing any revenue the whole time this is going on. Investors can cut funding or stop investing if they feel like the therapy isn't working. There are a lot of things that can go wrong, which is why I don't see anything happening in the near future.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's already a clinical trial involving using Cas9 to knockout a gene in an engineered T cell to improve its anti-cancer efficacy. CRISPR-engineered cells will be injected into humans this year.</p>
<p>Of course, knockins are a lot harder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Without getting into the weedy details I'll add that as a veteran of multiple CrisprCas9 projects the precision and flexibility is greatly improved but one still can see a mix of site alterations. And, as was mentioned above, the possibility of off target alterations and the necessity of screening for such effects. No doubt we are in the empirical optimization phase of this tech and will see improvements but we are a long way off from the media handwaving of ubiquitous human applications.
Nemesis_the_2nd's post pretty much nails it. imho</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How would that work in practice? Say you've got a dog with some disease we can cure with CRISPR. What would the process look like? I mean, you obviously can't go an inject new DNA in every cell of the dog's body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're exactly right, and that's one of the big limitations of CRISPR that most people overlook.</p>
<p>Sadly, you can't really cure that dog, assuming it's an adult.  If the disease is due to an issue with that dog's white blood cells, you could extract some from the dog, modify them (in a lab setting) with CRISPR, and then inject them back into the dog.  </p>
<p>If the disease is in every cell, or an inaccessible one (liver, brain, neurons, bone, etc.), that dog is out of luck.</p>
<p>What you CAN do, however, is take that dog's eggs (let's say she's a female), fertilize them in a petri dish, and then use CRISPR on the zygote (fancy term for the fertilized egg) to make modifications.  Then, you'd implant those modified eggs back into her womb.  This way, although the mother has the disease, the offspring can be disease-free.</p>
<p>Or, as another example, if you found that adding additional copies of some gene made the dog grow larger, you could add additional copies to the zygotes, inject those back in the mother, and then get larger adult dogs as offspring.</p>
<p>So if you're old enough to read this comment, you're probably too old to get a ton of use out of CRISPR-based systems on your body.</p></div>		</li>
