			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're spot on with one of the principle differences being the focus on profession defining someone. There also seemed to be a much greater emphasis in using appearance and clothing to asses people on the East Coast.</p>
<p>Coming from the Midwest I was extremely surprised to see how different the two coasts are from each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! I've noticed I've even started to &quot;upgrade&quot; my clothing and accessories to be of similar fashion to coworkers and friends. It happens slowly and sneaks up on you. I still get really excited though when some of my label-conscious friends complement my Payless shoes without realizing. lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can imagine, where I'm from blue collar working clothes are just the average ataire for most people.</p>
<p>When I dressed that way while visiting family on the East Coast people assumed I worked in construction.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As someone who lives and works in NYC, I'll take the calming sounds of my ticking clock and humming A/C unit over sounds of busses, subways, and people yelling any day.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to really compare that to the sounds of frogs and crickets at night or wind gently rustling grass, though.</p>
<p>It's theraputic in a way that's difficult to describe. I was fortunate enough to grow up in an area that allowed me to enjoy it, and suffice to say the sounds of the city just don't compare.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That may be another difference though.  In NYC, the entire city is one big...CITY.  Busy streets and busy sidewalks and tall apartment buildings and not much in the way of space.</p>
<p>Out west, the entire city is mostly more of what you consider suburbs...but inside the city.  I live in Phoenix, it's mostly all houses with lawns and backyards and garages...when you open your windows, you don't hear cars and buses, you just hear outside.  But you're still in the city, for all intents and purposes.  We're not as dense, we have a lot of room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing to me sounds more like urban sprawl or suburbs. Not knocking on ya, just my thoughts. I live in an east coast city but grew up in the suburbs, and your description sounds like the suburbs. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I moved to LA from NYC 3 years ago and it took me a few weeks to get comfortable sleeping in the relative &quot;silence&quot;. I am still in a highly populated neighborhood (for example, none of the homes have backyards, everything's concrete and pavement), but the difference in volume was still shocking. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, there are always exceptions to the rule! I tended to avoid LA for a similar reason. I'm a bit jaded from growing up in a smaller town.</p></div>		</li>
