			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. But the DC resistance of a superconductor is zero for all intents and purposes. The current in the coil will keep flowing until the coil is brought out of the superconducting phase.</p>
<p>This is actually a problem if you have a magnet on, and the power goes out.</p>
<p>Because now you have a massive current flowing through the coil, and no way to turn it off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is the DC resistance of a superconductor below it's critical temperature actually zero or just very very close to zero? I've asked a couple of people who should know and got conflicting answers and Google doesn't seem to be much help (I was an organic chemist for a while so got to play with some serious NMR machines). If it's not zero where is the power loss?</p>
<p>The other thing I've wondered was does the insertion of samples into the NMR machine slowly reduce the field strength? The magnetic field is doing work on the sample (even if it's a tiny amount) and that energy has to come from somewhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, could you not bring the coil out of SC phase by heating it slightly? Or would that mean the coil would/could vaporize, since it's now resisting potentially hundreds of amps?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>...at room temperature. would be the big caveat.</p>
<p>Most (that I am aware of) of our known superconductors have a negative temperature coefficient.  in order to get them to lower their resistance you have to lower their temperatures significantly.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Suppose I've got a superconductor with this (near?) infinite looping of current generating a nice magnetic field for me. It's cut off from any external power source. Can I reduce the level of current or the strength of the magnetic field by introducing new objects into the magnetic field and moving them around, bleeding off energy? Or does &quot;work&quot; done by the magnetic field not have any effect on the current that creates it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should mention the real-world application of this!  The main field for MRI machines is built from exactly this type of electromagnet!</p>
<p>Sorry for the exclamation.  I worked for a year in MRI research.  Superconductors, near-field antennas, LNAs, 2-d FFTs.  All these concepts I had heard of or learned in my EE courses all coming together in one awesome application.  Didn't hurt that my wife reads MRI scans, among other studies, for a living.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the applications of this are basically any kind of magnet that needs to reach field strengths above 2 Tesla. So that includes MRIs, magnets for particle accelerators, fusion reactors, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unrelated, but I never miss a chance to plug my favorite method of producing huge magnetic fields: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explosively_pumped_flux_compression_generator" target="_blank">explosively pumped flux generators</a>.  A magnetic field tries to resist a change in current, so if you use high explosives to increase the current density through a conductor (by crushing it) it'll respond with a <em>huge</em> magnetic pulse.  These devices are used to create up to a <em>thousand</em> Teslas.  Of course magnetars create hundreds of billions of Teslas, but hey.  We're trying.</p>
<p>The opposite is also true: if you rapidly induce a massive increase in a magnetic field it'll create an incredible compressive force in nearby conductors.  That's how the Z-machine studies fusion in pressurized plasma, and it can be used to <a href="http://cas2.umkc.edu/physics/sps/projectsupd/images/cancrusher/cancrusher4.png" target="_blank">shrink coins</a> hilariously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add *continuous field strengths. Pulse magnets can do WAY more, but obviously only for a short period of time and their application is mostly just for research.</p></div>		</li>
