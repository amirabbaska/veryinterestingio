			<div class="markdown"><p>Technically, yes.  Air is a medium after all!  </p>
<p>But it should be noticed that the difference is unbelievably miniscule, and it can be essentially be completely avoided.  </p>
<p>But the speed of light c is defined as the speed at which light moves in a vacuum.  Air is not a vacuum, but related to most other things in the universe, it basically is a vacuum, and it's effect is negligible, but still technically there!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if the effect is negligible, does it need to be accounted for in scientific experiments, or if we some how made a craft that traveled and was sensitive to the speed of light?</p>
<p>Just how negligible is it? Negligible where it doesn't need to be mentioned in everyday conversation, or truly negligible where it really doesn't matter anymore?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light in air is 0.999723<em>c</em> (this value from Wolfram Alpha). So it's about 0.03% slower. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be ignored for most things over small distances, like calculating refraction angles and so on.</p>
<p>As someone said, it's about .03% lower than in a vacuum.  Our atmosphere is roughly 10 miles thick, which would mean if you were measuring distance via speed-of-light timing, it'd measure about 15 feet longer than reality.  If you're on a diagonal rather than straight on, it would be more.  It's not much, but it's enough that things like GPS or measuring the distance to the moon do need to take it into account.</p>
<p>Oh, and it will vary based on current weather, so it's not just a flat correction to the calculation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is all light we see on Earth actually slower than it is in space?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When it's fizzing through the air it's only very slightly slower. Once it's moving through your eye though, it's slowed more significantly. That's why the eye can bend the light and focus it on the retina.</p>
<p>So all light you ever see will be going slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but the refraction index of the atmosphere is very close to zero, so the actual slowing is effectively none unless you are doing an experiment that is <em>very</em> sensitive to the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>
