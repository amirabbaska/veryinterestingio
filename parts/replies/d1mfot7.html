			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, a lot of media players do this. It's completely possible to randomly have multiple songs in a row by the same band, but our monkey brains don't think that's random, so they have to write a much more complex algorithm that breaks up the &quot;clumpiness&quot;, even though clumpiness is part of randomness.</p>
<p>In Photoshop, you can generate visual &quot;noise&quot;, which fills each pixel with a random color and shade. But there are two different ways to generate it: Uniform and Gaussian. One of them is random, while the other avoids clumpiness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that already have a meaning. In fact when they said that it was completely random, it was probably generated by a pseudo random algorithm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely, but adding that function certainly emphasizes that it's not truly random.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well I don't want to hear the same track twice in a short interval of time. I don't care about it being truly random, because why would I?</p>
<p>Foobar2000 calls the true random &quot;Random&quot; and the other one &quot;Shuffle&quot;, but Shuffle just randomly orders all tracks and then plays them in that order.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>the point is that the 'random' ordering of shuffle is no longer random, because a truely random distribution could end up with lots of songs from the same band etc in a row, and people perceive it as being non random.</p></div>		</li>
