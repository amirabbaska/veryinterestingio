			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.. It uses different technique. It actually renders lines on the screen, there is no sweep that goes from left to right, up to down. But there is still refresh rate, it has to keep drawing those lines over and over again and if there are lot of them, we start to encounter flicker.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your last point isn't necessarily true - you could simply vary each pixel continuously and independently as a function of time. Humans would perceive this just as they perceive reality - in infinite &quot;FPS&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>infinite &quot;FPS&quot;</p>

<p>Given that the process of updating a pixel is not instantaneous, there is a going to be a hard limit to the maximum frequency at which you can do that within any given unit of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The delay does not impose the limit; if the delay is, say, 10 milliseconds, you could still display a change that lasts just 1ms. If you, say, instruct the pixel to turn white at T+0ms, black at T+1ms and back to white at T+2ms, it would turn white, black, white at T+10ms, T+11ms and T+12ms.</p>
<p>In practice the device will take some time to change the output between black and white, but it can well be much less than the delay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You still would have a refresh rate for every pixel. As long as you use pixels you can't have a continous film.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure you can.  As a completely impractical thought experiment, if you start with a series of equations that model pixel value over time for each pixel, you can create an array of electrical circuits that mimic that equation, substituting input voltage for time.  Then you just use a slider that controls input voltage to all of those circuits, and you've got a continuous display.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine each pixel is a long tape the length of the film with all variations of that pixel continuously printed along the tape. When the film plays, all of these tapes are run in parallel at speed. No refresh rate there - it's continuous. </p>
<p>To print these tapes you would pull them through a printer that would paint the right intensity of each color channel along the tape. The instructions would be coded in terms of when to place down and lift the &quot;brush&quot; of the print head. These would be discrete instructions that would lead to a continuous output. </p>
<p>Now just change the tape/brush system to a light-emitting system. If it is controlled by continuous instructions (functions which tell when to emit and at what intensity), then you don't necessarily have a frame rate here either. </p>
<p>There may be a minimum length of time the photon emitter can be cycled off-to-on-to-off again, but this alone doesn't necessarily create a frame rate effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>OP asked about digital or analog. If we focus on digital technology then we always come down to frames because the nature of digital information is to switch values between discrete states. Even if every pixel operated independently then you still have frames for each pixel and, as you said, displays are going to process frame-by-frame in the end.</p>
<p>But if we consider possible analog solutions like light manipulated by magnetism, or whatever, then we may be able to create an analog video production based on true motion rather than still frames. </p></div>		</li>
