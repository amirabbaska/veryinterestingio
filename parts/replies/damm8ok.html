			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question and not 100% certain. Some bacteria and other single cell organisms do self destruct in response to viral infection to stop replication and protect the colony. Apoptosis has its roots in those systems.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While most of the mechanisms you mentioned are accurate for how things are killed by the immune system, several of them aren't usually done by T cells, but by other white blood cells. Antibodies are made by B cells (though T cells provide support for them to do so), reactive oxygen species are usually made by phagocytes or granulocytes (T cells mostly only use ROS for signaling, not as a weapon), and T cells don't participate in phagocytosis at all (that's more the realm of monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, mast cells, and neutrophils).</p>
<p>You were correct on the pore forming proteins being a T cell function, though you actually meant perforins, not porins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it that they can penetrate the parasite's &quot;outer layer&quot;? I'm not sure how to ask this but shouldn't a multicelular's organism &quot;skin&quot; be way more resilient than a bacteria's or some other cell's membrane? Or is it that the parasite isn't that big in comparison (maybe less than a 100 cells big)? Also, what kind of damage would it cause to something like an earthworm or a finger?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the parasite.  Most are composed of cells with the same cell wall makeup as our own (lipids and proteins).  One way that the body can 'fix' items that it can't break down is to encapsulate foreign bodies and then either try to expel them (like splinters) or encapsulate for life (like a metal instrument leftover from internal surgery / or sometimes even a fetus).</p></div>		</li>
