<p>Hydrogen sulfide, for example, reacts with four molecules of FOOF to give sulfur hexafluoride, 2 molecules of HF and four oxygens. . .and 433 kcal, which is the kind of every-man-for-himself exotherm that you want to avoid at all cost. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How do you synthesize something at 700C, which is not stable at room temperature, and then cool it to minus whatever to store it without it decomposing? Very quickly?</p>
<p>EDIT: So I read the paper as /u/superPwnzorMegaMan suggested (I have JACS access). The JACS paper does not describe the synthesis but instead refers to a prior publication: &quot;Dioxygen difluoride was prepared directly from the elements by the method described elsewhere.^9&quot;</p>
<p>Reference 9 is: A. G Streng and A. V. Grosse, &quot;Addition and Substitution Compounds of Oxygen Fluorides,&quot; Second Annual Progress Report for the Office of Naval Research, Contract Nonr-3085(01), Research Institute of Temple University, Philadelphia 43, Pa., January 19, 1962.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.onr.navy.mil/" target="_blank">The Office of Naval Research site</a> does not seem to have an archive, and searching the <a href="http://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/" target="_blank">National Archives</a> was similarly fruitless. I was able to find a scanned copy of <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CB8QFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dtic.mil%2Fdtic%2Ftr%2Ffulltext%2Fu2%2F403447.pdf&amp;ei=6i1vVbOAK5OhyASe-oKQDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNF92jpBxrea8J4Viz1o3zBKq787uw&amp;sig2=k1M4mt1K4PIymEjlXCvQjw&amp;bvm=bv.94911696,d.aWw" target="_blank">Streng's Third Annual Report</a> (which does not contain the synthetic details), but not the second. </p>
<p>The related patent <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US3634483" target="_blank">&quot;Process for preparing compounds containing the oof group&quot;</a> again does not describe the synthesis of FOOF and contains a reference to the same Second Annual Report.</p>
<p>So, the question remains unanswered. /u/thebigslide provided a reasonable suggestion for synthesis, but my question is what are the technical details for cooling the reaction from 700C to 90K (-183C). And does any decomposition of FOOF occur during the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More FOOF related trivia: The original Intel Pentium microarchitecture had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_F00F_bug" target="_blank">particularly trivial and nasty bug</a> nicknamed F00F. It was named after the hexidecimal encoding of the operand that would basically completely lock up the chip. Operating systems had to install special checks as the instruction required no special privileges.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A fluorine atom is connected to each of two interconnected oxygen atoms.</p>
<p>So that <em>is</em> the chemical equation (or its reverse, maybe). FOOF is something else (I don't know my chemistry well enough to know if it's a thing and has its own term and everything) that better-represents the structure of the molecule.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about lots of oxygen with a small amount of FOOF (or lots of nitrogen added in)? The gas would stay reactive down to a very low temperature and the excess oxygen would absorb large quantities of heat to cool the flame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The flame is definitely much hotter, yeah. FOOF is just so unstable that it will cause ignition even at that temperature, but while it tears itself and everything else around it apart, a ton of heat is produced.</p></div>		</li>
