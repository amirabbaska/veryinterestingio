			<div class="markdown"><p>High frequencies are damaging (ionizing) because individual photons have the ability to disrupt chemical bonds by energizing electrons. It has nothing to do with penetration.</p>
<p>An electron requires a certain amount of energy in a single particle to raise its energy level. This threshold is what makes radiation ionizing. For example if you stand in front of an extremely bright red light you'll never get a sunburn because even though there's a lot of energy hitting you, the individual photons have very low energies. A dim UV light will do more damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t photons need exactly the right amount of energy to be absorbed by an atom? Is it not because the atoms in the wall just don’t accept the specific frequency of the light?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To a certain degree, yes.  Introductory physics course teach that when atoms transitions from one shell (S, P,D,F,...) to another shell it requires an exact amount (quanta) of energy to do so.  Further along in physics education you learn than these transitions are blurred by all kinds of effects and so it’s not an exact quanta of energy.  </p>
<p>That said, it’s possible for an atom to momentarily absorb a higher energy photon than its transition requires and then allow the remaining energy to scatter as a lower energy photon (with a ‘phase shift’ but I digress).  This means thinking about photons as discrete particles is inefficient for explaining why high and low frequencies pass through matter.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! There are specific sets of wavelengths (or frequencies, or energies if you like) that any given atom can absorb. Because these are specific, explicit sets of energy levels, we call them ‘quantized’, which is when quantum mechanics was born out of. (Very simplified, but it’s the idea). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Other replies talk about single atoms, but in bulk materials, there are many atoms and many bonds, with many electronic energy levels (electronic bands). This creates a lot of different mechanisms for photons to be absorbed, resulting in absorptivity in large ranges of frequencies rather than just individual frequencies. </p>
<p>Also, I think the parent reply is incorrect, but I don't know enough to wholly answer the question, only parts. </p></div>		</li>
