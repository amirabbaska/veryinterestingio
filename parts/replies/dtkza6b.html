			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s cheaper, older, can transmit further, can penetrate buildings better, and because there’s less bandwidth per station, there can be more AM stations in an overlapping region. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're right about most of that. It's definitely not cheaper. AM towers are massive and you need more than one. You also need them out in a field with their own power supply station and an engineer. FM on the other hand can be broadcast with a simple antennae mounted to a high building or mountain in the area. AM uses vastly more power to operate as well, which does have advantages. At night, some AM stations can be heard coast to coast.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also the reason most stations on AM are talk radio, it is not really that important to get great sound when there is no music playing that needs the range.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Voices also occupy a much smaller set of frequencies, so you don't need the same large bandwidth to accurately portray voices (more or less). Many AM stations are used for talk radio because of this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And while FM gives the better quality, it comes at a price. The shorter wavelengths aren't able to travel as far as the AM band. Without adding in repeaters at least.....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a good thing, because available bandwidth is very limited. That way different cities that are not that far from each other can have different stations on the same FM frequency, which is not the case with AM. </p></div>		</li>
