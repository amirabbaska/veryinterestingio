<p>What are the expected downsides of countries submitting parts not money?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I work at what is going to become the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams(FRIB), which is an accelerator facility. So far the project is ahead of schedule, and is going to be finished most likely in 2021. There wasn’t a question of what country it would be located in, or decisions about what country would provide parts. There have been no issues with waiting for funding or waiting on people to give us parts, and still it is a project that has been almost 20 years in the making. These projects are so enormous that it isn’t just a matter of more money will make it go faster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How important of a project is it that there are no petty squabbles over location and part sources?</p>
<p>If global warming, IMO more important than energy (though the two are pretty intertwined), can't get politicians on the same page why do rare isotope beams?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Funding diversity can be a good thing too. In the 70's and 80's the United States wanted to build the Superconducting Super Collider, which would have far surpassed CERN and the Large Hadron Collider in terms of power. But, congress decided they didn't want it and cancelled the program in 1993. </p>
<p>That project had its own set of problems, but it wasn't technically impossible or vastly more expensive than the LHC (as far as we know). But, it only had one funding source, so when that funding source decided that they no longer thought it was a good investment, the entire program was cut. Why did they cut it? Some reasons were mismanagement: the projected cost of the facility ended up being greatly higher than anticipated, and progress was slower than anticipated. But, other reasons were political. The end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union meant that the US no longer felt the need to prove scientific supremacy. The International Space Station was also being built at the same time, which was also very expensive, and the science funding community argued that having two large super-projects was draining money away from many smaller, diverse projects that could be funded in other fields.</p>
<p>CERN isn't susceptible to the same problems. It's an international effort, so one country pulling its funding, or changing political conditions in a country, can't be total death to the entire project. That does cause its own problems: every country who contributes should rightly expect to get something for their patronage. It also causes good things to happen. International collaboration is good for science, so even if there are more disputes or it takes things slightly longer to happen, better science can happen and certainly better dissemination can happen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Helium-4 and Deuterium have the same charge to mass ratio. Thus they will have the same in cyclotron frequency.  Ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRF) is often used to heat a plasma, and an ICRF antenna that is designed to heat Deuterium can also heat Helium.</p>
<p>I believe that helium also interacts more favorably with the wall than hydrogen. This helps with density and impurity control.</p></div>		</li>
