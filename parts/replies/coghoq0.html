			<div class="markdown"><p>This is such a good point.  While there was enough computing power for the landings there was just <em>barely</em> enough.  Software was a new &quot;concept&quot;, rather than physically encoded programs in the hardware.</p>
<p>During the landing phase the on-board computer had several, now famous, <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/alsj/a11/a11.1201-pa.html" target="_blank">program alarms</a> that where indications the computer was performing too many operations and was forced to ignore &quot;low&quot; priority job.  The computer rebooted at least twice on the way down!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We still do!</p>
<p>Even though we rely heavily on computers to do big number-crunching in some scientific fields, you can't just be an untrained person with no experience and devise a study and get results.  You still need to be an expert to devise the method, do the computation and compile and interpret the results.  The computer doesn't come up with answers, it just comes up with numbers given other numbers.  If it's been programmed wrong or the input is wrong, it's the human operator that is answerable to that.</p></div>		</li>
