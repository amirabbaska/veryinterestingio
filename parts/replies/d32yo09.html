			<div class="markdown"><p>A week is a very long time to analyze a test. Let's say every two days I change my scented candle or scented room fragrance. It is obvious that the odor composition can be altered in a matter of seconds or minutes, yet the test takes a week Is there a no reliable and quicker analysis for testing odor?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No that's actually the most reliable way to test for odor because you need to gather a baseline. When you're in a room, CO2 spikes from your breathing; when you light a candle, aromatics spike; when you open up a window, ozone spikes. You need to get a baseline reading and because you're in and out of a room all day, you have to know at certain points what will the air that you breathe will have an effect on you and also because humans are variable and alter their environments so often, you have to get an extended analysis to be able to observe that. So it has to be a long test. It's quite expensive as well and unsightly as lines are hung around everywhere, but you also get peace of mind and you see hundreds of compounds that you're breathing everyday. It's pretty cool.</p>
<p>You can also test for odor in water, that's another odor test that's commonly done</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup! It's essentially non detectable though.</p>
<p>The odor that you smell in the air is actually super small particulates and/or VOCs in the air. So every time you can detect a smell, you are inhaling something of that source. Just like you can 'smell' dust in the air, because you are literally breathing it in. Same goes with rotten eggs, except you are mostly detecting sulfur based compounds in the air, which are very volatile at room temperature. </p></div>		</li>
