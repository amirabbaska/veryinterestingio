			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitropism (where roots grow towards gravity and stems grow away) is caused by starch grains in the cells being more dense and 'falling' to the bottom. The centripetal force from the centrifuge would move the grains outwards causing the plant to grow as if outwards was down and inwards was up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be that the downwars force exerted on the plant by gravity leading to it growing &quot;up&quot; is essentially replaced by the outward centrifugal force the plant experiences when spinning causing it to grow &quot;in&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, the first plants to be studied were aboard Skylab, but yes, I’m sure that they are still growing some basic plants. Corn, string beans, and peas I’ve read about specifically, because they both grow quickly and exhibit a great variety of genetic diversity in their offspring.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I currently have an experiment on ISS! We are one of a few ongoing plant experiments up there.. we're basically using a centrifuge to determine the lowest level of gravity that can be sensed by the plants.  This will hopefully help us make some predictions on how things will go when we have our first crops on the Moon (0.17g) and Mars (0.38g).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Certain cells at the tip of the root contain starch-filled compartments called amyloplasts. The starch granules inside the amyloplasts settle to the bottom of the compartment, like snow settling in a snow globe. Somehow (no one really knows how yet), this condition results in the auxin secretion in an appropriate area of the root to cause growth in the direction of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We actually do know, it's one of the research subjects at my University &gt;_&gt; </p>
<p>PIN proteins, which transport auxin in a polar fashion, are put on the membranes. There's different PINs for different growth effects, they generally all are made polar via endocytosis and recycling to the correct membranes side. I don't remember exactly, since I don't work with plants, but I believe the starch granules have a recognition protein that starts a signalling cascade to locally increase the endocytosis of PIN proteins. Whichever number it is for the gravitropic effect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So there are chemicals, called auxins, in root tips and stem shoots. In roots these chemicals, as you would expect, are pulled downward by gravity. So if the root is horizontal the auxins are pulled to the bottom. Root auxins restrict growth meaning the root doesn’t grow as much where they are. This means the top side of the root (which doesn’t contain these chemicals) grows faster causing the root to bend downwards as it grows. Auxins stimulate growth in stem shoots causing the shoot to bend toward light</p></div>		</li>
