<p>It's shit like this which reminds me that I don't really know jack about biology. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The toxin works on blood cells and destroys their ability to carry oxygen.  It is neither painless nor quick, it often takes more than a day to work.  The animal doesn't feel much at first, but it gradually becomes more and more winded.  The hunters may pursue it for days until it finally collapses with its lungs heaving, panicked because as much as it breathes, it isn't able to absorb enough oxygen.  The hunters close in and end it with a spear to the heart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So here's where the distinction between venom and poison is actually relevant!  The toxins in arrow poison are technically venoms, because they have to be introduced directly into the bloodstream.  Why is that?  Because these particular toxins are easily destroyed by things like stomach acid and heat.  Shoot your giraffe with a poisoned arrow, stalk it until it collapses, and you can eat it perfectly safely after you cook it.</p></div>		</li>
