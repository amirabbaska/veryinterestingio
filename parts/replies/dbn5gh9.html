			<div class="markdown"><p>Still won't work. <a href="http://hubblesite.org/the_telescope/nuts_.and._bolts/res101.php" target="_blank">Hubble has a resolution of 0.1 arcseconds</a>, this is barely enough to show objects of the size of 150 meters on the moon. To show objects of the size of 1 meter from the earth (or hubble orbit), you would need a resolution of ~0.0006 arcseconds. We are way too far away from achieving this. Also, if you are wondering how Hubble can resolve objects that are so unimaginably far away - it's because all objects that Hubble photographs are insanely huge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only because they are huge but also because Hubble looked at them for a long time and gathered all the data to make up a picture. Neil Armstrong would be moving way too fast to use the same technique.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The other issue is that the moon is far too bright for the Hubble to image under normal circumstances . Its sensors are extremely sensitive, and the light reflecting off the moon and would cause them to saturate. As I recall, normally the only time it's pointed at the moon is to produce flat frames to characterize the sensors. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the Hubble Space Telescope pointed to Earth, the resolution would be 1/10th of an arcsecond. <a href="https://www.spacetelescope.org/about/faq/" target="_blank">(1)</a></p>
<p><del>At the equator, an arc-second of longitude approximately equals an arc-second of latitude, which is 1/60th of a nautical mile (or 101.27 feet or 30.87 meters). <a href="https://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/0400/wdside.html" target="_blank">(2)</a></del></p>
<p><del>Does this mean that the Hubble would be able to make out the size of a ~3 m figure? If it's pointed at the moon there's also no atmosphere to see through. Should still be enough to see if there's someone walking around on the moon.</del></p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the clarifications.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hubbles resolution is 0.1 arcsecond <em>regardless</em> of where it is; that the whole purpose of using angular resolutions.</p>
<p>Your second piece of calculation is misplaced and irrelevant; what you have done is calculated an arcsecond of equatorial circumference. That has nothing to do with resolution.</p>

<p>/u/Xeno87  has correctly summarised how Hubble behaves when dealing with earth-moon distances (i.e. a resoltuon which equates to about 150 m).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No because the moon is farther. Angular resolution tells us what size objects we can distinguish at what distances, think about how the same person looks smaller when they're 100 as opposed to 10 feet away. So 0.1 arcseconds at the distance from Hubble to earth is a few meters, but 0.1 arcseconds at the distance from Hubble to the moon is some hundreds of meters. You can't make out a person if your pixels are the size of a football field.     </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you just have to track the Moon over the exposure length which probably won't be long (seconds). This is just done with the pointing of the telescope.</p></div>		</li>
