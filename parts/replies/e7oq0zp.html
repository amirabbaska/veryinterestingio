			<div class="markdown"><p>A piece of light is recorded using this streak camera. The problem is that by the time it takes a second picture the light is already out of frame. They instead use a second camera and although it takes a picture of a different piece of the light, it moves the exact same way as the first. You would then do that multiple times and put it together like putting together a movie. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arthur C. Clarke. It echoes Leigh Brackett:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Witchcraft to the ignorant... simple science to the learned.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Agatha Christie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The supernatural is only the natural of which the laws are not yet understood.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>edit: Clarke's own example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clarke gave an example when he said that while he &quot;would have believed anyone who told him back in 1962 that there would one day exist a book-sized object capable of holding the content of an entire library, he would never have accepted that the same device could find a page or word in a second and then convert it into any typeface and size from Albertus Extra Bold to Zurich Calligraphic&quot;, referring to his memory of &quot;seeing and hearing Linotype machines which slowly converted ‘molten lead into front pages that required two men to lift them’&quot;.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way: You want to take photos of a fast-travelling car on a road. You want to take photos when the car is going fast, but you want the photos to be taken when the car has travelled a really short bit between photos. The camera is too slow to take two pictures that fast.</p>
<p>So what you do is, you take the picture of the car on the road. Then the next time you see an exactly identical car, you take another picture - much later - when that car is just a little bit farther ahead. It looks as though you took two pictures of the same car, having traveled just a short bit but in reality a lot of time passed and they are two separate (but identical) cars.</p>
<p>This is how the light camera works. The light is set up so that a pulse travels by the camera say, every second (in reality much much closer together). The camera is set up to take pictures every second plus some veeeeeery small amount of time so that it looks like the same pulse, but in reality it's several different ones having traveled a bit farther just like with the cars on the road.</p>
<p>The ultra-fast shutter is needed to capture the light pulse at all so that it doesn't &quot;smear&quot; and look elongated on the picture (it does, but very little). Think of the cars again - if you had a slow shutter, each car would just be a blur. The fast shutter is to keep the light pulses in focus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well then this is not really a video of a light pulse. It is multiple photos of multiple light pulses played back sequentially to look like one light pulse.</p>
<p>I am no longer excited about this image.</p></div>		</li>
