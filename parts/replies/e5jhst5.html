			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering light as a particle: it's just Newton's gravitational force formula F=GMm/r^2</p>
<p>where G stands for the universal gravitational constant, M for the mass of Earth, m for the mass of the particle being accelerated towards the Earth, and r for the distance between them.</p>
<p>Then a(particle towards Earth) = F/m = GM/r^2</p>
<p>Which is independent of the mass of the particle, so even massless photons would accelerate towards the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

<pre><code>ma = GMm/r^2</code></pre>
<p>will do you no good when m = 0.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to talk about photons, which are quantizations of the electromagnetic field, which is a relativistic and quantum construct. It's enough to declare the existence of a nonrelativistic vector field and call the singularities of such a vector field &quot;charges&quot; and oscillations in that field &quot;light.&quot;</p>
<p>Einsteinian relativity can be derived from Maxwell's equations if you assume the Lorentz force law and require it to be equal in all reference frames, but the original approach was to assume Galilean relativity and Newton's equations and Maxwell's equations because that's a hell of a lot easier.</p>
<p>All I'm using is Galilean relativity and classical electromagnetism. Classical electromagnetism is taught using Galilean relativity. It certainly makes sense, it's done all the time. In principle, you could take your argument further and say &quot;well using quantum mechanics doesn't really make sense because space is just strings vibrating on a Kahler manifold,&quot; but if you can intuit string theory, you shouldn't be spending your time on ELI5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's fair, but I think you're confusing &quot;classical&quot; with &quot;non-relativistic.&quot; Relativity is a classical theory. When I learned electromagnetism freshman year of college, we presupposed special relativity and proved the existence of a magnetic field by equating the force on some moving charges in different frames--essentially the reverse of what you described. I think this approach is more logical and elegant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was not a fundamental assumption of classical mechanics. Optics was a field of study, and Maxwell was able to bring optics under the field of E&amp;M with his contributions, but before that, and before the 1800's (although I don't know how much before the 1800's. It really could have been at any time in the scientific revolution as far as I know) some astronomer made measurements of Jupiter's moons around Jupiter and found that the return half of the orbit always took less time than the orbit back around and they concluded that, if Newton's description of gravity is correct, the light must be travelling at a finite speed and the discrepancy in measurement can be described as a sort of &quot;rolling shutter&quot; effect (vSauce has a good video on the rolling shutter effect and the last few minutes, if I remember correctly, talk about how the Andromeda actually has a noticable rolling shutter effect for most equipment that can see the Andromeda Galaxy).</p>
<p>As for how it would interact with gravity, it could still be instantly transmitted on a curve. Physics is weird, and no assumption is ever safe.</p></div>		</li>
