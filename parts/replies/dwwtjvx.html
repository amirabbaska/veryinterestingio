			<div class="markdown"><p>Gray (or grey, if you prefer) is just the common term for &quot;reflects most wavelengths of light evenly&quot;.  So when you polish a gray material to get a clearer reflection (less diffusion), you are reflecting light evenly across the spectrum and don't get a tinted reflection.  If your material is colored (like gold or copper), that means it is reflecting that color of light more strongly, so if you polish it up, you will still end up with a tinted reflection.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is that why shapes are more defined through gray veils than white or black?</p>
<p>(If I put my hand in a gray glove, it's easier to see its shape than with a black glove or a white glove).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason why it is easier to see details in gray than black or white is because if contrast. Your eyes constantly adjust to attempt to gather the correct amount of light. When they do this they basically use the average intensity of incoming light to adjust. The problem with seeing detail in white and black is that these are at the extreme ends of the intensity spectrum. This means that they have a good chance of overloading the light receptors in your eyes or not stimulating the light receptors in your eyes enough, causing a loss of detail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, this is just saying gray has no tint. What you're referring to is probably related to the thickness and transparency of each fabric. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. From a spectrum perspective, white and black are both values of grey, as in, it's actually the same color. All 3 &quot;shades&quot; have the same flat wavelength spectrum, just at different intensities (True black being 0, true white being all your cones can handle). And if different veils have the same spectrum, the only thing that can change is the overall intensity. Therefore the only difference between the veils would be their overall transmission coefficient.</p>
<p>If you took a neutral density filter, AKA a gray veil, and sent pure white light through it, it would look white. Stack a couple neutral density filters, and the light white would come out gray. Stack 1000 and the light comes out black, AKA there is no light. Basically the lighter gray the veil is the easier you will the shape because the lightness of gray is literally just how much of the light coming from the shape is making it through. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes this. Gray is just white with some loss of brightness, and white is the combination of all colors, so a gray surface reflects all colors equally, which is the property that you want in a mirror so that it doesn't tint the reflected image.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps? That's essentially saying &quot;instinctive experience&quot; - that I've encountered polished objects in varying gradients of reflectiveness and have internalized their behavior.</p></div>		</li>
