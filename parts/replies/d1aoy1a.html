			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I don't understand how people aren't freaking out in lower sea level parts of the world/US.  In the US, some of the most populated and economically important cities would be the first to go.  This is a very real future, and it's legitimately denied by people.   I mean, I live in Minnesota and even at 60+ meters, we'd be okay here, but I still acknowledge it's imminent danger and get worried.  </p>
<p>Not to get too political here, but Marco Rubio, who was a final candidate for the president of this country, denies all of this, all while being a senator for the state that would get virtually erased from the map, and while living in one of the <em>very first</em> major cities, even globally, that would become flooded. It's just... incredible that with all we know, we choose to ignore the signal greatest threat to our entire species.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As a scientist, I would like to point out that this is global sea level rise <em>only</em>, and does not take into account regional distribution of sea level rise, land rebound, changes in ocean currents, etc...  So, don't use it to plan where your descendants will settle :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The ultra wealthy area will probably be able to put in place engineering solutions - like London's Thames barrier. The sheer value of land in these cities will make heroic engineering possible whereas other areas are probably going to be lost. The Nile delta strikes me as being a very likely candidate to be lost which will cause enormous issues.</p>
<p>Social issues are likely to be a much bigger problem than actual flooding for most of the world. Witness what the drought in Syria did to society there and extrapolate that to the entire world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Glaciologist here.  Nice summary.  The quick and dirty on ice sheets that we like to tell people is West Antarctica: about 6-7 meters of sea level rise, Greenland, also about 6-7 meters, and East Antarctica (the big one), about 60 meters.  Greenland is melting fast, BUT, West Antarctica is the area we are most interested in as it is a marine ice sheet and there is evidence that has collapsed quickly in the past.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here. I wouldn't say that it seems stable for now as the East Antarctic Ice Sheet is so bloody huge it is probably more appropriate to talk about the stability of particular areas within it rather than the stability of the entire system. Most areas of it are incredibly stable while others have the similar concerns to what we see in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and could also contribute to sea level rise. This is because much of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet lies on continental crust that is above sea level or would rebound to above sea level without the ice sheet on top.</p>
<p>However a lot of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet sits below sea level, some areas of which sit on basin shaped bedrock. What this means is that if the glacier edges in these areas retreat far enough, the grounding line (the point where the ice starts floating) will shift over the ridges of these basins into bedrock that slopes inland. This will allow warm water to flow inland and burrow under the ice sheet potentially causing much of the ice sheets interior to float.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n8/full/ngeo1194.html" target="_blank">good overview paper</a> about the West Antarctic Ice Sheet stability. Though it's from Nature and therefore behind a paywall.</p>
<p>This is a <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2014/05/16/west-antarctic-ice-sheet-news/" target="_blank">good blog post</a> going into more detail about water potentially burrowing under the ice sheet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends on who you ask.  There's a whole mess of great research being done in East Antarctica.  There are many stations and camps up on the high plateau where people are doing research in ice core science, geophysics, subglacial hydrology, biology, glaciology, etc etc.  I would say from a perspective of ice loss, mass balance, and ice sheet stability, the big interest right now is more focused on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet...and that in that regard, the larger East Antarctic Ice Sheet is generally behaving more stably.  There've actually been some recent papers that show that parts of East Antarctica are actually gaining mass (which isn't surprising as warmer air, carries more moisture, and therefore more snow falls).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you elaborate? You mean geological evidence that West Antarctica previously experienced a rapid collapse of the ice sheet and was temporarily bare ground? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's important to note that much of West Antarctica is below sea level, so you won't get indicators for bare ground in the paleo or geologic record. However we can infer that there has been open water in areas of West Antarctica by the presence of marine micro organisms in glacial sediments at the base of ice cores.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can study how the ice shelves might react in a warming climate by studying the glacial sediment deposits in areas where there is no longer ice shelves. We can map and date their retreat by looking at cores to see where glacial sediment is replaced by open marine sediment. Using radiocarbon dating, you can then place dates on when this occurred giving scientists a way to see how quick the retreat was.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-02-colossal-antarctic-ice-shelf-collapse-ice.html" target="_blank">good article</a> giving a more general audience description of the science.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/113/9/2354.full.pdf" target="_blank">specific paper</a> which is open access.</p>
<p>Here's another <a href="http://www.antarcticglaciers.org/glaciers-and-climate/ice-ocean-interactions/marine-ice-sheets/" target="_blank">quick article</a> on stability that mentions micro marine organisms in glacial sediments at the bottom of ice cores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's evidence across multiple disciplines that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet may have collapsed during previous interglacial periods in the past.  Many many scientists have been looking at this possibility, especially since most-recent mass loss, gravity, and ice flow data show that the major outlet glaciers of West Antarctica (Thwaites and Pine Island) are currently speeding up and losing enormous amounts of ice.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes it is a bit weird to say west and east antarctica, but within the community, this terminology is used.  The transantarctic mountains split the continent in half, and we refer to the &quot;Grid&quot; western half as west antarctica.  Grid simply means if you look at a map projection of Antarctica and take 0 degrees longtitude as grid north...then west antarctica is grid west, and east antarctica is grid east.  Usually when I'm doing outreach to general or middle-school audiences, I simply say the &quot;big half' and the &quot;small half&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll add to this by saying that a lot of sea level rise (SLR) occurs because the ocean is warming, and that additional heat causes the volume of water to expand slightly. A warmer ocean, even by just a couple of degrees, takes up significantly more space.</p></div>		</li>
