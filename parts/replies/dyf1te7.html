			<div class="markdown"><p>I can chime in on this a little bit. Medusa was not always the snake haired, turn every man she looked at rock hard in an instant (literally), gorgon that most of us are familiar with. Her [admittedly Roman] origin story, as related by the Roman poet Ovid, is actually rather tragic. She was raped in the temple of Athena (virgin goddess) and and punishment for <em>her</em> transgressions she was twisted and cursed into the monster she has come to be known as. This is one of the many stories that Feminist authors have pointed to which shows the aggressive patriarchy of the ancient world.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair it has nothing to do with patriarchy, she was not some random woman but a priestess of Athena who was by her sacred oath to remain pure and to keep the temple pure. </p>
<p>Gods cared not for excuses, she allowed her oath of chastity to be broken and she allowed the purity of the temple to be ruined. Gods were just as dickish towards men for just as stupid of reasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There’s texts claiming Medusa was a goddess of the Berber, a people in Liberia. The theory is that she was turned into a horrific feature to change the feminine goddess principle into something terrifying and she was an easy scapegoat since her location would also mean she was a dark-skinned goddess. This is based on Herodotus IIRC but there’s other theories that she may have been an entirely Greek creation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, that's a weird thing to say that they went out their way to destroy her because she was a woman...when there were many powerful female gods in greek myth. I think it was more because she was foreign </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That connection would tie in nicely with the theory that &quot;snake hair&quot; was supposed to be a metaphor for dreadlocks, but was interpreted literally because the concept of African hair was so foreign that having <em>literal fanged snakes for hair</em> made more sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My mind was blown the first time I heard these explanations to the story of Medusa. There's a video somewhere out there that in failing to find that breaks it down even further to show how the men, the myths call them heros, are really asshole &quot;dog the bounty hunter&quot; types who go assault this poor cursed woman on her own island. She's basically defending herself.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that Lake Natron in Tanzania (Africa) petrifies animals that come into contact with its alkaline waters, it's also likely that &quot;Medusa&quot;, or a Medusa-like being, was created and used as an explanation for what was happening with all the calcified animal remains people in the area kept finding. The stories then spread and changed and mutated from there afterwards.</p></div>		</li>
