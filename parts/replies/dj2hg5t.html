			<div class="markdown"><p>So what you're saying is that as time goes on, new stars will be composed of higher concentrations of heavier elements? So what would the lifespan of one of them be compared to first-generation stars? Also, how long is this system sustainable?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically, although the rate of supernovae happening has gone way down. We wont see the concentration of heavier elements increase by all that much. </p>
<p>The system is only sustainable for a short while really (on cosmological timescales anyways). At some point star formation will slow down and eventually stop. There won't be enough free hydrogen to form new stars and most of the matter in the galaxy will be locked up in stellar remnants and extremely long lived stars like red dwarves. A few trillion years maybe. </p>
<p>The life span however of current population I stars (Er population I stars are current era with high metallicity,III is the earliest generation.  Astronomers are weird) , and ones likely to be formed in the future will last much much longer than the earliest stars. As best we can tell there are <em>no</em> population III stars left. It's likely that population III were huge, hundreds of solar masses, dwarfing even the most massive stars today. Their potential upper limit for mass is somewhere around the lower limit for what it would take to just directly collapse into a black hole (that's also expected to have happened). Stars that large live fast, die young and leave brillant corpses that eventually merged into the supermassive blackholes we see today. A few million years for most of them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe the populations got their numbers based on spectroscopic observations, before astronomers had any idea why stars would have different spectra. So the most &quot;normal&quot; stars were named population I and the &quot;weird&quot; ones which had low-metal spectra were named population II. It's only later that we realized the stars in population II actually came first, but by then the name had stuck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So how is it that within earth's crust there are veins and concentrations of the heavy elements? How do the heavy elements and compounds stick together in a high enough concentration following a Nova, vice being randomly distributed wildly about that we find them in mineable quantities here on Earth following the re-congealing of asteroids and solid chunks of dead stars? ie Why do we find deposits of Iron, deposits of Uranium, ect stuck together (for lack of a better description)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concentrations of minerals into mineable deposits happened after the formation of the Earth.  When the earth was still molten, the elements separated out via density. This is why the Earth has an iron/nickel core (two of the heavier common elements). </p>
<p>The differentiation of the Earth into core, mantle and crust also had the effect of pulling the siderophile  (iron loving) minerals into the core.  These elements include Iridium, Osmium and Palladium.  It has been noted that these elements are far more common in metallic meteorites; it is assumed that they are equally common on Earth, but have been locked away in the core.</p>
<p>Following this differentiation after the cooling of the Earth's surface, ore deposits were created from a chemical, physical or biological process which concentrates the element into an ore.</p>
<p>For example, a volcanic eruption may bring these less common elements from the Earth's mantle to the surface.  <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation" target="_blank">Banded Iron Formations</a> formed through oxygen from the first photosynthesising organisms reacting with iron and settling iron oxides. Hydrothermal action, where hot mineral rich water precipitates in fractures led to the famous tin veins of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dartmoor_tin-mining" target="_blank">Dartmoor</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to the concentrating effects of these geological processes, we have mineable ore deposits.</p></div>		</li>
