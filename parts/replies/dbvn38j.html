<p>Previously you hack a credit card reader provider and you get everything.</p>

<p>This happened to me in the Home Depot hack. I swiped a card at one of their locations near Boston and after the hack someone used my debit card in Florida. By coincidence I had stopped using that card and only have $0.15 left on it when they tried to use it. Frustratingly that didn't trip the fraud detection with my bank, even though the card was A) used thousands of miles away from every other transaction I had ever made, not to mention me registered addressed. B) Was used to attempt a purchase much much higher than the remaining balance on the card.  C) A card that hadn't seen any active use in months. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not that it'll ever happen, but given that the usa has a single point failure with the ssn, that type of system should be used for that too. one-time-use codes any time someone wants your ssn, instead of just handing it out left and right the way we did with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5lgw1c/eli5_why_is_there_a_separate_security_code_on/dbvogrg/" target="_blank">carbon paper credit card receipts.</a></p></div>		</li>
