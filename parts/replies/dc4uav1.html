			<div class="markdown"><p>You recalled correctly. Apples are referred to as &quot;obligate out-crossers&quot;, meaning they have to cross-pollinate with a different variety to successfully set fruit at all. The apple produced is dependent on the mother tree, but each seed inside will be a unique hybrid. To be productive, an orchard must always have at least two apple varieties in it, which are chosen to be compatible pollen-wise for setting fruit, and which also bloom at the same time, so the bees can deliver the pollen between the trees when they are both in bloom. It's also significant to know that apple trees are grafted onto specialized root stock, usually chosen to create a healthy, short (=easier to pick), and faster to bear fruit tree. So, almost every apple tree you see is a double clone - one clone for the stem, and one for the roots.</p>
<p>Fun fact: Johnny Appleseed was a real person, and was the originator of many varieties of apples. What was he doing, planting whole orchards full of apple seeds, when he knew no two trees would be alike, and many not worth eating? The answer is, he was planting for cider, not for eating. If you are growing for cider, it makes sense to have variation: even tart, inedible varieties will produce a flavorful cider, and a mix is better than a single variety. The trees will also bear their fruit at different times, allowing you to spread out your cider production. A mixed orchard is more resilient to weather variation too: trees that don't bear much fruit one season may produce lots the next. </p>
<p>Johnny kept moving on, but the people who got his orchards had hundreds of newly created varieties to choose from. The healthiest, most productive, and tastiest varieties got chosen to be cloned into more trees. Also, sometimes a branch on a tree will mutate and start bearing a slightly different apple, and those are sometimes superior and chosen to be cloned as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I've read only a little about fruits and fruit trees, but I know a good bit that you described. Likely nowhere near your level, lol. I remember reading about full-size, dwarf, and semi-dwarf trees. The Rural King nearby has apple saplings every spring, and I wish I had property to plant one on!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Johnny Appleseed also believed that grafting was immoral. Which is another facet to why he planted so many types of seeds. He liked cider too, but that's not the whole story.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that its purely random what type of apples a tree will produce grown from seed.  So you could very well get apples that taste the same or you could stumble upon a new &quot;good&quot; flavor of apple.  I guess it would depend on the range of apples that can physically be produced versus what consumers label as good eating apples </p></div>		</li>
