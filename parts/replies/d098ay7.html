			<p>TL;DR backdoor access is about finding loopholes in the system, or unsecured things in the system.<br><br>Think of the system as a huge buildng. Uh oh! Looks like the designers forgot to make one of the windows on the 60th floor lockable! As a result, you climb the building Mission Impossible style and you break the weak security the contractors installed as a temporary solution to the window.<br><br>After you break in, you collect whatever useful data you have. Sometimes, they can break into another room from there, and can end up hijacking something far more valuable.</p>		</li>
