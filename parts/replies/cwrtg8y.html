			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an electrician in Canada, and this is probably the clearest answer here.</p>
<p>There seems to be a lot of talk about &quot;only having 120V&quot; in an American home, but every house could have 240 to any outlet, it's just a matter of changing the plug and breaker.</p>
<p>I would say safety is the biggest reason the keep things the way they are. 240 hurts a hell of a lot more than 120, and is more likely to kill a small child. Also, the way our grounding system works, you're only ever going to get hit with 120 if there's a ground fault that doesn't trip the breaker.</p>
<p>It would be easy enough for an American company to make a 240V kettle and you could definitely have a 240V plug in you're kitchen if that's your best reason for needing a higher voltage in your house.</p>
<p><strong>Edit for the &quot;current is what kills, not voltage&quot; brigade</strong></p>
<p>Because although that saying is true, it's very misleading. Voltage(V)=Current(I)Ã—Resistance(R). The one thing that stays constant in a simple circuit is resistance. Heaters, light bulbs, appliances, PEOPLE... they have a certain resistance that doesn't change. When you interrupt a circuit, you don't get the same flow of current that circuit used to have, you essentially are creating a NEW circuit with yourself in place of, for instance, the heater. </p>
<p>Say your body resistance is 10,000ohms, when you interrupt the 120V circuit, the current through your body is 120/10,000=0.012 Amps (or 12 mA) vs 240/10,000=0.024 Amps.</p>
<p>That's 12 mA in the 120V circuit and 24 mA in the 240V circuit.</p>
<p>Although the current refers to the actual electrons flowing through your body, and those are, technically, what kills you, the ammount that passes through you is entirely dependant on the voltage in the circuit.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2 to try to help understand current vs voltage</strong></p>
<p>Think of a water line. The water pressure in the line is the Voltage, and the actual water is the Current, and the thickness of your skin is the Resistance. You could have a 1 inch water pipe, with water flowing out the end at, say, 20psi (I'm no plumber, so I'm not sure if these numbers are realistic, but bear with me). If 100 gallons of water pours out on your head, its not going to hurt you, just get you wet and annoyed. Now if you had that same 100 gallons shoot out of a 2mm pipe, at 2 million psi, I'm guessing it would put a hole through you. Again, I'm not a plumber, but you get the idea. You can say that, technically, the water killed you, but its the higher water PRESSURE that was the real reason you were killed.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandparents's house has a few 220v outlets in the kitchen, that have Italian-style plugs.</p>
<p>I think they had them installed back in the 70's to run an espresso machine and some other appliances they had imported. Comes in useful from time to time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well depending on the amps we still use plugs like that for high voltage high current appliances like ovens and dryers. They are shaped differently so you can't plug in the wrong plug and it only gets plugged one way. There is a huge range of voltage and current rated outlets and plugs that look different. </p>
<p>So what I'm saying is what you saw may still be the standard today. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes sense to have a few outlets in the house with a higher voltage, particularly if they're used only in places that are easy to supervise.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm.  I recently remodeled my kitchen and put in a German 240v outlet in the kitchen to run a German kettle (which boils water way faster than a 120v kettle).  My electrician used red wire to denote the higher voltage, but it was the normal gauge (14ga I think).  The only hard part was sourcing the outlet, which I had to order online, but it came with the same code certifications as a North American outlet so my electrician was happy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't you use residual-current circuit breakers on that side of the pond? I thought those kind of faults was practically impossible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>rcd's in the uk and gfci's in north america accomplish the same objective, they measure the current leaving, and the current coming back, if there is a variation more than a few milliamps it will trip and protect you from injury</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use GFCIs fairly commonly (US), which will trip if there's a current imbalance between the grounded and hot conductors. However, not every outlet or device is protected by this by code, and many houses are old enough to not have any GFCI protection at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main issue with 120V systems is the power is quite limited. In the UK a typical domestic socket is rated at 240V, 13A, which gives a touch over 3kW. Perfect for a cuppa. </p>
<p>But in the US, the sockets don't go much above 15A, and they are only rated at 12A continuous load. Couple that with the lower voltage of around 110V, and the amount of power is less than half of what you can get in the UK. So things like microwave ovens, kettles, portable stoves, etc. are quite limited. </p>
<p>Also, if you want to charge an electric car from 120V it takes much longer. 240V, at least, takes only half the time, ideal for a trickle charge of 4-5 miles/range per hour vs only 2 mi/hr on the Tesla S. But connect it to a standard British 32A circuit (via a direct plug) and things get a lot more useful. In the US, 240V requires a different setup utilising two phases, requiring additional wiring.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nah.  120v uses a hot, a neutral, and a ground. 240v uses two hots and a ground.  Just requires an additional space in the breaker panel. We still typically pull 3 conductor + ground but it's not required</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do have 240V outlets in homes in the US, generally for major appliances. We also do regularly wire for 20A circuits and outlets.</p>
<p>An electric car charging outlet would definitely be a 240V circuit in the US, probably with a high amperage breaker and thicker wires.</p></div>		</li>
