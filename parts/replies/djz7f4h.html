<p>Modern behavior analysts would talk about karma as a conditioned reinforcer - it functions in the same way as other social reinforcers such as praise to increase the future probability of the behavior it follows.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC the reason they weren't used is because when they were trained, they were trained to look for AMERICAN boats because the americans training them only had access to american boats, obviously. so when faced with a japanese boat and an american boat, the pigeon would try to target the american boat which would have been a disastrous failure of the program had they ever been given real explosives in a live trial.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which basically means your opinion shifts, get a big group to downvote you even if you're right and you will start feeling wrong. Thanks for explaining the irrational massdown/upvote parties that happen on here sometimes. But now i'm just sad. Is there a way to break the cycle? To interrupt the conditioning through reason? </p></div>		</li>
