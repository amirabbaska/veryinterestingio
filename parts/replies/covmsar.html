<p>Also nobody wants a dead animal on the sidewalk in front of their business, and apartment building supers are legally required to keep that shit cleaned up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the reality of 99% of all living things on this planet and probably every other planet.</p>
<p>It is sad right? I don't feel very wistful towards &quot;nature&quot; or have any romantic illusions about it. It's eat or be eaten. Some animals are literally nothing but &quot;food animals&quot;. Their evolutionary defense is just to reproduce at extremely high rates to offset how often they are slaughtered and eaten. And they tend to be really cute animals too, like bunny rabbits and shit. The universe is a cruel place. Existence is suffering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was driving down a road with a guy i used to work with. Big trailer hooked up, sketchy road, blah blah. A hawk snatched a smaller bird out of thin air and took it straight to the ground  in an instant. It just stood there over its kill, in our lane, not flinching. Traffic was coming in the other lane, couldn't swerve, hit it doing about 55-60 mph. I hate birds, so i was cool with it, but the dude i worked with was all torn up about it. He was a pretty bad ass guy, but my opinion of him dropped slightly after that</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once saw a pigeon get run over by a taxi slowing down as it approached a red light. The pigeon was running out of the way but he didn't go fast enough. He was slowly crushed and his organs pooped out his butt. He staggered, still alive, for a moment and then fell down dead. Moments later a MUNI train came by and ran him over and dragged him down the tracks, smearing blood on the road.</p>
