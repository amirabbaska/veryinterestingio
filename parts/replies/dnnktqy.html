			<div class="markdown"><p>I was coming home from work last week and farted in my car. No big deal. I locked the door and went inside. About a half hour later, I decided to go pick up a six pack from the local store, and my god the stench when I got back in. I thought I stepped in dog shit.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It isn't accurate though. Not only does it not smell nasty when doing that, but people also enjoy the smell of their own farts when people directly beside them do not. You are both smelling it at the same time for the first time.</p></div>		</li>
