			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't there something about the role of virtual particles too? That in order for the math to work out and explain what we see, we need to incorporate virtual particles, which pop in and out of existence, or rather with the many worlds interpretation, they pop in and out of different universes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the name &quot;virtual&quot; particle is misleading. All they are are gauge bosons  (or some other mediating particle like the pion for strong force) which exist instantaneously and are (I think) impossible to detect. Cool note, by the uncertainty principle they can violate conservation of energy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that's quite correct. Virtual particles are things that appear in certain types of calculations; they are not to be thought of as physical particles. They have very little to do with the many world interpretation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just want to add that for the branching model, the &quot;proof&quot; under the most recent formulation (2014) is interference. Things like the results of the double slit experiment is thought to be the different branches interacting, since traditionally, other universes are supposed to be beyond our causal influence. Once the wave function &quot;collapses&quot; or the branching occurs, then the distinct branches are no longer able to influence one another.</p></div>		</li>
