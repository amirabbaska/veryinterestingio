			<div class="markdown"><p>Tempering a blade is an important step in making sure a knife (or any tool made of steel for that matter) will hold up to the abuse that some blades were designed to take and retain a good edge.The lower transition threshold for carbon steel is about 1300 degrees C.  This is where the metal starts to transform into a form of steel called austenite and is the last form of steel before it turns liquid at about 1500 degrees C.  When you quench steel and bring it below it's lower transition threshold you form different types of steel with different characteristics.  Martensite being one of the forms that is super strong but also super brittle because the carbon doesn't have time to separate into the steel and &quot;clumps&quot; making pockets in the metal.  When you temper steel such as for a knife you are controlling they type of steel it transforms into and if you know what you are doing you can make a blade that has a hard outer jacket that will hold a good edge while the inner &quot;core&quot; of the blade is a softer more ductile type steel.  This is an over-simplified explanation of some pretty technical metallurgical principles but the gist of it is to make a blade that will hold a sharp edge and not break when you hit a bone or something similarly hard.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Tempering is actually only a portion of the heat treating process, specifically the portion that occurs post quench, where you are relieving stress.  Straight out of the quench, at the steels highest possible hardness, it is incredibly brittle and under the right conditions will crack or break.  Tempering is heating the steel to a low temperature (the temperature depends on the composition of the steel) to take some of the hardness and brittleness out of the steel.  </p>
<p>Typically, when making a knife, the heat treating process starts with normalizing the steel, then heating to just beyond the Austenitizing temperature, quenching, and then tempering.</p>
<p>Also, alloy selection makes a huge difference when trying to control for a hard jacket and soft core.  Some steels just can't do that because of the alloys, like Manganese and Chromium for example.  Those elements make steels deep hardening.  In order have a soft core, you need to have a shallow hardening steel.  </p></div>		</li>
