			<div class="markdown"><p>So does it detect the magnetic flux? I suppose go &quot;askscience&quot; on the answer, cause I'm curious (if you're willing). Had so much info shoved at me at once I probably have a name wrong.</p>
<p>My assumption at the moment (from the physics I can remember) is &quot;detector emits magnetic field, metal in field experiences magnetic flux, flux creates current (eddie currents), current creates reaction magnetic field, reaction field altars net field, change in net field changes current strength in detector, something in detector recognizes current change, makes beep.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A changing magnetic/electric field can actually induce small electromagnetic fields in non magnetic metals.</p>
<p>What happens is that a small circular current will form in the metal to counteract the externalling changing feild (called eddie currents). This small circular current acts like a small electromagnet in the metal.</p>
<p>You can see this in action when you drop a magnet through a copper pipe. Copper is non magnetic, so you wouldn't assume anything would be different, but watch: <a href="https://youtu.be/zCUSXoL4SDE" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/zCUSXoL4SDE</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This. See Maxwell’s equations. Specifically, the total electric flux of a closed surface is proportional to the amount of charge contained in that surface and the magnetic field (specifically curl) induced in a closed circular wire is equal to the current plus a term that is proportional to the rate of change of electric flux. Basically, an electric field is created by a concentration of charge and a magnetic field is created by a current or by a changing electric field.</p>
<p>Edit: also, the curl of an electric field is related to a changing magnetic field and the magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero (zero divergence, no magnetic monopoles).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope! infact a metal detector can even tell the difference between magnetic and non magnetic conductors, some can even be tuned to tell you the diff.</p>
<p>The basic mode of operation is that they use the coil in the metal detector as the inductor in an oscillator circuit. They then use another osillator that more or less matches the 1st ones frequency and mix the results of the two. </p>
<p>As long as the frequencies nearly match, you'll get little to no 'beeping'. As soon as an object increases or decreases the inductance of the detection coil (IIRC, non magnetic conductive objects decrease it while magnetic ones increase it), the frequency changes and even though it only changes a tiny fraction of a percent, the mismatch between the two oscillators becomes huge.</p>
<p>Think of it like a 20,000hz osillator shifting by 100hz, going from 20000 to 20100hz sounds like very little, but when you mix it with a 19999hz oscillator, it goes from making 1 beep a second to 100 beeps a second.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you moved it parallel to the floor, probably. If you got closer/farther from the floor, it would beep, at least the way I understand it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe that should still induce a current, since parts of the floor are getting closer and further away as you move the field. I believe any moving magnetic field should induce an electrical field.</p>
<p>Edit: nevermind, an airport metal detector would still trigger on a metal floor, because it works by creating magnetic pulses. By inducing the change itself instead of generating a static field, the detector can induce fields even in static metal objects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most metal detectors have a control to adjust the steady state (although modern ones can be automatic). So you could adjust it so the metal floor is &quot;normal&quot; and getting farther or closer to it will set off the detector</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not how they usually work.  For most you have to move the detector to generate a tone, as they are triggering on the variance of a magnetic field.  It would trip once as you were lowering it to the metal floor and then stop.  You could determine the range of the detector by raising and lowering it until you find the spot where moving it up/down by an inch or so triggers the tone.</p>
<p>Here's a demo showing this...</p>

<p>You can 'tune' a detector to generate a different tone for 'trash', like aluminum, vs. coins.  </p></div>		</li>
