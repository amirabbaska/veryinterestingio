			<div class="markdown"><p>This is actually not true. Gravitational waves are a counterexample.</p>
<p>I do suspect it's true if all the associated velocities of the mass distribution are much smaller than the speed of light though. But I'm not sure, since it would seem that acceleration is what's important here. Does anyone have a nice derivation of this from Einstein's equations?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Definitely not my area of expertise, but despite the extremely exotic nature of gravity waves I don't see them as a counter example.  Keep in mind that the gravity waves we have detected are from two black holes orbiting each other. The gravity waves of a single spherically symmetric rotating object are zero, the gravity waves from a single near symmetric object are, although non-zero, very, very tiny.  They're tiny but furthermore, like any emanating oscillation, their amplitude drops to zero with distance such that at sufficient distance they are undetectable.  Furthermore, for any system, no matter how great a gravity wave source, the amplitude of those waves will always fall to zero at some great distance.</p>
<p>Thus I don't see why the old result of Newtonian gravity (that any distribution is like a point source from a distance) doesn't still remain true with the exotic addition of gravity waves.   </p>
<p><del>Also: to even consider it as an exception it would also have to be the case that the deviation due to gravity waves would have to be shown to be quantitatively larger than the deviation due to simply Newtonian gravity and non-point-likeness (i.e. one would have to show that the gravity wave deviation is the larger effect than whatever the higher-order deviation is from integrating over a finite sized mass distribution).</del></p>
<p>EDIT: Actually, I believe /u/2_the_point is correct.  Gravity waves fall of in amplitude at the same order as Newton's universal gravitation.  Therefore, one COULD in principle tell the difference between a non-spherically symmetric object and a spherically symmetric one if one could detect the extremely small gravity waves emitted by the former</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You get higher order (n-pole) moments depending on the distribution, which are subdominant to the overall mass term (monopole moment) at large r. But the radiation term isn't subdominant (or am I mistaken?)</p>
<p>EDIT: I mean, they carry energy like amplitude squared, right? (They're waves) Energy conservation means they amplitude falls off like 1/r, then. So yeah, it's immediately stronger than any higher-order term. It's just got a tiny initial amplitude.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not true even in Newtonian gravity. A <em>spherically symmetric</em> distribution is indistinguishable from a point source at a distance. Other distributions have higher order moments, as /u/2_the_point writes.</p></div>		</li>
