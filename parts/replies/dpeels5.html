			<div class="markdown"><p>I learned this last month in nursing school! Usually most people's will return to normal by 1 second. When we did assessments we were to report a refill rate of 3 seconds or more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On animals, you press on the gums, and on infants, you press on the sternum. </p>
<p>It is not very accurate, its more of a quick test. It doesnt really tell you what is wrong, but it can tell you <strong>if</strong> something is wrong.</p>
<p>If the color takes too long to return, it could be dehydration, poor circulation, low blood pressure, or even shock. More tests would have to be done to determine why the capillary refill rate is slow, as there are multiple possible contributing factors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I looked it up to make sure. According to wiki, the average adult’s refill should occur within 2 seconds, on infants (using the sternum instead of nail bed) it should refill within 3 seconds. Not sure about animals. It probably varies by species.</p>
<p>Edit: reconfirmed with another source, I know many people distrust wiki. Yes, should refill in 2 seconds or less.</p>
