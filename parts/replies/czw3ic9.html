			<div class="markdown"><p>To those who become confused by this, remember that 10^20 is not half of 10^40 , but instead only has half as many trailing zero's. This means that 10^40 is in fact 100 quintillion (short scale) or 100 trillion (long scale) times larger than 10^20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had no idea there was a long and short scale for numbers until I read your post and looked it up. That has to have the most potential for misinterpretation of any labeling system I've ever seen. This bothers me more than an American tone (2000 lbs) vs everywhere else's ton (2240 lbs), not to mention tonnes. I don't care how inconvenient it is for people, we need to all be using the same units of measurement. 100 trillion should never mean the same thing as 100 quintillion. It's way too easy to misinterpret.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>well, nearby everything was probably destroyed already by having two big black holes spinning around each other for quite some time already.</p>
<p>but the real question you nailed here is: the closer you are to the source, the larger the amplitude should've been - so how large could the initial amplitude have been?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If it's a wave wouldn't the inverse square law apply?  If we have the amplitude here and know the distance to the source then it's simple.  Assuming that there's not something else between points A and B absorbing part of the energy that we don't yet know about.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I suppose it would depend on if gravitational waves behave like other waves. I don't remember the exact equation for it, but it think intensity falls off with the inverse square of the distance traveled. Since this event took 1.2 Billion years to reach us (I think that's how long it was anyways), the amplitude would be (1.2 Billion)(1.2 Billion)(distance light travels in a year) times larger. Actually... Let me look that up real quick.</p>
<p>Edit: ok yeah I'm way off, disregard the above. I found an equation that related amplitude to the distance D traveled by the wave divided by the frequency F of the wave, A = D/F. So it would be ((1.2 billion)(distance light travels in a year))/(whatever the frequency was). I'll edit in an answer, or at least the value of the frequency, as I go back through the other comments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Assuming an observer somehow survived or got close enough on a rocket-ship to observe this mega dance of death, would they experience heating like Jupiter's moons experiencing tides? Or since it's space-time that's getting squeezed and stretched matter not experience any friction? I'm kind of wondering if the energy equivalent of 3 solar masses does any sort of &quot;work&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The important thing to remember is We are 1.3 billion light years away from the event, that's why it took 1.3 billion years for us to get those waves, on any event destroying nearby things is of no question as mentioned by someone earlier in this thread, but anything around millions of light years away from the event must have been significantly changed their courses unless otherwise the objects are huge compared to the total energy released wouldn't effect them. </p></div>		</li>
