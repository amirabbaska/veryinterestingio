			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't forget that it can be an asset for those media outlets to be attacked by the President.</p>
<p>Trump is very polarizing. Some people love him but a lot of people hate him, and they believe his positions and opinions to actually serve the opposite of a credible critique.</p>
<p>So if Trump calls your news outlet a fake, </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>you discredit Trump so much that it'll only make you have a stronger opinion that your news outlet is true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>you discredit Trump enough to just not listen to him</p>
</li>
<li>you're not going to watch that news network anyway because in your opinion they're already unfair.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any way you look at it, the harm that such a statement makes is pretty minimal.</p>
<p>...although such statements made by a different president that was substantially more trusted and popular might have a different result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the bigger issue with impeachment is that it doesn't make the president accountable to the people, just to Congress which is likely their own party. Republicans are never going to impeach a republican president, no matter what he does.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, the republican party isn't 'his' party. He conveniently ran with the GOP, which makes it likely that they won't back him when the time comes. We've seen a glimpse of that when they tried to repeal Obama Care. Is party loyalty still that prevalent? I don't think so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not when it is the POTUS saying so, I think. I'm not an expert on US law in any way, but as far as I know there are some very special rules surrounding the presidency. Then again, I suspect those rules have never been tested in this way, so who knows what the legal practice might be?</p></div>		</li>
