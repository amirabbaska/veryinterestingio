			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, some.  About a third of a liter of water is produced in your body each day through the metabolic process, but the majority of water your body uses is water that your drink, or eat in food.  If you drink the recommended amount of water each day then you're drinking 2 liters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Which is a mistake, because that was based on how much actual H2O entering the body was necessary, meaning they didn't account for the vast amount of water contained in food. 2 liters a day is way too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you've ever dripped sweat into your mouth, or had snot drain down your nose, or breathed out then back in and had a water molecule stick to the inside of your mouth, or any number of similar processes, I agree it would be nearly impossible to not drink at least one water molecule twice over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was also thinking about how when you flush a toilet, it aerosolizes some of that water. So... if you've ever inhaled in a bathroom you previously used to urinate, I imagine there's that too.</p>
<p>Gross to think about, really.</p></div>		</li>
