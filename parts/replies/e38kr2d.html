			<div class="markdown"><p>This, kind of!</p>
<p>There's a reason why the largest animal in the world is the blue whale! Being that large means that you're generating a ton of heat just keeping your body at stasis and if you're too large (and therefore generating too much heat) you're not going to be able to properly function. Elephants are huge but only because they have almost equally large ears that allow their blood to be rapidly cooled by the ambient air/evaporation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Having big ears might mean you have sweet ear-conditioning, but you're also stuck with being able to hear everyone mock the radar-dishes strapped to your dome.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand, it's not just elephants' ear size but how their physiology is built for their ratio of volume (or mass) to surface area. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">square-cube law</a> explains a lot of limitations in nature. If an elephant was the size of a mouse, it would freeze to death. And if a mouse was the size of an elephant, it would explode.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oooh ooh ooh.  From what i remember, theres a special term for what im gonna explain but i cant remember.  Back when intelligence was sought after, humans started to grow larger brains, but suddenly womens birthing canals could not sustain a babies head that was too big.  From what i remember, this is part of the reason why babies are “babies” for so long.  Because our brains dont fully develop because that gave us a disadvantage in birth.  Someone will prolly explain better but im on mobile and i know ive used some terms wrong but the general idea is the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When humans started walking upright, around the same time our brains got larger, we started birthing babies at 9 months instead of 12 months. Most animals can basically walk when they're born, but humans are born too early for that.</p></div>		</li>
