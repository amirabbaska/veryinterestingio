			<div class="markdown"><p>so it would depend on the type of brain cancer... DIPG's and Meddulloblastoma have different responses to treatment.</p>
<p>I would opt for treatment if the treatment had a good chance of working. I would get as much cut out surgically as I could.  followed by CSI radiotherapy to get any metastasis with a boost to the tumour bed, and regimes of chemotherapy.</p>
<p>i would prob also stop paying my student loans for a bit and travel..</p>
<p>I want to bring up a two quick points you touch on...</p>
<p>there was a poll asking doctors if they had a terminal illness would they do aggressive treatment. the majority said no they wouldn't. I would fall into that group I think.</p>
<p>but brain tumours aren't necessarily a terminal illness anymore (DIPG's are, but not all medullos)... and when you hear in the media of some physicians who pass on treatment for some cancers it is dwarfed by the physicians you dont hear about who do take on aggressive treatment...</p>
<p>i hope I have answered you question properly... </p></div>		</li>
