			<div class="markdown"><p>I wholeheartedly agree that vaccines are fantastic and should be administered whenever needed! I didn't mean to imply that I thought they were detrimental to our health.
Rather my question, poorly stated as I look back at my initial question, was if the efficacy of the immune response to the vaccines would be the same or less if someone were to receive multiple at once. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I’ve just had a heated discussion with an anti-vaccer, and it irks me. </p>
<p>It is a good question, and looking at other respondes, you’ve had more temperate and on point responses already. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No worries! I appreciate you weighing in! </p>
<p>You brought up good points. There has definitely not been any evidence that receiving multiple vaccines is in any way detrimental to your health. And your metaphor was an eloquent method of describing it since I am definitely the type of person who sees things better through metaphors like the one you described.</p>
<p>I've definitely had my fair share of arguments with anti-vaccer's so I understand where your frustration would come from. It can be incredibly difficult to understand why someone would be against something that has been proven by multiple scientific sources. </p></div>		</li>
