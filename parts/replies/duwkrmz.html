			<div class="markdown"><p>Traffic is definitely a large factor. I love driving a stick, but city driving in the US sucks majorly no matter where you are. It's more convenient to be able to focus solely on not getting rear-ended, instead of also having to worry about constantly shifting between 1st and 2nd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really isn't, but I get their point about constantly shifting being annoying in stop and go traffic. When I go to work it's usually 40 min of stop and go between 0 and 15 mph. If I don't shift out of first I stall, if I do I have to immediately shift back into first.</p></div>		</li>

<p>a friend has an 1980s era VW Diesel manual rabbit.  The darn thing is so freakin' easy to work on (TONS of room under the hood to access the engine), and got obnoxiously great gas mileage back then.</p>
<p>Zero to sixty in May (may that day come soon)</p>
<p>The thing is a bit of rattle trap now (dash vibrates, trim isn't what it used to be, etc) but still starts right up, and runs like a top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The US also has a ton of traffic lights instead of traffic circles. Where I live randomly has a decent amount of them (I think because it has a European name and thinks it’s cool) and people dont know how to use them. You always see people trying to switch lanes in the middle of the circle or just generally not going when they are supposed to. These are great because you just coast right through, but everywhere else is stop and go even when it isn’t busy. Sometimes they make you stop just for the hell of it while no car goes by the other way. Those are getting more uncommon though with signaled lights. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here in Boston we have everything. Tons of traffic lights, tons of traffic circles (often called rotaries here), tons of cars, and tons of congestion. We're not as congested as places like LA and NYC but we make up for it by driving like assholes and having absolutely bonkers road layout that confuses anyone who isn't local. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Traffic circles are called roundabouts.</p>
<p>There is plenty of stop and start traffic in Europe and especially the UK.</p>
<p>I wonder if it's the opposite - so in the US a 400 mile drive isn't unusual, whereas most people may not ever undertake a single drive of this many miles in the UK - or do it once in a year. Even so, an unbroken flat drive of more than a mile in the UK is unheard of anywhere except a quite motorway. In the US you can drive for 50 miles without changing gear when going between cities.</p>
<p>As such, a US driver is more likely to have a very different driving pattern to a European.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is to do with it somehow although it seems slightly counter intuitive?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah this was what took me away from manual cars. I used to love my manual impreza when I could get out and actually drive it. Got a new job and spend a lot more of my drive time in traffic and fiddling with the clutch every 10 seconds to move a car length got old quick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, RSI in the knee started to suck. </p>
<p>I think clutch pedals tend to have too long a throw. Like, you don't need to move the thing 9 inches to disengage the clutch ffs. I have better fine-motor control in my ankle, anyway--you know, the joint I use for controlling the gas? </p>
<p>A little better ergonomic design and maybe an automated way to deal with stop-n-go would probably see a surge in manual sales in the US. I know I would much rather drive stick than auto if not for that pain. </p></div>		</li>
