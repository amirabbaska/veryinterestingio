			<div class="markdown"><p>We have found several new fossils since changing hands. We have found at least 3 kinds of theropod dinosaur and many more bones from the hadrosaur Protohadros. Overall though the site itself hasn't changed much.
I have not received much interest from UTA about involvement with the AAS. They do not have many faculty that do paleo anymore. We now work closely with the Perot Museum.
