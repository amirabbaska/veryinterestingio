<p>Do we already see everything omitting/reflecting light in our observable universe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Light is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" target="_blank">redshifted</a> over time and distance, losing the visual information it carries (from the perspective of our vision, it degrades). But as an example, the omnipresent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">CMB</a> is essentially the leftover light from the Big Bang event spread across the universe and it can be detected even now. You just can't see it with your eyes.</p>

<p>can we also theoretically just catch a glimpse of a new star being formed?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can see that practically. If a star is born somewhere close, the light radiation from its inception will eventually reach your eyes, with the exact delay of the speed of light. If it takes 20 years for the light to reach Earth, you will see events that happened 20 years ago. In a nutshell, due to light not being instantaneous, you are always looking at history when you look into space. If you eyes were more tolerant of observing the Sun directly, you would see its exact state with a delay of 8 minutes.</p></div>		</li>
