			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Spare and camping blankets, a lot of cool-season coats, and many forms of upholstery come to mind. Anywhere there's a need for soft and warm fabric.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the same affect that you see in mowing patterns on athletic fields. The mowers that are used have heavy rollers that bend the grass blades in the direction that the mower is traveling. Grass bent away from your point of view reflect light and look lighter in color. Blades of grass bent towards your point of view don't reflect as much light in your direction and cast shadows making those section appear dark in color. Because of this, the section of a football field that look light and dark to one person are actually the opposite for someone sitting across from them on the other side of the field.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As additional information on these types of fabric, sewing patterns (in the US) refer to fabrics that have little carpet-like fibers like velvet and faux fur as having &quot;nap&quot; or &quot;with nap.&quot; When you use a pattern to cut it out and sew it, you have to be careful that the nap is all running in the same direction or you end up with something that looks odd due to the different color effect that you noticed. </p>
<p>There are other fabrics that appear to be different colors depending on how you are viewing the threads in the weave that have to be treated the same way when cutting out and assembling. These fabrics appear to change colors for a different reason than the types of fabric you asked about.</p>
<p>As far as using a fabric like this for a cloak of invisibility, I think you'd be able to blur your outline a bit if you used super-reflective material for the hairs, but I think it would cause a funny looking spot that would draw the eye. Maybe in a jungle where there was a lot of objects to hide in and around it might work...</p></div>		</li>
