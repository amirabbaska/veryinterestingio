			<div class="markdown"><p>But then how come athletes tend to have lower resting heart rates than average? Isn't it essentially because they exercise their heart?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the physiologic adaptations to exercise is increased cardiac inotropy. As a result stroke volume is increased so while cardiac output is the same, heart rate is lower. </p>
<p>Chronic stress does not lead to increased inotropy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My general understanding of why elevated HR is so beneficial is precisely because during the vast majority of the time when you're not exercising, the lower resting HR is ideal. But if you're physically active with a elevated HR throughout the day (I have a very active job <em>and</em> I lift weights 3x/wk), is that potentially problematic?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because a high HR means your body is having to pump more times to get the same amount of blood to the periphery  of your body as a normal HR. That's why Armstrong's heart was so strong because his HR was insanely low and he was doing the same work for almost half as much a normal heart rate. It's all about the efficiency of the each or the stroke volume.</p></div>		</li>
