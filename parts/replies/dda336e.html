			<div class="markdown"><p>The Breakthrough Starship program is moving along.  The technological challenges are great, and are all at the edge of what is currently possible, so we will see how they progress.. It is an exciting prospect, and now uses only private money, which is why I am involved.  </p>
<p>As far as space exploration for the future of mankind, I think in the long term we will need to consider locations other than earth for humans to live, but I do not see this as a pressing issue now. Space exploration, in my opinion, is best done with robotic devices like the rovers on Mars.  Human Space Exploration is mostly built around adventure, which I can certainly relate to, and I think is worth doing as well, but the best science that is done doesn't involve humans because the dollars spent on missions can be spent on science rather than getting humans back alive. </p>
