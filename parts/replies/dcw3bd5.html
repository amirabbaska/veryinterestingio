			<div class="markdown"><p>All companies have negative externalities and positive externalities.  Just because you don't like something doesn't mean that thing is inherently subsidized.  Also, while oil companies do emit GHG, so does all economic activity.  GHG emissions are a global externality.  Blaming oil companies for all GHG emissions is like blaming farmers for all starvation and obesity.  They should be making more and less food!  Damn farmers!</p>
<p>One could argue that the positive externalities associated with oil and gas companies far outway the negative.  Forget the fact that all modern commerce is based on the use of fossil fuels and focus on one specific detail.  U.S. petroleum companies provide a massive diplomatic and economic benefit to the United States and have directly helped this country win several wars.  BP, Standard Oil (Chevron and Exxon), and Shell destroyed their own oil fields in Baikal to help the U.S. and England win WW1 (prevented them from falling into German hands) and they destroyed their own oil fields in the south pacific to help the U.S. and England win WW2 (prevented them falling into Japanese hands).  It would really suck if we lost those wars.  </p>
<p>Moreover, oil companies often act as the Praetorian guard for current U.S. diplomacy.  They work with countries that we can't be seen to be working with and bring our beliefs to all parts of the word.  It is hard to start a war with the guys who bring you oil.  The &quot;Pax Americana&quot; the world enjoys right now is at least partially due to oil diplomacy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the biggest ones people talk about is the foreign tax credit, but that applies to all US businesses so it's pretty unfair to call it an oil subsidy. </p>
<p>However, petroleum companies get breaks on things like spending money on oil exploration, drilling on federal lands, and depreciating the amount of oil left in a well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There we go. Now how much do these add up to in revenue credits in a year? The only one I can get a breakdown on looks like its pennies and serves as a sort of put option for oil wells.</p>
<p>It looks like ConocoPhillips, Chevron, and Exxon pay some of the highest % of revenue and net tax bills out of all corporations.</p>
<p>Yea I'm calling bullshit on this canard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While that's true, it's also important to consider that most foreign corporations have American subsidiaries that are eligible for the subsidies. Things like the foreign tax credit wouldn't really apply because those companies are sending profits out of the US, not bringing them into the US. However, things like exploration and drilling subsidies would apply.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Like I said, it's way more complicated. But regardless of who owns the company, a corporation that's doing things and creating jobs in the US is going to be favored by the US govt.</p></div>		</li>
