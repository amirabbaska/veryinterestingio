			<div class="markdown"><p>I am curious how parrots fit into this. I have a greenwing macaw who is pretty vocal, she responds to and imitates certain birds outside. Other times she uses greetings that have context to the human members of my household (e.g., she uses her typical call that she uses to greet a new person arriving in her presence or upon her approaching a group of people when she sees a bird outside). She also appears to recognize herself as herself (as opposed to another bird) in the mirror. Bird brains are so fascinating. I suspect we still don't quite fathom just how advanced they could be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great question! I used to work on vocal learning in a parrot lab. Parrots are a whole other game, they learn far more similarly to humans that many songbirds do, as they can actually form associations between specific calls and external referents in the environment, much like humans use words. They are excellent mimics, but also adept at mapping these sounds to meanings. Your macaw maps particular sounds to particular people, as she has presumably been socially reinforced for making those sounds in those contexts. The best way to teach new words to parrots in our lab was to make it a social game called the 'Model Rival Technique'. For example, say you have Parrot A, who knows the word 'orange', and Parrot B, who has not yet learned this word. You would show an orange object to Parrot B and ask 'what color'? Parrot B doesn't know. So you turn to Parrot A and say 'okay, what color?' Parrot A responds 'orange!' &quot;Good job, Parrot A! What a good bird! What do you want?&quot; &quot;A nut.&quot; &quot;Here you go!&quot; By now, Parrot B is incredibly jealous that Parrot A is getting all of this attention, praise, and treats. He now associates these rewards with the word 'orange' applied in this context. They pick up words and their appropriate associations very quickly this way! You can also do it with another human if you don't have a second parrot on hand. Alex the parrot learned over 500 words and their referents this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>VERY interesting, I'll have to try that. She certainly does seem to exhibit jealous-like behavior in similar contexts.</p>
<p>Are there any recent new or exciting discoveries related to bird communication you have to share? </p></div>		</li>
