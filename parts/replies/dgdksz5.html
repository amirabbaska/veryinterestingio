			<div class="markdown"><p>To be pedantic, how did you determine the drag coefficient?  It changes with the velocity (usually shown as a function of the <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/dragsphere.html" target="_blank">Reynolds number</a>), which can make determining the terminal velocity a bit more difficult when you approach the dip at the turbulent transition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm fairly comfortable using the approximate turbulent value on Wikipedia.  It'll be mostly turbulent for most of its descent (Reynolds number of about 4000 above 10 m/s).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Wikipedia article for terminal velocity states a bullet's terminal velocity is about 90 m/s. If you use 1.2 kg/m^3 for air density it gives a closer approximation. </p>
<p>If you fire a bullet straight in the air, it will tumble down which will significantly lower the terminal velocity. Only problem is that it is almost impossible to aim perfectly upward. In most cases, there will be a slight angle so the bullet will maintain its spin which will allow it to reach terminal velocity on its way down. In this case, the bullet can be lethal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question!  But I'm not doing the calculus.  The muzzle velocity is nearly 1 km/s.  Assuming no air resistance, it'll reach 47 km into the air.  I suspect we can be pretty comfortable with it reaching terminal velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should add the muzzle velocity to your top-level response.  While 100m/s is fast, it's 1/10th the muzzle velocity.</p></div>		</li>
