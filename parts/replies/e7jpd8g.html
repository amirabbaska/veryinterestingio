			<div class="markdown"><p>Mostly the second, though it depends on the exact type of chapstick. More natural things (Shea butter, for example) can actually work to restore the original layer somewhat since it’s similar in composition. Petroleum based chapstick like Carmex goes the simple “seal everything in” approach instead to provide relief without actually repairing anything which it leaves up to your body to do (though it is more resistant to other things in return).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Does this mean for some it works great and for others somewhere between a little and none?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It slows down evaporation.  One tip is to use a cream like eucerin that has urea in it on your lips.  Wait a moment and then apply your lip balm.  That makes the lip balm last much longer.  Also the urea drags moisture out from the lower layers so you have a double effect going on.  </p>
<p>This is something I figured out over decades after suffering from eczema and chronic chapped lips.</p></div>		</li>
