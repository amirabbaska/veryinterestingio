			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair peer-to-peer networks do exist. This is how Tor, BitTorrent and Bitcoin work, for example. Skype was originally peer-to-peer as well, routing calls through other users' computers. <a href="https://ipfs.io/" target="_blank">IPFS</a> is the closest I can think to what they describe in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>The issue is doing it on phones. Like u/pragmojo said, for a phone to be part of a peer-to-peer network it needs to be constantly receiving and serving data, which impacts battery life and the data usage of your plan. Desktop and laptop computers, which are plugged into mains power and lack bandwidth caps, don't have this problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think a bigger problem would be designing dynamic pages in a peer network. I don't think the back end of servers could be replicated in a peer based system without major developments in that area.</p>
<p>If pages were simply static like the early days,  it wouldn't be as big of a challenge. But even then to have changes propagate could be a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, it's wrong (or the depiction on Silicon Valley was wrong .. I didn't see it).</p>
<p>The internet we use today is highly centralized, in two ways, each of which some people want to decentralize.</p>
<p>First, is the hardware.</p>
<p>Our home routers are designed for a hub-and-spoke model, wherein your home devices are connected to an &quot;internet provider&quot; who connects in turn to a higher-level provider, and so forth.  In this part of the internet, the advantages of a network, a web, are completely lost.  If you want to connect to your neighbor down the street, your data goes to your ISP, and possibly somewhere else, before getting to your neighbor's ISP, and then to them.  This is despite that fact that there is tremendous unused capacity between your house, and their house, which could get the job done locally, without having to leave your own street.  Neither of your ISPs should have to get involved, at all.   </p>
<p>Further, it is possible to set up ad-hoc mesh networks so that smartphones can communicate with each other.  This has already been done in the real world, during crisis situations when people cannot access regular internet, to enable a way to communicate to others, over WiFi, without any other hardware except the smartphones in the area.   I don't buy for a second that this isn't solvable for general use.  What's missing here is further support for the concept.   And that could mean taking support away from hub-and-spoke infrastructure like cell towers so more bandwidth can be dedicated to WiFi.   Obviously there's opposition not just from corporations who profit on hub-and-spoke, but spies who like to monitor it.</p>
<p>Second, is the software.</p>
<p>We could change the hardware right now, and the system would still be centralized.  Consider how we use it.  Actually consider just Reddit.  Reddit is something which ought to be a protocol, so that no matter where you were on the internet, you could leave a comment with your reddit ID, and other redditors would see it, either by following you, following the subject, or following that website.  Nobody, in particular the site owner, or admins, or moderators, could block the communication between you and the people who were interested in what you had to say... regardless of what you had to say.  By leaving Reddit as a site, it is fundamentally flawed, and is essentially a censorship machine like all the rest.  (At least it has the decency to admit when it deletes something, though... but watch for that to disappear) </p>
<p>The comment before yours referred to file storage.  Well, decentralized file storage is ALREADY a thing (storj.io, lbry.io) and it's hosting content that others have tried to censor (notably, a series of university lectures that deaf people had censored because they weren't captioned).  This is a new concept, but people can be compensated for their storage costs by the people requesting it.  It's unlikely that you'd opt to store other people's file fragments on your phone today, but give it a few years.  </p>
<p>Keep in mind that the concept of &quot;eat up your bandwidth&quot; doesn't necessarily apply to a mesh model, where you are cooperatively serving the internet to each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I love when someone speaks with authority.  It challenged my own understanding for an instant before I realized you may be speaking out of turn.</p>
<p>I work for a tier 1 Internet provider. We don't route traffic in neighborhoods because we aggregate traffic on a wider scale.  We don't have a router in every block. There is a local aggregation point in the city (we have ~ 150 nationally covering 300 M people, all major markets) with a router that allows localized communication.  Your traffic to your neighbor goes to that local router and back, but that's because we handle petabytes of traffic and the routers are extremely expensive.  From there they go to regional data centers where traffic is routed to other operators or around the country.</p>
<p>We don't carry traffic to some national central data center or something, &quot;back to the ISP,&quot; whatever you meant by that. The cable in the ground outside is the ISP's, so if it leaves your house it has reached the ISP. </p>
<p>I see this as a decentralized model as no single operator runs the show. Even our network architecture is decentralized,  we want the traffic to move off our network as close to you as possible so we don't pay to carry it far.  There are many Tier 1 operators in the states and we all route traffic freely amongst one another.  There is no central authority, ie centralized, or central national data center...  it is very decentralized. </p>
<p>If I were to try to sort out the engineering of a seasonal plot point on a fictional show about a fictional compression algorithm,  I'd have to agree it's likely a peer-to-peer architecture.  Who knows.</p>
<p>Most spaces I see that talk about this are talking about how Google and Facebook are central authorities on the Internet and have amassed too much control of Internet attention.  It's still not centralized, it's just more centralized than they would like.  That's your &quot;software&quot; comment.  I disagree that widespread voluntary usage of a site, Google, or whatever, is the same as centralization, but I see their point and where it could lead.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You are conflating &quot;the internet&quot; with &quot;How I connect to the internet.&quot; They might seem the same, but they are fundamentally different concepts. </p>
<p>No one is preventing you from having multiple paths to the internet, most people don't simply because it increases their cost for very little benefit. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and as you note <em>this is already possible.</em> The same thing is possible using community wifi networks. The reason it is not more popular is, again, little benefit to justify the cost and hassle (which includes the increased security risk and inherent DoS opportunities that another person mentioned).</p>

<p>That is literally what the show was talking about. </p>
<p>But none of this has anything to do with &quot;centralization&quot;. It only shows you don't know what that word means. </p>
<p>&quot;The internet is decentralized&quot; means that something like a natural disaster or enemy attack cannot disable the network as a whole. There is no single point of failure that can bring the network down. It is certainly possible to disable individual sites, or make it so that individual people cannot access the internet, but even the largest DDoS attack can't bring the entire network down.</p></div>		</li>

It's a step up from Bitcoin, but basically uses processing power as currency (Ether). I'd recommend checking it out; it's pretty interesting especially when you consider a main strength of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised this was so high up in the responses. First thing that popped into my head but I couldn't for the life of me remember what it's called. Since the parent referenced storage, specifically, I think there's another project that's concerned solely with that. They basically use spare hard drive space on various people's computer to make a decentralized storage system. Can't remember what that one's called either, though. edit: looking around a bit, I think I was thinking of <a href="https://storj.io/" target="_blank">storj</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Ok, first off, I think we can safely say we're beyond &quot;web 2.0&quot;. Now that the shiny buttons and badges are gone, it's just the net.</p>
<p>Secondly... I don't think it's that far fetched. Aren't you kind of assuming that the network won't work at all unless everyone's got the same app? Consider the situation where we each have a tiny facebook server on our devices - I could be using Facebook 2.3 to serve my profile to my friends and family and then when they click on your face, they get redirected to your server, which might be Facebook 3.1. Facebook would become the provider of social network software servers rather than the central point of communication.</p></div>		</li>
