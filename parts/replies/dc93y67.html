			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on the diagram, I would guess that the red is off set so that the Irish cross is side by side with the Scottish cross rather being perceived as being on top of it.  I would imagine that either Scotland or Ireland would be upset if their cross was placed behind the other's.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's certainly a plausible possibility. But unfortunately the original designers never left us an explanation of why they chose to create it like that (or if they did write it down somewhere, it's never been discovered).</p>
<p>So any answer is going to be educated guesswork. Keeping Scotland and Ireland &quot;equal&quot; on the flag sounds like as good a reason as any, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly why it was done. It set up so that neither the Scottish cross or Irish cross are &quot;on top&quot; of the other. Instead their widths are both halved and then share the space evenly.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It <strong>is</strong> the same if you rotate it 180°.  However if you flip it along the horizontal axis it goes from <a href="http://i.imgur.com/WNqKYeE.png" target="_blank">this</a> to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/8easku1.png" target="_blank">this</a>.  In other words the thick white diagonal band which should be above the left-hand red diagonal, gets flipped so that it's above the right-hand red diagonal.</p>
<p>Makes sense? As I said, the effect is subtle, but would be instantly noticeable to any member of the British military.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah that bit makes sense, but I don't understand how you could achieve that with a physical flag. Surely whichever way you put the flag it's correct?</p></div>		</li>
