			<div class="markdown"><p>it depends on at what point in recovery the area is. if it's still inflamed and actively damaged then, no, rest and ice is the recipe...possibly cortisone injections or something else recommended by your ortho guy. if the area has been rested for weeks or even months (depending on the injury) the damage has occurred, inflammation has set in and resolved, and fibrosis (scarring) has occurred. at this point ROM exercises and physical therapy are beneficial. sometimes therapy is the thing right away to prevent fibrosis and adhesions in a damaged and inflamed area. i don't know if bridging fibrosis occurs in muscle groups and permanently disables discrete sarcomeres or if it merely impedes them pending recovery...an orthopedics guy would know more about this than me. believe it or not, your body does not always respond in a way that ensures your optimal recovery...especially when the inflammatory cascade sets in. some of what modern medicine does is combat these physiological reactions which, evolutionarily, were designed to ensure survival, not perfect post-recovery functionality. evolution didn't anticipate what modern medicine could accomplish, where the goal is perfect functionality after recovery and <em>not</em> merely survival.</p></div>		</li>
