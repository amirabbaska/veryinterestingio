I always wondered how would they have made the first ones.
A lot of the stuff on those things are 0.01mm work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You might enjoy reading about the <a href="http://gingerybookstore.com/MetalLathe.html" target="_blank">Gingery Lathe</a>, which is designed to be bootstrapped using only fairly basic hobbyist tools and materials.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.isobevel.com/gingery_lathe1.htm" target="_blank">This link</a> has some pictures, and there are a lot of videos of construction around on youtube.</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine, we didn't suddenly construct a modern machine tool from nothing overnight. The first versions would have been crude and relatively imprecise, but each able to (with a lot of work, care and hand-fitting) produce a slightly improved version.</p>
<p>Also, hand-work with simple tools like files, scrapers and laps can produce incredibly precise results if done properly, and with suitable measuring equipment. And an awful lot of that can be done with just a good surface plate and some gauge blocks.</p></div>		</li>
