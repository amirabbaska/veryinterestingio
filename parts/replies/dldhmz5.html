			<div class="markdown"><p>I think OP is asking what's the lowest temp you could have a (visible?) flame, not what the lowest temp combustion could occur at.</p>
<p>After all you can have something that combusts or burns without giving off what people would consider a flame yes?</p>
<p>I think OP's might be a tricky question to answer, because afaik there's not really a scientific definition of what constitutes a flame.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He was and the op you responded gave a totally, idk even know. Like know it all cocky answer that's totally not what op was looking for. Then he had the whole &quot;by flames you mean fire&quot; thing. His answer is angering me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course there is. The flame is a product of combustion where atoms and molecules are excited to a higher energy state. As the atom sheds this energy, it gives off heat and photons. The photons are what you are seeing when looking at a fire. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, in most common flames (campfires, candles, forest fires) the photons are a result of soot heating up and emitting thermal radiation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't photons and heat part of the same mechanism? The photons released in the ionizing event are absorbed by the surrounding gasses increasing their kinetic energy (heat). If my line of thinking is correct, and since there are wavelengths of light that are below the visible spectrum, you could have a flame (defined as the byproduct of a combustion reaction for this) that is invisible to the naked eye. You may be able to see it with a thermal imager as black body radiation but technically you could achieve even lower energy photons. I don't have a degree in physics so I could be completely wrong and please correct any mistakes in my line of thought.</p></div>		</li>
