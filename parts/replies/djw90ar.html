			<div class="markdown"><p>That's only half right, the other dimension and the most important one is the economy. </p>
<p>In third world nations and very rural countries the birthrate will be higher because children are assests. They work on the farm or somewhere else and provide capital to the family.</p>
<p>In a first world nation children are a cost, when your child moves away from home you have <strong>spent</strong> more money than you have gained. In the third world it is the opposite.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This! Children are seen as an insurance policy, or a retirement package in addition to being children. if you have more kids, there is a greater likelihood they will be able to take care of the land/parents as they age. </p>
<p>In the first world, there is a lot less of a need for that. That's why countries that are becoming more modernized/have stronger economies have declining populations. They have other, better means for retirement or whatever, so there is much less of an economic incentive to pump out kids. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was ready to say the exact same thing! I just took an international economic development class and it showed this is exactly what happens, the worst part about it though is that poverty leads to population growth and population growth leads to poverty. It's a viscous cycle that can really explode when the government can't help its people effectively. </p>
<p>Either way well said!</p></div>		</li>

<p>which means you get married when you're old enough and have a family because this is what people do.</p>

<p>Also if you don't have kids, this means there's nobody to take care of you, buy food, and pay bills when you get into old age, unless you want to continue being a laborer at age 70.  In a country without a social security system, kids tend to be the social security for old people.</p></div>		</li>
