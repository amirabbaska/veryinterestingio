			<div class="markdown"><p>Stercobilin (from stercobilinogen) is actually the waste product excreted to make our turds brown and it is formed from half of our gut’s urobilinogen that yup was a product of the natural elimination of old red blood cells.</p>
<p>But the other half of urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the blood and then excreted (sent to the bladder) by the kidneys in the form of urobilin and is responsible for the yellow color of our urine.</p>
<p>So it’s pretty fun to think that our poop and pee are both based on the same color (brown is like dark yellow? but I’m no color pro) for that reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. So the darker the urine means that urobilinogen hasn't been diluted enough and shows you're dehydrated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah! Essentially you’re spot on but it’s a little more complex with water balance so that we don’t have to be drinking water non-stop and so we can tolerate short term periods of having no water available (imagine the herd of buffalo searching for their next spring or whatever)</p>
<p>Your kidneys basically constantly “test” the amount of solutes (dissolved stuff) in the blood when they’re filtering it and if they determine that the concentration is too high (imagine you’re dehydrated so the ratio of “stuff” dissolved vs water is high like a pound of salt in a pot is a lot higher concentration than the same amount dissolved in a pool) the kidneys signal a part of your brain (posterior pituitary gland if interested) to release more Antidiuretic hormone, ADH also known as Vasopressin, to tell the Kidneys to save more water and excrete less to the bladder so that in the short term you don’t die of water osmotic imbalances. That regulates the blood’s volume since blood is a majority just water but in the process it also regulates how much water the blood gives to/takes from your cells because it all just follows physics laws of osmosis (and its application in medicine is called the Starling Forces).</p>
<p>So if you’re still with me here’s a medical advice correlate, it’s your kidneys thinking “hey, I’ve got either too much stuff dissolved in my blood or too little water for all that stuff dissolved in there but either way I need to save some more water so that high concentration doesn’t kill me”. This is why eating a really salty (high sodium) diet can be cruel in the long term. It tells your kidneys to save more water in the blood but that dissolved salt and other stuff concentration is super high even if you aren’t dehydrated and it makes your blood volume constantly high which gives you high blood pressure (again with the physics the increased blood volume with only marginal amount we can compensate by widening our blood vessels means the blood pressure inevitably goes up) which makes our heart have to work/pump overtime hard basically our entire life. And we need that organ not to be constantly stressed or we have heart attacks and/or heart failure. Plus, high sodium diets new research suggests that indirectly can increase your chances of kidney stones and that, I almost can guarantee you, will be the worst pain of your life urinating a solid stone. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Yes, dehydration makes your urine darker because you’re dehydrated and your kidneys notice and also have to save more water while they filter the blood to keep the cells water balance regular. Also don’t eat a high salt/sodium diet or your kidneys will be tricked into saving more water when you’re not dehydrated because the high dissolved salt concentration makes them think you are dehydrated aka let’s save more water leading to high blood pressure from the excessive blood volume and if it’s all the time you’re pounding back salty stuff then you’re much more susceptible to heart attacks and heart problems because your heart is stressed 24/7 for years until you have a heart attack/failure.</p>
<p>I can’t believe I actually just wrote all that out, please don’t read it. But if you actually did just take it for a grain of salt ;)   —alright now I’m actually done, bad pun over. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure! The whole enterohepatic bilirubin circulation is not something we ever really think about day-to-day so I agree it’s not exactly long-term memorable to know the end part of it when the real focus is on the more clinically relevant beginning bile/bilirubin part anyway. </p></div>		</li>
