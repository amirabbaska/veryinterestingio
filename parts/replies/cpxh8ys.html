So would it be, in one universe the cat is dead, in another it's alive? </p></div>		</li>

<p>turning the laws of physics on and off like a lightswitch is about as undesirable as allowing for the existence of infinite universes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a pile of explanations out there but the two biggest are the Copenhagen interpretation and the Many Worlds interpretation (the multiverse one). The Copenhagen interpretation is the oldest one and the one that pissed off Albert Einstein. It states that when a quantum sort of event happens (see the double slit experiment) the particle in question exists in a superposition of two different states; an up and a down, a one and a zero, an off and an on. It's the one Schroedinger famously attacked in his eponymous cat experiment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To follow up on this if you're not familiar with the basics of quantum mechanics, the reason we see an interference pattern even if we only send a single photon through is because if a photon can take multiple paths, and we don't observe which path it takes, then it takes both paths simultaneously, and interferes with itself. If at some point we set up a device to observe which path it takes (even if we only choose to set up that observation device <em>after</em> the photon has already passed through one path or another) then the photon doesn't take both paths simultaneously, it 'collapses' into one path or the other exclusively. We've found that the path it collapses into is completely and totally random. <del>Multiverse theory</del> The Many Worlds interpretation says that the reason it seems totally random is because actually the universe splits into a number of other universes every time there's a collapse like that, and we just happen to get randomly placed into one of those universes. This makes us feel better about the whole situation, because at least it's a sensible mechanism for why we observe these random collapse decisions, rather than just shrugging our shoulders and saying that the universe picks something and we don't know why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you shot particles at a screen which mapped them then the pattern they make actually changes depending on whether you measure or not. If you don't measure then they make an interference pattern. If you do measure then you get two bars.</p>
<p>Edit: This actually works backwards in time as well. Checkout the Quantum Eraser experiment for that bit. I'm on mobile and can't get a link easily.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The interference pattern only appears when photons pass through both slits - it's what you get when you do the 'normal' double-slit experiment and send billions of photons through; they act as waves and interfere with one another as waves do.</p>
<p>Except, if you only send a single photon through, there's no other photons there for it to interfere with, so it must be interfering with <em>itself</em>. In order for the interference pattern to appear, photons have to go through both slits - if they just went through one slit, there's no interference pattern. Since the interference pattern is appearing with a single photon, it must travel through both slits simultaneously.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the single proton behaves like a wave. Which doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>Imagine a wave of water. It only exist because of the relative motion of all the water molecules creating the wave. A single water molecule will not create a wave. </p>
<p>In the same tact, what the experiment has done is shoot photons at a detector (a screen) through two slits, one at a time at small intervals, for a long period. So what you should have is a bunch of marks on the screen showing the cumulative photons striking it in two different spots. What you see on the screen instead is two waves interacting. </p>
<p>Which seems impossible seeing as the photons are being shot one at a time, they shouldn't behave like a wave. It's like shooting water molecules on a paper towel. If you push a body of water against it, you expect to see evidence of a wave. But if you're shooting single water molecules at it, you should only get a wet patch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very well explained. Could you clarify one point? You mention a photon collapsing into one path which creates a subset of universes, as such &quot;we&quot; get placed into that new subset universe. This is one of the concepts I'm trying to better understand myself. Is the &quot;we&quot; the entire material universe or is the &quot;we&quot; just the observer? If it's the entire system, why the need for a split? Wouldn't the system (or in this case the observer) just encounter one of the many random paths the photon collapsed into? If anything there wouldn't be a split but rather the photon collapsing into one path happening infinitely over an infinite number of already formed universes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Moron here.  Sorry, I wish I was educated.  I believe that the idea here is that all possible results occur but though at different probabilties.  However we function in a ridged world.  Any of the result sets that dont affect you continue on with maximum potentiality.  But the results that affect you are constrained to function within your world / domain. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes to the first, no to the second in my humorless opinion, but only because there's no good way to show that a horse in another universe is 'you' in any meaningful sense.</p>
<p>If you're really looking for a different sort of mindfuck, know that the two-slit experiment can be performed using the gravitational lensing effect of galaxies. Meaning that there are photons that are simultaneously taking lots of different paths around the outside of a galaxy, but if we point a telescope at them we can collapse their paths thousands of years after they've already passed that galaxy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What it means is there is a universe out there where the slit experiment always behaved the same way and therefore people don't know about the possibility of the miltiverse. We just happen to be in one of the multiverses where the experiment is random just like 99.99999...% of the universes existing (if the multiverse theory is wrong then just round that number up to 100%).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The above post is describing what most people would label the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. That's because the multiverse concept in cosmological physics has a different common meaning.</p>
<p>In many worlds, we assume that field collapse is navigation among many possible branches of the future. In the multiverse, we assume that in regions of spacetime far distant from us, what we consider as fundamental constants might have significantly different values. The distinction is between branching futures locally, vs alien physics remotely.</p>
<p>There are some theorists that believe the two ideas are connected if not equivalent. Here's a good writeup by Sean Carroll: <a href="http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2011/05/26/are-many-worlds-and-the-multiverse-the-same-idea/" target="_blank">http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2011/05/26/are-many-worlds-and-the-multiverse-the-same-idea/</a></p>
<p>In particular I'd emphasize that when people are talking about alternatives to the Copenhagen interpretation, they most likely mean many worlds branch locally, not the distant physics work different view.</p>
<p>For many worlds, see Everett's writing, as well as his adviser Wheeler and the various succeeding papers. I don't know multiverse stuff that well, but I know it has many very prominent proponents such as Hawking, Weinberg, and Susskind. I've found Sean Carroll to be a reliable source as a layman.</p></div>		</li>
