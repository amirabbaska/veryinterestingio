			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep paralysis resulting in the scariest fucking dreams I've ever had. Thankfully my cat always sleeps next to me. When I wake with paralysis I try to shout his name (Boba [like Fett. His backpacks got jets]). He usually then sits on my chest and knocks me out of the paralysis. I always see black witchy figures with long clawed hands standing over me during these paralysis terrors. Like a hagraven from skyrim.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend was going to order some pills that apparently help you lucid dream. One of the listed side effects was this. They called it the stranger, said there was a risk of sleep paralysis and many people reported a shadowy figure lurking around. They stated it is one of the most terrifying experiences people have experienced. Its safe to say he didn't buy them after reading that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I often have lucid dreams. And I can definitely say sleep paralysis happens at times. I also noticed sleep parlysis happens when I sleep face down. I have this feeling that someone's on top of me suffocating me. And then I feel that it's enticing me to fall completely asleep. Somehow I just know if I do succumb, I won't wake up again.
And the way I force myself awake is I start with twitching my fingers. As soon as I do that, I jump awake. But lately I notice even twitching my fingers don't help anymore. I have to force my whole arms to move.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've actually gotten sleep paralysis so much that I've gotten used to it. Whenever it happens I just focus on my breathing since it's involuntary, and I tell myself that it's just a ride and it will pass in a couple seconds. Haven't had a bad experience with it since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had sleep paralysis enough times that now I kinda like it.</p>
<p>It's still terrifying, but now it's more like a very scary movie than an actual fear for my life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know what you  mean ! After some time you come to realize it's just paralysis so you kinda go with it .</p>
<p>It becomes lucid dreaming if you drift off to sleep just slowly enough during the paralysis !</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a kid, I vividly remember having dreams in which I fought that paralysis so very hard.  In the dream, something stopped me from acting. </p>
<p>For instance, I wanted to scream, but suddenly I was eating a tuna fish sandwich and had a mouth full of it.  I tried to spit it out, but it wasn't working. </p>
<p>I ended up being a sleep walker and talker.  I don't think I do it anymore, but I sleep alone, so I don't know.  I have Sleep as Android, but I'm too lazy to listen to the audio. That and I snore, and it's annoying to listen to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, when they put me under to remove all four wisdom teeth, half way through I started deflecting the doctors hands and grabbing for stuff. I was completely out and have no memory of this. Since then if I am ever put under they give me an larger dose to put &quot;subconscious&quot; me out as well. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I woke up during hernia surgery 3 times, the one time that I remember part of (the nurse in surgery confirmed the story) I sat straight up from being out cold, eyes closed, pointed at the nurse and said &quot;I know what you're doing&quot; then slowly laid back down and went back out.</p>
<p>She told me she has seen some crazy things in the surgery room but that was the first time she wanted to walk out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Apparently when I was really little I would talk about serious stuff in my sleep. My granddad recorded me one night because I was apparently telling a soldier that his cover was not going to keep the mortars from hitting him... I was 5. </p></div>		</li>
