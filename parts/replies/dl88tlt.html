<p>I want to add that the phenomenon of impedance matching isn't limited to visible: it is important for sound waves (a megaphone bridges the gap between the acoustic impedance of your respiratory system &amp; that of the open air), lower-energy electromagnetic waves in electronics, and presumably other fields also.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For anyone who is interested, here is a great video visually showing the phenomenon. You can see how exactly the wave behaves when it encounters a medium change.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DovunOxlY1k" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/DovunOxlY1k</a></p>
<p>Go to 20:00 (20 minutes). At this moment, the man visually shows how waves get reflected due to impedance mismatchs between the two medium.</p>
<p>The entire video is great by the way too. Amazing explainations and visualizations on wave behaviour and some basic calculations regarding them. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. This guy is smart. Not just because he's talking about really complicated material, but because he's able to present it in a way that a layperson like me can immediately understand what he's explaining :O</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always have trouble really grasping impedance in an abstract manner... I feel it has deep interpretations but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>edit: for those still reading, from the video, I take that impedance is is a notion of how one system reacts/accepts energy from another one. When mismatch occur the first system capacity is too small, so some while some of it is transfered into it, part of the energy stays in the first system, a cause for waste.</p>
<p>I played music, advanced music playing is effortless.. and technically, it means having zero impedance mismatch, or near perfect energy efficiency. In drumming, it mean that your wrist is the perfect transformer. It's a partial analogy because it's not a single point coupling but involves many degrees of freedom and many junctions but anyway. When at top form, I could rotate bottles of water back and forth without causing any ripple (at low speed of course) and that was a clear test of my wrists shape and ability to perform percussions.</p>
<p>In manual shifting cars, the way you handle the actual shifting can cause back waves too, and if you drive &quot;smoothly&quot; it means you made a continuous transition between no load and load without creating a mismatch.</p>
<p>And.. if I risk full ridicule I consider solids as &quot;infinitely&quot; fast wave propagators, and weight being internal impedance mismatch. Inertia being the time the receiver system accumulate internal random kinetic energy to overcome its own mass (so all your efforts finally reached all material and stabilized into a coherent directional energy, a force)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does. Look at the equation for one mode. The complex part of the impedance gives a phase shift - it can lead, or lag. And you can add up these complex parts to have it do neither (at least, for one particular frequency).</p></div>		</li>
