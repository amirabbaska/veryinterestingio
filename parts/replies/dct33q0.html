			<div class="markdown"><p>This is also why apple juice is mixed in almost every fruit juice, often as the first ingredient. It's a filler that doesn't dilute the fructose like water would and doesn't impart any notable flavors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  It still has flavor that you can taste.  It's just not as strong as a lot of other juices, so it's better for a base than something like cranberry juice, which is incredibly tart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  I have had apple sorbet as a palete cleanser between courses, and the flavour was indeed very subtle.  Delicious, but you really had to concentrate on it, especially as cold dulls flavours.</p>
<p>I'm sure the creaminess of ice cream would soften the sharpness, dulling the flavour even more.  If you had it with anything else, even something as mild tasting as a cone, it would drown out most if not all of the flavour.</p></div>		</li>
