<p>Now let's ask outselves... I wonder if I can write 1/3 as an exponent??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That works, but it's kind of assuming the answer. The question is more &quot;what happens if we try to extend exponentiation to negative powers?&quot; rather than &quot;how can we write 1/n as n^(k)?&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, maybe makes a little more sense to do it this way: </p>
<p>What's 3^-1?</p>
<p>Well, we know 3^1 is 3, and we know that 3^a * 3^b = 3^a+b, so...</p>
<p>3^-1 * 3^2 = 3^-1+2</p>
<p>3^-1 * 3^2 = 3^1</p>
<p>3^-1 * 9 = 3</p>
<p>3^-1 = 3/9</p>
<p>3^-1 = 1/3</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno. I mean if it wasn't valid to write it as an exponent you'd get no solution</p></div>		</li>
