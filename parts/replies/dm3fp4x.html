			<div class="markdown"><p>I always jump to the defense of mosquitoes when the topic of extermination comes up, and I'm usually met with the claim that
&quot;everything that eats mosquitoes will just find something else to eat, there are other insects.&quot;  The problem here is that they give no thought to the consequences of expanding the populations of <em>those</em> species to accommodate for the loss of mosquitoes.  Like you said, each solution leads to another, larger and less predictable, consequence.</p>
<p>Perhaps if mosquitoes naturally went extinct (unlikely), then their trophic niche would be gradually overtaken by other insects like Chironomids, but on an incremental level.  All at once, every population dependent on mosquitoes for any decent portion of its food source is in peril, as Chironomid populations aren't going to explode all at once to make up for the loss.  And if they did, well, that would be another issue entirely.</p>
<p>So I think I just rephrased what you said in more layman's terms, and with fewer specific points.  I'm mainly just looking to clear up my own understanding of your very excellent comment, so as to be able to discuss this topic in the future and swat down the assertion that mosquito-eradication would have no consequences like the annoying little blood-sucking flying insect that it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I understand the idea of species removal and not being able to predict complex trophic effects in an ecosystem. </p>
<p>The two questions in response to this that I really would just like an answer for are</p>
<p>Wouldn't other insects which lay larva in water expand due to less competition and mitigate that loss?</p>
<p>Aren't most examples of species eradication on boots which are not parasitic? If they can be replaced as a food source it what other possible impacts would be that impactful especially in light of the fact you would be eliminating a vector for numerous diseases which affect humanity.</p>
<p>Also I would posit that as far as limiting other populations by causing disease isn't essential their are plenty of other factors which are what predominately control for populations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All good questions, and /u/MrPoon could probably give you more thorough responses.</p>
<p>To your first question: yes, it is likely that over time some other family of insects would eventually come to fill the mosquito's niche in the ecosystem.  Now, this would obviously have drastic unforeseen consequences, but in this scenario it doesn't matter, because you don't allow time for this to happen.  Community dynamics and niche specialization don't typically shift rapidly enough to compensate for the sudden total eradication of an important ecosystem component.</p>
<p>I painstakingly made two <a href="http://i.imgur.com/6O9cylX.png" target="_blank">very professional line graphs*</a> that show very simplistic outcomes of natural and artificial mosquito extinctions.</p>
<p>In the first, mosquito populations fall at a slow and constant rate, allowing a hypothetical alternate food source to steadily breed and disperse, which in turn keeps the secondary consumers (or whatever organisms may rely on mosquito numbers) to remain relatively stable as their food source in unaffected.</p>
<p>In the second, mosquito populations remain stable until suddenly extirpated, while the alternate population only grows in response to the open niche, likely not fast enough to compensate for the <em>immediate and sudden</em> loss of an entire population.  The affect this has on the secondary consumers is, as MrPoon pointed out, highly unpredictable.</p>
<p>Now, you don't have to take my graphs as gospel, they're rough estimates based on a decent understanding of ecological principles and ecosystem dynamics.  What you should consider is the difference between long term incremental extinctions and fast extirpations, taking place within the span of a single human lifetime.</p>
<p>The second question is sort of a values debate.  The argument that the chaos caused may be worth the human lives saved is a powerful one, but falls to pieces when used to justify mosquito eradication in countries like the US.  In nations where mosquito born illnesses are <em>serious</em> problems (as in massive Malarial infections, not isolated cases of Zika), it might be a better solution to consider.  I don't really have an answer to that one other than that there would be significant ecological impacts, something some people try to deny.</p>
<p>You may be entirely correct about disease as a limiting factor.  I haven't studied disease ecology or medical geography, so I can't speak on those subjects.</p>
<p>If any professional population or community ecologists want to comment on the viability of my graphs I'd be happy to hear it.  Remember that they are <em>very</em> rough representations of a hypothetical scenario, created for the sake of providing a visual reference in a discussion.</p>
<p>Edit: in the second graph, the alternate insect food source population could probably start rising earlier than I portrayed it.  I was going for the visual depiction of mosquito populations falling very fast due to human intervention, within two or three generations.  In this time, I wouldn't think an alternate population would begin to immediately increase, as population dynamics tend to lag in response to environmental factors.</p>
<p>Edit 2: thanks to /u/Smauler for bringing up another point.  Most of the insect families we might consider as candidates for replacing mosquitoes as a food source for insectivores aren't bloodsuckers, they're reliant on other sources of food.  In order for them to even have the opportunity to grow and replace mosquitoes, their food source needs to also increase, which seems like an independent factor.  In order for an insect genus to completely replace mosquitoes, their only option would be to use the food source mosquitoes left open: animal blood, or else they would hit their carry capacity before achieving the population levels mosquitoes had before the extirpation.  Mosquitoes occupy a very specific trophic niche, and it isn't even certain that niche could be filled again except in terms of geologic time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another issue would be species that may have a relatively steady state in their populations due to the number of deaths they experience because of mosquitoes. With that species being removed it may mean they begin to thrive more where they wouldn't have and grow too fast for their ecosystem.</p></div>		</li>
