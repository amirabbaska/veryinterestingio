			<div class="markdown"><p>yes. Outside the atmosphere it's a common occurance to see white spots from space radiation. Depending on your age and locale you will have seen it a few times yourself, too. But from natural background radiation, in other words a stray neutron or whatever running through your head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, it's the exact same thing as what the Apollo astronauts saw for the exact same reason - charged particles either producing cherenkov radiation in the vitreous humour, or ionising the vitreous humour or the retina.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><h1>3 was likely hot particles, or &quot;fuel fleas&quot;</h1>
<p>Fuel fleas are really fine fragments of fissile material, so small that the kinetic energy imparted from a fission event causes them to leap in random directions like fleas. They are a huge problem with decontaminating an area because they become less active as radiation levels drop, and can therefore &quot;hide&quot; for a random length of time and kill when a spontaneous event later causes them to &quot;jump&quot;</p>
<p>In reality they are a risk to being inhaled or swallowed, it is theoretically possible for them to pierce flesh though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Hisashi-Ouchi-kept-alive-for-83-days-against-his-will-in-unimaginable-pain-and-suffering" target="_blank">I am getting my source from here</a> which seems to be correct. There are no medical records stating that Ouchi had his foot amputated and there is no dressing on the limb to imply that it was. (Which would be required as it wouldnt heal with the damage done to his cells). Also note there is no IV visible in your image even though he was losing an insane amount of fluid each day. (20L). I think that is an image of some other guy who had massive burns across his whole body.</p></div>		</li>
