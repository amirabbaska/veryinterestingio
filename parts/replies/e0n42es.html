			<div class="markdown"><p>They don't just merge when their event horizons meet, but non of those shapes, with the possible exception of bottom right, are stable orbits meaning they would move towards each other and merge.</p>
<p>edit: kagantx is actually kind of right. The black-holes don't immediately merge like they suggested, but there are no stable orbits where event horizons can overlap. This is because at distances that close the centripetal acceleration maintaining their orbits is so great that it creates such strong gravitational waves that the black-holes lose significant amounts of energy causing their orbital radius to reduce, this means that by the time their event horizons overlap they will inevitably merge into one larger black-hole within a short period of time. As you can see in this <a href="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/app/uploads/2017/06/Simulation_binary_black-hole_coalescence_GW170104.gif" target="_blank">gif</a> as the black-holes move together the amplitude of the gravitational waves, and therefore the loss of energy increases.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Query: why is this? If one singularity were inside the others event horizon, I could see that. But if just the outer edges overlapped, the singularities themselves would still be at a greater distance. Wouldn't a stable orbit be possible there?</p></div>		</li>

This is the correct answer.</p>
<p>Quick and dirty thought experiment to confirm:</p>
<p>Gravity is measured by the &quot;center of mass&quot;.
How would you distinguish between 2 smaller black holes and 1 larger black hole via observation IF the schwarzschild radii overlap?
It's kind of (key phrase, please let's not argue technicalities) like two water droplets touching, once the surface tension is broken, you don't have 2 water droplets anymore, you have 1.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It does act like a physical barrier from the outside. Lowering a probe on a tether down towards the horizon, you will see it as a super hot membrane that incinerates anything that gets close. It's only when you free fall towards the horizon and cross it that it looks like empty space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>By the shape of the observable radius I'd imagine. Until the 2 masses merge or come close to merging you'd be able to observe the event horizon as being significantly oblong. Alternatively by observing the gravitational waves given off by the ongoing merge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question:</p>
<p>Assuming that these super massive objects somehow manage to maintain a cube shape inside the newly merged blackhole, is it possible for me to survive in the Lagrange point between these objects? Or would i still be thorn to shreds into a stream of atoms?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The black holes would coalesce completely on a timescale of ~100R/c, where R is the radius of the final event horizon. Assuming stellar mass black holes, this is around 0.1 seconds. Afterwards (if you weren't already dead), you would fall into the singularity on a timescale of R/c and be torn to pieces.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what would happens in that 0.1 second? Let's just say two black holes of equal mass and shape. If you got dropped smack bang in the center would you be spaghettified from two directions? Assuming there was anything left would that change when they coalesce?</p></div>		</li>
