			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about body language. Humans don't really become friends or enemies but they do establish an order when they meet. Who is the leader of the group when they meet. Some humans will fight to be the leader, some will put their hands up immediately with every human they meet as a sign of submission. Most humans fall between and check each other out. </p>
<p>Two humans that haven't figured their order out tend to grab each other's hands, one will stare down the other, or put their arms over the neck of the other. These are all signs of establishing dominance. They'll tend to become more and more aggressive with the signs until the one they're trying to dominate submits or has had enough and they fight. </p>
<p>My American used to be really dominant aggressive before I got him fixed. I had to learn his signs and jump in to get him to back off before a fight. He still sends dominant messages when he walks on the street but doesn't fight unless he gets hit first. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Not to derail this convo too much...but people tend to forget how much we really are just that...animals. Sure, we are &quot;special&quot; in some ways. But, in the end, we exhibit very similar behaviors. Maybe it's not rolling on our backs and urinating. But I've sure seen some dudes puff their chests out and act aggressive when meeting another group of dudes they don't know.       </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>thats really interesting because my husky can go to a dog day care and be fine with running around 20 other dogs after they meet in and greet in a transition fence area. When walking her in the street she doesnt pull (took 5 years to get that point lol) but other dogs that see her all non stop bark at her and i was told its because of the way a husky can unknowingly send dominant singnal by its high tail, high ears, light eyes, and posture.  What I do see often is her placing her head over the other dogs shoulders if they meet face to face. I find it easier to swing her body to the side and allow the other dog to come up and greet from the side vs face on. That usually lets the other dog put thier guard down to come up and sniff and see my dog isnt as threatening.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My female dog is some sort of mix but she does have husky-esque posture and bearing.  She also lacks a tail (was born naturally tailless for some unknown reason).  As a puppy, she had a few instances where other dogs -- who were usually friendly and sociable -- got aggressive with her, and now as an adult she is very aloof and wary of new dogs.  She will do OK if they are off-leash and in a neutral territory but she is not a fan of the usual doggie meet'n'greet.  </p>
<p>ETA:  I do think that some of the negative response she would get from otherwise friendly dogs were because her body language was a little off, especially since there is no tail to wag.  And she doesn't do the butt-wiggle thing that dogs with cropped tails usually do;  she seems to have no idea that she should be wagging <em>something</em>.  When she's happy and excited she does a little dance instead.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this is also the short answer about why owner is more important than breed when it comes to how aggressive the dog is. A good owner is a dominant owner, and as a result can (within reason) control their dog.</p>
<p>Good owners are underrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, so much. It baffles me when I see a dog get aggressive, then the owner pulling them away, petting them and saying &quot;It's ok little baby, mommy's here&quot;. They just don't understand that they are rewarding the behavior. So, next time the dog will exhibit that same behavior to get that same reward.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It baffles you to know that not all dog owners perfectly understand dog body language and how to correct behavior? I agree that it's something all dog owners should understand to some degree, but it's not baffling that that's not the case. I thought it was common knowledge that tons of dog owners just buy a dog and think that walks/feeding is all the care that it takes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ofc, I agree 100%. It is essential that any potential owner looks into  breeds before they choose for many reasons.</p>
<p>If you aren't a capable enough dog owner to deal with a breed that has a disposition towards aggression don't pick it.</p>
<p>Nature vs nurture, that being said I feel not looking into breed traits first to make sure they're appropriate is part of being a bad owner.</p></div>		</li>
