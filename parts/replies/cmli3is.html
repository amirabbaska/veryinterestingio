			<div class="markdown"><p>No, the mold that was sprayed would grow everywhere. I think you are implying competitive inhibition where one microorgansim out competes another effectively stopping its growth. The best organisms to use to out compete molds are lactic acid bacteria, the same bacteria used to make cheese. They produce anti mold compounds and also out compete the mold. The reason though the cheese still molds is that the lactic acid bacteria used as starter culture to make the cheese has already played out a full life cycle and is on the downward decent to death. The best way to prevent mold is to store cheese in vacuum packaging, wash your hands before you take the cheese out, and keep a clean fridge.</p></div>		</li>
