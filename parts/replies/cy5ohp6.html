			<p>I think they can eventually expire due to Hawking radiation, but the amount of time it would take is orders of magnitude greater than the apparent lifespan of the universe. That's what I remember reading from somebody who commented in a similar thread a little while ago, so it might not be accurate. </p>		</li>

			<p>Although smaller black holes theoretically would have much shorter lives. </p>		</li>

			<p>This is correct. However, black holes are one of the longest living things. I've seen some debate recently questioning if the expansion of the universe will be the deathblow to them or not. This is known as the &quot;big rip&quot; scenario where the expansion of space accelerates until it overcomes all 4 fundamental forces. The alternative scenario is known as the &quot;big chill/freeze&quot; where entropy kills the universe. Basically everything reaches an energetic minimum and remains trapped in it for the rest of time. In this scenario, hawking radiation gradually destroys black holes. Note that hawking radiation will reduce the size of black holes in either case but the question is if they will live long enough to experience the big rip (if it even occurs). </p>		</li>
