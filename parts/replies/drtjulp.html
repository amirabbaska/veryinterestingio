			<div class="markdown"><p>How likely is a mutation to express itself phenotypically? Obviously, there are the mutation-caused pathologies, which have well documented incidence rates, but I'd be interested to know the likelihood of a totally benign mutation that trivially affects the body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's incredibly unlikely and definitely shouldn't be considered at all in this already unlikely scenario. There are some polymorphisms (mutations that are pretty common in humans)(common meaning a 1% incidence rate so not that common) that are <em>possible</em> but even then it's still very unlikely. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We call it “incomplete penetrance” when otherwise dominant genes don’t always express their associated trait. That’s way more likely to cause a change in phenotype than the infinitesimal chance of a non-synonymous mutation. </p></div>		</li>
