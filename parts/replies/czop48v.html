			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, we have basically evolved to eat many different kinds of food, and that's one of the reasons we were so successful as a species. Grizzly Bears have something like 270 different food sources in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, but Wolves eat 90% Elk. If the elk disappear, then wolves will likely perish with them, but if one of the Grizzlies main food sources go (elk being one of them), then they can more easily move onto something else because they are generalists. The same is true with coyotes, they are much more versatile than wolves and can survive off of almost any type of food, and they have more or less thrived while other large predators have been killed off. </p>
<p>Some researchers suggest that the agricultural revolution was bad for us from a dietary standpoint, because it resulted in us eating the same thing over and over because we were able to produce it in mass. When we were hunter-gatherers, we naturally had a much more varied diet because the food that was available was always changing.  </p></div>		</li>

Amazing, amazing the complexity of living things' relationships to each other and the planet. Just wild (literally, ha) to think about sometimes. </p></div>		</li>
