			<div class="markdown"><p>Thats the thing though.  We don't want messy.  We want something that looks more justified and clean.  Firing squad was seen as awkward since nobody wanted to be pulling the trigger so sometimes they had to have 3 shooters two had blanks and one did not and it was random chance who got it.  They also had auto shooters.  But then there were reliability chances since the more you distance yourself the better chance that you have problems and people suffer - which is the opposite thing you want to happen</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can shoot someone with a 38 and if you hit them in the tbox at close range they'll go down instantly.  The entry would will be small but the exit wound would be larger.</p>
<p>I believe it's consider more humane because lethal injection is less messy.  There is less visible trauma on the corpse post mortem.  That and the clinical nature makes lethal injection seem cleaner and therefore more humane.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Someone has to do the dirty work - even if you create an automated system, someone sets the timer - someone moves the person into position.</p>
<p>There's no way to kill someone intentionally and not be involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's at least less of a dramatic reaction since we can hide behind walls and doors and windows to get away from the noises the convicted might make. Shooting someone is messy and incredibly involved. Having been there when many a horse was put down, lethal injection is still bad but not soul crushing beyond repair.</p>
<p>I do agree though, it's hard to escape the problem but lethal injection at least seems to keep us sane longer. I think, and God forbid if we ever become like this, this was one of the major reasons the Nazis switched to gas chambers: personally killing via shooting was making the people doing the killing into emotionless, absolutely crazy monsters, and the Nazis were trying to control their troops instead of make them into psychos that might not listen to your orders/become unstable enough to defect or do damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree. I fully acknowledge that people do things that they probably deserve to die for and certainly might need to die to stop them from some immediate lethal attack, but forcing government employees to take lives is a very dangerous road. They have to distance themselves from the act to deal with it, which is counterintuitive. People should be fully aware of the severity of that act. We've executed many innocent people because we ignore the severity and permanence of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why I don't really like the death penalty, but killing someone in self defense isn't so heinous to me. If you caught the dude and convicted him, just give him life in jail. Who knows, maybe new evidence will free him some years later.</p></div>		</li>
