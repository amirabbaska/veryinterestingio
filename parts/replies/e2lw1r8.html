That is the true maximum speed of light. In other mediums, as you mentioned, light travels at a slower speed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone posted a massive explanation of what's going on, but basically light always travels at c, and there are lots of complicated interactions happening when travelling through a medium that make the time it takes for the light to travel through that medium longer than a vacuum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is it perhaps the maximum speed of light which also happens to be the most commonly observed speed?</p>

<p>What we call <em>c</em> in physics is not the &quot;speed of light&quot;, it's the speed of <em>causality,</em> hence the symbol. It's the maximum speed, at which information can propagate through the universe. Since light (photons) doesn't have any mass (m = 0), it will not be slowed down by interactions with the Higgs field (which seems to be responsible for giving particles mass), because it doesn't interact with it at all. That means that light will always travel at <em>c</em> whenever it can. It's speed is decreased when travelling through a medium (like water, glas), because it interacts with the medium's matter (the electrons), which takes time.</p></div>		</li>
