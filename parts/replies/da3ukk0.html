			<div class="markdown"><p>The compressor is either on or off. So the load would still be the same on the engine if the fan was on low/high.  Unless there are compressors than can run at different settings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The compressor cycles on and off to maintain a specific temperature range, turning the fan down changes how often and/or how long the compressor stays on. Further, you can manually shut off the AC but leave the fan running (which is what I do). In high end cards with digital thermostats I have no idea what happens exactly as I have never owned one, :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Why? The blower takes very little energy, so the difference is going to be hard to measure at low speeds, and favoring keeping the windows closed at medium/ high speeds.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A blower motor takes typically about 300 watts at max speed. A very aerodynamic car, like a Tesla, takes 300Wh/mile, or 18000 watts continuously. </p>
<p>Add in alternator inefficiencies in your ICE vehicle, and you're talking about a 2% difference in energy requirements. Not much, but not negligible either.</p>
<p>Edit: Corrected wattage numbers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I promise you that using that blower makes basically no difference, and the car is more aerodynamic with the windows up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The blower is run off of electricity. A/C is another pulley that has to be turned by the engine, pretty much free spinning when off, but quite a bit of drag when compressor is running. Just running the blower would only be using the electricity from the alternator that would be produced anyway, but go to waste when the battery has a full charge. Basically the same idea as using the radio doesn't consume more fuel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually the more electricity you use, the more load on the alternator, although nowhere near as much as an AC compressor with its clutch engaged. You can test this by letting your engine idle and then turn on the high beams (if they are conventional bulbs), you'll hear the engine change sound a little as the additional load is added to it. This does ultimately affect fuel mileage a bit. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The abstract does not cite (perceived) temperature differences. If the windows open gives you a perception of x degrees cooling, but AC cools by x + y, then what about alternating the AC on and off, using just the blower otherwise, to average x cooling?</p>
<p>I think vlogbrothers at some point cited another study that showed this was the most efficient in overcast conditions and windows open was always better in very sunny (near-perpendicular sun) conditions (at highway speeds)</p></div>		</li>
