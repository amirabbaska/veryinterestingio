<p>The need for a new method to clean teeth is almost non-existent. Brush, floss and go to the dentist every 6 months can guarantee healthy teeth in the long run.</p>

<p>Nope. I do all of these things and still have problems, and I'm incredibly thorough. Nor do I snack or eat anything particularly sugary. However it is important to note that a lot of dental problems can be genetic, and that could always be possible in my case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should edit #1. Most adults I know with terrible teeth/dentures brushed them every day of their life and saw the dentist regularly.</p>
<p>I am extremely crazy, I decided to stop brushing my teeth or going to the dentist close to 10 years ago. When the last dentist I went to refused to honor the Groupon I had for a simple teeth cleaning procedure, insisting instead that he had to do a $3,500 debrisment before doing a cleaning, then insisting all my teeth would fall out within the next 6 months if I didn't have the procedure. Haven't really brushed my teeth (once in a while if a bit of food gets stuck) since, haven't gone to a dentist since, it's been close to 10 years and I have all my teeth, they're all healthy and  I honestly can't remember the last time I have had any kind of dental pain or sensitivity. Prior to this decision, I had tooth problems/pain on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Again, I am extremely crazy and commit myself to 5/10 year &quot;experiments&quot;, this is one of them. Don't try this at home. Also, everyone in my family winds up with dentures before they're 50, or sooner, and they all follow(Ed) standard dental hygiene, so a part of my decision was realizing I would likely loose my teeth whether I brush them/see dentists or not... However now, it's looking like I won't be losing any of them.  </p>
