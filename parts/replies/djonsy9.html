<p>Military procurement has led to industries servicing said procurement horizontally spreading their production across as many districts as humanly possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boeing and Verizon are two good examples, people think of commercial planes, and cell phones when they think of these companies. But they both have military applications that no one would know about without doing research.</p>
<p>I would add the Public Relations aspect to the reasoning as well. The Navy is heavily used to make countries like us. They lock people up on a ship saving up money, then choose countries to release the sailors into, and boost a local economy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assume what he means is that the Navy has sailors do a long stint on a ship making them deprived of human interaction and luxuries and then those same sailors are given shore passes at a port in a foreign country and spend all the money they earned over the last 6-12 months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if you put a teenager in a locked room for 9 months. Twice a month you dump a pretty decent pile of money on him.</p>
<p>After a couple months of being locked in that room, you let the teenager out with all his money and tell him to do whatever he wants for 2 or 3 days, but then he has to go back in the room for a few more months.</p>
<p>I've heard from bars owners that when a Navy ship, especially a carrier or amphib, pulls into port they can make several months worth of profits in a few days. Sailors love to drink.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When underway there isn't much to spend money on. Sure there is Amazon, but there isn't much room to store stuff. So when a ship pulls into port people go out and get food, hotels and booze. The more irresponsible ones will pay for more expensive stuff since they have a big pile of cash, and they want to ball out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. This. I think that it's also important to note that our excessive military budget/ global occupation does allow the US an interesting position in the global community. Thanks to our massive military many of our allies do not have to spend excessive amounts of money on their own defense. This allows them to, in turn, better use their own governments budget to offer social welfare programs, subsidize new industries and just generally take care of their populations. Our military acts as both a mechanism of defense and as foreign aid. This gives us quite a bit of leverage when it comes to global politics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea. To some extent. Ironically the two allies of ours that benefit from it most are our former enemies: Japan and Germany. Yet even then it's not as clear cut as one might think. These countries have to sacrifice some degree of sovereignty by allowing a foreign power military privilege in their country. Can you imagine how people with nationalists views/ tendencies would react if the federal government allowed a foreign government to have a sovereign military base on US soil? More than likely there would be some serious outrage.</p></div>		</li>
