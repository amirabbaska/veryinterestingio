			<div class="markdown"><p>的 is used for possessives, but it behaves more like the English &quot;'s&quot; than the similarly-pronounced French &quot;de&quot; because the possessed word goes after 的. It can also be used for adjectives in the structure [Adjective] 的 [Noun].</p>
<p>地 means &quot;ground&quot;. It can also be used for adverbs in the format [adverb] 地 [verb]</p>
<p>得 is often used to describe the effects of an action in the format [verb] 得 [adjective], as in &quot;Subject verbed the object until it became adjective.&quot;</p>
<p>Note: Noun-person, place, thing
Verb-action
Adjective-Describes noun
Adverb-describes adjectives and verbs</p>
<p>Edit: clarified adjective 的</p></div>		</li>
