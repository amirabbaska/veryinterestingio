			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally do not understand what this means. I don’t think I’ve ever had ”jammed fingers”. I don’t live in an English speaking country, but the entire expression ”jammed fingers” sounds strange, and your explanation doesn’t help clarify what jammed fingers are at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s just when you hit your finger(s) dead on straight. On impact it doesn’t bend forward nor backwards, it just “jams” into itself. </p></div>		</li>
