Eye drops were used to dilate the pupil and then the opthalmologist looks through the scope to see the retina.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a different test.  When they dilate the pupil, they're looking at the retina to see if it has any health problems: detachment, blind spots, etc.</p>
<p>The scope that estimates your prescription does not require dilating the pupil. It's usually the first machine they make you look into after you leave the waiting room and go into the back.  It's the one that has a little picture of a balloon or a cross or an X that whirrrs in and out of focus for a few seconds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What he is likely referring to is a retinoscope. And he is correct, we often use retinoscopes on small children, children that are too difficult to refract with the standard phoropter, or adults with mental disabilities. It requires the pupil to be dilated to get the best view and most accurate results. </p>
<p>You are talking about an automatic refractor. </p></div>		</li>
