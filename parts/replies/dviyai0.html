			<div class="markdown"><p>To explain this in a simpler fashion your body several different sources of energy.  A very short term storage is glucose (sugar, bread, starch, all carbohydrates) are a quicker source of energy. Fats (oil, butter, avocado, nuts) are a more long term source of energy. If you exercise extensively for even a short amount of time, the immediate glucose reserves will be depleted. Ultimately calorie Input/output are your main determining factor. You’re loosing “weight” immediately while working out or even doing simple tasks. It’s obviously being over simplified in my explanation but I’d be happy to explain further on any questions you may have or would like to get more in-depth with. A quick lesson on the four biomolecules would most likely be a huge help to you. Or even just the three:carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. </p></div>		</li>
