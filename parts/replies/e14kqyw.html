			<div class="markdown"><p>You could say the same thing about DNA... DNA isn't an organism, it doesn't make a conscious decision to reproduce or anything.  Yet the entirety of human existence is just an emergent outcome of DNA's attempts to propagate itself.  That is our biological purpose in life: reproducing our genes.</p>
<p>Self-replicating prions are &quot;alive&quot; in a very real sense - a life-form that is, itself, genetic material, in the same way that our genetic material does.  It is a parasite that exploits our DNA's mechanisms for reproducing, just as viruses are a parasite that exploit our cell's mechanisms for reproducing.</p>
<p>Other oddball examples of organisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bees - a colony is essentially a single organism that reproduces itself.  Workers have no ability to reproduce themselves without their queen, so they're not independently &quot;alive&quot; by a strict definition.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Memes - information/ideas that are evolved to propagate itself.  It's like DNA, but it doesn't need physical coding.  eg things like religions, social customs, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>Cities - a colonial organism similar to bees, with individual life-forms taking on specialized/differentiated roles.  <a href="https://www.jtlu.org/index.php/jtlu/article/view/29/20" target="_blank">They're even known to have pulses that correlate well with the power laws observed in biological organisms.</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Oddly, people are totally willing to humor the idea that exotic life might depend on chemosynthesis or be based on silicon, as long as it's a complex higher life-form, but reject the idea that an organism might actually be pure DNA or proteins with no higher expression.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prions are just broken parts. These parts are normally replicated, and the cells will still replicate the broken ones, but it is still the cells normal function to replicate. The prion is not hijacking or corrupting the cells, it's simply a work order that has a typo in it. While this does result in de-facto self replication it's a radically different element from a virus or bacteria or DNA in the method by which it functions and replicated and evolves and grows. I think the issue is being overly narrow in use of &quot;self-replication&quot; to refer to alive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Pretty sure youâ€™re using a definition that nobody else is using to the point of losing the entire meaning of the word.</p></div>		</li>
