			<div class="markdown"><p>OP, listen to this guy. Even better, if you have a floor drain in the basement, just take a short garden hose and run it to the drain. Most dehumidifiers have a hose hookup, it may be behind the tank or under a cover. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Seriously. Do it.  Zip tie the hose to the drain if it won’t fit down the drain cover so it can’t be kicked out of place. </p>
<p>Mine runs 24/7. I clean the air filter a few times a year  when I think of it, otherwise I forget it exists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you run a hose to the floor drain, make sure the drain is clear when you first install the hose. Then a couple of times a year, check it and clean it simultaneously by pouring a water-bleach mix down the drain. (A quarter cup of liquid bleach in a gallon of water will do. )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This guy knows whats up. My parents house have a sump pump that it drains into otherwise it fills up about twice a day.. my parents house is crazy damp. They also had a battery back up installed because losing power and draining sump pump well by hand is a nightmare. </p></div>		</li>
