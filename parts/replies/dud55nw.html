			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. The amount of that radiation needed to make food unsafe to eat would be enough to make it unrecognizable. Only contamination with actual radioactive material would make it unsafe to eat, as then the material would decay inside you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How does radiation make food unsafe to eat? My limited knowledge of radiation is that it is just high energy particles that kinda destroy pieces of your DNA as it passes through. But that's with live tissue that is actively replicating. How can radiation affect dead meat? Or even something that isn't even meat like veggies or grains? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What is dangerous is eating something contaminated with an isotope of a radioactive element. When a radioactive particle decays, it sends various kinds of radiation out into the universe.</p>
<p>If radiation strong enough to cause your food itself to become radioactive is near you, then you will have other problems beyond what you ate for lunch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Normal external radiation won't do a thing to food unless some special cases:</p>
<p>1 super high energy photon radiation: in this case, the energy of the photon is so high that it can produce antimatter and matter (usually positron and electron). Antimatter could further react with matter and results in radioactive isotopes that make the food radioactive. </p>
<p>2 Neutron radiation. Unlike photons, the reaction of neutrons with matter directly results in potential radioactive isotopes, making the food radioactive in the process.</p>
<p>Low energy X ray on the other hand, won't make the food radioactive and is much cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really doesn't.  You're confused because you're right, but a lot of imprecise language people write on the subject will make you think otherwise,</p>
<p>If you bombard something with radiation, you may do damage to it, but (ignoring a few edge cases) you will not <em>activate</em> the target.</p>
<p>Activation means turning the target itself radioactive.  To do that, you need to bombard it with neutrons, which will then either be absorbed by the atom, or split the atom, making it or its fission products radioactive.</p>
<p>Irradiating food is actually a great, and underutilized, sterilization method.  If you irradiate something like an apple, it will last for months, or even years, so long as you don't break the skin and let any new bacteria in.</p>
<p>Your intuition is right.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a good chance <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm261680.htm" target="_blank">a fair portion of the food you eat has already been intentionally irradiated for safety purposes</a> while en route to you. There's basically zero risk involved.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would the airport x-ray scanners actually irradiate food passing through and make it safer by killing any bacteria on the food?</p>
<p>Like say I had a packaged ham sandwich which was already irradiated, I eat half of it and reseal it in a ziplock bag. Since it was exposed, it's now contaminated with bacteria that would eventually cause food poisoning if untreated long enough. But my ziplocked half eaten sandwich is in my backpack which goes through an airport x-ray machine. Would the x-ray kill all the bacteria on the sandwich thereby effectively irradiating it to be safe again?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The dose in an airport luggage scanner is much lower than that used to sterilize food.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The food does not become a radiation <em>source</em> when exposed to X-ray radiation. The X-ray source is a component of the machine. Once the food has left the machine it is radiation free, as the X-rays have long since been absorbed or dispersed.</p>
<p>This isn't true for all forms of radiation. Neutrons, electrons, and alpha radiation can actually activate the material (food) they are irradiating, causing the material to become a radiation source itself. Once activated, the material can then re-radiate at a later time, say when it is in your stomach.</p></div>		</li>
