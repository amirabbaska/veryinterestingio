			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone posted below in veterinary medicine you would pack the wound with antibiotic solution or powder. Is this gone in humans too? What about say a liver or lung abscess, you wouldn't be able to pack them and doesn't leaving them open just allow the infection to spread? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the general guideline is drainage without antibiotics for most abscesses, and then antibiotics for when you can't drain due to where the abscess is, multiple abscesses are spreading, the patient is old or young or somehow less healthy than your average joe, or the infection is MRSA.</p>
<p>Antibiotics haven't been shown to help with abscesses much. at least according to <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1212788" target="_blank">a study</a> in 2014.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know about internal abscesses, but I have unfortunately had experience with a couple external ones. When I was diagnosed with diabetes I ended up in the hospital with Diabetic Ketoacidosis and two abscesses on my legs. The bacterial infections were being fed by my high blood sugars. My diabetes also made the healing slower.</p>
<p>Anyway, they incised and drained them. And then every day (for a month) I had to pack this special type of gauze inside the holes. If I remember correctly it was antimicrobial silver alginate.</p>
<p>I was also taking a lot of antibiotics, first via IV, then later pills. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My son had a lung abscess the size of a baseball when he was 7 years old.  Since it was in his lung, they didn't want to break it due to the risk of the infection becoming systemic.  The doctors threw every possible antibiotic at it in as high a dose as my son could tolerate.  He wasn't coughing anything up, so there was no way for the doctors to determine what particular microbe was causing the abscess.  After three weeks of being sick, they decided to do a bronchoscopy to look at the abscess and while doing that it ruptured.  Once it ruptured he started doing better and a few days later got to come home. He spent another 6 weeks on antibiotics.   Now he has asthma, but is otherwise fine.  Oh, ct imaging shows he still has the wall, or shell, of his abscess.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Just had a MRSA abcess...the main treatment was frequent needle aspiration then lots of oral antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking why they're drained, it's because there's no injection into the infection itself. You stay outside the infected tissue and just suck out the dead cells and waste (pus) that's outside the infected tissue. You're cleaning around the infection essentially</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. Abscesses are lanced all the time. It's fine to pierce abscesses under controlled conditions.</p>
<p>Abscesses are walled-off collections of pus and bacteria. Because of its large volume compared to surface area the immune system is not very effective - there are no blood vessels to bring white blood cells (germ fighters) into the middle.</p>
<p>The abscesses therefore breed bacteria which can and do escape into the blood, or secrete toxins that end up in the blood. This causes the systemic symptoms of abscesses, fevers etc.</p>
<p>(A clue for a hidden abscess is if a fever keeps going away during treatment with antibiotics but comes back with antibiotics. The antibiotics are killing the bacteria in the blood but can't reach the abscess in any decent concentration.)</p>
<p>Therefore the best treatment of abscesses is incision and drainage. Cut into it to drain out the bulk of the germ-ridden pus. Often the doctor will rinse out the hole with disinfectant (not antibiotic) to help kill most of the rest. Tablet or injection antibiotics will kill off any bacteria that escape into the blood because of the cutting.</p>
<p>Then you need to keep the hole open so it dries up and doesn't come back. You want it to heal from the bottom of the hole, not over the top leaving a big space to fill back up with pus. Special packing will do this, or you can stitch it open (marsupialisation, because you make a pouch).</p>
<p>In summary - if you're sticking a needle into an abscess you're better off draining it totally then injecting antibiotics.</p></div>		</li>
