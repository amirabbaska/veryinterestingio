			<div class="markdown"><p>The papers don't publish the addresses for humiliation, they do it to avoid defamation cases.</p>
<p>Let's say John Smith is arrested for murdering some babies, if the papers just reported 'John Smith' then you could have a thousand John Smith's sue them for defamation of character because they didn't make it absolutely clear which John Smith was arrested.</p>
<p>It's annoying, and embarrassing for those involved, but it's genuinely the safer way of doing it within the current framework of laws that we in the media have to work with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting sidebar, related:</p>
<p>In the USA, in 2005, I was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving. Blood alcohol tests in that place (Fayetteville, NC) were only conducted at the courthouse/jail in that county. I was transported there, and tested. When the test result showed 0.03% (0.08% was the limit), the Magistrate there dismissed the charge and I was released immediately. No fingerprints or mugshots or anything. </p>
<p>A couple weeks later, I started receiving correspondence from numerous local law firms advertising their services representing defendants in DUI/DWI cases. The suspicion of DUI thing lasted all of an hour or so, and I was not actually <em>charged</em> with any wrongdoing in that regard (I was cited for following too closely, to which I plead guilty and paid a fine two days later). Lawyers across Cumberland County, NC, nonetheless became convinced that I might need legal representation in a DUI/DWI case, in defense against a charge that never formally existed. </p>
<p>Less-related:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>By the time I was receiving these offers from law firms, I had moved to Texas. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Embarrassingly, this correspondence came through the military, meaning my commander and first sergeant had some uncomfortable questions for me; it could be argued that this had some small but significant negative impact on my military career. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was stalked by the arresting officer the following day. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was told by the administrative employees there at the Cumberland County courthouse, that it was the first time in his three years on the force that this particular cop had brought in a DUI arrest who didn’t stay the night and wasn’t charged; also, they said that was as angry as anyone had ever seen him when he left after uncuffing me. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He had a ride-along in the car with him when he arrested me. </p>
</li>
<li>The unmarked car in the parking lot of the bar I left immediately before the pullover and arrest, had run my car’s license plate at least twice that night; by the time I was cuffed and in the back of the car, I could see clearly that my car’s plate had been run five times in the last couple hours. </li>
</ul>
<p>And so on. Not an uncommon story for military personnel in the USA. We find ourselves profiled and targeted by local law enforcement. Communities like to blame their problems on us, much like some college towns blame theirs on large student populations. Actually, I doubt the word “community” is appropriate in these places, where populations can scapegoat others for their existing social problems...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do you think he was pissed at having a suspect &quot;get away&quot;, pissed at looking stupid for arresting a .03 person, or did he have an agenda (anti-your-race, anti-military, etc)?  Seems a bit obsessive.</p></div>		</li>
