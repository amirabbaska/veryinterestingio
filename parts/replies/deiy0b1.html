<p>Fast liquid particles escape the liquid's surface and gas particles hitting the surface join the liquid again until an equilibrium is reached when the gas pressure reaches the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure" target="_blank">vapor pressure</a> of the substance at that temperature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is mercury in many fluorescent lights (which also happen to be what the majority of &quot;neon&quot; signs truly are, high-powered florescent lights). Inert gases and a drop of mercury are added to an evacuated tube\bulb and then sealed close. The mercury is boiled from outside the glass by induction heating, this coats the inside with mercury vapor. When inert gas inside the tube is ionized, the mercury vapor is also excited and releases short-wave ultraviolet light, which does its magic on the phosphors covering the inside of the tube\bulb - Florescence.</p>
<p>Neon gas discharge tubes are mercury-free and create their light purely by ionization, not florescence. Neon and small amounts of argon alone creates shades of orange\red</p></div>		</li>

The drop would produce a small amount of vapor that helps strike the bulb. If your fluorescent tube has green ends it is probably mercury free.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Source? At least according to wikipedia a fluorescent lamp <em>&quot;is a low pressure mercury-vapor gas-discharge lamp&quot;</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tungsten has an extremely high melting point (3420 °C or 6190 °F) and an extremely high boiling point (5560 °C or 10,000 °F). It is often chosen for hot environments.</p>
<p>The orange glow you can see is its black body radiation. Anything heated to above ~600 °C (~ 1000 °F) will begin to glow with a dull red; above about 1000 °C (~ 1800 °F) it will take on a bright orange colour. This is called incandescence. Below 600 °C objects still glow but it's infrared heat rather than visible heat. </p></div>		</li>
