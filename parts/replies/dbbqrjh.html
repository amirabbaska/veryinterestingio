			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll take a swing at it. The prostate creates seminal fluid. Semen is created in the testes. Androgens, like testosterone, interact with the prostate to create seminal fluid, which is used as a vessel to carry the semen toward the egg, or in other words, the sperm can swim through that easier than just the vagina alone. A vagina doesn't have an agreeable pH for the sperm to swim through without the addition of seminal fluid. It makes it more &quot;hospitable&quot; for the sperm.</p>
<p>I haven't used my biology degree in years, so this explanation may not be spot-on. This is all I can remember, but I'm sure I'm leaving something out. </p>
<p>Edit: ah! I remember what I left out. Seminal fluid also works to clean the urethra before ejaculation, since the sperm could be killed by the leftover urine. The term people use for this is pre-ejaculate, or pre-cum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here you go;. Androgens are a class of hormones that cause masculinity(testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, ect). The presence of these androgens causes both the prostate and the seminal vesicles to produce fluids which help carry the sperm to the egg within the girl. Now the actual SPERM is produced in what's called the &quot;seminepharous tubules&quot; and it travels through this pathway within your balls (SNT-&gt; vas deferins-&gt; prostate-&gt; seminal Ves-&gt; urethra) to be mixed with prostatic fluid from the prostate and SV fluid from the SV and then ejaculated. As we get older testosterone and other androgen levels decrease and sperm production also diminishes. </p>
<p>TLDR: For a normal healthy male in prime reproductive years the most probable factors influencing the quantity of your loads are; hydration, prior sexual stimulation and androgen quantity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>time since last ejaculation</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is the one that makes the most difference for me. longer times in between mean more semen coming out.</p>
<p>and when it feels really really good (like with someone who i'm comfortable with and knows what I like) then it comes out with lots of power.</p></div>		</li>
