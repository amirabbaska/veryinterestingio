<p>But weren't the dinosaurs we're talking about much bigger than an elephant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to think in terms of orders of magnitude.  Elephants are the largest land animals, and we are approximately 1/10th the size.  The largest dinosaurs were less than 10x the size of an elephant.  In logarithmic terms, elephants and dinosaurs are close to the same size, and that size is close to the upper limit for animals evolved using the shared DNA basis of Earth life in Earth conditions.  Like elephants, the largest dinosaurs would have to make a lot of lifestyle compromises for their large size.  They would not be able to jump or move quickly due to the relative fragility of their skeletons.  Huge size means long distances for nerve signals to move, which would limit their ability to sense and control their extremities (imagine a latency of 1 second on sending a signal from the brain to a limb, or a pain signal from a limb to the brain).  The big dinosaurs would have been limited to slow moving grazing lifestyles, while the large predators like T Rex would probably be a lot less exciting to watch than the movie versions, they would have to rely on size instead of ferocity in order to hunt, and their lifestyle would only be possible because their prey were equally large and unwieldy.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>Were they not cold blooded though?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a simple binary, and even within &quot;warm-blooded&quot; animals there's a lot of variation in metabolic rate. The common definition of warm-blooded is that an animal expends energy to maintain a constant temperature; if you're losing heat slower than that takes less energy to do. Some dinosaurs may have been so large they could have maintained their body temperature with basically no effort. For smaller dinosaurs, one possibility is they may have had a sort of intermediate metabolism, expending energy to keep warm while active but then letting their body temperature fall while resting.</p></div>		</li>
