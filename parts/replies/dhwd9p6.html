			<div class="markdown"><p>It can vary from state to state , in my state we don't have to show registration. It is license and proof of insurance, if you don't have them you will get a ticket, you have by the court date to show that you did actually have that stuff and in my experience the tickets are dropped</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Australia, they can check your registration status from your licence plate, and the system ensures you have compulsory third party insurance when you register it each year. You can't register it if you don't have it. So we just have to present our licence if requested.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the same in at least the states I have lived in as well. The DMV keeps a record of your insurance attached to your registration. I also believe if you get ticketed for not having either you can just go into the courthouse and show them proof and they drop the ticket. Had a friend who did that once when she got pulled over for expired registration and no ID. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine the registration isn't to see if the car is registered, but to make sure the car is registered <em>under you.</em> I'm pretty sure they already know that though after running your plates so it's still weird to ask.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We do not need to carry absolutely anything when driving, no proof of registration, insurance, tax, ID, whatever, never had. However the police can check all details just with the licence plate whether the car has some sort of insurance cover, although this doesn't show whether the driver is insured to drive the car (here, we insure the driver, not the car). The public too, can look up the taxation, insurance and MoT status of any car online, although details are limited. </p>
<p>If the police need to see some documents, they do what's called a &quot;producer&quot; where you are required to go to a police station with the requested documents. Have had a couple of this in the past, no more than 2 minutes in the station.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I keep my drivers license in my wallet but I can't recall ever having to need it. It is my only photo &amp; address ID though, so I like to have it on me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In Estonia, you aren't required to carry your driver's license at all; all the necessary data is accessible from centralized records via the chip on your national ID card or, failing that, your personal identification code. Same with like all other records, so I'm assuming registration/insurance/whatever is the same as well.</p>
<p>This country continues to aggressively go paperless as they realize how much paper-based bureaucracy is a waste of both your time and theirs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have a social security number that is routinely used as a national ID (because modern society can't work without one).</p>
<p>So in practice you don't get any of the advantages of not really having an ID, and all the drawbacks from having a very bad one (no picture and a number that can't be changed which makes identity theft very easy).</p>
<p>I think you should just be doing what every other country in the world does. The only downside would be having to give up the illusion of not having a national ID.</p>
<p>EDIT: also identity theft is not a thing outside the US. When I first encountered the term I was so confused and thought it meant someone literally stealing the life of someone who went abroad or died, disguising their own appearance to make them look like the victim, living in the victim's house, and pretending to be the victim when interacting with friends/family.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, most of the time the Officer will simply let you go wit ha warning if you truly were not doing anything.  Anything else results in a minor ticket which will be dismissed when you show up to court with it.  Now if you simply do not have a license you get in trouble.</p>
