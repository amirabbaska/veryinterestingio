			<div class="markdown"><p>Bidet:</p>
<p>you can use without using paper first or using paper first, i think that depend of toilet paper availability in the country, in my country no problem.</p>
<p>I use more currently since my hemorrhoid, paper irritate and not clean good enough. its a 'must use' for me, when i can't use  a bidet i try take a shower 'after' because isn't comfortable or clean enough for me and this problem.</p>
<p>Not clean with water mean for me have a very bad day and increase the problem. Use it mean have a nice day and forget the problem and feel clean.</p>
<p>Water must be tempered. (ideally)</p>
<p>You must sit down back to the faucet, except if you plan clean your 'front', if you visit a minimally decent brothel in spain its common the girl invited you to clean your private parts in a bidet before the act, you can use it after the act too for clean. Anyway if you sit down front i think you can clean you ass too :P</p>
<p>You can move the tip of the faucet to point up to your ass hole or near and use the hand.</p>
<p>I use paper first for the gross, not much because irritate, and then finish clean in the bidet.</p>
<p>Tempered water must eliminate easy the gross if you not use paper first.</p>
<p>After that( using paper or without using it) its convenient use the hand with water and soap, and rinse</p>
<p>Finally dry with a  towel (generally in hotels and house with bidet have very small towels for that)</p>
<p>Then have a clean and happy day. :P</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I rented a house in the UK that had a separate bidet, it was really weird, I hadn't ever seen one before.  The bathroom had pepto-bismol pink carpet (who puts carpet in a bathroom?), and all of the fixtures were a similar shade of offputtingly bright pink.  I think I used it like three times in the year I lived there because I personally wasn't a fan of having water jetted up my ass (it had one pressure setting: water sodomy).  Maybe I was doing it wrong. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>American here, and it has always grossed me out that we clean up after pooping by wiping with dry paper. I mean, think about it, if you got poop anywhere else on your body would it be sufficiently clean after a few wipes with a dry paper towel? Why should our butt holes be any different?</p>
<p>I bought an integrated one a few months ago, and installed it myself with very little fuss. It hides behind a little cover (that is far back enough so that its essentially under the rim of the seat in such a way that I've never even gotten the cover dirty) and when you turn it on the water pressure is enough to extend the nozzle past the cover and spray the approximate location of your sphincter.</p>
<p>It's a small, hard stream of water in which the pressure (which is adjustable) alone is enough to remove pretty much all detectable fecal matter without having to do anything involving my hands. The most I have to do is wiggle around a little to make sure the water is hitting all the spots that are potentially dirty. When I shut off the water, the nozzle retracts automatically, and at most it only takes a couple wipes before there is nothing detectable on the paper, though it's usually just one to dry myself off.</p>
<p>Before getting a bidet, I would have to use an ungodly amount of paper before I was sure that I was clean. It would take a long time, occasionally I would even bleed a little from wiping so much, and I wasted a bunch of water flushing every couple wipes to make sure I didn't clog the toilet. Having the bidet is faster, cleaner, more comfortable, and less wasteful. I would never not have one in my home in the future, it was probably the best $35 I've ever spent.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I've never liked this argument. Where else on your body do you cover with at least two layers of clothes and never use for any public interactions? We do that because it has a potential to be unsanitary by its very nature.</p>
<p>While it's possible that you'd still feel dirty if you didn't clean very thoroughly, I think the problem has been sufficiently buried. </p>
<p>Edit: Everything else, though, agreed!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I dunno, sometimes after wiping till I was sure I was clean, I would still get some serious swamp-ass a couple hours later. Being in a sexual relationship means your ass isn't 100% private, and I just like knowing rather than hoping that my ass is actually clean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh man I might need to get a bidet when I have my own house. I always keep those wet wipes on top of the toilet because I also think that wiping with just paper doesn't cut it  (unless you have one of those magical poops where it just doesn't leave anything on you).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Side note: if you have septic do not use those wet wipes. I know they say &quot;flushable &quot; but that doesn't mean they break down like TP. I recently had my septic pumped and it was a shit show  (pun intended) because of those things.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used those for a while, but I hated having a trashcan full of turd wipes in my bathroom. Even if those things were actually flushable, a bidet would be preferable IMO.</p></div>		</li>
