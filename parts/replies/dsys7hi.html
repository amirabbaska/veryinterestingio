			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi, this is a really weird coincidence but I actually conducted research into what you've just said for my master's dissertation. The activation of the amygdala overriding pain is a theory and was the main theory but had never actually been tested. I tested it and found it probably wasn't the case. I hypothesised that it was more likely to simply be distraction from the pain. Hope this helps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife has a PhD in psychology for a paper that has made its way to the front page of Reddit, and she fucking hates the paper and doesn't really agree with its conclusion. Her adviser &quot;massaged&quot; the data by excluding participants to reach the conclusion he wanted to reach. </p>
<p>She's no longer in psych, because of her shitty experience with her adviser and the &quot;publish or perish&quot; mentality of academia. She detests the kind of pop-psych that makes headlines because it is almost always based on poor methodology and almost never is able to be replicated. </p>
<p>She tried to get into psychology that used hard science metrics (MRI, CT scans, measurements of cortisol levels, etc.) but was not able to get funding.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's moaning or groaning with the men in my family. My dad, his brothers and my granddad always moaned real low and quietly when they were hurting. As a kid I asked my dad about it and he said he remembers asking my grandad the same question. Grandad jokingly told dad he believes he would die if he couldn't moan when in pain. I thought it was funny. </p>
<p>As I got older I forgot about it. Then one day I was helping my 8 year old son build a &quot;fort&quot; and gouged a hole in my palm, still have the scar. It was hurting, a lot. But being a dad I was determined to man up around the boy. A few minutes later my son said, &quot;Dad, why do you make that sound every time you get hurt.&quot; I didn't realize I was making a sound so I asked him, what sound? He imitated me best he could with his kid voice and I realized immediately what he was hearing, I too was moaning. I told him when I was hurting &quot;I believe I would die if I didn't make that sound.&quot;  He's 45 now and I have heard him do it too. His oldest son is 22, I expect to hear him do it anytime now. </p>
<p>I have thought about it a lot over the years and all that I can figure is it takes your focus off the pain. My mother is Native American and as a kid I spent many summers on the rez with my grandparents. The traditionals (old ways) people each have their own personal Healing Song. When they're hurting or sick they sing their Healing Song over and over. I think it's similar to why we groan, curse, yell or moan. It distracts us from the pain. </p></div>		</li>
