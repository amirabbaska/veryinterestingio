			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to hijack your comment to add: When you get sick your body is fighting off infection, and this process produces inflammation. Inflammation has a lot of different purposes, such as telling your body's immune cells to come in and eat the bacteria, or increasing your temperature to cause a fever (fever makes the environment more hostile to bacterial growth, so you get better sooner). Inflammation makes a more hostile environment to the bacteria, but it also makes you feel like crap, because those chemicals also have an effect on your cells/tissue/vasculature too, such as swelling and pain. </p>
<p>The inflammatory process is done by chemical signalling, and during the night these &quot;chemicals&quot; build up in the local tissues where the infection is. These tissues are drained by the lymphatics, which are a series of vessels kind of like your blood vessels, but instead their job is to drain watery fluid in between your cells that has leaked out. The lymph system doesn't have a heart to pump it, so instead it relies on the motion of your muscles together with one way valves to pump the lymph out of the area, and it eventually drains that watery fluid back into the blood system in your chest. </p>
<p>So at night, you're not moving around and that watery fluid around your cells just sits there collecting more and more inflammatory &quot;chemicals&quot;, which do help with the infection but also make you feel crappy. Once you get moving, these inflammatory molecules get pumped out of the area and more diluted/inactivated, which helps to reduce a little of the local inflammation. So thats one of the reasons you sometimes feel better after moving about during the day versus first thing in the morning with a cold. </p>
<p>Obviously the process is a lot more complicated than that, hopefully it makes sense. Source: med student.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a professional sick person, yes indeed I recommend it 9/10. Some times you need to stay in bed, but usually you should get up, drink a full glass of water, and take a shower or something simple where you can stretch the muscles in different ways (I like to take my dog outside for a quick potty break and stretch while she's doing her thing). Then you can make coffee/tea like an hour after you've gotten up. If you get up, drink water, and get going, cortisol production will keep you going until you need to boost with caffeine after an hour or two.  Even if you go back to resting after getting up for a couple hours, you'll be glad you got up and moved around. If your eyes are overwhelmingly heavy to the point you can't keep them open, then you need to sleep though.</p>
<p>Source: have lupus, and thus my body is excellent at making too much inflammation </p></div>		</li>

<p>You need rest, but you need to move. Rig up some ropes and pullys that will flail your appendages automatically while you rest. Some kinda of Ferris Buelers Day Off / Weekend At Bernies / Wile E Coyote shit dawg.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do the same thing. A recliner is a good place to sleep sitting mostly upright. More like \<em> than |</em> so it isn’t as hard on the neck. Slightly more comfortable than an airplane, but I still don’t sleep as well. That leads to me waking up more to use tissues, which is also helpful.</p>
<p>When I don’t have a recliner I build a similar shaped incline from pillows, blankets, and couch cushions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the nurse, but I do this too. I have a couch that has reclining seats...so it's more like they took two recliners and attached them together to make a couch. You could also use a single recliner or any kind of sloped back padded chair with a footrest.</p>
<p>It has a few settings like fully upright, halfway reclined, and fully reclined. I tilt it back enough to get the footrest up and the headrest a bit diagonal, and then sleep like that. Sometimes I turn to the side in the chair, bend my knees onto the cushion, and prop a pillow up under my chin so I don't drop my head down while I sleep upright. Seems to work pretty well! I slept comfortably for the duration of my miserable 3-week cold last year.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the nurse but I have one of those big wedge shaped pillows that I use for this purpose. It's like laying in a recliner that isn't quite all the way back but it's enough to keep your sinuses draining. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I just stack any pillows any way I can to sleep at about a 45 degree angle. I don't get the best nights sleep because Im a side sleeper and its not comfortable to lay on your side at that angle. But a few nights of mediocre sleep is better than a week or more of a chest cold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are a parent of small children, this can be really helpful. Get a set of bed risers from Wal-Mart. They are black and are meant to raise your bed up about 5 inches so that you can store more things under your bed. Put two of them under the legs of your child's headboard on a crib, toddler bed or regular bed. My 5yo has asthma and allergies and is prone to upper respiratory infection. These helped out immensely! In the worst cases we would sleep with our little boy on our chest in a recliner. </p>
<p>These may also be effective enough for an adult. I've heard raising the head of your bed recommended for heartburn and preeclampsia as well. They are relatively cheap - about $10 a set - and are sturdy. I've even seen them at Wal-Mart with an electrical outlet in one of them during back to school time - obviously you would have to plug it in. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, maybe someone down there said it, but if you're in any kind of pain like sore throat or achiness, when you first wake up, you're not desensitized to it and it takes a while for your body to adapt to it-specifically &quot;adaptation&quot; referring to when your body partially blocks out a sensory stimulus that's been going on for a while, like a sore throats </p></div>		</li>
