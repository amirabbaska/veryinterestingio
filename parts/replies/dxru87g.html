<p>Hahaha.  Oh the flashbacks.  </p>
<p>Related note, practicing squad rushes are actually a pretty good workout.  </p>
<p>Go to one end of a field and &quot;I'm up the see me I'm down&quot; until you get to the other end.  Its like sprints and burpees had a baby, and that baby grew up to be a total dick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was Ordnance but had I had every tactical vehicle license because I was a pro skater so I spent more time in trucks than my actual job. So nearly everyday I was at the pumps. And I got covered in JP8 in two spills, an overflow, a “negligent discharge” of a fuel handle and explosive decompression of a fuel line </p></div>		</li>
