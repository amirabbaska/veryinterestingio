			<div class="markdown"><p>The University of Washington and Seattle University are part of a crow study where they had a man with a mask hold a dead crow and walk around campus with it. They will put the mask away and then walk around in the mask intermittently and the crows will send alert calls to each other as a warning. It's been years now, but I guess the adults have even taught the younger crows about the mask because even the young crows recognize the masked man when they walk around campus.</p>
<p>*I took an animal behaviour class at Seattle U and one of the research assistants spoke to us about it. My details may be a bit off because this was years ago, but it wouldn't be difficult to find the research if you're interested I'm sure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Corvids in general are VERY intelligent birds. They don't just recognize people with guns, they recognize faces of individuals, oftentimes for years. They're capable of complex problem solving as well.</p>
<p>I dislike most birds in general, but I like Crows and Ravens a lot, because of their intelligence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Crows have distinct calls depending on what kind of danger there is.  They have a different call for dogs, people, cars, etc.  They can also remember the faces of people who they consider a threat.  They're incredibly smart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can also can connect correlations in the behaviors of other creatures. For example, many crows learn that it is safe to enter certain areas of an intersection while the light is red and will fly away as soon as it turns green.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only can crows recognize that people with guns cause them harm, experiments were done with masks and crows can actually recognize human faces that have caused them harm or grief. I learned about this experiment in my wildlife biology courses in college, but don’t remember where the study was performed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a fascinating experiment; the guy drove to different campuses wearing the mask to judge how quickly the news would spread. At one, he wore the mask upside-down which confused the crows until one twigged &quot;by doing a barrel-roll&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know if it was Koko, but another primate lost her baby.  That primates caretaker also lost her baby (miscarriage?).  When the caretaker shared that with the primate, the primate offered some sort of condolences.  Would love to see the story again if anyone can find it.  It was moving. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the chimpanzee Washoe.  When a pregnant volunteer suffered a miscarriage, she was absent from work for several weeks and Washoe was angry with her for disappearing.  When the volunteer apologised to her and signed to her &quot;My baby died&quot;, Washoe replied &quot;cry&quot; and &quot;please person hug&quot;.</p>
<p>Washoe herself had lost two infants by that point, and seemed to understand when her caretaker explained that the most recent infant, Sequoyah, had died (&quot;BABY DEAD, BABY GONE, BABY FINISHED&quot;), and became deeply depressed.  Afraid for her mental state, the institute found an orphaned male infant, Loulis, and decided to see if Washoe would adopt him.  Her caretaker signed to her, &quot;I have baby for you&quot;.</p>
<p>Washoe became extremely excited, repeatedly signing &quot;Baby baby baby&quot; while hooting and rushing around on two legs.  When she was presented with Loulis, however, she visibly deflated.  The caretaker believes Washoe thought she was getting Sequoyah back.</p>
<p>So, if we accept this series of events at face value, it seems Washoe had an idea of death, that she understood the various dead babies were gone and this made her sad.  However, if we accept the caretaker's interpretation of the latter events, Washoe had no difficulty believing that Sequoyah was coming back to her, despite having been told that he was dead.  Of course, she was never allowed to see the body, and Sequoyah was not with her when he died; might that have helped?  We can't really know.</p>
<p>(Side note: Washoe did come to accept and raise Loulis, even teaching him to sign herself.)</p>
<p>EDIT:  Most of these stories can be found of the <a href="http://www.friendsofwashoe.org" target="_blank">Friends of Washoe</a> website.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who really knows? Could be that she understood the concept of her baby's death, but also saw it as a reasonable conclusion that the humans could bring it back? Really makes me wonder what kind of abilities animals could attribute to us.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Woah, woah. Hold on. Washoe <em>taught</em> her foster child, Loulis, how to use sign language??? That's blowing my mind. Not only can we teach a chimpanzee how to communicate with us in one of our very own languages, but that chimpanzee is capable of then teaching that to other chimpanzees out of its own volition?! I'd love to know how that works on their level - learning that physical signs relate to <del>words</del> things and concepts, understanding that, and showing that to another animal. Am I the only one who thinks this is crazy? </p>
<p>Edit: corrected myself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Straight from Wikipedia, nice short read. </p>
<p>Koko is one of the few non-humans known to keep a pet.[citation needed] Researchers at The Gorilla Foundation said that Koko asked for a cat for Christmas in 1983. Ron Cohn, a biologist with the foundation, explained to the Los Angeles Times that when she was given a lifelike stuffed animal, she was less than satisfied. She did not play with it and continued to sign &quot;sad.&quot; So on her birthday in July 1984, she was able to choose a kitten from a litter of abandoned kittens. Koko selected a gray male Manx and named him &quot;All Ball&quot;. Penny Patterson, who had custody of Koko and who had organized The Gorilla Foundation, wrote that Koko cared for the kitten as if it were a baby gorilla. Researchers said that she tried to nurse All Ball and was very gentle and loving. They believed that Koko's nurturing of the kitten and the skills she gained through playing with dolls would be helpful in Koko's learning how to nurture an offspring.[32][33]</p>
<p>In December of that same year, All Ball escaped from Koko's cage and was hit and killed by a car. Later, Patterson said that when she signed to Koko that All Ball had been killed, Koko signed &quot;Bad, sad, bad&quot; and &quot;Frown, cry, frown, sad&quot;. Patterson also reported later hearing Koko making a sound similar to human weeping.[33]</p></div>		</li>
