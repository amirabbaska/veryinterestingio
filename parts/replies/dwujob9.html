<p>I mean..... add Russia in there, and just say &quot;other countries with substantial resources are the 5 that make up 35% of the worlds total landmass.&quot;</p>
<p>Most countries the size of Europe will have large deposits of most minerals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Still, if price goes up there are other countries with even larger resources </p>

<p>Russia has large deposits of pegmatites, but they aren't cost-effective to mine at this time. I was pointing out that Canada/US/Australia/China/Russia are usually included in most lists of &quot;they have large deposits of X&quot;, which means a lot less since they are such huge countries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk about salt flats, but there's plenty of dry land in the Russian Steppe, and the caucus region gets plenty warm, like in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sochi#Climate" target="_blank">Sochi</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they are probably talking about reserves (things that are currently mineable for a profit) and not about resources (things that we know might be mineable in the future). Chile has the highest reserves. Argentinia has the highest resources. Bolivia is no.2 for resources although not far behind Argentinia.</p></div>		</li>
