			<div class="markdown"><p>So does gravity CREATE new space? Thinking of a trampoline, if 1 has a heavy object in the middle and 1 does not, thee heavier one created extra distance from the threading of the trampoline. But in space, where does the extra space come from? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not making more space, as far as I know. It's warping/stretching space-time, so that crossing the same distance takes longer. Even though the model makes it appear as if the &quot;surface area&quot; of the space-time fabric is increasing, it's more of a handy visual guide for the effects of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looking at this animation, does it mean that it is possible to time travel but only forwards?</p>
<p>Edit: Also, if the gravity was so strong where time only went straight down does that mean time has stopped completely? Or will there be some voodoo where we are all immortal?</p>
<p>Edit2: Is it also, possible to travel around the curve where time goes backwards and thus you can time travel backwards?</p>
<p>Edit3: Since there is no up, down, left or right in space, how would time react if it was going &quot;downwards&quot; directly in center of the hole in the animation? I giess this kind of goes back on my first question. </p>
<p>Also, I appoligize for so many edits. I keep having questions pop up.</p>
<p>Edit4: Is it possible for two timelines to cross or crach into each other? If so, what would happen?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, given that motion is a form of time travel, &quot;forward time travel&quot; is possible at relativistic speeds.</p>
<p>Your first edit question is basically describing a black hole. As far as I know, we aren't sure what exactly happens past the event horizon (where a beam of light is sucked in and can't escape), but there are some neat things on the event horizon, like where light &quot;orbits&quot; the black hole, albeit shortly.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean - this model represents a 2-D universe; to understand what this would look like in a 3-D universe, you need to &quot;warp&quot; 3-D space, which is usually achieved by thinking of a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AGeneral_relativity_time_and_space_distortion.ogv" target="_blank">bent wireframe</a>.</p>
<p>Not sure what the last question is asking, multiple particles of light intersecting? That may get into the particle/wave duality of photons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My second to last question came up after I read that our time moves in one direction in motion in space kind of like how you said. So I was curious whether it was possible to travel in a different direction bending time. If so, how would this affect your body if you were to go backwards?</p>
<p>On the last question I guess I had a brain fart and somehow associated multiple time lines with multiple universes crossing or crashing with each other.</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Like mentioned that where black holes come to play. If you were to sit on the event horizon, where gravity is so strong that nothing escape, time would come to a crawl. <strong>If</strong> you could then look out past the event horizon, you would witness the end of the universe in fast forward.</p>

<p>If you traveled around the curve you would just experience that level of time dilation for longer.</p></div>		</li>
