<p>There is remarkably little research on the most humane way to kill. Injections look nice for an observer but could be absolute agony for the one executed. We don't know since they are typically paralyzed (a specific drug is injected to induce this) to prevent any movements that would indicate agony.  </p>
<p><a href="http://documentaryheaven.com/how-to-kill-a-human-being/" target="_blank">This is the documentary to watch</a> on the issue. Death by nitrogen asphyxiation is so euphoric that it is actually difficult to resist dying from it; the documentary shows the former Minister of Defence actually not minding to die when he was asphyxiated by nitrogen. The officer with him has to force him to put his oxygen mask back on.  </p></div>		</li>
