			<p>You're right that there's not a <em>lot</em> of self-made movies and tv-shows on YouTube.<br><br>However, you're severely underestimating a large amount of good quality content in education and a better alternative to pop culture news/discussion.<br> <br>CrashCourse, SciShow, SourceFed, that kind of thing.<br><br>I know there are some people making short movies, but everyone on YouTube says the money isn't quite as good as it seems. I don't know what the figures are but I expect if you have a popular channel it's good money for a single vlogger but it's not going to get you enough for a cast and there's not any money up front. Merchandise and sponsorship is what everyone needs. So you have to build up to it. Video Game High School style. <br><br>Random people making their own shows usually won't go anywhere. It'll be badly acted, badly edited, and no one will watch it. It would have to be a hobby. Meaning just a couple people doing their thing. Short movie style. Which is most definitely on YouTube already. They're usually not good.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're probably right. We are without doubt in a media blackout when it comes to the real problems affecting the good old USA. What you suggest?  </p>		</li>

			<p>Does the cable packaging structure mean I have to pay .50 or up per specific charging channel to <em>subsidize</em> the unwanted channels like MTV, BET, LOGO, CNN and MSNBC? (ESPN aside, I don't watch sports at all)<br><br>I asked Google Fiber employee about nixing unwanted garbage channels from the Gigabit + TV package. He said not possible, just block unwanted channels with own password.<br><br>Do you support <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_la_carte_pay_television" target="_blank">A La Carte</a></em> option for the customers to pick their preferred channels rather than all in one package that contain objectionable political and/or moral content? </p>		</li>

			<p>As the parent poster explained, a la carte comes with a huge cost increase - if you allow some of your customers to opt-out of ESPN, then suddenly you have to pay triple ($13+ instead of $5.5) for everyone that does want ESPN.<br><br>Furthermore, some channels are 'all-or-nothing' by policy (due to advertising impact probably), i.e., either you provide all your customers with it or you can't distribute the channel at all; or a package policy - if you want to provide nice channel X, then you must provide less nice Y and Z (where they are worse than a similar competing channel but want marketshare) or you won't get to provide X. The local cable companies don't get much choice.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ever since the mid 90's (Digital) the cable companies could easy offer A La Carte video. It is the 6 content owners that refuse to allow it to happen. They do offer A La Carte options to comply with anti-monopoly rules, but it would cost you much more based on the pricing structure put out by the providers.</p>		</li>
