			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the industry, the engineer doesn't get to decide at all.  His managers, or even his company entirely, may not choose that level of detail if it's not function/safety critical.  If they outsource component manufacturing for that part, it may get swapped for whatever the assembly house in China has in stock for the cheapest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm the outsourcing bit.  When Xerox mover their manufacturing to Flextronics, Flex engineers swapped fasteners in the BOM to match fasteners that were used by other customers.   They saved a fraction of a penny each, but multiplied over hundred of millions of fasteners, it was a nice add to their bottom line.    </p>
<p>Fun fact: almost every Xerox fastener is a 5.5mm hex head.  This was standardized in the 1980s to make service as easy as possible for the techs.   You can disassemble the entire machine with one tool.   </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day (early 90's), when I was just out of school and learning the IT trade, the most prized possession of many technicians was a Compaq (the now-defunct PC manufacturer) bit-holder with several bits in the handle (black with a white screw-on cap). This single tool was all you needed to disassemble a PC (I never checked) but, more importantly in my case, also a Mac.</p>
<p>I still have mine. Still use it to this day, albeit with different drivers.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="http://img1.r10.io/PIC/52220820/0/1/450/52220820.jpg" target="_blank">here's a</a> picture of one, in case you guys have one lying around (they sell for over 100$ ,nowadays).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Indeed. Besides the scenario you outlined, there might requirements for a particular kind of screw head... an airplane or school, for instance, might ask for tamper-resistant screw heads. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also tolerance stackups that need to be taken into consideration when you buy these off the shelf parts. Depending on what you're designing the tolerance  can be very tight and one manufacturer might not be able to support those tolerances for every different fastener. For example, if you're stacking up a bunch of PCB's in a black box, the tolerances are extremely tight so you need very specific screws to hold them, where as the cover isn't so tight so you might just want a big old screw that doesn't have very tight tolerances.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the ease of maintenance is for them, not the customer. It is sometime desirable to make it a real pain for the customer to open it up, like for a laptop, as to push the customer into buying a new one. For example, apple use a variation of a torx screw that have 5 wings instead of 6. That screwdriver is not available in regular stores. In fact, the most common place is online, in china. I also saw security torx on laptop, again the goal was to make it a pain for normal customer to open it up, but being torx it's super easy for those who have the proper screwdriver!</p></div>		</li>
