			<div class="markdown"><p>Mundane things aren't necessarily simple. Killing dragons requires mostly broad motions that scan well at a distance. Faces or hands interacting is very intricate because of the sheer number of moving parts, and any minor mismatch by changing a mesh etc is going to be extremely obvious because of how familiar viewers are with it. A simplified but realistic hand has 16 segments and 15 joints or so, and changing position by a visual or actual distance that's small is very large proportional to the thing that's moving. Subtlety requires cohesion in all the moving parts.</p>
<p>The extreme short version of another problem is that objects in animation aren't actually solid.</p></div>		</li>
