			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason he died is because that isotope of polonium is an alpha emitter which is absolutely terrible to eat. Alpha particles have short ranges before they're absorbed, which is fine if you're holding a source with say a tissue. But when you ingest the source, most the energy gets deposited into your digestive tract. Very bad </p>
<p>Back to your question. A source &quot;hot&quot; enough to kill you within a matter of seconds would be too large to ingest (unless you're creative). </p>
<p>Acute symptoms are listed in a comment higher up. Cells explode, blood starts coming out of lots of your holes, vomit too, also severe headaches. It's not pretty. Death would come from organ failure and cell degradation probably. Though a source that hot might literally burn you to touch as well </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm... a HSA cobalt source would probably get you pretty fast. It's around 13K-16K R/h when it's fresh. It wouldn't take much. Of course it degrades extremely quickly... That's probably your best bet though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah we used to do detection labs with Co-60 back in college. I forgot how active those could be. Wikipedia says that a fresh source could have an activity of 44 TBq/g. Wouldn't take much....</p></div>		</li>

<p>Do school Physics classes not do this anymore?</p>
<p>I remember having the teacher having a Geiger counter and getting out radium and showing a sheet of paper stopping the alpha particles getting to the counter and putting their hand in the way to show it stopping.</p>
<p>Then a chunk of Uranium going straight through the paper and a plate of lead to show it stopping.</p>
<p>There was also another one but my physics school classes were a long time ago!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only way to make this happen is with an external whole body acute dose of around 10,000 rads. This causes complete central nervous system shutdown, causing you to go unconscious and then die.</p>
<p>This could not occur with an alpha or beta emitter deposited in your body as the range would never be high enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what they were trying to achieve with the &quot;neutron bomb&quot; IIRC, so they could airburst a few over an advancing line of Soviet tanks and immediately incapacitate the crews.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See that's interesting because I thought neutron bombs could detonate other nukes so their utility was in anti icbm roles, though I don't doubt your claim since I believe the soviet bpm (? I believe that was the name of their apc) had radiation shielding in it </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This appears to be factually incorrect.</p>
<p>The only information I can find is <a href="https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/polonium-210a-deadly-element/1013587.article" target="_blank">this article</a> which only speaks of Polonium delivering &quot;a fatal dose of radiation&quot; as its way of killing, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polonium#Biology_and_toxicity" target="_blank">the Wikipedia article</a> where it specifically says &quot;The main hazard is its intense radioactivity (as an alpha emitter)&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: found further information <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/58088.php#how_does_polonium_poison_humans" target="_blank">here</a>: &quot;Polonium-210 does not itself have toxic chemical properties - the danger comes purely from the radiation it emits.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yikes, I'm heinous. I normally associate heavy element effects to toxicity not radiation. I'm a medical physicist but rarely deal with this stuff, my sincerest apologies :/</p></div>		</li>
