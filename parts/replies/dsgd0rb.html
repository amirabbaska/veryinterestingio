			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the resonant frequency of water tuning is a myth. The resonant frequency of water is ~10 GHz while a typical microwave oven is at 2.45 GHz. If it were at the resonant frequency all the energy would be absorbed on the surface and the food wouldn't cook well.  I used to believe this myself until I looked it up. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, the frequency at which water maximally absorbs microwaves changes with temperature. From 0C and 100C, this frequency will shift by about an order of magnitude. Furthermore, at 2.45 GHz, the dielectric loss factor of pure water at 80C is roughly 20% of that at 0C.</p>
<p>Any fine tuning of the oven to match the dipole resonance of water would be a complete waste of time. </p>
<p>Further reading on the interaction of microwaves with water can be done <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/microwave_water.html" target="_blank">here</a>. I also used the figures on the linked page to give the rough figures above.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does this resonance only happen at one particular frequency, or would it be possible, though less efficient, to double the frequency and still get better coupling than say, frequency that is only 25 or 50% higher? Or would such a wave not interact with the water molecules at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The resonant frequency of the waveguide is pretty fixed and depends on tbe waveguide. You'd need to vary the size of the guide to get different coupling.</p>
<p>Note that you can increase the frequency through the waveguide to a point, but higher frequency means different modes of propagation which means less efficient power delivery and reflections back towards the generator which is BADBADBAD. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wasn't referring to the waveguide when I said coupling. I just want to know if... harmonics... that's the word I was looking for... will affect water similarly to the standard microwave frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation, it was very interesting!</p>
<p>Off center can really make a difference. I wish I'd known to do that years ago. Spreading food into a donut shape also really helps eliminate the cold middle and molten edges, too.</p></div>		</li>
