			<div class="markdown"><p>AT one year implies that the change happens at exactly the one year mark, regardless of circumstance. The change happens the exact day a child turns one year of age. </p>
<p>BY one year implies the change could have happened (rather gradually, I would assume) at any point leading up to the year mark. The change can happen at 7, 8, 9 months of age depending on the child, but will have happened by the time the child turns a year old. </p></div>		</li>
