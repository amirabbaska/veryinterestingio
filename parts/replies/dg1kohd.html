<p>Neither are a significant number (majority?) of cases seen by doctors in GP surgeries or hospitals. My last dental issue I left for so long I developed a large abscess. If I didn't stump up the cash it could have done permanent damage to the bone structure or resulting in life threatening blood infections etc. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you have something that goes beyond your teeth (like a blood infection), your health insurance steps in and you'll be headed to the hospital. I've known scenarios where an oral surgeon gets in and has to transfer to the ER because an infection has spread too far up in the head. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, you're kind of missing the point. It can be just as life threatening. You should take care of it <em>before</em> it's a life threatening blood infection. </p>
<p>Why is it different than any other condition that will become life threatening if left untreated?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely can be life-threatening, and there are studies that say that poor dental hygiene and infections in the mouth can lead to infection &amp; inflammation elsewhere in the body. I had a friend who had heart problems who was required to take antibiotics before, during, and after a simple dental visit because if any mouth germs made it into her blood stream, she was more susceptible to heart failure (I don't know the specifics).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is spot on. I have a great dentist. He can talk at length about this. I have witnessed anecdotal evidence to support this as well.</p></div>		</li>
