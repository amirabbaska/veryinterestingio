			<div class="markdown"><p>To keep going off of what you said, alcohol works on receptors that make the chance of those neurons firing much lower. So alcohol quiets your brain, rather than making it overactive. Overactivity, such as what would be caused by a brain seizure, leads to excitotoxicity, which WILL kill brain cells. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually work in the Lazarov lab (am earning my phd there). You are correct that neurogenesis continues throughout life and only slows during aging. Our lab is interested in understanding the specific pathways of why/how this happens, particularly in the context of Alzheimer's. </p></div>		</li>
