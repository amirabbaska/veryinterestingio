			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the explanation but I need more clarity.  So in as far as political theory goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liberal &lt;--&gt; Authoritarian: spectrum for power/governance.</li>
<li>Conservative &lt;--&gt; Radical: spectrum of wanting change.</li>
<li>Progressive &lt;--&gt; Regressive: spectrum for distributing material resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Now as far as political identity goes, this needs further exploration, as I said, most Progressives I know do not identify as Liberal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure I agree with the OP above, or at least with the way you characterized it in your post.</p>
<p>The answer is honestly somewhat non-existent, because it depends how you define &quot;liberal&quot; and other terms. People use words like &quot;conservative&quot; or &quot;liberal&quot; colloquially, without knowing the philosophical/political underpinnings. For example, in the United States, both republicans and democrats are &quot;liberals&quot; because they prescribe to certain enlightenment notions. These notions are things like equality, individual rights,and free market practices. They are rooted in theorists such as Locke, Hobbes, and countless others. The degree to which one is a liberal is actually what defines the political parties. How much regulation, what freedoms, etc are all arguments liberals disagree on. </p>
<p>However, radicals exist outside this liberal circle. I'm not sure there is a &quot;school&quot; of theory for just radicalism (liberalism is a school of thought) but there is for groups typically called radicals, say Marxists or anarchists. The reason why I disagree with that spectrum in your post is because &quot;radicals&quot; or Marxists or anarchists, are never liberals. One cannot be a Marxist and a liberal, they are two separate schools of thought in opposition (not to say they don't borrow ideas from each other). You can't advocate for the end of private property (Marxism) while also adovocating for free market capitalism. </p>
<p>As far as to the difference between progressive and liberal, I can't help much there. Just know that in the United States, people have very little understanding of politics and what the different political theories are. This means terms get conflated and misused all the time.</p>
<p>For example, people will often say that Sander's platform is socialist. In reality, it's left liberalism. Socialism is worker control over the means of production, which Sander's does not (openly) advocate for. Raising minimum wage is liberal, overthrowing factory owners and running an equal share worker co op is socialism.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that most Americans know very little about the terms they use to describe themselves. Media and both sides of the aisle use over exaggeration and incorrect understanding of political theory to make outrageous claims of their opponents. I suppose another reason for America's political illiteracy relates to our two party system. Other countries have sizable alternative political followings. This means that their citizens are used to seeing Marxists, socialists, anarchists and more. In the US many of these movements were crushed, so the average citizen thinks the &quot;conservative-liberal&quot; (aka democrat republican) dichotomy is the only existing political theory.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is so very true. I have a lot of business relationships with people in the UK, Ireland and South Africa. They often just assume that the Republicans are the liberal party and the Democrats are social-democrats because that's how they compare to most parties in the western world.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As much as I don't want to make excuses for my country, some of this isn't my countrymen's fault.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government has run propaganda campaigns for decades to promote patriotism to the level of radical nationalism by demonizing countries and beliefs that differ from the current leader's. </p>
<p>The Red Scare might be the most nationally renowned form of propaganda and brainwashing by the U.S. Government on its populace to program them to irrationally hate something. </p>
<p>You can see the results easily, even today. Ask 100 Americans what &quot;socialism&quot; means, and 99 of them will have a completely incorrect idea of what it means from just about every angle. Politically, generally, interpersonally. To most Americans, &quot;Socialism&quot; is a four-letter word that their parents treated with fear, disgust, and loathing.</p>
<p>The average American doesn't even know that taxes are a Socialist concept.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for this. Liberalism and Marxism are two entirely different things and associating them on a &quot;political compass&quot; is entirely wrong. While Liberalism may share some sentiments with Marxism on the equalitarian spectrum, they really share very few similarities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the key issue is the &quot;conservative vs radical&quot; difference.</p>
<p>The person above has defined &quot;liberal&quot; as liberal, <em>conservative,</em> and progressive, with conservative being the opposite of <em>radical</em> in the spectrum of change preference.</p>
<p>Which is to say, progressives differ from liberals in wanting radical change to better deliver on the liberal and progressive qualities the two ideologies tentatively share, whereas liberals are more inclined to favor the status quo, especially in terms of power structures that already exist.</p>
<p>You can see this play out in the Clinton-vs-Sanders fight and the underlying struggle over the Democratic Party: progressives want big changes such as single-payer health care and free/fully subisidized college tuition, and they view the liberal establishment as risk-averse, complacent, ineffective, more interested in order than justice. Liberals, meanwhile, might see progressives as impatient, foolhardy, careless, and chaotic; they want slow, steady progress that's been fully thought out, discussed, and tested.</p>
<p>(This is an absolute bearcat of a subject to analyze, because liberal, progressive, and conservative each have two distinct meanings here. But basically, yeah, I agree with the first commenter: liberals are liberal-conservative-progressive, progressives are liberal-radical-progressive. )</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>except that Clinton and Obama have been referred to themselves as progressive.</p>
<p>When talking about Progressives it become hard to manage a term that describes them because Liberals absolutely view themselves as progressives, or at least more progressive than conservatives and way more progressive than radical conservatives.</p>
<p>I think what Progressives are separated from Liberals by their hate and watchful eye of big business capitalism. Why? Because progressives absolutely are the empathetic people and want social safety nets to be put in place to help everyone. We don't believe in the bootstraps theory and it it is largely proven to be false. A lot of us tend to believe in facts and things that are absolutely backed by science.</p>
<p>Limited capitalism, regulation, health care as a right, and being progressive in general, such as not waiting to the last minute to start doing something. For example, we will absolutely need to move into some sort of basic wage for everyone once automation takes over everyone's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Obama was a progressive but slipped into Liberalism as he became president which pissed off a large fan base.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The issue is further complicated, while what /u/KubrickIsMyCopilot describes what these terms mean on an academic level, what they mean to people who use them as a label isn't only more complicated, but also ever evolving.</p>
<p>For example, politicians who aren't liberal or conservative in the slightest will adopt those labels in order to garner support, thus pushing the term to mean things that it doesn't.</p>
<p>This has a counter-affect of people who use those term to adopt new terms in order to distance themselves from the ideology of the politicians who are using them, and thus the cycle continues again.</p>
<p>I for example consider my self a progressive, though only loosely.   I don't identify as a liberal because people who identify as liberal often adopt neoliberal policies (such as strong military funding and intervention, and free trade).   While the term liberal doesn't directly refer to neoliberalism on its own, it has been co-opted by people who support those views.</p></div>		</li>

<p>its a moderate position that can shift into either a left or right mode depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>sometimes you need a strong government position to break corporate monopolies, then you need to dial back government power before it can be used to over ride individual liberty.</p>
<p>that's part of why defining liberal is hard, there isn't an over all permanent policy ideology,  it shifts depending on need.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To hijack this in general political theory explanation, which sorta misses the in practice and historical context. </p>
<p>/u/makhay I hope you read this.</p>
<p>Aside from some amount of jargon issues (like what does the word liberal means in political theory vs actual honest-to-god goals and policies, etc, etc) and bias due to supposed negative or positive connotations of certain words (like people dont like the word, authoritarian). Lastly, ignoring historical redefining of policies that FDR did, which is described below, consider the following.</p>
<p>Under /u/KubrickIsMyCopilot 's explanation, the liberal/progressive positions in this country would be radical, authoritarian, and progressive... except it's not radicial because while it wants to change the system, the socialist ideas to improve the overall welfare of the country is not new, it's been around for a very very long time. A radical, like never tried before, would be like UBI, or overhaul of the IP philosophy and framework in this country...</p>
<p>It's also not really authoritarian, (not really because it doesnt want to, but because it physically can't be) because the concentration of power is focused in those with influence and power (politicians and rich people). There's no &quot;we forcibly steal money from rich people and give it to poor people&quot;, there's &quot;we barely get rich people to pay their fair share... despite evidence pointing that we really should be doing more of a redistribution of wealth... but they're most definitely not letting us do that because they own both parties.&quot;</p>
<p>It's progressive indeed in that it wants more of a redistribution of wealth to promote a better economy and increase overall welfare. (The better economy part increases the overall welfare).</p>
<p>So while it should indeed by radical, authoritarian and progressive, it's not really the first two parts.</p>
<p>Specifically about your question. You're really asking about moderate democrats vs progressive wing of the democratic party. This is really about who is the establishment (or who is in power), there's no real philosophical difference... to be completely honest for the everyday supporters of the two wings of this party. The problems are the leaders of those wings, it looks like while the progressive movement's wings do want to bring about progressive policy changes... to an extend, a subsection of the moderate wing, known as the corporatists, do not want to bring about those progressive policy changes...</p>
<p>They say they do, but they dont. While the rest of the moderate wing wants more of a gradual slower progress, they want those changes... even though it's not really a super priority for them either.</p>
<p>There's foremost the corruption vs anti-corruption part of the discussion, while the moderate wing is not inherently completely corrupted, they do take corporate money, the corporatists' votes are influenced by money, the rest to a less extend. (before people talk a bunch of shit about how money cant influence politics cus of laws, there are superPACs.)</p>
<p>There's a lot of wedge issues, but let's not get into that.</p>
<p>Consider the subject of free trade, progressives do not hate free trade, they hate free trade without proper compensation of individuals that gets disfranchised in the process; the sickening part of the story is there are other countries were able to successfully deal with in this globalization process happening in the last 20-30 years. With some arguing, you can get moderate democrat voters to say that it is indeed fucked up that there are meth towns and we should do something about it. With the leaders of the moderate democratic wing, you can potentially convince some of them... but pretty much all corporatists will never concede that point in practice, they may say they agree with you, but they wont vote to get companies to retrain people, or for the government to have retraining programs... </p>
<p>It's a lot more complicated than that, but if we're using /u/KubrickIsMyCopilot 's definitions, then 1 party is completely regressive, while the other is only partially regressive. </p>
<p>PS: Keep in mind that the very act of minimal economic regulations is inherently regressive, because the capitalist system inherently concentrates power... so in some sense, conservatives in this country wants complete regressive policies, and moderate democrats might want less regression or maybe in balance. While progressives should technically want progressive policies, they're stuck fighting for balanced policies. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One of many falsehoods in this post.  Power is concentrated much more strongly in non-capitalist systems.  Socialist countries more closely resemble monarchies in the narrow benefit that their economic hardships sow.  Capitalism, by contrast, enjoys much higher standards of living completely across the board.  The whole point of capitalism is to decentralize power, away from the hands of the few well-connected politicians, and into the hands of the consumer and business owner.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>German here. While this basically has been the main objective of our &quot;liberal&quot; party (FDP) for the last 20 years,, there are other issues that European liberals typically consider important.</p>
<p>The general definition for liberalism in Germany is somewhere along the lines of &quot;Anyone should do what they want&quot;. This has been mostly used to push economic deregulation in the recent terms, which is why this so called neo-liberals often are called economic liberals as well.</p>
<p>But for example the FDP is pro abortion and pro same sex marriage, or more general: Pro individual freedom rights.</p></div>		</li>
