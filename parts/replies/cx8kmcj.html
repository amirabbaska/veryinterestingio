<p>This article covers a small part of it, including the authors experience with the sensation of &quot;wet&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My physiology professor explained it as we don't have an actual receptor to detect wet, but can detect temperature and pressure, and then our brain kind of puts the rest together to determine if something is wet. Can't remember her exact words, but I believe that's how it went. This was about 3 years ago if that makes a difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting...</p>
<p>The anus has a comparable time trying to distinguish between a fart and wet, sloppy diarrhea. The nerve endings in the anus can usually 'tell' you if you have to fart or poo, due to the consistency of the matter pressing up against it. However, when wet, sloppy diarrhea is involved, the anus nerve-endings have a difficult time trying to discern the two feelings. This is why we sometimes end up with a 'shart' situation.</p>
<p>Anyways</p>
<p>tl;dr
The human body sometimes has a hard time deciding what it's feeling during a 'grey area' type of sensory input. Hence, poop.</p></div>		</li>
