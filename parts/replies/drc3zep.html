			<div class="markdown"><p>That explanation of how to do that exercise is completely terrible. It says to lift your head like someone is pulling your hair. No comment as to which direction to lift your head. Someone could pull your hair in any direction. The woman pictured is pulling her hair in both the photos and I can't imagine either would be called &quot;lifting&quot;. The most obvious way to lift your head would be by increasing the distance between your nose and the ground, through the axis perpendicular to the ground, but it's hard to gel that with the instruction about pulling hair. All in all, a terrible explanation.</p></div>		</li>
