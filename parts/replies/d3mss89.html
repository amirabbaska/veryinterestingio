			<div class="markdown"><p>Sleep paralysis is a part of your brain actively inhibiting motor movement. Thinking about movement doesn't go through the same paths as actually acting. </p>
<p>Basically, brain thinks of instructions in one area office. Executes orders somewhere else. Sleep locks the office to the execution orders. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Motor pathways are complex and the are formed hierarchically, with broad strokes pattern generation forming at the top and flowing downward filling in finer details.  There's a risk that some of the commands might actually make their way through to the muscles, so the brain attempts to sequester the activity to prevent it from making it to the actual motor neurons. I think that the lock is leaky, because I've noticed my muscles twitch a bit in correlation with movement ideas when I'm dreaming.  There's still a gross lock that keeps them from being full movements.  Sleeping partners have corroborated this and maybe others can weigh in with their experiences.</p>
<p>I have also woken up in the middle of sleep paralysis and tried to move and there's a thick wall to break through to create movement.   Usually I can tense and wobble some of my spinal muscles and abs a little but nothing more than that until I finally break the sleep paralysis wall and then full movement returns.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can only speculate, because i'm not familiar with that, but I guess it's a similar mechanism at work where some key &quot;roadblock&quot; (read: interneurons or basal ganglia nucleus) is strongly inhibited, blocking any voluntary motor command from traveling further. The difference in this case would be that there's no conscious blocking going on (like in imagined movement) but a subconscious one, connected to sleep centers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Your brain has a disconnect when you're asleep, it isn't 100% though, so that's why your legs will move slightly if you're running in a dream, or people say muffled words. Just like how dogs can bark softly. </p></div>		</li>

<p><em>Doggy dreams are adorable!</em> although i did wake my pupper up a few times when the soft barks started sounding a bit distressed.. figured he was having a doggy nightmare :( is OK. woke him with cuddles. was happy doggy time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can, and that for me strongly supports that the pathway is the same as motor execution, but voluntarily blocking the motor command is not a 100% - 0% deal. It likely comes down to simply activating inhibitory projections on certain interneurons to decrease their excitability, but of course depending on the strength of such inhibitory commands, &quot;some&quot; activity can still make it through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a relevant story. So, recently I broke my humerus in half (mid-shaft) and a plate was installed and they had to cut quite a bit of muscle to do this, not to mention the muscle that was damaged during the break. The muscles have essentially almost healed now but if I think about moving my upper arm, sometimes my biceps will twitch ever so slightly as if they were about to start moving the arm. </p>
<p>edit - I should clarify, my other arm that hasn't been broken does not twitch if I think about or visualize moving it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it definitely involves more than just the regular motor planning-execution structures, as you say, there would be some extra commands sent somewhere along the line to prevent the motor plan from being carried further. This however is way beyond my knowledge so I can only guess.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why would there need to be a stop command. Wouldn't it make more sense that a command is needed to be received that fires off the final signals.  If you are just imagining movement no command would come so the signals wouldn't fire off. I don't see why it would require a separate stop command.</p></div>		</li>
