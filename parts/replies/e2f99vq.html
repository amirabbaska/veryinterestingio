<p>Yep. Even in an aseptic food testing lab we occasionally get a sample where we wonder &quot;How the hell did <em>that</em> get into there? Did Bill not sanitize his workstation thoroughly enough when he was working with it a few weeks ago?&quot; </p>
<p>Food processing facilities aren't nearly as rigorous, and there's likely to be a minute amount of everything they've ever made. For people with serious allergies that's an important thing to disclose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, what that page says is that it <em>isn’t</em> required to list potential cross-contaminants on the label; that’s left up to the discretion of the company, and many companies opt not to label for shared lines, shared facilities, etc. (believing, for example, that their cleaning is sufficient to remove any possible traces—although it's tricky, because these cleaning processes almost never has any transparency to them at all, so it's hard to find anything out about them, and if your allergies are severe enough that you have a chance of reacting anyway [and these people do exist], trying to figure out what's safe for you to eat can be... a crapshoot). </p>
<p>What <em>is</em> required by the FDA is listing all allergens that the item explicitly contains—as the article says, either within the ingredients list or at the end (e.g., “contains: nuts”). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also important to point out that different countries have different allergens that require labeling so if you’ve got certain allergies you might want to be careful depending on where you travel.</p></div>		</li>
