			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the only answer that is even close to being correct, except for the tummy bit. It doesn't matter how you consume it, DMT by itself will never get you high. The MAO in the body instantly neutralise the DMT and restricts it's ability to act as a neurotransmitter. DMT is NOT a complex chemical, and is near identical to almost all neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine. DMT is one of the simplest ones, making it a common metabolite, and always present in the body in massive quantities. MAO is the only reason everybody isn't tripping every second of the day. Non of this is simply unknown theory, it is a basic principal in all psychopharmachology. There is no debate about this in the scientific community. </p>
<p>Smoking DMT will have no effect at all. The only version of DMT that can be absorbed and used by the body immediately and unchanged is 5meo-DMT. It can ingested, insulflated, injected, or freebased. N,N DMT needs to be oxidized before it can be absorbed, and needs to be burned. </p>
<p>Edit: I could be confusing N,N DMT with 5meo-DMT. One of the two has to be oxidized.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is incorrect on all accounts. </p>
<p>Both dmt and 5-meo-dmt are active when smoked. It only lasts a few minutes because MAO breaks them down rather quickly. If you take an MAO inhibitor, the trip will go from just a few minutes to several hours because the chemicals are not being metabolized. </p>
<p>Dmt is related to the neurotransmitter serotonin but is NOT related to dopamine. There is NOT a ton of dmt floating around in everyone's system and you wouldn't be tripping without MAO. People take MAOIs (monoamine oxidase INHIBITORS) for lots of different reasons unrelated to psychedelics and don't go around &quot;tripping every second of the day&quot;. If what you are saying is true then MAOIs would be inherently psychedelic by themselves. They are NOT.</p>
<p>Dmt is NOT a common metabolite of neurotransmitters. The only structurally related neurotransmitter is serotonin which is metabolized into 5-HIAA.... NOT DMT. </p>
<p>&quot;Serotonin is metabolized mainly to 5-HIAA, chiefly by the liver. Metabolism involves first oxidation by monoamine oxidase to the corresponding aldehyde. This is followed by oxidation by aldehyde dehydrogenase to 5-HIAA, the indole acetic acid derivative. The latter is then excreted by the kidneys.&quot;</p>
<p>Where do you keep getting these &quot;facts? They are misleading at best, but for the most part just completely incorrect. Metabolism is an oxidative process (We breathe in oxygen to break down molecules). You will never make DMT by oxidizing neurotransmitters, only through reduction and methylation. </p>
