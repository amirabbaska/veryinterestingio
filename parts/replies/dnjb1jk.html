			<div class="markdown"><p>A nevus isn't only in the eye, either - it can be anywhere on the body.  My son has a large nevus on his leg, and a small one on his right iris.  Some children are born with very large nevi that cover large portions of their bodies, and some are born with literally thousands of &quot;satellite&quot; nevi.  Some can be removed through surgery.    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_melanocytic_nevus" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_melanocytic_nevus</a></p></div>		</li>
