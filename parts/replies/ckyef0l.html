			<p>Currently, it is thought that we absorb micronutrients far better from whole foods than we do from synthetic sources, such as a MV, however, we do absorb the micronutrients from MV <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2003.10719285#.VC121PldWFU" target="_blank">see here</a>. Whether or not we utilize them in same manner as nutrients from whole food is a more difficult question. There is limited data. <br><br>It would be beneficial to do those type of studies you described but it is problematic <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/1/269S.full.pdf+html&amp;amp;member.." target="_blank">see here</a>. Besides the limitations of trying to measure absorption and the bio availability of micronutrients in the human populations, i.e., metabolite transformation, synergistic and antagonistic affects, half-life, etc. It is thought that we possess varying degrees absorptive capacity from one person to another, depending on the nutrient, our genes, and the environment. <br></p>		</li>

			<p>For a couple of reasons. One of which is referred to as the &quot;food matrix.&quot; Which really just refers to the composition of whatever your eating. Depending of the food matrix certain characteristics may enhance micronutrient absorption and availability. An example would be fiber which would slow down gut transient time allowing for more efficient absorption or the inclusion of fat that would allow for more efficient absorption of the fat soluble vitamins. Secondly, it is also thought that if you spread your intake throughout the day versus a bolus your overall net absorption will be increased. <br><br>Edit: here is a <a href="http://jn.nutrition.org/content/129/2/349.short" target="_blank">paper</a> describing the effects of the food matrix on b-carotene...and another <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf061818s" target="_blank">one</a></p>		</li>

			<p>I do nutritional research on urban populations. And granted my subject base has been homeless women and mid-to- low income families (30% on SNAP)...

Even a when I do diet recalls on my own nutrition students, they aren't consuming 100% in all categories. <br><br>Most commonly it was low fruit and veggie consumption, but on a nutrient specific basis, calcium, vitamin D and iron were nearly always low. On the flip side, niacin and sodium are usually crazy high. <br><br>Granted, we do 3 day studies and you need 30 diet recalls to get an adequate level for most of those nutrients. </p>		</li>

			<p>So, after reading a little more, I guess it's a question of how 'hemey' you want your heme iron :). It's a nutritional science term I didn't know, coming from a photosynthesis/biochemistry background.<br><br>The iron in plants is also largely bound to heme groups, but they're not exactly the same heme groups used in animal mitochondria, so they don't count nutritionally and may be less bioavailable. For example in what I wrote above, cytochrome b6f used in chloroplasts has a b heme, while cytochrome c1 used in mitochondria has a c heme.<br><br>But plants ARE a rich source of iron, you just have to eat more of them than you do of animal protein.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; but they're not exactly the same heme groups used in animal mitochondria<br><br>I was wondering if that would be the case. Thanks for digging in some more. I did nutrition + bio minor specifically so I could avoid plant biology!<br><br>&gt; But plants ARE a rich source of iron, you just have to eat more of them than you do of animal protein.<br><br>Definitely. Though you also have to eat more of the non-heme iron because it doesn't absorb as well. But eating it with heme iron or (for vegetarians) vitamin C or alcohol (1 serving is enough) in the same meal increases the absorption of non-heme iron.<br><br>Fun fact: alcoholics can develop iron overload because alcohol increases absorption and chronically excessive alcohol intake can increase iron stores to the point that iron begins to deposit in the liver!</p>		</li>

Riboflavin has very poor water solubility so it gets easily excreted through urine, but the body is still able to absorb and use some of it, albeit not much (this is also why they put huge amounts of Ribo in MV's because of it's low water solubility/absorption).</p>		</li>
