<p>weather or not one actually needs them is one thing, but is there conclusive evidence our body can use the vitamins in a MV once ingested?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Currently, it is thought that we absorb micronutrients far better from whole foods than we do from synthetic sources, such as a MV, however, we do absorb the micronutrients from MV <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07315724.2003.10719285#.VC121PldWFU" target="_blank">see here</a>. Whether or not we utilize them in same manner as nutrients from whole food is a more difficult question. There is limited data. </p>
<p>It would be beneficial to do those type of studies you described but it is problematic <a href="http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/85/1/269S.full.pdf+html&amp;member.." target="_blank">see here</a>. Besides the limitations of trying to measure absorption and the bio availability of micronutrients in the human populations, i.e., metabolite transformation, synergistic and antagonistic affects, half-life, etc. It is thought that we possess varying degrees absorptive capacity from one person to another, depending on the nutrient, our genes, and the environment. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A deficiency is quantified by a disease, syndrome or symptom associated with a lack of that vitamin or mineral. E.G. If you have scurvy then you are suffering from a Vitamin C deficiency.</p>
<p>I know, that's pretty circular but it <em>is</em> almost a tautology. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avitaminosis" target="_blank">avitaminosis</a> for more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another molecular biologist here, just never got around to veryifying with the mods.</p>
<p>I would like to add that it has been shown that prenatal vitamins help in the development of the fetus and prevent mom from loosing out on the vitamins and minerals that the body needs.  Folic acid in particular is very important in helping prevent birth defects and as such, should be taken for several months before conception occurs.</p>
<p>At work on lunch, on my phone, and out of time, so I can't provide references at the moment.  Someone please feel free to verify this information with the proper source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think many people are arguing against the benefit of folic acid, seems like there is much more debate regarding the benefit of including that folic acid in a multivitamin vs just giving folic acid to women looking to become or who are pregnant. One major concern would be the teratogenicity of Vitamin A, but also some potential (with varying evidence) benefit of some of the other vitamins or possible omega-3 fatty acids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Folic acid should ideally be given to women before they get pregnant, as it's mainly involved in the prevention of neural tube defects that can happen as early as day 23-28, often before the time most women even realize they're pregnant. This is why it's recommended to be taken by all women in childbearing age, not just the pregnant ones.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think another few important ones are Iron and Magnesium. I wish they had tested my iron levels before they were critically low after labor due to all the extra that had gone to the baby, the placenta and the blood loss during labor. I felt a significant increase in my well being after beginning an iron supplement.</p>
<p>Lack of Magnesium has shown correlation with premature contractions and increased muscle tone in the uterus (as well as some of the other not so pleasant pregnancy side effects like leg cramps). </p>
<p>Not being a scientist my opinion is that vitamins can help increase overall health when there is a noted deficiency in the body. Many of us really don't have a balanced enough diet to take in all that we need. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the point of multivitamins and other supplements to get the things you aren't consuming in your diet. Like fish oil if you don't get a lot of omega-3. The study was done on &quot;nutrient-sufficient&quot; individuals which in that case seems like a waste of supplements, but I'm not sure the study answers the question of whether or not it would be beneficial for people with bad diets (like college students and poor people, but I repeat myself).</p></div>		</li>
