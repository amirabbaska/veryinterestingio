			<div class="markdown"><p>I've dealt with a lot of people who I've thought were deserving of the label alcoholics until I met those who are literally stuck.  Quite a few people are able to stop even just for a day, to a few, or even a week or more, before getting right back into it.  Only a very few that I have met and talked to have had full blown alcoholism, and quite often they are shy and don't want to talk about it.  </p>
<p>The hardest factor of it all is knowing that harsh words wont help, and will make the situation worse. Which makes me think that you are a very strong person for being that forgiving, by sticking with him and supporting him through any recovery he can muster.  </p>
<p>Truth is anyone I talk to about this that even know alcoholics outright deny those people have a problem they are mentally unable to come back from without almost killing themselves.  They argue that adults should be in control when quite a lot of them are barely in control themselves, one of which is an alcoholic bordering onto seriously alcoholism themselves, and they have no pity for people in that situation.</p>
<p>While my anecdotal accounts wont necessarily solve the problem, I have noticed a few determined alcoholics desperately trying to recover.  A few of which tried a WW2 veterans idea of locking himself away in a out of town motel for a week.  Reading, writing, doing as much as they can to distract themselves away from what in their lives caused the problems in the first place.  With a little success though one still keeps relapsing, though I still think the act of him quitting for a short time has made his health improve greatly. </p>
<p>Others take holidays, which is all well and good if you can afford it. In a lot of cases the alcoholics cannot which is why I think those things should be supported by the government. I personally just believe that getting people away from reminders of pain will stop them from wanting a drink. It's like when you go through a breakup after a long term relationship, everything around you hurts, because it only just reminds you.  That's why I think alcoholics keep going, because everything around them is depressing and they are not broken for being sensitive. </p></div>		</li>
