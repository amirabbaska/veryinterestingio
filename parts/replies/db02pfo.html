<p>So anywhere in that range can strike you. Even if you're in an airplane at high altitude. It will pass through you or the plane on its way to somewhere else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can damage electronics by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse" target="_blank">EMP</a> and in the case of some aircraft damage structural components. In the case of carbon fiber structures it can make them explode. IIRC, the first of this, were some helicopter crashed from carbon fiber rotors being hit. It was a REALLY BIG concern of the Rutan around the world flight. Designing for it delayed the Airbus 380 and Boeing 787, as they designed for it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES! That answers a question I've had since I was a little kid! I saw a ton of sprite lightning and I had no idea what it was. I described it to some professors in college and they had no idea what I was talking about. It's a thing! I'm not crazy! I know the name of it now! Thank you! :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No idea. It was just a somewhat constant thing over the course of a few minutes. Maybe it was something else, but it was purple streaks across the night sky that looked pretty similar to pictures of sprites I found on google
Edit: Not sure if it helps, but I was also in one of the darkest places on the east coast? Cherry Springs State Park, PA</p></div>		</li>
