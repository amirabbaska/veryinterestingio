			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to fall asleep listening to the first Harry Potter on cassette. (I feel super old saying that) </p>
<p>The American narrator (Jim Dale?) had such a soothing voice and each side was only ~90mins long so when I fell asleep I didn't miss much. I still hear certain parts in his voice when I do my rereads. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to fall asleep to the cassette of the 3rd book all the time as a kid. That was before I learned to fall asleep to the tv which is what I do now, usually Law and Order (original flavor or SVU) or forensic files. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>trying to go to sleep without an audiobook or something (often something i've listened to many times) would be very hard for me now. i used to always put futurama on, but anything i've listened to before is good, comforting, i suppose, otherwise my brain won't shut the fuck up. ahh, the delights of single living. i'll just hug my pillow and imagine there's somebody here...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's me exactly. I need something on or I can't get my brain to shut up. It has to be something Im very familiar with, it lets me picture the scene in my head abd distracts me. </p>
<p>Futurama, friends, himym, I was familiar with them when I chose them to watch as I fell asleep, now I practically have them memorized. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do the exact same thing. I even have Frasier on right now.  </p>
<p>For me, it's a distraction. When I lie down in silence, my mind becomes really active. If I focus on the show, watching it in my head the way you described, I can turn my mind off and fall asleep. </p></div>		</li>
