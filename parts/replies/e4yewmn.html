			<div class="markdown"><p>This needs to be higher, seriously. A car can run over so much shit that will fuck up a bike. Line of sight of what's up ahead is really important. Also gives an out if you can't brake in time and allows you to brake down the side of the vehicle depending on the road, plus saves you from being rear ended by a truck that wants to see how compact you can get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, the car in front is in the middle of the lane.</p>
<p>If they were to rear-end someone then you can just continue past their mangled vehicle.</p>
<p>Although, by having the visibility, you'll have seen and anticipated what they're going to do and either dropped back or got past to a position of safety.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was looking for this. Plus if you ride in the tracks of the car ahead, you somewhat know you won't run over anything you can't see because a car would swerve if it were in his tire path. </p></div>		</li>
