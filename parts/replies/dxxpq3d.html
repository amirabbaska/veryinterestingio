			<div class="markdown"><p>My daughter loved blowing raspberries at 6 months old. Big wet slobbery ones. Around the time, my brother in law was getting married to his crazy future ex wife  and she blew raspberries through the whole ceremony. Her mom and I were in the wedding party and grandparents did nothing to shush her. We had to bite our lips to keep from cracking up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I  just realized that she also really likes berries, getting into the trash, takes huge poops, and will randomly hibernate. Guys, I think I have a bear.</p></div>		</li>

<p>and (specially when crying)

<p>Yeah mine was saying &quot;mamama&quot; whenever he cried ever since he started making consonant noises. People would always rain on my parade and tell me &quot;doesn't count/he's not saying it with meaning/he doesn't know what he's saying&quot;. </p>
<p>Well duh but if I respond to that noise he's gonna figure out that I'm mum isn't he, that's how it works. Now he definitely knows what it means. He'll look at me from across the room and yell &quot;MUM!&quot; Then when I respond he just goes &quot;Hey.&quot; He's 19 months. Cute little smartass.</p></div>		</li>
