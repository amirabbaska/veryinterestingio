			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an artist and have always read about accelerated fading tests for pigments and wonder how that's done, in the interest of developing a handful of my own pigments from natural materials around me. Are you folks just bombarding pigments with intense UV light, then? Is there a standard wattage+distance+time=year formula? Seems like pretty interesting work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually simplified the answer, as there are multiple light tests, but for the one regarding fading of chromophores, the &quot;colorfastness to light: outdoor&quot; method is most accurate to this discussion </p>
<p>AATCC test method 16.1-2012 (or ISO 105-B01), and I'm sure NIST or ASTM has one as well.</p>
<p>Light sources could be enclosed carbon-arc, xenon-arc (most popular), or natural daylight.  Units for testing are in kJ (m^2 nm) @ various wavelengths in the 300-420 ranges.</p>
<p>Most companies (Atlas/AATCC/etc) have their own plug and play booth they will sell you so you just have to select the parameters you'd need)</p></div>		</li>

Personally, this has my curiosity on several fronts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything on the surface of the moon is subject to much more UV than anything on the surface of the earth is, because the atmosphere blocks a good bit of UV. That's what the Ozone hole was all about. What the guy above said still applies to the moon, just much more so.</p></div>		</li>
