			<div class="markdown"><p>Running water is often being carried down a mountain or from underwater springs, both of which will be cooler than stagnant water which has a chance to heat up in the sun. It won't be cooler in every situation though</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I got that. My confusion is due to the fact that it's all in the same environment anyway, subject to the same sunlight and ambient temperature.</p>
<p>But I wasn't taking into consideration the different sources for the water, and I'm now realizing that running water will also ostensibly evaporate more readily due to more moving surface contact with air, which would also act in cooling it.</p></div>		</li>
