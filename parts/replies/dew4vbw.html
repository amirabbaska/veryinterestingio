			<div class="markdown"><p>People are talking about viscosity because the original question was about water splashing, not about water in a cup.  In splashing water the sound comes from water rhythmically hitting a surface, as well as the dispersion of the water.</p>
<p>In a cup the waters shape is constant and determined.  The pitch is therefore the frequency of standing waves in the volume.  In splashing water, the frequency of the wave depends both on the speed of sound, and the distance the wave has to travel before reflection.  In less viscous water, this distance will be smaller as the drops will be smaller.  That means higher frequencies.  This effect will be much larger than changes in the speed of sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The viscosity argument has more to do with the type of sound the water makes rather than the pitch. Hot water has a sloshier sound to it. The theory is that the cohesive forces decrease as temperature increases, so the water is able to separate into drops more easily than when it is cold. This in turn makes it sound sloshier. </p>
<p>Closer examination would be needed to determine if this is correct. Slow motion cameras might be able to shed some light on it. Using laminar flow would help to reduce variables so as to have a fair comparison.</p></div>		</li>
