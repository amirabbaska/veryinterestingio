			<div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't yet you should try Kerbal Space Program as it's excellent for showing you some of the fundamentals of orbital mechanics and efficient spaceflight. Course corrections can certainly be made but in the end the more accurate your trajectory the more efficient and the earlier you make the correction the better.</p>
<p>An extreme example of this would be trying to change your orbit from west&gt;east to east&gt;west. The absolute least efficient way to do it is turn retrograde and burn the engines until you're going the opposite way (you'd have to pack a ridiculous amount of fuel to even do that). The absolute most efficient way is to pitch the rocket west instead of east just after launch. The earlier you do your burns or course corrections the better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ksp is my favorite game in the sense that it is not the kind of game that is designed to make you win, it's a game that makes you learn the actual approximate mechanics of spaceflights, and that it is not without huge and many failures, kind of an allegory for real life. </p>
<p>Plus I passionately love physics, so that makes me go overjoyed to see the principles of gravitational physics which i see in textbooks, in action in front of my eyes. </p>

<p>Your explanation helps me understand the theory of it though. I think there are many aspects of orbital mechanics that I never even considered existed.

			<div class="markdown"><p>The gravity assist isn't about saving time (in fact, it probably takes years longer). It's a matter of getting the spacecraft to the target by using the least amount of fuel. By using gravity assists, the crafts can steal energy from the celestial bodies.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>1) All elliptical orbits steadily lose speed at its apogee, the point farthest from where it is orbiting. Think of it like a baseball thrown straight up. When nearing its height, it slows down dramatically and then comes back. Same with an orbit: It slows down to a few m/s at its apogee and then comes screaming in and whips around whatever it is orbiting at perigee, the lowest part of the orbit. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/Classical_Kepler_orbit_e0.6.gif/200px-Classical_Kepler_orbit_e0.6.gif" target="_blank">Badly scaled (in size and speed) Gif example</a></p>
<p>2) It's an efficiency thing. I don't believe we can even make a craft powerful/efficient enough to burn the several thousand m/s delta-v needed to go from an orbit around earth directly to an orbit around... anything but the moon.
Even if we could, I believe gravity assists are virtually free, given the proper planning.</p>
<p>Any more than that I can't say with certainty. I have no credentials other than being an astrophysics nerd who also played the hell out of Kerbal Space Program, lol.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Surprisingly, if the craft uses optimal transfer windows it costs approximately the same amount of fuel (&Delta;V) to reach Mars and Venus as it takes to orbit the moon.  That's also why we send probes to (especially) Mars on direct transfer trajectories, and why Venus is a handy target for an inner-solar-system gravity assist.</p>
<p>It is, however, frighteningly expensive to reach Mercury (because it's so close) or the outer solar system, which is why fuel-saving gravity-assist trajectories are mandatory components of missions to these bodies.</p>
<p>An /r/space user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/29cxi6/i_made_a_deltav_subway_map_of_the_solar_system/" target="_blank">contributed</a> a subway-style &Delta;V map some time ago that presents all the information in a handy way.</p></div>		</li>

<p>New Horizons was launched directly into a solar escape trajectory (It was the fastest object ever launched) and technically could have made it to Pluto without any gravity assists. However, because they wanted it to get there in time to see Pluto before its atmosphere froze out, they performed a gravity assist past Jupiter.</p>
<p>Also, Galileo was originally intended to be a direct Hohmann transfer, but that was nixed when the original boost stage was prohibited from flight on the space shuttle.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Think of two cars speeding around a race track at various speeds, and the race track itself is moving. If you wanted to launch something from one car to the other, you will have to adjust the speed of the object you're launching relative to the other car. If that other car is going around the slower or faster, it might mean slowing down or speeding up, which requires those gravitational assists. You have to match the orbital velocity of Saturn else you would zip right past it, too fast to catch its gravity well. Or going to slow, and miss it completely.</p></div>		</li>
