			<div class="markdown"><p>Mattress quality and Positioning via pillows. Sidelying with a body pillow extending from between the ankles, continuing between the knees, and then with the uppermost arm draped over it. One pillow under the neck so it is in a neutral position. A mattress that does not sag and allow a “bowing” position of the body. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have you tried a body pillow or putting some pillows around you? That should help you to stop moving so much in your sleep. I have a pillow I hug with my arms, another pillow I put between my knees (I sleep on my side), and a pillow behind me to stop me from moving...also the pillow behind me lets me turn sides and maintain the same position without having to readjust everything or move any pillows.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In lieu of that, a body pillow to lean back against does wonders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain why muscles &quot;shorten&quot; and don't always relengthen themselves after exercise?</p>
<p>As in, I've always been rather flexible without doing stretching and exercise to promote that but took up kickboxing about 3 years ago and have now lost a lot of the flexibility and my muscles feel sore and tight like they're shorter than they use to be.</p>
<p>I can still bend and touch the floor, however now there's a burn &quot;stretch&quot; through my calves and hamstrings when I do this, and I used to feel nothing. Same as a basic quad stretch getting foot to or past my rear used to be simple, now I struggle </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is such a thing as “neural tension” that would take a separate post to describe. Basically your nerves can actually restrict motion as well if they are not able to glide freely trough the muscle and connective tissue in the body. They can adhere to other tissues and “snag” up. Also, you may be moving in less diverse patterns than you were previously. This may lead to restriction in ranges of motion that are not frequently used in kick boxing. There could also be some malrotation of your pelvis occurring. Hard to say without an examination! </p></div>		</li>
