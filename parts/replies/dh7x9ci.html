			<div class="markdown"><p>To clarify: Phosphorescence is what the OP is referring to as &quot;glow in the dark&quot;.  These are the glow in the dark materials that need to be &quot;charged&quot; by exposing to light.  Think of the greenish-white plastic toys like those stars you can tape to your ceiling.</p>
<p>Fluorescence is when something glows a specific color when exposed to light (so not really in the dark).  This is most commonly seen under a black light, where a mostly invisible form of ultraviolet light causes the dyes in your white shirt to glow.   In truth, these brightener dyes glow in daylight as well, which is the reason your shirt looks so white.  </p>
<p>There's another thing you may think of as glow-in-the-dark, which is called chemiluminescence.  This is what makes glowsticks glow.  In this case, the energy for the glowing is provided by a chemical reaction from mixing two chemicals that begins when you crack a small glass vial within the glowstick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct, but strictly speaking phosphorescence could happen on the scale of nano seconds, or it could be much slower. The difference is the electron has to make an extra jump so to speak, from the first excited energy level, to a different and slightly lower energy level, before the drop to ground state that produces a photon in the visible spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close, but not quite. The important part of phosphorescence is that the jump from the slightly lower energy level to ground state involves a forbidden transition (typically spin forbidden) which makes the transitions relatively slow.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, that's absolutely the correct process, though I figured forbidden transitions were a tad opaque for Explain like I'm 5. </p>
<p>Maybe I could have said a transition that relatively speaking, isn't very a likely to happen.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi - thanks for the insightful answer. I'm not OP, but hope you don't mind my asking a follow-up question to confirm I understand the reason. Recently put up some glow-in-the-dark stars in my bedroom so got wondering:</p>
<p>Does that mean my glow-in-the-dark stars will never become increasingly ineffective (like emit less light in one year's time)?  Since the glowing is due to electron relaxation, which is a process that doesn't disappear or otherwise &quot;wear off&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you're still dealing with reality. Things will degrade. Over enough time, the compound will react with something to create something that is not luminescent. The process also still involves excited electron states, and excited electron states are relatively reactive.</p>
<p>That said, don't be afraid of using them. They'll still last a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey, thanks for answering :) That's a shame, but it makes sense. Guess I'll just see how long my current ones last and replace as needed.</p></div>		</li>
