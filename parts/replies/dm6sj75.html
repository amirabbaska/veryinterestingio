<p>moving the file from the temporary download directory to the actual location you wanted to save it in.</p>
<p>If both locations are on the same drive, that part goes instant, if they are not then an actual file move operation needs to happen.</p></div>		</li>

<li>Download is split in chunks for parallel fetching and one of multiple connections is slower than the others. So the last Bytes take a long time compared to the 99% before. </li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>but why cant this exra time be integrated into the calculation of how long it will take? It knows the file size and what it needs to do, why cant it assign the last 10% or whatever it needs to error checking etc and have it be fluid as oppose to shooting through to 99% in a few tens of seconds and then the last 1% taking minutes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because the process that downloads a file is not able to predict things like whether the file will be scanned by antivirus and if it will how much time it is going to take. The process showing you a progress bar can only be responsible for its own part of the job.</p></div>		</li>
