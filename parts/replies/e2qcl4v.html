			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a fraternity big that went on a cow day road trip for three years.  Literally dressed up as a cow and drove to every chik fil within 5 miles of I 20 from a friend's house in Mississippi to Atlanta.  Had coolers for all the sandwiches and catered a party for a bunch of people.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes things like that are about the festival environment too. It's not really about saving $2 on a burger, it's about hanging out chatting with your friends or strangers. Even better if you have a lax job that you can cut out of to go get the &quot;special.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chick fil A is just plain awesome with their franchisees, which they can be because they are so selective of them ahead of time.  I think they also help their franchise operators out when there is a disaster nearby and the franchise operator sends out sandwiches to first responders.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right.  Chick fil-A also limits the vast majority of their operators to one store, which I think is great.  Operators also can not pass down their stores to relatives when they die/retire.  CFA actually owns/leases the property, a d puts up all of the capital, and selects the site, before choosing the operator.  You basically run the store as an independent contractor, as if it’s your own business with a contract that specifies how much of the cut you will take home.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At that point, what are you actually doing as a franchise owner? CFA puts up the capital, owns the building, and it's not like you vary at all on menu or procedures...so I don't get it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is pretty common for many fast food chain franchises and gas stations, among others. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That topic gets under my skin..I get it but my gay son worked at a Chik Fil A and the franchisee was the nicest guy as was the entire staff (my son opened with a a completely new staff and store).  Blaming and boycotting the franchisee who has put his or her savings, blood sweat and tears into a business for the mindset of an old southerner doesn't seem like well spent energy.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's what I do, because I love chicken but don't want to feel like a terrible person.</p>
<p>At the end of the year I look over my Visa statements, and add up how much I spent at CFA.  Then I cut a check for half that amount to GLAAD.</p>
<p>It somewhat discourages me from eating out, because now my tendies are $6 instead of $4, and teh gays don't have to suffer due to my chicken addiction.  Win win.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chick-fil-a's previous CEO and the current CEO donate to anti-lgbt groups. It is more than a belief, as they act on said bigotry.<br />
Edit: my point is that it isn't just an opinion they hold. If they personally disagreed with homo/bisexuality, that would be one thing. However they are actively finding anti-lgbt groups as of April 2018. </p></div>		</li>
