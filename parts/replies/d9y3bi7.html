			<div class="markdown"><p>That's very interesting, but my question (maybe, I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I'm not) would more be asking if it would be possible for the entire game to write itself, instead of one of it's conditions. But, that's still definitely the best thing I've ever seen about Conway's Game of Life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If we assume that the &quot;outer world&quot; has infinite resources, or at least apparently infinite compared to the size of the &quot;inner world&quot;, then overall I would say the answer to your question would be yes for any game with Turing-complete logic. (There are <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-84996-217-9_7" target="_blank">non-Turing-complete automata that can simulate themselves</a> as well, but that's a separate issue.) As a concrete example, Minecraft's redstone logic is Turing complete. A player in this world that acts completely randomly would be capable of potentially constructing a redstone circuit which implements a CPU and associated data capable of running Minecraft (or any other game). If the inner game was Turing complete this could be repeatedly indefinitely until one of the systems runs out of space/memory. In practice it would take longer than the age of the universe for a randomly-acting Minecraft player to construct a working Minecraft simulator. While that's obviously a very long time, the age of the universe is also just about the amount of time it took for random interactions between molecules to eventually yield humans, so it's not completely preposterous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! Good answers all of you! Thank you very much.
But on another note, that sort of strengthens the whole &quot;the universe is a computer simulation&quot; argument.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some parts are random, but then selection kicks in and accelerates curve. It's a non-trivial difference.</p></div>		</li>

<p>A program that writes a copy of itself is called a quine (or with some modifications, a virus). This is somewhat different from a simulation, since a quine outputs itself and terminates, but it naturally could just keep the output in memory instead and loop forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>YES the conways game of life zoom-out to reveal conways game of life was one of THE most mind blowing things I had ever seen.  I only hope that its actually real.   it gave me all kinds of epiphanies about scale in our universe, how everything is kind of working to make the same thing (atoms/solarsystems)</p></div>		</li>
