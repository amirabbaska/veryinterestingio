			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to note that the force is always oriented directly toward the moon (the center of the moon, to be precise) -- the gravitational force from the moon is not parallel to the surface of earth. The displacement of water is parallel to the earth's surface because the force of gravity on earth is much stronger and does not allow the water to be lifted from the surface.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Both the absolute gravitational force of the moon and the tidal force (that is, without the absolute force minus the centre of mass component) are parallel to the Earth's surface in specific places, and the tidal force varies from being perpendicular to parallel to the surface of the Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I assure you that the force is <em>not</em> oriented away from the moon. Gravity doesn't become a repulsive force just because it is &quot;behind&quot; the earth with respect to the moon. Gravity is strictly a force of attraction. The wateron the &quot;back side&quot; is farther away from the moon, so it is pulled with the least force compared to the rest of the moon. The earth itself (&quot;land&quot; which is where we take measurements from) is pulled more strongly than the &quot;backside water&quot;, so it is pulled in the direction of the moon as well, but with greater force, so it forms bulge #1. On the &quot;near side&quot; it is pulled strongest of all, accounting for bulge #2. </p></div>		</li>
