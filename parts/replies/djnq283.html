			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing that could be properly explained in less than a few pages.  Most of the same issues on big deals as small, just more pressure, emotion and ego to deal with.  The best stories for me came from smaller private deals with a single shareholder.  Some of the things I've seen people deduct on their taxes and then claim ignorance, then lie and then have a sudden onset of amnesia.  Your kid's bar mitzvah is not a business expense, even if you invite all of your best clients.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This seems like it should be a simple question, but it's actually <em>incredibly</em> complicated bc you are touching on <em>why</em> companies acquire each other, and there are millions of non-financial and non-economic reasons companies buy each other. </p>
<p>Business school teaches you that you should use some sort of DCF/NOPaT/FCF/WACC analysis, but this doesn't match the reality of doing M&amp;A in practice. I did tech/TMT M&amp;A for about 4 years. In 9 out of 10 situations, company A wants company B for whatever reason and it's up to the bankers to find a multiple/valuation/theory/story that makes the deal work after the fact. M&amp;A banking is a lot like high-touch real estate sales. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just finished an internship where I determined various cost of capitals for some subsidiaries, and my manager told me that in the corporate/commercial banking industry (not IB) people prefer to use discounts rather than adding additional premiums to the discount rate. He told me that they just put a round and nice discount figure and then be done with it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some companies do.  Most will set a return threshold they need to hit for M&amp;A, which is usually above organic initiatives.  In many industries, 15% is a common target but that number has crept down over the past few years.</p></div>		</li>
