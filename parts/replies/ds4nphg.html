			<div class="markdown"><p>so, you are saying that at a distance of ~1.59 miles north of the south pole, the distance to go in a circle around the south pole is 10 miles?  how did you get the number 510/44?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a seperate concept.   You have euclideon and non-euclideon geometry with higher-dimensional spaces.  The concept revolves more around the shape of the space itself.  If you start walking in a straight line,  and you get further and further away from your origin at a constant rate, that's probably regular space.   If you start looping back on yourself, or get further at an inconsistent rate, the space is probably distorted in some way.</p>
<p>Now, non-euclideon space is often described as a surface of a higher-dimensional plane or object.  Like the surface of a 3d globe being a 2d warped plane.  But this doesn't really let us represent the higher dimension.   It's the other way around.  We need the higher dimension to represent the space. The 3d space helps us understand the warped plane,  the plane doesnt really help us understand 3d space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. You can have 10-dimensional Euclidean space. Or 10-dimensional non-euclidean space. Space being Euclidean or not basically tells you about straight lines and how many parallel lines there are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, that doesn't rely on the Earth being curved, but on &quot;West for 10 miles&quot; not being a straight line (except at the equator). That is perhaps most clearly seen by looking at the situation if you stand 5 meters from either pole. West for 10 miles is then walking in small circles around the pole.</p>
<p>The Earth is nearly flat for small distances, so when we talk about distances of 10 miles, the deviation from the Euclidean result is quite small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damn, I never realized this. I've used the example of the 5 mile right angled &quot;triangle&quot; lots of times while trying to explain non-Euclidean spaces. Didn't expect to learn something from an ELI5 post about mathematics! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If instead of 5 miles you made the sides of a length so that the first journey extends from the pole to the equator, then you're always travelling along great circles and the analogy is fixed. ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your comment was helpful by conceptualizing the differences in simple terms. /u/sfurbo's comment was helpful by providing more information and helping to bring the concept into sharper focus. Both of your comments were helpful.</p>
<p>Unless /u/sfurbo said something confrontational and edited it out later, I'm not sure why you're being defensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Atrocious reaction to valid criticism. You've really let yourself down.</p>
<p>The criticism is not pedantic, and your metaphor is not intuitive if you think about it properly. I didn't realise it either at first but they uncovered a massive flaw in the analogy which could quite easily lead somebody to an erroneous understanding.</p>
<p>The shape made by the path you described is almost entirely flat and looks like a quarter-segment of a circle. There is no mystery in the fact that it joins up with itself, because the curved line is not remotely straight, neither in Euclidean nor in spherical space.</p>
<p>For this analogy to be correct and useful, the sides of the triangle should not be 10 miles long, but rather a quarter of the way around Earth, such that you go down to the equator, then along it, then back up to the pole. Then that is indeed a triangle composed of straight lines in spherical geometry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not pedantic. The effect in your explanation is almost entirely caused by &quot;walking west&quot; not being a straight line, and barely caused by the curvature of the earth. Your response isn't almost correct (at which point objecting would be pedantic), it's almost entirely wrong. </p></div>		</li>
