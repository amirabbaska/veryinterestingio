			<div class="markdown"><p>In Canada, all finances at the federal level are controlled by the Treasury.  They hand out money at the beginning of the year to all the various federal agencies, and at the end of the year, any money not spent is clawed back by Treasury.</p>
<p>I used to think the government was wasteful, until I started working with these agencies.  They are hand to mouth, it's a bit sad actually.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just how strapped for cash they are.  I work in the private sector, and dealing with the government is kinda like being a rich guy hanging out with your poor friend. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at an office furniture manufacturing facility and one of the main source of revenue are government contracts. Every year, the same agencies are ordering new tables and desk like clockwork.  It's such a blatant disregard for our tax dollars, the tables we built came with a lifetime warranty! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Business owners definitely use up some money at the end of the year. I've heard &quot;I need to get a new work truck, office furniture/equipment, etc before year end.&quot;
In reverse, I have heard owners wanting to hold orders because they are &quot;done spending money&quot; until the new year. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This varies greatly by jurisdiction in details, but what you are describing is the practice of forcibly increasing business expenses to lower the overall taxable earnings, needing to pay less corporate income tax. At a very high level, as a business owner, you would rather invest the money in the business rather than let it become profits you don't use/dividend and pay income tax. It basically comes down to whether it is best to spend the money now on business needs than to pay taxes but keep the remaining money available. Plus a lot of details like what is taxable, what is deductable, etc. It's an accounting maze.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The use of the word &quot;dump&quot; implies wasting money, spending on whatever just because you can. That's very different from investing in assets like equipment. </p>
<p>Also, capital investments (again, like trucks or other equipment) are not a deductible expense, nor do capital expenditures affect profit. Spending on compensation like bonuses, or other expenses is sometimes pushed from one year to another for cash flow or tax reasons. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but Capex does depreciate over time, and the depreciation can be used to offset gains in future holding periods, so it can be beneficial to invest in equipment in the current year. But as you said, they arenâ€™t just throwing away money for the sake of getting rid of it</p></div>		</li>
