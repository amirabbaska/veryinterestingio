			<div class="markdown"><p>Space between stuff is being created, everywhere; at bigger distances, that adds up to the distance increasing faster than the speed of light. Things aren't moving faster than the speed of light, there is just a lot of space being added between them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am confused now because I think I don't fully understand what space is, I thought I did but I no longer do.</p>
<p>My understanding was space and time can wrap.</p>
<p>My point being that even though it is vacuum i.e. it's absent of matter(or anti matter) and dimensionless, by wrapping, it is showing that it is still a subject to the laws of physics that govern this universe.
When our universe expands into nothingness, it expands the domain over which our physical laws apply.
This was a key differentiation for me between space and the nothingness we are expanding into.
Even though the objects aren't moving faster than light which is basically the maximum speed of causality, the ftl expansion of space is either violating causality or is not subject to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is the speed light travels <em>through</em> space. This is talking about the speed at which the volume of space increases, thus increasing the distance between objects in space. </p>
<p>Nothing is travelling through space, space itself is moving.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are allowed to &quot;move apart at the speed of light&quot; because each measures the actual velocity of the other to be lower than the speed of light, but also noted that there is space being produced in between them, meaning that they &quot;move apart faster than the speed of light&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No this is not about special or general relativity. The speed of light is the speed limit of information in space. What's being talked about here is space itself expanding. There is no speed limit for that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't this mean that things are moving faster than the speed of light (at least, relatively speaking)? How does this fit into our theories of physics where <em>c</em> is the 'universal speed limit'? What reference frame is this all being looked at from?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In a sense, yes.  Neither object is moving.  They are occupying the same point in space that they always have.  The space between them is just expanding.  So it doesn't violate any speed limit issues.</p>
<p>And unfortunately, because all space at all points is expanding, this cannot be used to go FTL in any manner, since no matter your destination, the expansion of space is going to only increase the distance you must travel, and effectively slow down your trip.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am confused by this. If space is being created in every direction then it must be between the two objects as well. So, how then are the two objects not being forced apart? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is moving faster than light within its own reference frame. Adding more space between two distant objects is not the same as moving one object across space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But, in the reference frame of one object, isn't the other moving faster than the speed of light? Could you clarify this?</p></div>		</li>
