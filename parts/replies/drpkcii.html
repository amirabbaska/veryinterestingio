<p>&quot;Universal reference frame.&quot;</p>
<p>Again, not possible. Einstien and many experiments prove that there is no privileged or special frame of reference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No: they've shown time and again that a universal reference frame is not <em>needed</em> -- all observations so far can be fit into a picture without one.
That's not at all the same as <em>proving</em> there isn't one, only that if there is one, most things interact with it in such a way that you can't tell.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You'd think that if Alice appears slowed down to Bob due to traveling away from Bob at high speed due to special relativity, then Bob would appear in fast forward to Alice. You'd be wrong though - they both see eachother as slowed down. And there will never be a single frame where both of their perspectives make sense.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I can't prove that you don't have an invisible insubstantial rabbit inside your head, but I still say it doesn't exist because it can't be detected in principle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Such a weird concept to me. </p>
<p>So you fly away from earth at near light speed, come back, and three generations of your family have passed in a night. </p>
<p>So you're basically the same age, but on Earth some amount of decades have passed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to understand why this happens is a simple explanation of what is called lorentz contraction. When you were moving at the speed of light or close to it space itself contracts around you, meaning that the distance that you perceive yourself traveling is actually shorter than the distance and observer sees you travel. This is why it might only take a week for you but a year for other people watching you. For you to travel a Year's worth of distance in a week might require that you travel faster than the speed of light, but from your frame of reference you didn't travel a light years distance at all you only travel a light week maybe because space itself contracted and the distance was shorter. </p>
<p>If you take this to The Logical extreme, at the speed of light you actually experience zero distance. A photon emitted by the sun does not perceive itself taking eight minutes to get to Earth, it perceives it happening instantly, because the distance between the aun and the Earth is zero when moving at the speed of light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you accelerate away from Earth at near-but-not-quite light speed, you can look back and see your kids, grandkids, and great grandkids grow up and die while you have dinner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Technical quibble - you'd only see that once you turn around and head back (unless they were all going to die within some freak accident in your lifetime anyway).</p></div>		</li>
