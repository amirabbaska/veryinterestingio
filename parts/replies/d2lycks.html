			<div class="markdown"><p>I've eaten undercooked fresh pasta.  Twas disgusting.  Like chewing lumpy, mushy snot that's a little slimey.</p>
<p>This makes me want to experiment.  </p>
<p>Make some fresh and cook it hot and cook some 'cold'.  Then take dried store bought, cook hot and cook cold and then take homemade dried and cook hot, cook cold and see first hand.</p></div>		</li>
