			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but the ones I get are thicker, stronger and black (I'm a redhead).  They also tend to appear out of nowhere and grow from 1-4 inches long.  I've never known anyone outside my family to get these.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on where they are, it could be hormonal hair growth. Some redheads still get darker hair on their armpits and pubic area. Idk your gender, but hormonal hair growth can appear in the beard area, on the chest, around the nipples and probably elsewhere too. It's especially prominent in women with PCOS. It could be ingrown like /u/gumnos talked about, and pop out from exfoliation or abrasion, making it seem like it grew to that length overnight.</p>
<p>But that's just my guess, I haven't had pigmented mystery hairs pop up myself ¯\ <em> (ツ) </em> /¯</p>
<p>EDIT: Realised that underarms =/= armpits in English</p></div>		</li>
