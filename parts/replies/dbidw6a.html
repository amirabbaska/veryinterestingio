			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah, that explains it a little more. Three things-</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Minimal union representation. The Deep South has the lowest rates of unionization in the country, and where unions are weak, wages are low. Never expect employers to give you a raise or benefits if you don't fight for them, and most folks in the south don't fight for them. In more unionized regions of the country, wages for these jobs are higher.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Political conservatism and scapegoating public employees. Lots of politicians likes to give lip service to these professions and simultaneously scapegoat them as overpaid leaches of public funds, and as such there's political will to keep these people from making too much money as public employees. Especially true in intensely conservative regions. </p>
</li>
<li>Wages in the Deep South are low in general. This isn't meant as an insult, but you live in one of the poorest regions of the country, so it should come as no surprise that public jobs pay very little, especially when there's so little tax revenue.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, you're right.  I think overall, unions have a bad name here.  My first job at 19 was a Walmart cashier, and I still remember a very prominent sign next to the time clock that basically bashed unions and that there was an &quot;Open Door Policy&quot; and all that.  For the longest time I thought unions were bad, thanks to experiences like that.  However, they do fight for workers' wages, so they're certainly not bad.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife (public school teacher) and I live in Alabama. She started out at $42.5k gross with a masters. That, ontop of the incredible benefits she gets, is a pretty substantial income. Her benefits include:</p>
<p>1.Very cheap, but quality medical/dental insurance. Her medical by herself before we got married was less than $100/month. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Extreme job/wage security due to Unions. Can't even imagine what it's like when tenure kicks in. Regardless, she gets a guaranteed wage increase that is spelled out when first signing her contract. No cloaks and daggers, no misleading by her employer. Otherwise, she can sue with union lawyers.</p>
</li>
<li>Loan forgiveness from federal government. She'll dissolve I think it's $17.5k in student loans by staying with her school for a minimum of 3 years in a row.</li>
</ol>
<p>My point is that there are plenty of good, middle-class monetary incentives for school teachers, just in different forms. But as you've heard here before, teachers really don't do it for the $. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those are several good points.  And yes, the medical and dental benefits are wonderful, even though costs more or less doubled this year, but it's still some of the best around.  And loan forgiveness is definitely a big plus.  Some have much higher debt loads, but $17.5k is nothing to sneer at, and will be great for you two when they're forgiven.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Full representation though, (also married a teacher), I have a BS degree and earn just over double what my wife makes, with her Masters. We paid the same college tuition rates. The return on that should be more inline with the cost. </p>
<p>What's funny is I argue they don't get paid enough she argues it's okay and she loves her job. I love my job and get fair compensation for my education. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on what you mean by &quot;great money.&quot;  I'm a teacher in one of the more affluent towns in Massachusetts.  If &quot;great money&quot; means I make more than teachers in Alabama or Louisiana, that's absolutely true.  If &quot;great money&quot; means I could actually afford to live in a community like the one I teach, that's definitely not.</p>
<p>Even though teachers in my state, and some others, NY and CA for example, make significantly more than teachers in more southern or central states, on average, we also have a higher cost of living.  And we still make far less than any other profession I can think of, apart from public law, that require at least one advanced degree as a requisite for employment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. My wife is a teacher in Massachusetts, and I work in Higher Ed. Sure, we make &quot;great money&quot; when you compare to Alabama or Mississippi or the like. But that does not equal &quot;great money&quot; in this area. We both have advanced degrees, plenty of years of experience, and low student loan debt. And we still cut it close every month. That is NOT great money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Both my wife and I are teachers, we have no student loan debt left, but do have a mortgage.  And even with our combined incomes, living in a suburb of Boston that gives us each a decent commute, it's not much.  We're hoping to start a family soon, and still haven't totally figured out where all the money for day care would come from when we (hopefully) have a little one.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My wife is a teacher.  We both graduated from a PA state college.  Teaching jobs are so coveted in PA, and they graduate so many teaching majors, that the only way to land one is to know someone.  It's nice in PA because the salary:cost of living proportion is very reasonable. 42k first year with ~700$/mo for 1BR apartment.</p>
<p>My wife wouldn't make it through a screening interview in PA. We moved to a high need teaching state (NoVA) where she was offered 46k/yr starting, but the rents for 1BR apartment are closer to 1100$/mo.  She was made to be the chair for 5th grade after her first year, but wasn't seen as a viable candidate in PA.</p>
<p>She pays 1,250$/mo in student loans, having spent all 4 years in state colleges, and even commuting for 1.5 years.</p>
<p>She has ~300 dollars to spend each month after paying for her student loans, gas, car payment and groceries. She spends a minimum of 9.5 hours a day at the school, then an additional 2-3 hours at home grading, doing report card comments, responding to parent emails, taking required night classes etc.</p>
<p>If I were to have any school debt, we wouldn't be able to afford living together.  If she was single, she wouldn't be able to afford to teach here.</p>
<p>There might have been a time where teacher pay let you live a middle class life, but if you weren't subsidized by the state to go to school, or your parents didn't save for your college, you're not doing any better than someone who skipped college all together. At least not for the 10 years it takes to pay off your debt.</p>
<p>2 years in and she's ready for a new occupation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>$1,250 / month seems extremely high for student loans, and this is coming from someone with over $60,000 in loans currently (my minimum payments amount to around $600/month). Has she tried applying for different repayment plans? Yes, you will pay more in interest most of the time, but at the cost of your sanity and being able to live somewhat comfortably I would say it is worth it. There are income based repayment plans that will certainly take into account her low income. Just a thought, it's possible you've already looked into all of this before, but as someone currently struggling with student debt I understand the struggle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She was in that golden zone of &quot;parent make too much money to get federal help&quot; and &quot;my parents didn't save for my college&quot;.</p>
<p>A year into our college careers the governor of PA reduced state funding by 20% and the tuition increased to compensate. Some of the interest rates on her private loans are straight usery - one at 11%, several at 9%. She had to defer payments for a few months after graduating and that's how we arrive here</p>
<p>This all just to go to state school to be a teacher in Pennsylvania.  It feels criminal.</p>
<p>I was in a more fortunate family situation, so it has helped offset and we live very middle class.  I know that if I didn't have that help, we'd be scraping by and probably ending the month in the red.</p></div>		</li>
