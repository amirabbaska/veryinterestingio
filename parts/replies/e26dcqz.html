<p>I totally get your point, but what government wants to run a sports team?  Or do you charge the team rent? Or what sort of incentive do you provide to the team to keep them there rather than move somewhere else that will give them a stadium? I guess you could just not have a team, but now your hurting unemployment, stagnating tourism.</p>

<p>If you seriously have a problem with that then you should have an issue with basically every high rise ever, power plants, dams, wind farms, electric company power lines, etc. Governments subsidize construction all the time. Mainly for the reasons I listed in my previous comment. These are projects that demonstrably add value to the area. Even if you put a middleman between the government and the consumer, it's still the  best system we've got. It's easier to take shots at sports than any of the others because, well, sports seems kinda trivial next to housing and basic utilities. </p>
<p>Ok, why shouldn't the governments run the high rises? Very valid question. The short answer is, they've tried, and they've failed miserably. I'll refer you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_housing_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">the wiki page</a> on attempts at that in the USA.</p>
<p>Also it's not like these are <em>exclusively</em> funded from tax money. The sports teams do have to put up hefty capital to show that they're serious. </p>
<p>I will concede one point to you though. The decline in popularity of professional sports is making this a less and less attractive program with each passing year. According to the wiki page on the subject, in 1990, subsidies worth $16.4 million a year would generate $24 million in additional tax revenue annually. But fast forward to today and you have a lot of economists hotly debating whether or not these programs will break even. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Take the view of an owner for a minute. Your peer 2 hrs away had the city pay for a new stadium. Your city won't pay, but another offers to pay instead. What's your play?</p>
<p>The cities probably shouldn't have to pay (in my view they definitely shouldn't be paying a dime) but they have to because other cities will, or have. </p></div>		</li>
