			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoops! I forgot to answer your bonus question!</p>
<p>As far as we can tell, the age of the Sun is about 4.6 billion years. This is about half-way through its total &quot;main-sequence&quot; lifetime of about 10 billion years. After that, the Sun will enter the red giant phase and be a red giant star for about 2 billion years. The Sun will then go through a brief period called the &quot;Helium fusion&quot; phase where the Sun is fusing helium in its core (unlike hydrogen which is what it fuses whilst on the main sequence). This phase will last about 500 million years, then the Sun will expand once more, evacuating the remnants of its outer layers, and leaving behind its core - the thing we call a white dwarf. That white dwarf will last a long, long time. It won't do anything but slowly cool down for billions of billions of billions of years. Eventually the Universe will be a dark place, full only of black holes and old, barely luminous white dwarfs.</p></div>		</li>

When last echoed calls of heresy had cried<br />

<p>When last planets twirled and danced about brazen stars<br />
When last a cold core all its light had supplied<br />

Then at last the universe had died</p>
<p>When last glowed a dying red light<br />
When last particles a myriad of sorts had flied<br />
When last witness fled, no eyes for their plight<br />
Then at last the universe had died</p>
<p>When last fell tale of victory was told<br />
When last of all trades had been plied<br />

When the last child played to have fun<br />

When the last two people regarded each other in despair<br />
When the last of all life on this Earth was dead<br />
When the last of anyone was there at all to care<br />
Then the lasting universe went on instead</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, humans are also part of the 'life' on this planet, so the earth might just evolve itself a much longer reprieve from its inevitable death.   </p>
<p>If humans are around for 500 million more years, we will very likely be capable of blocking 10% additional sunlight, as we please.  And if humans are not here, there might still be (1) artificial intelligence (2) alternate intelligence evolved independently or (3) aliens having travelled here (barring humans competing for all the fun stuff, earth does seem like a pretty neato planet to start a colony) . </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd like to think if we live that long, we'll be doing things that we wouldn't even be able to imagine right now.</p>
<p>Forget blocking 10% additional sunlight.  Just tunnel Earth through space time to a suitable sun somewhere else Or just move the Earth somewhere further out.  That's just boring though.</p>
<p>Why not be super mature as a species and just accept that the Earth has run its course and is going to die.  So why not go live somewhere else?  Why even a planet?  Seems a little unfair to terraform a planet that might some day support it's own native life.  Why even be a corporeal being anyway?  Why not encode out personalities into some vast Quantum Woo-Woo system so each of us can be our own self contained solipsistic gods if we wanted to.</p>
<p>So yeah.  500 Million years is a long time.  I would hope we'd be quite non-phased by the death of a single planet.  Even if it has sentimental value.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>About 600 million years from now C3 photosynthesis will stop working, followed by C4 about a billion years from now, because the Sun is gradually getting brighter, which causes the CO2 level in Earth's atmosphere to go down. When it gets too low, most plants and animals will become extinct and the planet's temperature will increase more quickly.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>why would you assume that defines its death? Jupiter and the outer planets will still orbit. Maybe the heat in the outer solar system will enable new life to evolve on the moons of jupiter or saturn, assuming it hasn't done so already? And, when the red giant collapses down to a white dwarf, why would it be dead then? There will still be energy being radiated? When the white dwarf collapses into a cold cinder (neutron star? Not sure if the sun is going there or not?) Is the solar system dead if planets are still orbiting around the cold dim remnant? When we're talking solar systems, what defines death? Is it when all movement ceases or sometime sooner, when the last living cell in the solar system dies away? What about those water bears that were released into orbit and are floating, desiccated and cold, waiting for the water and warmth to revive them?  </p></div>		</li>
