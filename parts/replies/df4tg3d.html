			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll never understand strict airline security. As long as we can brings phones and laptops with us, we have access to explosives, and any terrorist worth his salt shouldn't have much trouble getting access to Anti-Aircraft weapons. They say it's to make us feel more secure, but going through security on the second leg of a flight, raising the possibility of being stranded in a foreign airport, scares me more than the idea of falling out of the sky.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I grew up in the 80's and 90's during pre-9/11 and the days when you could show up just before your flight and still make it are over. Nowadays you have to show up 2-3 hours before because security is so tight.</p></div>		</li>
