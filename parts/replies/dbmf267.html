			<div class="markdown"><p>As a fairly avid photographer who owns multiple film cameras including a view camera, I can attest that 10 years ago? Maybe. Today? No, there's pretty much zero advantage to film other than it being fun. Maybe if you want a film-like look, are shooting video, don't have digital training, AND have no budget (all 4 things at once), then MAYBE you can come out ahead by buying cheaper up front stuff and sending it to a lab instead of buying and learning software. But everything it does can be digitally replicated these days.</p>
<p>It USED to have meaningful differences, not long ago. Better dynamic range (not anymore with high end digital), it has a sort of soft look (can be replicated now by algorithm), lasted a long time (nowadays digital storage will last long enough for better digital storage which will last long enough for better digital storage.....)</p></div>		</li>
