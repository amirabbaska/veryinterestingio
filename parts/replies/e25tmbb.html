			<div class="markdown"><p>Are those bro deals? I also live in LA, and $5/g is super cheap. If you want anything above their lowest quality offering it’s going to be $8-12/g, and that’s for medical, recreational is even more.</p></div>		</li>

They do have good stuff (B+) for $5. I have seen that price all over Hollywood, but that means you have go to....... Hollywood. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nice. I’ve actually heard there’s better deals in Hollywood, but then I’d have to drive farther. After the new tax imposed at the beginning of the year it’s like prices went up. The place I go covers tax on special days, which makes it feel like a bro deal, simply because they’re back to what they were last year.</p></div>		</li>
