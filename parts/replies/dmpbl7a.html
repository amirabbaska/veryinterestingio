<p>If that's the case a blue star might not be able to last long enough for intelligent life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but at that point we're talking microbial life tips before being snuffed out. Interesting from a scientific point but you'd need longer for the biodiversity of a planet that could sustain human settlers, if that's your goal, without bringing all their necessities in tow. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The death of a star is related to their size not luminosity. A star has to be about 8 times larger than the sun to achieve type 2 SN, which is generally what people picture (it can be less than 1.5x if there is a binary star system, creating a type 1a supernova). It has to be large enough that the core begins to create iron. At this point the balance between the outward force from the fusion and the inward gravitational pull falls out of equilibrium and the star begins to expand. As it expands the surface cools and we get a red giant. Finally the core can no longer fuse any material together, and without that outward force the star collapses on itself in a SN. The outer layers will explode outwards while the core will remain. Depending on the size of the star it could remain as a small white dwarf, a neutron star, or a black hole (there are subcategories but those are the three main options.)</p>
<p>Now could a blue star be large enough to eventually become a red giant and achieve SN? Yes, thank you people smarter than me below! A star 8x the mass of the sun can burn blue. </p>
<p>Edit: significantly overestimated how much larger a star had to be, thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A star only needs to be about 8 times heavier than the sun to go supernova at the end of its life. It is also about this mass that normal (main sequence) stars become noticeably blue. So yes, blue stars definitely go supernova.</p>
<p>You're right in your &quot;thousands of times larger&quot; in that stars swell to enormous proportions before going nova, but physical size is not the best way to measure stars. Even the Sun will eventually become a red giant and swell to more than a thousand times its current radius, but won't get all the way to iron.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The method of destruction doesn't really matter, even though our sun isn't big enough to go nova, it will expand large enough that earth will probably get eaten by it anyway. Of course, a nova would be more destructive to the solar system as a whole. But it's all about mass vs time. The larger the star, the faster it burns its fuel, the less lifespan it has, reducing the amount of time to allow life to form on planets in the habitable zone. Not to mention even if it did, the amount of time it would have to evolve before the star got hotter from burning fuel and subsequently entering its death throes, nova or otherwise would be much smaller as well. And everything in the universe is a war against time, except maybe at a black hole where time is both immediate and forever and makes no more sense lol. But that's a story for another day. </p></div>		</li>
