			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes the difference between both ears is what demonstrates spatial awareness. The full width we can perceive is about a seventh of a second delay between both ears. That said crosstalk is what we make of a &quot;shadow&quot; but intentional. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no scientist and I don't have hard numbers, but &quot;7th of a second&quot; seems way too long. The speed of sound is something like 300m/s, and the distance between two ears is like 0.2m. Maybe more like 7 <em>hundredths</em> of a second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>According to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_localization" target="_blank">wikipedia article on sound localization</a>, (how awesome there's an article for that!) our brains combine similar-volume-similar-frequency sounds up to around 35ms and can get basic location information even down to 1ms difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Youâ€™re right it is way too long. The largest inter aural time difference is on the order of 700 us (7/10000 a second), and the smallest difference we can perceive is on the order of 10 us. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have two ears, sound arrives at different times to them.</p>
<p>If a door slams to your right, your right ear hears it first, and your left ear gets it on a delay which tells your brain the sound was close.</p>
<p>When sound arrives from <em>very</em> far away, the sound wave is more spread out and arrives equally to both ears. If thunder booms on the horizon, both ears hear it at once.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hearing loss and tinnitus, both stronger in one ear than the other, make for an interesting -though annoying- interference to that. </p>
<p>For example: dropping money, and the good ear telling you it went one side while it actually went the other. Or sounds one is unable to tell if they come from the same room or further away, or if it's just the coincidence of a few different sounds piling up their soundwaves and &quot;creating&quot; a new sound that is not even actually there.</p>
<p>That's when one realises the human brain can build up some 3D awareness and mapping of its surrounding by the smallest cues and distinctions in the noises. And that not much can turn that 3D into 2D at times</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking the delay between the ears should be identical regardless of the distance of the source, though I suppose the attenuated quality of a distant source might make it so that the sound would 'fade in' and as such be more difficult to identify a difference between the ears.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>At longer distance the sound waves are more diffuse, like waves in a pond from a dropped rock. Echoes also makes it appear to have multiple sources. When the source is close you get a strong signal on one ear and then the other, when it's distant its a weaker signal that often won't get picked up on as rapidly. Once both ears picks up on it and your brain register that the sound heard on both sides belong together you notice it more clearly, even if one ear did indeed hear it first. Also, the difference in strength between the ears is more distinct close to the source. </p>
<p>TL;DR: loud close sounds are easier to judge the direction of.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No because one ear is further away from the sound, therefore sound takes longer to reach it. </p></div>		</li>
