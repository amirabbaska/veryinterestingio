			<div class="markdown"><p>This is probably because Ancestry does not have enough quality sequence data and ancestral history records to give as high a resolution as European regions. If you have a database with tens of thousands of genomes and associated ancestral records, you can narrow down someone's ancestry with much greater precision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides the problem with a small dataset, the Americas were the last continents to be settled by humans, which means that there's less genetic variation there when comparing with other populations (Africa has the highest), which makes it harder to distinguish between areas. Also, there are very few completely native populations left.</p></div>		</li>
