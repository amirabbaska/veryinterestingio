<p>No it is not. If the money only goes to the top 1%, then life is not getting better for everyone else.</p>
<p>I am not trying to make a political argument relating to trickle down economics, but conflating economic growth with 'life getting better' is not so simple. </p>
<p>Also, many people will find that life 'got better' when they worked less, despite earning more money. IIRC, Japan has a government which heavily pushes economic growth on its citizens, and many people there work long hours. But Japan also has a very high suicide rate.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's not really true, although it's very counterintuitive. If people were ok with a fixed standard of living, you'd be able to work something like ~15-20 hours a day. Keynes was famous for making the prediction that people would work less as productivity improved- turns out, for the most part, people would rather have more stuff (for now, anyway. perhaps it will change in the future)</p>

<p>Eh, it's still better than it was before (he didn't say life getting better for everyone). It's just not as good as if the gains were more equitable. 1% more free &quot;stuff&quot; for the rich is more or less strictly better than not getting that stuff, unless it causes social unrest.</p></div>		</li>
