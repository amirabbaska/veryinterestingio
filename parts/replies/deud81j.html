<p>Evolution ELI5 right there.  Even if weird things happen due to X that don't seem to make sense, if X is a net positive it will usually stay and spread.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah exactly. another way to think about it is that evolution takes the laziest option that works.</p>
<p>Would it be amazing if we could fly? Yeah, but being able to walk upright was the &quot;least&quot; effort we needed to survive so there was no point to push things further. </p>
<p>If over the next 5 million years, we're attacked by insects that jump higher and higher and kill is in a few bites, the people who jump the highest or stay away will survive to breed and we might gain &quot;flight&quot; naturally.</p>
<p>People who are smart enough to build containers or chemicals that keep the bugs out or kill them will also survive. </p>
<p>Evolution takes the laziest way out. In our case, it'll be option 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know you're simplifying but evolutionary theory is actually much more complex than this. Many features are not adaptations, but mere byproducts (&quot;spandrels&quot; as they're sometimes called). Other phenotypes are more complex: some genes encode both an adaptive and maladaptive trait simultaneously. For example, those with sickle cell anemia are also resistant to malaria.</p>
<p>This kind of casual simplified theorizing about evolutionary features is sometimes harmless, but it can also be very harmful, as when people say silly unscientific things about race or gender. So I think it's worth not simplifying too much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes sense. </p>
<p>I travel a lot in the wild, and almost every tick i find is due to me scratching an itch and then discovering a bump that i am not familiar with, which makes me check it  and find the tick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What may reinforce this idea is that you can scratch to the point of pain. So if you're scratching yourself for maintenance or defense (like removing dead cells or swatting off a blood sucker) the distinguishing threshold between those reasons and damage would then be the pain.</p></div>		</li>
