			<div class="markdown"><p>Good, now that we have the equation, we can actually answer the question. So all that's left is: How much immediate heat loss from a normally-heated, human will kill them? Also the surface area of the object, and the areas of the person that come in contact since we have weak spots...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quantum mechanics makes it more complicated.  In reality a particle will always at least have:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-point_energy</a></p>
<p>Furthermore, the classical idea that temperature is just the average kinetic energy falls apart a bit at low temperature when quantum need becomes more important.  Nothing that would affect the conclusion here though, which is just an order of magnitude estimate.  In reality REACHING absolute zero is forbidden by the third law of thermodynamics, so really we can only talk about a particle CLOSE to absolute zero, say nanokelvin or something</p></div>		</li>
