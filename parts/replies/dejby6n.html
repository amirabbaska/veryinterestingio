			<div class="markdown"><p>Because proteins are a biological polymer, with 20 different monomers and the order MUST be precise to fold and work correctly. If the protein misfolds it doesn't work, or even worse becomes a threat to your health.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are also organelles and other proteins that alter the protein after it is initially translated from RNA. This includes cleaving the protein, combining it with other proteins in a specific quaternary structure, adding specific carbohydrates to specific amino acids in the chain, adding certain metal ions, and more. More complicated than just the sequence of the amino acids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also important is the environment in which the protein folds. We are actually pretty decent about synthesizing the necessary RNA, but even if the amino acid sequence is perfect it's still hard to get it to fold into the perfect shape. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's just color and water, why is it hard to paint?</p>
<p>You know my truck's engine is mostly just plain iron...</p>
<p>This thirty story building is just iron and concrete... why would it be hard to make?</p>
<p>With all things it's not what it's made of. There are, after all, only a hundred and change elements in all of existence. And something like 98% of the human body is carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, or calcium, and nitrogen.</p>
<p>What it is, is the shape and placement.</p>
<p>So from the DNA up, you are a machine that turns sugar into atomic skyscrapers that make macro-scale skyscrapers look like Linkin Logsâ„¢.</p>
<p>Hemoglobin is made of more than 10,000 atoms. It exists to hold four iron atoms in an exact position so that they can link to oxygen atoms without deconstructing the O2 and the CO2 it carries. So ten thousand atoms to carry four molecules of O2/CO2 at at time.</p>
<p>Now that's in the red blood cells, but the 74 atoms in a cholesterol are no less amazing nor precisely placed for being able to carry oil around in that 95% water plasma without the oil and water separating like cheap salad dressing. And again, that oil is delivered unchanged when it finally arrives in the target cells.</p>
<p>So you are full of this incredibly precise machinery. And those machines build other machinery that, on the atomic scale, does just freaking amazing things. Things we have absolutely no idea how to do any other way. And a lot of that machinery floats around in the carefully constructed salt-water ocean that runs through your veins.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The chemical reactions to generate a protein require linking of the N and C elements in an amino acid backbone. </p>
<p>But each protein must also be folded perfectly for it to function. Sometimes, multiple chains intertwine to create the protein</p>
<p><a href="http://cbc.arizona.edu/classes/bioc462/462a/NOTES/Protein_Structure/Fig6_23aHbRibbon.GIF" target="_blank">This insane looking scribble</a> is Hemoglobin, the oxygen carrier in our blood. If your DNA is wrong, and replaces a <em>single</em> amino acid with the wrong one, or fold it incorrectly, that patient will have sickle cell anemia. (remember, DNA goes to RNA which is used to make protein)</p>
<p>and it's made of about 64,000 atoms, that make up 574 Amino Acids. And it's a relatively tiny protein.</p>
<p>Titin is a gigantic protein which makes your muscles &quot;springy&quot;. It's made of 33,000 amino acids, (around 3.7 million atoms) precisely folded. </p>
<p>Our bodies have extremely careful/precise machinery for creating, folding, and packaging proteins, then transporting them from place to place. </p>
<p>Proteins are really hard to make in a lab. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA" target="_blank">Here's how our body makes them in delicious detail, so you understand how hard this is to do in manufacturing</a> </p></div>		</li>
