<p>The cut off is to stop the terminals from providing current if the voltage is too low (to save space for self-discharge).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Fully discharged&quot; is just whatever the lower voltage cutoff of the cell is. With the right equipment, you can even discharge Li-ion cells into the negative potentials (I've done around -1.0V). You will permanently damage the cell, and it is unsafe, but it is possible.</p>
<p>What I'm saying here, is that discharging a cell to 3.5V is going to result in longer cycle life than 3.2V, the manufacturer chose 3.2V as the lower voltage cutoff as it maximizes capacity, while having acceptable cycle life. By limiting how much you discharge the cell in your phone, you will extend the useful life of your phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also note worthy is the charge rate. Fast charge is not optimal for battery life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Avoid ultra-fast charge. Charge Li-ion Energy Cells at less than 1C (below rated Ah); Power Cells are more rugged and can be charged and discharged at a higher rate. NiCd is the only battery that can be fast charged up to 70 percent SoC without adverse side-effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1C is your average 1-2 hour charger. 2C is typically considered fast-charge. I thought some devices used charging rates as high as 10C, but I can't find source. ultra-fast-charge?</p>
<p>Does anyone know what the distinction between &quot;li-ion energy cell&quot; and &quot;Power cell&quot; is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is indeed something that has been bugging me about the new &quot;quick charge&quot; fad, while this capability is nice if I need a quick top up, for the most part I just charge my phone when I sleep, as long as it charges at least at 0.2C then I am happy. (Edit: Dash charge is about 1-1.5C based on the graphs I've seen)</p>
<p>Energy cells are cells with high specific energy (Wh/kg), while power cells give up some specific energy for higher specific power (J/kg). The cells are classified by the cathode material used. The most common are:</p>
<p>Energy Cell: Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO), Lithium Nickel Manganese (NMC)<br />
Power Cell: Lithium Manganese Oxide (Spinel), Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP)</p>
<p>Phones use energy cells, as the currents required during use are quite low. Whereas electric cars and power tools are two common uses for power cells. </p></div>		</li>
