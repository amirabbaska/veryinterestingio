<p>Is the last frame just played for a shorter duration than the other 23?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you were to only watch a single second of video, yes. That last frame would be displayed for a shorter time. However if you were to keep watching, that frame would still get the same amount of time that the other frames got. It's 'time slot' just extends into the next second.</p>
<p>Basically every frame still gets the same amount of time, it's just that every frame gets 1/23.976th of a second rather than 1/24th. So it just takes 1.001 seconds to see a full 24 frames of video.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the best way to think of it is that all of the frames are played for a slightly <em>longer</em> than they normally would be. You still get a full 24 frames, but instead of getting them in 1 second, you get them in 1.001 second.</p></div>		</li>

Thank you for not being a tool about it; you totally had an opportunity there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That information is totally WRONG!</p>
<p>I guess people put it in those words to make a technically complex explanation understandable by a lay person, but it is wrong. Since this could cause a lot of confusion for someone who is studying to become an engineer or technician, let me put the correct explanation here.</p>
<p>The bandwidth that was available to use for color information is spread as gaps in the spectrum. Those gaps have always existed, they are there because the video signal is formed by multiples of the horizontal sync frequency, which was 15750 Hz in the old black and white TV standard. The color signal is transmitted by using a sub-carrier that's not a multiple of the horizontal frequency, so the modulated color signal will fit in the gaps left by the luminance signal.</p>
<p>However, the color signal is sent as phase modulation, because there are two separate signals that must be sent. We see color as a combination of three fundamental colors, so three separate signals. One of those signals is already there, in the form of luminance. The other two are sent by adding a color sub-carrier. The hue information is modulated in phase on that carrier and the color saturation information is modulated in amplitude on the same phase. With these three signals, brightness, hue, and amplitude, the TV can determine exactly which levels of red, green, and blue it must show.</p>
<p>Being a phase modulated signal means it would be susceptible to interference. The audio carrier, at 4.5 MHz, could cause a visible interference, because 4.5 MHz is not an exact multiple of 15750. This interference isn't perceptible on a black &amp; white TV, but it could appear as color bands on the screen. To avoid this, the frequency was shifted so that 4.5 MHz became an exact multiple of the horizontal frequency. The frame rate came as a consequence, because each frame is an exact number of horizontal lines.</p></div>		</li>
