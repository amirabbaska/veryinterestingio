			<div class="markdown"><p>A bunch of people thought they were being really clever and make Kevin Spacey jokes instead of trying to answer the question. Others thought they were being clever by telling the OP it's probably cancer. A bunch more just replied with &quot;OMG, I know exactly what you're talking about&quot;. Pretty standard &quot;I'm not actually going to answer the question&quot; stuff that we remove all the time, there just happens to be more of it here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Out of curiosity, does this subreddit allow for anecdotal answers or is it supposed to be more fact/profession driven? A doctor would certainly know more as to &quot;why&quot; a pre-sneeze feels light, but I wonder if someone with heavy allergies might also have some insight on the subject.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's fact driven, but you don't need to be an expert in the field to give an explanation. If you've learned some things from talking to your doctors about your heavy allergies, feel free to chime in. Just make sure you're providing an explanation and not an interesting anecdote.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely because OP is assuming that everyone has the same feeling as him when about to sneeze. I, for one, do not.</p></div>		</li>
