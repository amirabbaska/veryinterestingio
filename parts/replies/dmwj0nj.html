			<div class="markdown"><p>The way OP broke it down, it sounded pretty simple. Then I read the wiki.</p>
<p>Correcting deviations</p>
<p>To achieve the highest accuracy a number of corrections were applied to all distances calculated from simple trigonometry:</p>
<p>Curvature of the earth
The non spherical nature of the curvature of the earth
Gravitational influence of mountains on pendulums and plumb lines
RefractionHeight above sea level</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm good. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>K2 is actually a placeholder name from before they had found out the local names.
It is the 2nd mapped mountain in the Karakoram range.<br />
They found out what the locals called most mountains, but K2 was so remote that very few locals were even aware of it, so it had no local name.</p></div>		</li>
