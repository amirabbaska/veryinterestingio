			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, thanks for the in depth response. I appreciate your insight on this. Al Jazeera had some coverage on Tajikistan earlier this week and I admittedly had to look on a map to see where that even was. I stay up to date with current events via briefings at work (I am in the US military) and reading on my own time, but i know almost nothing of these three countries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing about these countries you mentioned is that they all have brutal dictators as leaders and that's half the reason they are so harsh towards Muslims and especially the more practicing ones who they fear could unite and start causing problems by demanding certain rights , and if one group rises up others might follow etc etc... and as such, radicals haven't been able to stay there  because they would get tortured to death as soon as they were identified and found so they went abroad. The Taliban/AQ had thousands of Uzbeks and Tajiks in their ranks and now ISIS does too, entire battalions  of central Asians even. They make up quite a large percentage of the foreign fighters total in ISIS and the guy who is possibly the &quot;minister of war&quot; for ISIS who's name is Gulmurod Khalimov was an ex special forces guy back in Tajikistan and served as a personal bodyguard for the President, trained by the USA, before he fled the country and joined ISIS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is, however, kind of a perversion of the ISIL brand of ISIS. At the end of the day, they only accept leadership from the Sultan, and only a male who is a direct heir to Mohommad is accepted. Therefore, there is kind of a racial/tribal bias against anyone who's not Sunni Arab. In the end, such an alliance is not sustainable until they fall back to the old Al Qaeda model of &quot;All Sunni Muslims let's get together and kill the westerners (and Jews) and kick them out&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tajikistan is absolutely marred by religious extremism, but internal struggles and a lack of access to the international community prevented it from looking the same as Afghanistan.</p>
<p>After independence, Tajikistan broke in to a civil war among the different ethnic/regional tribes. The resulting government has been in power and tightly holds on to that power, preventing a political opposition and restricting the population's religious outlets. The government has very strong secular and anti-muslim policies that have continued to enrage religious groups in Tajikistan.</p>
<p>The population is small enough that militant groups could not form as large as the Taliban in Afghanistan without leading immediately to another civil war. Instead, Tajik extremists have left the country to join other more established terrorist organizations including ISIS and the Taliban.</p>
<p>Tajikistan is definitely as susceptible to terrorism, but it lacks the international funding, domestic infrastructure, and population to resemble Afghanistan</p></div>		</li>

I'd like to clarify Uzbekistan part since I was born and grew up there. </p>
<p>During soviet rule Uzbeks only practiced islam after they retired (despite having a muslim identity). When the country became independent, Uzbekistan established diplomatic relationships with Saudi Arabia. When they visited our country, we were not islamic enough in their eyes. So they sent their wahhabism and it became popular in ferghana region which is surrounded by mountains and where population was more conservative even during soviet times.</p>
<p>Wahabism ideology spread among ferghana valley population and they suddenly wanted to establish khalifate in 1992. It scared the rest of the country who were secular/soviet atheist/career muslim/agnostic and knew very little about religion. The leaders of the country and the former president were ex communists (atheists) and didn't know how to deal with ferghana valley situation. So they went full Stalin on them. Anyone that escaped this purge started IMU organization in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Majority of Uzbeks are non-practicing muslims. Government and secular part of Uzbekistan is afraid of wahhabism. Only government approved Islam is allowed and whoever starts fully practicing Islam goes to jail. There are around 15 thousands muslims jailed in Uzbekistan as of today. It is a shitty situation created by Saudi interference. </p>
<p>So you have uzbeks with muslim identity and a little knowledge about islam, who are brainwashed by terrorist groups. Saudis are hated in our country for creating this mess  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know anything about IMU except what was shown on state controlled TV. I thank the NATO on behalf of my people for obliterating them. Many innocent people suffered when they were active in Afghanistan. We had to increase our defense budget, as they possessed threat to peace in our country. Now they are gone, we can invest more in infrastructure and education.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You don't believe you government is somewhat to blame by jailing 15000 people? Can you expand more on the Muslim-government relations?</p>
<p>I'm honestly curious and interested to hear more from your perspective </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You made a great post. I will also say that Taliban stood with and protected Al Quaeda after 9/11 because they made an agreement with them rather thn due to a cultural practice. The Taliban had conquered large parts of Afghanistan, but in 2001 were still engaged in a war with the Northern Alliance. The main leader of the northern Alliance and the biggest enemy of the Taliban in this war was Ahmad Shah Massoud. </p>
<p>Al Quaeda agreed to help the Taliban deal with their enemy, in exchange the Taliban would not give them up to the Americans and allow them to keep operating training bases in Taliban controlled territory. </p>
<p>On Sept 9th 2001, Al Quaeda assasinated Ahmad Shah Massoud by setting up a fake interview with him. Two guys posing as journalists
killed him by detonating a bomb hidden in a TV camera. With this move the biggest obstacle to the Taliban winning the war was removed. According to witnesses the fake journalists had insisted this interview take place before Sept 10th or it would be called off.</p>
<p>Two days later, 9/11 happened. It is no coincidence of the timing. Al Quaeda needed to ensure Mullah Omar of the Taliban would support Bin Laden and not give him up to the Americans. So they had to kill Massoud before 9/11 happened.</p>
<p>Massoud is known to have warned about Al Quaeda planning a major terrorist attack on US soil. In April 2001, he addressed the European Parliament and said his intelligence agents had discovered a major attack on America was imminent.</p>
<p>Here is an article from Sept 10, 2001 reporting this attack. NB Massoud died from his injuries a few days after the attack.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was no warlord in the Afghan Civil war without blood on their hands. </p>
<p>My point is that Al Quaeda killed Massoud to ensure that the Taliban would not give up Bin Laden after the Sept 11th attack. Due to this deal, the US had no choice but to invade if they wanted to get him. And many more lives were lost because of this deal.</p></div>		</li>
