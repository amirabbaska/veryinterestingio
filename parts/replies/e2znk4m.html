			<div class="markdown"><p>All sorts of things such as billions of ancestor behaviour contribute to underlying urges, but they're not an actual reason we do it, they're just what solidified the urge. I think people make the mistake of thinking for example that because something benefited ancestors in an evolutionary 'test', that's the 'reason' for that urge and it should only be done to achieve that, or that when we act out that urge we're just trying to achieve that. The urges and personal benefits are not tied to some inner logical goal for x, that benefit is just what made the urge remain, but the urge is its own unique thing which doesn't care about particular reasons, nor needs to be tied to them.</p>
<p>i.e. You don't want to fuck to preserve DNA, fucking was something which preserved DNA and so remained, but the urge is for its own sake, there's no inner logical goal set within you at some level.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn’t make sense to me.  When breastfeeding an infant the position changes with each feeding, right breast, left breast, baby on its left side and then on its right respectively. Some babies prefer the football hold.  Then there is the position where the mother is reclined and the baby is tummy to tummy on the mother while nursing.  Babies and toddlers will nurse in any crazy position, over the shoulder and upside down. I’m not making this up. Any mother who has nursed from infancy through toddler age will attest to this. </p>
<p>There really isn’t one consistent nursing position that would translate to head tilt in adult kissing. I’m not saying it’s wrong....I just truly don’t get it. </p></div>		</li>
