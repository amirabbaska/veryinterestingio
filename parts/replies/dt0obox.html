			<div class="markdown"><p>I’m aware. Point I was making is that you can treat dosage as adult when the “child” exceeds the normal parameters for weight at the given age. Even a hospital will treat them as a child at 17 and 270lbs, but give an exactly measured dose instead of a rounded dose an adult would get at the same weight.</p>
<p>Only drugs that need tightly controlled concentrations should follow that rule, but that goes for all patients regard of age.</p>
<p>The absurdity being highlighted was the intention of my post. They don’t give you the math to make per-kg dose judgements at home because people are idiots and even nurses give a patient weight in lbs instead of kgs (constantly).</p></div>		</li>
