			<div class="markdown"><p>There should also be differences in the chemical composition.</p>
<p>A cleaner meant to aid in cleaning deposits (water stains) isn't generally going to work so well when used to try to clean organic compounds (grease).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on the intended use but you're correct comparing water stains to grease. Water stains are caused by mineral deposits and they can be easily cleaned with any weak acid like vinegar or citric acid powder. But for grease you want a strong base like bleach which reacts with the glycerides and fats in the grease and through saponification turns them into a soapy residue that washes easily. </p>
<p>Bleach reacting with the oil in your skin and forming soap is why it feels slippery when you get bleach on your fingers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Grease cleaners are alkaline to chemically break the grease down, but it does not work particularly well against water scale (carbonates).<br />
Water stain/scale is easily dissolved by acids (carbonate + acid -&gt; water + carbon dioxide).<br />
Btw, if salts (the water stains) were really so easy to dissolve, they couldn't form in the first place! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I literally sat down to reddit with a coffee after cleaning bathroom and kitchen. The whole time in the bathroom was thinking like fuck me these products are amazing. Like 15 years ago the bathroom was a bitch of a elbow grease fest, had to scrub hard. Now it just melts right off. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Further question, my wife uses a lot of this stuff to clean the bathroom, is there any side effects from cleaning the bathroom on a daily basis ? The fumes sure get to your nose I must admit...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The main thing to be concerned about is to be careful using bleach based products to clean a toilet, and especially not to mix bleach and ammonia together. </p>
<p>Hydroxides react with ammonia and one of the substances created is gaseous chlorine gas which is deadly. The ammonia doesn't need to be a cleaning product like windex either. Sometimes there is enough ammonia from urine on a toilet to produce some. Ventilation is always suggested. </p>
<p>Personally I clean hard water stains with vinegar or powdered citric acid scrubbed into a paste and left to sit a few hours. I also use alcohol cleaners like lysol. I only use bleach in the kitchen and then only in low concentration to get rid of grease. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hey thank you for the reply. How do you &quot;transform&quot; the powdered citric acid into a paste ? Some powder, some water, shake a bit ?</p></div>		</li>
