			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is only right in parts. (most parts) </p>
<p>Sure, water escapes. What irks me is, that you say &quot;steam gets trapped and steam has less density...&quot;</p>
<p>It's not wrong, but imagine a pipe filled almost completely with water and it sinks. now let's (somehow) boil the water inside, so that steam forms. The total mass hasn't changed and the total volume hasn't changed. So the density is still the same and the pipe doesn't float all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Food begins to float because it loses part of its water content <strong>and</strong> it gets puffy because of trapped steam, i.e. it loses part of its mass <strong>and</strong> its volume increases. Since density is mass over volume, the density gets lower and as soon as it is lower than that of oil, the food floats, just like you said.</p>
<p>Sorry for being so pedantic, but I think that stressing that also the volume increases (while the mass decreases) is important.</p>
<p>Other than that, great explanation! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do a little bit, but the key with chips would be that they've lost some mass due to evaporation as well as the low-density steam still trapped in there buoying them up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's the steam that becomes water again, and the density of water is a lot <strong>lower</strong>, so it shrinks.</p>

<p>You meant higher, right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve also observed a ton of bubbles still attached to frying food.   Also tons of bubbles escape the bottom of the food, ride along the bottom surface before they can go past the food and go up.   Both of those factors would also help bring the food to the surface.  </p></div>		</li>
