			<div class="markdown"><p>We have an internal model constructed from experience that allows the brain to ascribe meaning to complex things quickly without having the reconstruct every feature of them. For example, think of a &quot;tree&quot; right now. What kind is it? A pine? A maple? Something else? Interesting, because I didn't say anything else besides &quot;tree&quot; but your brain immediately rendered something complex in your mind without needing to see every leave or nook and cranny in the bark, etc. I would imagine (ha) that in dreams, your brain is using this same internal model. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this: dreams will often mix and match. Which is why when describing a dream you have to say stuff like &quot;I was at my house, except it wasn't my house it was my elementary school.&quot; Your mind is interpreting the object you know to be your house along with the visuals and structure of the object you know to be your school. Dreams are hard to explain because your mind is just free associating with those models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly! The blended feelings are so strange... It seems reasonable to assume your dreams draw from the internal models. Sometimes they even play with and create new experiences by mixing models... A gun fight you've never been in, a fall you've never sustained. All practiced with models, no harm. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. And once an experience has been labeled and no longer being experienced, that's the end of the data. For instance, if I say &quot;look at that bookshelf, then look away. Now tell me how many books are on the top shelf&quot;. You won't be able to do it, because you haven't stored an image of the bookshelf. You will simply have stored some rough things like it's color, a 'small' number of shelves, 'many' small books on the top shelf, etc. and that's it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't render the plants, your brain just simply gets to say &quot;you are seeing a plant&quot;. </p>
<p>When you see an apple, for example, in real life, you know its an apple because the apple fits a set of patterns in your brain that also link to other sets of patterns that are related to the sight of an apple, like the word &quot;apple&quot;, the smell, memories and stories of apples you have. You got those patterns from past experiences. </p>
<p>When you dream about an apple, for whatever reason your brain triggered the &quot;pattern&quot; of the apple. Your brain doesn't have to render anything, because it doesn't have to prove anything, it has administrator access.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The assumption that a your mind would have to &quot;render&quot; a highly accurate simulation of an object to prove to itself that its seeing an object is assuming that there are two separate entities in your head when you dream, one that is trying to trick the other into believing a false reality.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doesn't your subconscious brain fool your conscious brain that the dream is real? Then if your conscious self figures out it is a dream, you can control the dream or have lucid dreams? Wouldn't that kind of be like two entities inside you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your subconscious brain processes are not separate or special compared to your conscious ones - they are just processes that have not risen to the level of consciousness. There is not a dichotomy between the two. Try sitting still and thinking about nothing. Thoughts will simply bubble up unbidden seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>There are several different ideas about why we dream, and not really a whole lot of science to back up any of them (there's some, but it's not like human-caused climate change levels of evidence by any means). One that I like just because it's interesting is that it's a way for our brain to prepare itself for situations that haven't happened yet by simulating a bunch of different variations on past experiences. There's a PBS NOVA special on dreams that talks about this and other ideas in greater depth.</p>
<p>Lucid dreaming is not a triumph of the conscious self over the unconscious that was trying to trick it. It's more like consciousness managing to show up somewhere where it is normally absent. There is a lot of neuroscientific evidence suggesting that consciousness itself is only our brain's way of making sense of things after they've happened. In a lucid dream, it feels like you're controlling the dream because it's not anchored to external stimuli that would normally stop you from flying or whatever. So once you become conscious in a dream, one way for consciousness to make sense of the insanity that it is experiencing is by interpreting it as control.</p>
<p>Question: who or what is this &quot;you&quot; that is controlling a dream in a lucid dream?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have had full visual hallucinations before. I'm talking about closing my eyes and seeing perfectly normal images of forests and cities, &quot;rendered&quot; to the tiniest blade of grass. I saw myself driving and I could move my hands normally and even stare at my palms which had every crease. My mind was completely blown and I could not believe that the human brain is capable of creating perfect images effortlessly. (For anyone wondering it was because of drug abuse)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sounds more like use than abuse.. and using it the right way! My guess would be lsd or mescaline. Though I've taken lsd and mdma at the same time and that was pretty magical too. However there's a fine line between the right amount and too much. </p></div>		</li>
