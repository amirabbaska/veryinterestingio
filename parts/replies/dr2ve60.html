<p>That's still way higher than the usual depths, isn't it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on your point of view. The Congo river is in excess of 2km across at some points and has a previously recorded peak discharge in the region of 65,000 cubic metres per second, then don't forget that localised scour from waterfalls and geological scour changes can also impact on the depth. </p>
<p>It is deep, but perhaps not as outlandish as it sounds. It is a fascinating river. Up until just 12 years ago there was a series of rapids that was deemed unnavigable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Didn't it improve from &quot;unnavigable&quot; to &quot;some guy in a kayak didn't die, once&quot;? I mean those rapids are still absolutely brutal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating river is under selling it.  The water moves so fast that there's divergent evolution in the some species of fish on either bank. That's amazing.  The congo is batshit crazy fascinating.   </p></div>		</li>

<p>Where exactly are/were there rapids, how far up the river?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's deep enough that fish populations along one bank may be evolutionarily divergent from fish on the opposite bank because the depth and flow in the middle of the channel act as a dispersal barrier.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that it's not the depth that caused the divergence, it's the speed of the current. From the article you posted some ways down... </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite I wouldn't say. There is some evidence to suggest the grand canyon was eroded through post glacial discharge after the collapse of the laurentide ice sheet.</p></div>		</li>
