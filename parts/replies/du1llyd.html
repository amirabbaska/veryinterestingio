			<div class="markdown"><p>This just made me think more or less for the lament (me), does angular momentum of each set of objects or groups of objects and the gravity of other sets with different angular momentum eventually pull each other closer to a plane because with enough time they just average out? </p>
<p>Second, is that because the gravity between the objects more easily  averages out the y-axis? (Rather than fighting their apparent centrifical force and orbit distances around saturn first, and ultimately falling into the planet?) </p>
<p>Last question, if Earth's moon was formed by something smashing into it and causing a bunch of expelled rock to orbit around Earth until it eventually collected together to become the moon (just the theory I've heard/seen animated), why doesn't that happen with Saturn's rings, or is that in the slow process of happening?</p></div>		</li>
