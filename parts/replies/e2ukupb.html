			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a dull 'blade' that vibrates and shakes out blackheads.</p>
<p>It's the safest way to remove them, as there's no pressure on the skin and there are no contraindications.</p>
<p>If it's REALLY impacted you might need more extreme measures to remove them, like a lancet (depending on what state you live in). This is a blade that punctures the opening and makes the blackhead easier to be squeezed out. You may have seen these on those Dr pimple popper videos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Clarisonic is the big name in ultrasound cleansing brushes -- there are inexpensive duplicates of it, but I can't vouch for them.</p>
<p>What I <em>can</em> vouch for is that my Clarisonic does wonders to gently exfoliate and clean, and my skin is softer and looks younger. I'm getting one for my mom for her birthday, and I recommend them highly. Note that they are pricey, but mine's gone five years with not a single issue. It's also great for getting off the last remnants of makeup at night.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I knew about Clarisonic brushes, but I never went for them because they are so pricey... however, your words are highly tempting. I just went to Clarisonic's site and saw that they have a summer sale on their face brushes! It's a great deal. Can I ask you which brushes you use, and which brushes you would recommend?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is really just like doctors saying you should never use ear buds to clean your ears otherwise you run the risk of impacted ear wax.</p>
<p>Everyone uses ear buds, everyone squeezes blackheads, and only a very small amount of people will ever develop a problem from doing either of those things. </p></div>		</li>
