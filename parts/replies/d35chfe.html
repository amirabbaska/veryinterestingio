			<div class="markdown"><p>Others are on the right path. It's more to do with the structure of the crystal than the individual atom to atom bonds.
The carbon atoms in a diamond are held in place extremely rigidly. If you imagine a perfect cube of diamond and nudge an atom in the middle, it will hardly budge. You could break that atom off, but it wouldn't flex much before doing so. This is because it is held in place by several strong bonds all around it. Imagine you are in a room with a ball, and this ball is tied  to opposite walls with rope. You could flex it up or down, or side to side, but try and pull it against the rope axially, and it wont budge. Now imagine a second ball tied to all four walls, and the roof and the floor. This second ball is like the diamond. (diamond carbon atoms only have four bonds rather than six, but you get the point)</p>
<p>If you look at something like iron instead, it may take a similar amount of force to break the atom off, but it will move around a lot more before doing so. (note for sticklers: it actually would take less force to break an iron atom off, but the point is it's more flexible)</p>
<p>Now imagine a sheet of glass balanced on top of an imperceptibly  tiny rock. If you put weight on top of the glass, all the weight supported only by the area near the rock. Since the weight is only supported by a small area, very few atom-atom bonds share the load, and the strength of those individual bonds is exceeded. The sheet cracks.
If you do the same with something more flexible, like a plate of steel, the sheet would deform down around the rock, allowing the load to be spread across many atomic bonds, and the sheet stays intact.</p>
<p>If you had a perfectly flat diamond disk and a press with perfectly flat surfaces, it would take a ridiculous amount of force to fracture it. But, since this is the real world, the surfaces are really only in contact at a few points, and the load is only distributed to a few carbon-carbon bonds.</p>
<p>TLDR: Material hardness is nice, it keeps individual atoms from getting broken off; but on a macro scale object, that same property causes loads to be concentrated in a small area.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Or, you could use frustrum-shaped diamonds so that they press on a smaller internal volume.  Diamond anvil presses are pretty awesome.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good question. Chemically, there's hardly any difference between the bonds in a diamond compared to those in carbon fibre. Both are simple carbon-carbon bonds. The difference is the 3-dimensional pattern in which they are arranged, so the answer must lie somewhere in there. A physicist can probably answer this better than a chemicist.</p>
<p>I'd <strong>speculate</strong> (meaning I don't actually have a clue, so proceed with caution) that the 3-dimensional grid pattern of bonds that give diamond its structure is both hard and easy to break because of its near perfect regularity. Because all atoms are very restricted in all directions and can't move, physical force gets passed along rather than absorbed (=turned into movement). In carbon fibre the atoms form strings rather than a grid, so a lot more movement is possible to absorb any incoming force. You can probably tell from my wording that physics was never really my cup of tea, but I hope the general idea isn't totally wrong.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemically there is a very large difference between the bonds in a diamond and those in carbon fibers. Diamond are sp3 hybridized where as CNT, Graphene, graphite, and buckyballs all all sp2 hybridized. There are a TON of differences that come with the change in hybridization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, this is correct. Toughness is the ability to withstand significant plastic deformation (i.e. breaking of bonds) before failure, which is not possible in the very rigid diamond structure. You start breaking a few bonds, you break them all.</p>
<p>Note that many metals also have a regular lattice structure, but metals in general are much tougher as metallic bonds are not as directional as the covalent bonds in diamond (which can be thought of as a large single molecule). Another reason that metals are tougher is that they're made up of many tiny crystals, as opposed to diamonds which are single crystals.</p>
<p>Oh, also, carbon fibres are generally made of graphitic planes, and not strings of carbon atoms. But other than that, you're mostly right: their toughness comes from the ability to have relative sliding of graphite sheets and the crack-deflecting abilities of the individual sheets, although they're not known for being particularly tough in any case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hardness correlates with tensile strength in many materials. Toughness is the amount of energy a material can absorb before failure (integral of stress-strain curve). A brittle material can have a high failure strength, but absorb very little energy and fracture before a softer material would.</p></div>		</li>
