			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd just like to point out that quads are among the most important muscle groups for the clean and jerk which is primarily a lower body exercise, despite appearances. This is not necessarily to suggest that muscle size is the only (or even primary) factor in his strength, but clearly this guys <em>does</em> have big muscles where he needs to be strongest (no doubt alongside excellent technique, genetics etc.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are a few anecdotal tests that I've seen, but really the best way would be to go to an exercise physiology lab at a university and have them do a muscle biopsy. It's expensive and not fun, they cut out a piece of your vastus lateralis and then they can calculate the percentage by running it through a centrifuge. </p></div>		</li>
