			<div class="markdown"><p>Glass tasting better than aluminum has been disproven in various blind taste tests.  Many craft brewers are switching to cans, they are cheaper and can be consumed in more places.  Also mobile canning is very efficient for smaller brewers.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well at that point your getting a lot more aroma effect from the glass, etc.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m not sure the difference draft makes, could be placebo but I agree that is my preference as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taste is a matter of opinion. Although this article is intriguing. Maybe it's more that bottling plants put higher quality sodas in glass because it sells better. (I don't drink beer)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt pressure had much to do with it, there are plenty of clear bottles of water with carbonation in Europe; and travelling around there I was always like, &quot;SON of a BITCH!&quot;  When I grabbed my water out of my pack and it exploded on me, on a train, or a mountain(where half goes shooting out and that was my water for the afternoon!).  I didn't like the taste much for most, but it kinda grew on me after a few months.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm canadian and don't drink carbonated water. That fact never crossed my mind. The plastic bottles here have less plastic than the lids do so I doubt it could hold up to the pressure of a warm beer.</p></div>		</li>
