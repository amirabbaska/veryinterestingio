			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not completely familiar with what a showrunner is because that sounds more like a television term and I work in digital.</p>
<p>Think about a producer like someone that gets stuff done so as an executive producer if I'm handling budgets and big picture work with a client such as distribution... I'm going to need a variety of producers depending on how large the show is in order to handle different departments and &quot;producing&quot; stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This can be true as well because an executive producer could just be handling cash and that would allow them to gain and executive producer credit.</p>
<p>There is also an interesting current term called associate producer and that someone that maybe did some form of random roll or possibly made a connection of some sort just something simple and gained the credit associate producer. There is no hard-and-fast rules to this and sometimes the credits can be like a gift or thanks</p></div>		</li>
