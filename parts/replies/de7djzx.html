			<div class="markdown"><p>I take it that it'd need to run on an isotope reactor like Curiosity, right? You're not going to be getting much sun under the cloud layer and any form of solar panel/wind turbine sort of power supply is moving parts for acid to get into.</p>
<p>So basically you need a material that doesn't even remotely soften at 500+C, isn't reactive with acid, is sturdy enough to survive the landing, and you need to make the probe solid enough that there's no internal air pockets to cause a pressure differential and crush the probe.</p>
<p>The other issue is locomotion. Wheels, tracks etc are all moving parts and weak points. You could probably get readings on the upper atmosphere by getting a probe into orbit of the planet then dropping mini-probes of a similar design to an RC drone into the atmosphere with testing equipment on it, as long as you either stay above the acid layer or only enter that layer as a suicide mission at the end of its usefulness.</p>
<p>On the surface though, moving is going to be a bit of a bitch.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's very little acid at the surface of Venus, mostly stays kilometers up in the atmosphere. If there was, acid proofing is reasonably easy. The hard thing to engineer against is temperature, (specifically computers and electronics) pressure is comparatively easy.</p>
<p>Wind power might work, but the &quot;wind&quot; is apparently a slow moving supercritical fluid, so I'm uncertain how well that would work. It wouldn't be much like wind power, almost like pulling power from a slow moving creek or river.</p>
<p>An RTG should work, though not very well. They use the temperature difference across a thermocouple to generate electricity, and that's a lot harder to maintain when it's already very hot. I think it's possible, but one would generate a lot less power than it would in space or on Mars. (The voyager RTG was 1273 K to 573 K, but the temperature on Venus is already ~730 K).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NASA has developed new materials that will allow electronics to function at much higher temperatures. It's still in the experimental stage but it could be viable in a few years.
Here is a popular mechanics article about it: <a href="http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/solar-system/a25099/nasa-develops-a-computer-chip-venus/" target="_blank">http://www.popularmechanics.com/space/solar-system/a25099/nasa-develops-a-computer-chip-venus/</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spent a few years getting to know some of the Venera folks as part of my space history research. They told me that the major factor limiting Venera's surface lifetime was heat. After a couple of hours or so, enough heat would have made its way to the lander's central core so as to overwhelm the electronics. Provided that high-temperature electronics are now available, I would say Yes - a Venus lander could indeed be made which is more tolerant of the Venusian surface environment than the Soviet Veneras.</p></div>		</li>
