			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right: Pressure and temperature activates Rhodopsin within the rods and cones of our photoreceptors, but &quot;Eigengrau&quot; is something different.</p>
<p>Eigengrau is the adaptation of every single photoreceptor within the eye to the presented wave spectrum (light), it happens quite fast (10 to 15s). Thats why photoreceptors can only see change, not constant pictures. If the &quot;light&quot; doesn't change the receptor fades to Eigengrau.</p>
<p>To avoid this sensation, mammals e. g. have an eye movement (slow and fast, both of them not concious) to vary the input of the receptors to avoid Eigengrau.</p>
<p>Birds like pidgeons move their complete head (like they are nodding) to avoid Eigengrau.</p>
<p>Frogs probably see nothing when they don't move - just Eigengrau. But so they can see changes like moving flies around them easily.    </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, pretty much the darkest your eyes will ever signal to your brain is a dark gray, but your brain can interpret this signal as being darker. In the case of that picture your brain interprets the vantablack face relative the the lighter objects around it and you perceive it as much darker than an eigengrau dark gray. </p>
<p>Eigengrau becomes easier to perceive in pitch black after your eyes have time to adjust (several minutes) but looking at that picture you should be able to see some slight shimmer of off-black which might be a slightly different effect...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I often notice this in pitch black. I spend a lot of time trying to describe the 'noise' that still exists no matter what. Very interesting. I'm under the impression that 'imagination' uses the same part of the brain that vision does so this possibly applies when I close my eyes and try to imagine just pure black and find it's impossible. Thanks for the post. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's hard to say what someone born blind &quot;sees&quot;, as their visual cortex may never have developed enough to &quot;see&quot;. However, the rhodopsin discussed above is in the eyes, so if someone lost their eyes (or had the nerve connection damaged) then they might &quot;see pure black&quot;. There may also be some visual &quot;noise&quot; generated in visual cortex (something like hypnagogic hallucinations) so it's hard to say.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Close one eye, and then try to see out of that eye. You will not percive anything, that's what blind people experience with both eyes.</p></div>		</li>
