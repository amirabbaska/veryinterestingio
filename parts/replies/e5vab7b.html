			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Paradox&quot; is often used to describe a situation that seems extremely unintuitive or nonsensical on basic analysis. For example, Zeno's Paradox. At least in the context of proper noun labels, it doesn't necessarily refer to a technical paradox (e.g. &quot;this sentence is false&quot;).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When at full draw, the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/igt2yU2.png" target="_blank">angle of deflection</a> is small. If the arrow was completely rigid, the angle of deflection would grow as the tension released and the string pushed the arrow forward. The arrow can't travel through the bow, but archers with enough skill could accurately and precisely aim the bow at the target and hit it. The arrow's contact with the bow when the string's released <a href="https://i.imgur.com/y6h5CNV.png" target="_blank">causes it to flex</a> around the bow entirely. </p>
<p>According to Wikipedia, which I'll admit isn't the best source, the phenomena was first discussed in 1859, so if by centuries you mean almost 2, then sure. I don't think it was fully understood until it could be reliably photographed. Bows and arrows more or less work the same regardless of whether or not you understand the mechanism. The oldest definitive evidence of the use of a bow and arrow is ~18,000 years ago. The mechanics might seem intuitive today because many topics that are common knowledge would've been considered science fiction 200 years ago</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I say understood, I meant the underlying mechanics. People knew things had certain properties and could behave certain ways well before we could record them.</p>
<p>Eg some consequences of general relativity weren't tested and recorded for decades after they were proposed (eg time dilation).</p>
<p>I just find it hard to believe the problem could be proposed and no one saw the obvious solution?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A paradox is not something that's inherently unexplainable. </p>
<p>A paradox is a statement that despite being seemingly based on a true premise leads to a contradictory or otherwise unacceptable conclusion. </p>
<p>The archers paradox is this: The arrow, when drawn is deflected to the left, and when released should be expected to continue in the direction it is pointed due to that deflection. Despite this the arrow travels forward from the bow and does not deflect to the side. </p>
<p>The paradox arises because of the expectation that the arrow acts like a rigid body, and in fact for a bad arrow it <em>will</em> act as a rigid body and <em>will</em> deflect. You resolve the paradox by re doing the analysis for a non rigid body</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think seeing the paradox may just depend upon on one’s familiarity with archery. I’ve never been near a bow, so I naively expect an arrow to fly straight. However, if I were to expect the whole setup, I might start wondering why it doesn’t veer off its course. </p></div>		</li>
