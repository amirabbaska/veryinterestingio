			<div class="markdown"><p>For reference though, since planes don't take off empty, the F-104 had a max takeoff weight of 14.5 tons, the F-15E, 40.5 tons, and the 747 about 450 tons. So the ratio still has the 747 with the smaller wings by ratio, but not by quite as much. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just those two things but they also require a purpose to fly too. And the weight associated with that purpose is likely pretty significant (much moreso than the pilot at least).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cant find numbers for the total footprint of these planes, what percentage of wing area to total body area would these planes have? </p>
<p>Also wing shape is important obviously, a jumbos wings are more effective at creating powerful lift and the f-104 is great for reduced drag and the f-15 is a feat of engineering I barely wrap my head around. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The body area isn’t particularly relevant to the performance of an aircraft. The thing that matters for limiting performance is the drag for the body. You could easily make the fuselage volume 10x bigger and if you reduce it’s drag you end up with higher performance. That’s why you’ll never see such a number. The ratio can be arbitrary and change with few consequences like with extended fuselage models.</p>
<p>The wing shape definitely plays a role in efficiency vs performance though. The F-104 had a comically inefficient wing. It was so thin that <a href="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8a68a20f38d41d01a5e46ebc47886fce-c" target="_blank">the leading edges</a> had the profile of a knife and needed protective covers on the ground.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A conventional round fuselage, such as the F-104 has, produces negligible lift, but the F-15's body actually does produce useful amounts of lift. The lifting body design is the reason an Israeli F-15 made it home despite having a wing sheared off almost at the root in a midair collision. The pilot didn't realize how much of the wing he'd lost until he landed, and McDonnell-Douglas engineers said it couldn't fly until they saw pictures. After some wind tunnel work, they found that the lifting body design was more effective than they thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was talking about the effective area of lift vs total area of aircraft then trying to work out how much force each wing generates, so basically the wings on the f-104 are more like fins on a surfboard. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was the F104-G, (for &quot;Germany&quot;). The Germans wanted an all-weather multi-role aircraft but bought a fairweather fighter with enough strapped to it to pretend otherwise. It killed a LOT of pilots...</p></div>		</li>
