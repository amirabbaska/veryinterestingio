<p>It's not a simple venturi effect, either, there are actually losses to the flow because nozzle like that creates a lot of turbulence, which quickly dissipates energy through viscous effects. This is useful, because the pressure stays low on the other side of the restriction, instead of recovering as it would for a venturi device.</p>

<p>I'm not totally convinced you need to cite the viscous losses here for that to work. You'll get flow recirculation in the corners but I see that more as a way of preserving a very thin shear layer of low pressure high speed flow passing past the sphere - <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3r1qc7/why_does_this_pingpong_pong_ball_get_sucked_in/cwkpt2l" target="_blank">I didn't draw the recirculation regions in my diagram here but of course they're there.</a>. I'd think you'd get the same effect for a wide range of Re without the need for losses present, but I'm open to argument there.</p>
<p>I think you can make a case for this being an inviscid phenomena.</p></div>		</li>
