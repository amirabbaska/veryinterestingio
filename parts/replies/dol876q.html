			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s not as simple as “replacing negative thoughts with the opposite.” CBT is more about training your brain to recognize maladaptive/bad thoughts and thought patterns and replace them with more realistic thoughts and thought patterns. So the guy-reaction of “I hate my life” doesn’t become “I love my life”. “I hate my life” becomes “do I really hate my life? Probably not. Then why am I thinking that? Because I’m sad because of [thing]. So actually, I don’t hate my life, I’m just unhappy about [thing].” Eventually it evolves from that chain into “I hate my life...no, actually, I don’t, I’m just unhappy about thing”, and eventually “I’m unhappy about thing.” It trains you to catch when you’re catastrophizing or blowing things out of proportion and bring it back to something more specific and realistic. </p>
<p>TL; DR: CBT isn’t taking a bad thought and replacing it with its opposite, it’s training you to recognize when your brain is being an asshole through shitty thought patterns and teaching you to question and refute those patterns. Eventually, instead of your brain being in the habit of thinking bad thoughts, it gets in the habit of questioning those bad thoughts. And after a while, you skip the questioning stage and go right to the “thinking better thoughts” stage. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>It's better to switch to a positive line of thinking, then follow the, &quot;Why was there a thought of I hate my life?&quot; line.</p>
<p>The reasoning is once that chain of questioning is followed, something is learned. However, switching to positive thoughts after doesn't have the positive neurological habit building benefits.  When positive thinking is replaced first the positive behavior is reinforced.</p>
<p>Technically, you can follow the negative chain first, and it will eventually work, but all you're doing is reinforcing negative thoughts for a while.  It will get worse before it gets better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s...not correct. Saying “I love my life” when you are thinking “I hate my life” doesn’t reinforce anything, because your brain knows you’re lying to yourself. It’s not like smiling when you’re sad to make yourself feel better. And it’s not what CBT is designed for. </p>
<p>Cognitive <em>behaviour</em> therapy is designed to change behavioural and thought <em>patterns</em>. It’s a process of teaching your brain a new way of thinking by going through the process step by step to help you understand why what you’re thinking is actually incorrect, not blindly reinforcing positive feelings. The point is to learn why your thought patterns are unreasonable and then proceed to “this is a more positive and realistic approach” to finish off the thought process. Straight up replacing “I hate my life” with “I love my life” doesn’t teach you anything. If anything, eventually the phrase “I love my life” will be associated with the negative feelings that are persisting despite the fact that you’re thinking what should be a happy thought, because just saying “I love my life” doesn’t do anything to address the negative thought itself. </p>
<p>Plus, it doesn’t get worse before it gets better. By the time you work through the logic - which is done through exercises with the support of a therapist first - you do feel better. Those positive feelings reinforce the whole process and encourage you to continue with it. The negative feelings aren’t reinforced by questioning them, because questioning isn’t a bad thing or a thing that causes negative thoughts. CBT teaches you to question those negative thoughts before you throw yourself into them, lessening the impact. Then you add the more positive and realistic conclusion, which reinforces the entire process and further reduces the impact of the negative feelings. And that way, you teach yourself new thought patterns.</p>
<p>Also, CBT works for a lot of disorders, not just depression. Anxiety has been successfully treated by CBT, and just thinking “I’m not anxious/nervous/etc.” does literally nothing to help the actual anxious feelings. What does help is asking “why am I anxious?” and proceeding from there. CBT teaches you to start that questioning process before the anxiety becomes overwhelming and you can’t think anymore, and lets you bring your anxiety down to a manageable level (if it was high) or maintain equilibrium to avoid a panic attack (if it was not overwhelming, but rising). If CBT was as easy as you described, everyone saying “everything is fine!” over and over would feel better, which is obviously not the case. </p>
<p>TL; DR: questioning doesn’t reinforce negative thoughts at all. The goal of CBT is to teach techniques and tools, not to blindly replace one thought with another. Replacing a “bad” thought with a “good” thought is more likely to just attach the bad feelings to the “good” thought rather than reinforce any positivity. </p>
