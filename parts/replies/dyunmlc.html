			<div class="markdown"><p>The coolest part is that cancer is more like domestic terrorism. They can radicalise normal cells, not to become them, but to support them. They turn your body's defences - like macrophages into tumour associated macrophages that feed them growth hormones. They hijack the surrounding environment and make cells create new blood vessels to support them. </p>
<p>Part of why pancreatic cancer (adenocarcinoma) is so deadly, is not the cancer itself, but through harnessing its environment, it can surround itself in a shell that prevents drugs from getting in. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Cancer is like any other organism on the planet. Everything wants to reproduce itself whatever way it can. Malignant cancerous cells are really good at that, by definition. They've slipped past their one predator, your immune system, and have developed a &quot;beneficial&quot; mutation that causes them to multiply out of control. Unfortunately for them, just like any other organism that multiplies too quickly, they outproduce their resource, your body, and kill you along with themselves. In the wild, cancer would probably weaken you until you get killed by some other disease or predator, so it's a pretty good analogue to religious extremists (cancerous cells) that weaken their own home country (home organism) and make it vulnerable to other countries (other organisms).</p></div>		</li>
