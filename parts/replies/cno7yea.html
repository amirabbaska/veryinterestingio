			<p>I live close to the Uwharrie Mountains in NC which I found quite humorous since these barely rolling hills are certainly not what I would consider &quot;mountains&quot;.  I assumed they were merely mountains by technical definition until I found out they once possibly peaked near 20,000 ft.  To see them in person now, closer to 1000 ft at their highest point really puts some things into perspective when contemplating time in general.<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwharrie_Mountains" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uwharrie_Mountains</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah.  I hiked around Uwharrie a few times, and it is not a mountainous region.</p>		</li>

			<p>Mount Olympus is by no means the tallest mountain on earth. What are you taking about? </p>		</li>

			<p>I know.  I accidentally typed Mount Olympus the entire time because I had just read about it.  Mount Everest.</p>		</li>
