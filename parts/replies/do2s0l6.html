			<div class="markdown"><p>A further Colorado twist is that if if you dig a hole in the ground (like a rock quarry) and it fills with groundwater and/or rainwater, you have to calculate how much water evaporates each month. You then have to “replenish” that water that was “stolen” from the people/companies that own superior water rights farther down the watershed. When I first heard about this, I envisioned that we had to bring in trucks of water and dump them into a stream, but apparently those superior water rights holders will also accept cash payments in lieu of water. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>what the fuck is the point of this? Is water that scarce? </p>
<p>And by this logic wouldn't there just be a chain of payments all the way downstream of whatever? To the state border? Whoever owns the land where the water either stops flowing downhill or enters another state gets all the money, right? Since everyone upstream is ultimately &quot;stealing&quot; from them?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are parts of the west - particularly, but not exclusively, the southwest - which are overpopulated in which existing fresh water sources are insufficient to support the population. Drought is also fairly common in the west and particularly the southwest, which can make water even more scarce. Water rationing isn't uncommon in states that live with these shortages. An easy visual of the demand for water over the supply is the Colorado River. It's so heavily divided and diverted to supply water to places like Phoenix and San Diego that it no longer reaches its outlet in the gulf of California. The top of Lake Mead (the man-made lake in Nevada created by the Hoover Dam) had fallen 130 feet since 2000 in 2010. It's crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that is part of why the state came after us...part of it was because the share of water we get from the creek was so small that a lot of it leaked out of the ditch or evaporated before it got to the lake, and the lake was allowing water to evaporate, so we were &quot;stealing&quot; water from the people downstream. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not one barrel of water per year, it's one or two barrels equaling up to 110 gallons at a time. You can collect as much water that flows into the barrels through your downspout year round as long as you're only storing it in your barrels. </p>
<p>Another rule is you only use the water outside. The result is, at least in theory, the water goes back into the system and everybody downstream still gets their water, albeit a little later.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well Im not in disagreement but it would certainly help out the locals if they could put out barrels and help feed their own gardens and such...it seems insane that it is illegal for me to catch water falling from the sky and store it. Now, if they were storing hundreds of thousands of gallons for their crops at the expense of others I could see somebody stepping in. But this is complete overkill. </p></div>		</li>
