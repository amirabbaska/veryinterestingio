<p>Compared to electricity, the answer is generally a &quot;no&quot;, since with electricity it's not really a technology limitation but rather just girth of the wire, insulation, heat tolerance, and stuff like that.</p>

<p>Not that this is wrong, rather for anyone who wants a deeper understanding, power lines rarely approach the point where they come to their physical limits. </p>
<p>On the power grid, line flows are limited to a what we call post-contingency or N-1 flows. When a powerline trips out of service the power it is carrying does not disappear, it redistributes over the rest of the network. We can calculated these redistributions and know the worst case scenario for any individual power line. To keep the system secure, we keep flows at the point where that worst case scenario will only load the line up to its actual physical limits and not exceed them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never meant to imply otherwise (I was talking about physical characteristics, and mostly of cables with plugs/receptacles, not static lines on pylons/poles). That's a separate sort of issue, and a similar sort of thing applies with internet traffic around the world as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, I'll mention that in Norway, and I'm guessing many other countries that have in recent years upgraded their infrastructure on a large scale; do in fact route fiber all the way to the modem of a household. I'm sure there's certain stretches that don't, and less populatedy, rural areas lag behind in general.</p>
<p>What we colloquially refer to as &quot;Copper cables&quot; are bottlenecks just by virtue of the medium. Electric signals travel slower than a pulse of light, and get congested with traffic much sooner. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, typical coaxial signals travel faster than fiber optic signals. Velocity of propagation in coax is 84%-ish the speed of light, in fiber it's closer to 70%, based on a refractive index of around 1.45 which IIRC is typical.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of fiber networks is that require far less active devices (amplifiers) and therefore generally far less maintenance and down time in general.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very true. I don't know much about coaxial, which is why I didn't explicitly mention it. I know it's used for short routing between houses and the distribution point, but in general degrades signals much more over greater distances.</p>
<p>It makes sense for short distance though. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that copper cables are slower not because of the transmission time within the cable, the difference has a minimal impact on speeds, but due to the fact that copper  cables are much more susceptible to noise and interference from the environment causing corruption of the data packets and therefore frequent retransmissions and slower speeds. Fiber optic cables have virtually zero (if at all) loss of signal or interference and therefore can provide a more reliable and direct route to the data center of the ISP leading to increased speeds.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking the cable visually looks the same since it's still almost always Ethernet (although some providers may provide it via a coaxial cable line), but it does have better noise isolation and other stuff improving the speed it can operate at.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is misleading.  Ethernet cables would <del>never</del> rarely be provided by an ISP, as the maximum range on that is about 100 meters.</p>
<p>Edit: A word to reduce confusion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is misleading.  The distance limitations you're referring to are related to Ethernet over UTP.  There are other physical layers with much greater distances.</p></div>		</li>
