			<div class="markdown"><p>At Panera bread they have these big bags of blue cheese. They're completely white until you beak it up a bit and open the bag. Almost immediately after being exposed to air you can start to see the mold form. What exactly is going on here?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the oxygen, the mold was always there but it is oxidizing and changing color. I cut some pretty large wheels of blue cheese and they are frequently clean white on the outside, with brown mold veins, as soon as one opens them up it begins to turn blue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah ok. So the mold can grow in a low oxygen environment. But then oxidizes and turns color in an oxygen rich setting. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good, question.  All molds produce toxins that inhibit bacterial growth, which is why we use it to preserve food. </p>
<p>There are a couple things going on here.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The toxins vary, the form of penicillin we use for antibiotic was originally a food mold, but likely produces a different form of the toxin.</p>
</li>
<li>When you eat food, it spends some time immersed in HCL in your stomach, which chemically changes any ingested toxins. Without the protective coating on the pill, it is likely very little reaches the blood stream.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since it is likely the two toxins are related, some immunity may be transferable, which is one reason taking the full course of antibiotics is necessary to insure no resistant bacteria survive. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer!  I have a follow up question if you donâ€™t mind.</p>
<p>In your second point, I think you are talking about antibiotics being enteric coated for intestine absorption.  Plenty of antibiotics (particularly for children) are given in a liquid suspension.  How would this change your explanation?</p></div>		</li>
