<p>I read somewhere recently that DNA begins to degrade after a few hundred years so how can these seeds germinate? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There's only two recorded incidents of seeds over 1,000 years old that have germinated. The 32,000 year old seeds were actually done by scientists who extracted embros, kinda like Jurassic Park style.</p>
<p>So, the short answer: seeds do decompose, degrade, and die.</p>
<p>Typical seeds have a &quot;half life&quot; depending upon variety, after X-number of years the germination rate will decrease by roughly half... There's studies done about how long seeds can naturally last at deep freeze - of course no one has tested this - but it's theorized some could last a thousand years under <em>perfect</em> storage.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As long as the money lasts.</p>
<p>The temperature inside is like -9 Celsius, and the seeds kept in strict conditions like individual packages of a few hundred seeds... You can find a lot of details with a google search.</p></div>		</li>
