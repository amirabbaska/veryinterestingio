			<div class="markdown"><p>Flying in Canada is a rip-off, but there are a few factors.</p>
<p>One is that Canada is very big, and very empty. Even if one discounts the basically empty north (there are more people within a kilometer of me, right now, than in all of Northern Canada) it's still a long country.</p>
<p>Another minor one is aviation fuel. It's more expensive in Canada than the USA (but cheaper than Europe).</p>
<p>Another is competition, there are really only two carriers (and a few smaller ones/upstarts) and they have the country pretty carved up. Also, their &quot;bidding&quot; system for tickets basically ensures that they'll have the same prices, which is collusion-without-collusion. This means the airlines can be incredibly profitable on our backs, because there's little regulation and even less competition. They have also successfully lobbied to keep out foreign competition, which is why American or European carriers don't do relatively busy hauls like Edmonton/Calgary - Toronto. </p>
<p>Lasty, and perhaps most importantly, landing fees at Canadian airports are &quot;user pay.&quot; That means that in the USA, airports are funded by taxes; in Canada they're funded by user payments. This means that landing fees in Canada are <em>at least</em> double that of the USA, sometimes more.</p>
<p>Add all those factors in and we have our shitty, expensive system. How to fix it? Many different opinions are out there, I always lean towards socialism, but that's just me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're also banning the new airline from getting rights at Pearson from what I've heard, so they're only flying out of Hamilton. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's all about competition, if there are several airlines flying that route, and there are plenty of customers, then the airlines can shave prices to steal market share.   If the route is much less traveled, or the destinations are smaller, then the airline jacks up prices to pay for the price shaving they do elsewhere.  </p>
<p>Flight from MCO to TPA (81 miles), leaving Monday/returning Friday is <strong>$432</strong> on Jet Blue.<br />
Flight from MCO to EWR(937 miles), leaving Monday/returning Friday is <strong>$234</strong> on Jet Blue.       </p>
<p>They are clearly subsidizing the tourist flights by jacking up the price of a flight that only a businessman would take.   Any tourist would probably rent a car and just drive the 81 miles from Orlando to Tampa.  Businessmen don't care as their company is paying for it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I live in Orlando, I grew up in Tampa Bay. It takes about 90 minutes to drive from downtown Tampa to downtown Orlando. To the theme parks it's less, since they're closer than downtown Orlando.</p>
<p>Plenty of tourists rent cars for their Orlando stay anyway, they should 100% drive from Tampa to Orlando if they need to make that trip.</p>
<p>Also, Busch Gardens/Adventure Island are in Tampa. If you have a Seaworld pass you may even be able to hop on their daily buses . . .</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not really a fair comparison or explanation, that 80 mile route probably takes a small plane and has fewer passengers = higher cost. It's not just miles</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe it's the lack of competition. How many airlines and flights can get you to London? Probably a lot. How man to Vancouver? Probably much less (especially within Canada).</p></div>		</li>
