			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, sloshing is also a problem.</p>
<p>When you accelerate in any direction the liquid will (relatively) move in the other direction. This can cause the vehicle to rollover - turning left all the liquid piles up on the right, plus centrifugal force, and you roll. This gets even worse if you change from left to right at a similar speed to the natural frequency of the water in the tank (e.g. at a roundabout).</p>
<p>The best shape for fighting this (generally) is a sphere - if you look at LNG cargo ships their containers are spheres. Again, that's annoying to transport -and forward/backward sloshing is less problematic in a truck so next best is a cylinder.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ooh! I can add to this! The 'sloshing' effect is called surge in the industry. Certain tanker trailers have bulkheads (sheets of metal inside that sort of separate the whole container into many smaller containers) to reduce the front-back surging. However, there are no side-side bulkheads, and you can only haul non-food grade stuff in those trailers (extra surfaces add difficulty to cleaning). This is also a main reason why you'll see (good) tanker drivers accelerate, slow down, and take turns very slowly. Surge is real, and it sucks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LNG use a sphere due to the pressure and safety. A cylinder tend to bend in the middle. This is why they add a retractable wheel in the middle, so they can aleviate the issue. With gas at such high pressure, designing a safe cylinder can become an issue, so what they will do is make a sphere, and optionally put several one behind the other. For fuel economy they may even add a cylinder over it of thin metal, this help to make it more aerodynamic, thru reducing the drag/friction when the truck is moving, thru using less fuel.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm not saying pressure and safety isn't an issue, just that sloshing is also a reason.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dont spheres have the largest volume to surface area ratio? Yes if you put spheres next to each other you cant pack effectively, but if you want to pack things <em>inside</em> a sphere (like the question suggests) spheres should be the best.
The rest sounded absolutely correct though, maybe im just confused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: Packing rectangles into a sphere is also uneffective but we are talking about fluids (that are not shape restricted) anyway. Fluids choose the highest volume/surface area ratio anyway to be able to achieve equillibrium with the ambient pressure. Thats why balloons are naturally circular, nothing is restricting them from being square, oh wait yes the ambient pressure is of course. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you're talking about truck transport, there are height limits. In the US that's 13'6&quot; without a special permit. The same can be said for width, 8' or 8'6&quot; depending on the state. You can't fit the same volume of liquid that is presently carried by cylinders in a sphere that fits on the road.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>...but volume to surface area is not an important metric for shipping/transport. Absolute volume is what they care about and thus  rectagles win. For gasses and liquids they savrifice volume to reduce forces. In the case of gasses, this has the side effect of up'ing the pressure they could carry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Kallus and Nazarov also applied the same logic to higher-dimensional space, where spheres still exist as mathematical objects, even though they are much more difficult to picture. The more dimensions, the more neighbours each sphere has. Surprisingly, adding dents now increased the amount of wasted space. The pair showed this was true for 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 24 dimensions.&quot; This might be the craziest thing ive heard. Maybe its my lack of completing calculus yet but i just cant grasp this. </p></div>		</li>
