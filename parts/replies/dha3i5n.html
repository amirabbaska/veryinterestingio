			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is that if you just 'like' the smell of tulips, that doesn't necessarily trigger the reward centers of the brain that sex and drugs would.<br />
For some reason or another, dispute how arbitrary it might seem to us, our brain rewards us for listening to music we enjoy, in a similar fashion as though we were using it to survive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is the simple explanation. When hearing music that you really, really enjoy, it can sometimes cause your brain to signal the nerves in your skin to do the &quot;goosebumps&quot; sensation.</p>
<p>I know this happens to me when I listen to songs that I really love and also know a lot about, like if there's some cool facts or trivia behind it, or something that I'd geek out over and blab a whole bunch of explanation about, I get all excited and feel tingles in the back of my head/scalp.</p></div>		</li>
