			<div class="markdown"><p>Funny story... I worked for a company that made electronics for the military and aerospace markets.  We had offices in the US, UK, Isreal, Canada, Romania, all over the place.  We bought up one company with offices in the southern US -- that belt of states that no one campaigns in because the outcome is a foregone conclusion, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>So we send one of our spec sheets about a product to the newly acquired office because the design team there was supposed to design an add-on board.  All of a sudden the VPs and executive team start getting angry e-mails and demands from the employees in the new office -- it seems our spec sheets had pinouts for connectors nicely labeled and for the sake of convenience diagrammed and designated the connectors to show where pin 1 was.  Of course, the diagrams also labeled to show if you were looking at the &quot;male&quot; or &quot;female&quot; end of the connector.  The angry e-mails and complaints were because only God had the right to designate things as male and female, and that the heathen design teams who sent them the spec were committing blasphemy by referring to connectors in such terms...</p>
<p>I think of that story whenever I see &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot; in reference to cables/connectors.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Be glad that the specifications did not include anything about &quot;Master&quot; and &quot;Slave&quot; components. That might have gotten a very different reaction in that region.</p>
<p>Apparently IDE HDDs with pin-selectors marked master and slave brought some real trouble once from people the state of California which had some very different sensibilities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha seriously, I'd think this would only be an issue in very trans friendly areas. Again, like California with the master/slave IDE drives. You'd think San Diego CA or Somerville MA would take issue with male/female, not the deep South! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I made myself a solution to that: I took a power strip, cut off most of the cord and attached a C13 connector to it. So now I have a power strip with Schukos (European plug) that I can provide power to using any local computer power cord. Saves me such much annoyance with power conversion things that I always fear are going to set the house ablaze. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But your home-made power conversion thing could also set a house ablaze - especially if you connect a grounded power strip to a non-grounded outlet, or if you plug an UPC into an outlet that doesn't supply enough amps. </p>
<p>I guess if you are educated on the topic, that's something a person <em>could</em> do, but I wouldn't recommend it to strangers on the Internet...</p></div>		</li>

A C13 is the female connector that the electricity 'comes out of'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Between US and China is a cakewalk tho, you don't even need an adapter. One thing that China did right is their crazy wall outlet. It has a bunch of holes that allows you to connect US, most European, South American, New Zealand, Australian, Japanese, and many others. </p>
<p>Hong Kong is another animal entirely. You need to get some wonky adapter because their outlet is crazy. The iPhones sold in HK don't get a nice sleek wall charger,  they come with this monstrosity. </p></div>		</li>

<p>As a warning for people who see this, this is true for most modern power supplies, especially of known brands. However, I was able to find a power supply on Amazon that still had a manual switch for selecting the input voltage, and could probably find one that was actually only 110V if I looked hard enough. It would still be a good idea to verify that your power supply is compatible if you move to a country with different grid voltage. </p></div>		</li>
