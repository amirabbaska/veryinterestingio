			<div class="markdown"><p>Liquid water is our first stage of understanding, next would be temperatures that allow proteins to retain their shape.  You can cook food and kill viruses and bacteria because these proteins will denature - and in fact do so before water boils, which is why the <em>typical</em> range starts to narrow beyond liquid water.</p>
<p>So first you would need another solvent, then you would need another type of molecule that can bind to form stable structures within that solvent, and so on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not life as we know it.  Supercritical water's solvent properties are very different than conventional liquid water.  For example, salts and very polar molecules tend not to be particularly soluble in it which is a ptoblem for life that is recognizably Earth-like.</p></div>		</li>
