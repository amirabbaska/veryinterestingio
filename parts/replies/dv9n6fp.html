			<div class="markdown"><p>Your bottom eyelid moves up slightly when you blink, but it's range of upward movement is far smaller than your top eyelids range of downward movement. What this means is that when you close your eyes, your lids meet somewhere below the horizontal centerline of your eyes. </p>
<p>To keep them fully and completely closed (with no gap between them) it takes just a little bit of conscious effort. When sleeping, meditating, or otherwise resting your eyes, you relax control of that little bit of conscious effort. This means that there may be the smallest bit of a gap between your upper and lower lids, because this is the naturally relaxed state of your eye lids. </p>
<p>When you are trying to sleep, it's of pretty paramount importance to block incoming visual signals, so your eyes compensate for this little gap at the bottom by rolling up behind the upper eye lid. </p>
<p>This is why sometimes when drifting in and out of sleep you can see blurry and distorted shapes of people and things moving in your room (provided there are people moving about around you, for instance if you're taking a nap on the couch in a house full of family or something). Your eyes move during sleep, but also your upper eyelid can sometimes tend open a little bit more than expected. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm going to go out a limb here and say you're bullshitting (unless you got a source)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a source. But I have noticed sometimes when I'm laying down in that in-between sort of sleep/awake state, my eyelids are not fully closed, and if I look downward, I can see. Also, I've seen it in my pets, and in countless videos of creatures sleeping (occasionally humans too). The top eyelids floats upward, but the eye is rolled up as well, causing you to see the whites of the eyes. </p>
<p>I guess my explanation isn't the physical explanation of the mechanisms by which this happens, but I do think it's an accurate description of the philosophy behind why it happens. </p>
<p>Its like describing the function of digestion. On one hand, you can say that the stomach breaks down food using acids and enzymes, into it's constituent molecules, which then are moved along the intestines by the action of the cilia, and are absorbed into the blood and transported to various organs for processing and use (of course, this explanation would require something akin to a textbook, and a plethora of science-y words, and descriptions of molecular interactions both within and outside of individual cells). </p>
<p>On the other hand, you could just say that the body uses organic matter to fuel it's various processes, and it does this using the digestive system. </p>
<p>My explanation is akin to that second one there....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I didn't know this was a thing. Never noticed mine doing it. In fact, sometimes when I close my eyes, like when trying to meditate, I feel like I have to consciously move my eyes to a comfortable position.</p></div>		</li>
