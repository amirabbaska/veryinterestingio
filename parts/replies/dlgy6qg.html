<p>It's still not 100% known what that advantage is. Could simply be easier to attract a mate.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. The bright light intolerance is because more light leaks through the iris, not coming through the pupil, so the additional light is unfocused and useless.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is wrong. There is no light comming through the iris, otherwise people with bright eyes would see worse in general. The melanin only protects deeper layers of the iris itself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The sun is not as bright</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Only for a portion of the year. A lot of the time during snowy periods, walking outside is like walking into a gigantic floodlight: white reflection from the snow, maybe some glare from high altitude clouds, depending on which way you're walking the lower angle of the sun might mean you're walking into sunlight for a lot longer periods of time than our equator-dwelling counterparts. I would make the case that the sun is as-bright, if not brighter in some cases, than in regions of people with more melanin. However, if it is true that lower incidence of melanin is an evolutionary reaction to less total yearly sunlight, then I guess there must be more to the story. </p></div>		</li>
