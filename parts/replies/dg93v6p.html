			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow that's a fascinating idea. Intelligence has generally been considered an advantage, since it improves the chances of survival (and in some species, of finding a mate). But I get your point. We are probably the first species (on earth) for which this is a possibility. I guess we'll have to wait a few hundred thousand years to find out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for your answer. I really don't know that it is an advantage, if you think about it.</p>
<p>Even on earth, we see one highly intelligent species.. out of 8.74 million estimated species (not to mention however many millions are already extinct).. one is highly intelligent to the point of manipulating its own evolution.</p>
<p>We'll see how it plays out</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it is important to note that all species are a result of their ancestors and do not just appear.  So, The fact that there is one conscious being out of eight or so million species is largely irrelevant.</p>
<p>To be clear, what I'm saying is that the rise of an intelligent being is not largely contingent on the quantity of species but rather on major events in climate history as well as extinction by predator.</p>
<p>The human species actually dwindled to about 2000 total at one point, and in my opinion that could easily have allowed for the rise of another being of similar intelligence over time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, given CRISPR technology, we could have a fully edited human genome in a matter of decades, not centuries, not millenia, certainly not 100's of thousands of millenia. I can't see us going to Mars without it. And certainly by the time we launch a colony ship to Trappist system there will be a solid turnkey black box to help us adapt our earth genetic database into a variety, a very wide variety, of Trappist friendly conditions. Pretty sure I would want my kids to have those new peroxide gills so they can breathe... And we'll have plenty of time to naturally evolve on the way there too. Let alone consolidate any enhancements. </p>
<p>And what of life in the Asteroid Belt? An inside out planet has way more surface area, and thus can support a much much larger population. Even w/o CRISPR, give we all the extra radar we will see a lot of divergence in the glitterbands population of 300 billion plus.</p>
<p>So I fully agree with scottesolomon this one. </p>
<p>We will go in every direction. And some will be stronger and stupider than we are now.  </p>
<p>They may settle this whole gender battle by making naturally hermaphroditic humans, or flipping gender with age, or eliminating it all together and reproducing by edited clone, or men get immortality via telemere extension (sorry ladies, need the nads for this) with their AI fembot life partners, and leave women to child-rearing edited clones in communal families, ie complete divergence of gender into two species. Some of these solutions will gratefully be far enough away from the others to hopefully stay alive when the others go down in flames. </p>
<p>We will no longer be a single species. Racism is a simple test case compared to this. If we continue to honor intelligence, identity, and diversity we might survive. if we continue to be stupid fearful and monocultural we will select for a goal down at the end of a one way dead end street.</p>
<p>Myself, I believe we will be forced to contend with this first here on earth bc of climate change. both adaptions to ourselves to survive new conditions and disease, and to natural world to essentially terraform earth in this obvious transition phase. We have already changed it, now we have to fix it before it flash apart. we must change ourselves to do this, how deep will it go?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thought, but if a species is intelligent enough to recognise that their intelligence could pose a threat, surely they would do something about it? Just the fact you even asked that question shows that we might just be smart enough to solve that problem before it's too late :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but the issue in my mind is the law of unknown consequences. For example, use of fossil fuels may have put us on a path of global extinction. We've been using fossil fuels for at least a couple centuries and we're only now beginning to understand the risk.. is it too late? Who knows.</p>
<p>Imagine if we start altering the genetic code without fully understanding the implications of what we're doing.</p>
<p>or even something like the ability to design our offspring.</p>
<p>I've read where we are creating more children with life threatening allergies because they are not being exposed to dust and dirt and things like that in childhood but rather raised in basically sterile environments... Could things like that have a negative effect on the viability of the species?</p>
<p>I think it could. The one thing that spares us however is that much of the human population in the world is still basically &quot;wild&quot; subject to natural selection. But that could quickly change as technology spreads.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean with &quot;interfere with natural selection&quot;? Natural selection is blind and takes millions of years to bring forth adaptions, which can be achieved within decades with cultural and technological progress.</p>
<p>Intelligence itself is certainly not a disadvantage, but a large brain can be.</p>
<p>That's why some animals have gotten dumber, some even lost most of their brain, in their evolutionary history. The same way some cave dwelling fish lost their eyes.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Let me give you a very basic example. Man-made vaccination.  That may protect us against one form of infection, but that may simply mean that weaker genes get passed on that would not have if it wasn't for the vaccination... .so at some point in the future, another virus comes along and wipes out a larger chunk of humanity than it would have, etc... </p>
<p>Also, the very fact that mankind understands natural selection and may be inclined to attempt to manipulate it through genetic design, etc, could be very dangerous.. especially if there are unintended consequences</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Genes aren't 'weak' or 'strong'. They just come in many variants (called alleles). The more variants exist, the more likely that some of the population can resist a given disease. This is a good thing.</p></div>		</li>
