			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes me sad because there is so much in the universe that we will never know. There are probably an unimaginable number of life forms, knowledge,  technology, etc that will never be known by the human race. It's soul crushing to know that not only am I insignificant but my entire galaxy is as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something that makes me sad about this is that even though we don't have a complete understanding of the universe, civilizations could arise in the far future for whom it would be impossible to have the amount of information we have.</p>
<p>It might be that they never reach our understanding of the universe, not to mention surpass it, not because of lack of trying but simply because a lot of our knowledge will be unobtainable to them. </p>
<p>The universe will grow darker in more ways than one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If the universe is infinite, then this isn't the &quot;extent&quot; of the universe, it's the proportion of it's expansion since T0</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More precisely the CMB is from the recombination / photon decoupling epoch, when the universe cooled enough to become transparent to light. Before that point photons were constantly scattering off of free ions and electrons, so we can't see all the way back to T0.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This implies that there exists some point in time (far in our past) that is the most-recent moment we'll ever be able to see in that galaxy. Or in other words, if we <em>did</em> wait and watch for an extremely long time, eventually we'd see the last light that that galaxy emitted before it crossed the CEH.</p>
<p>Does the expansion of the universe work out such that we approach that moment asymptotically (i.e. we would see the light get redder and redder until its wavelength was infinitely long and it faded slowly from view) or linearly (i.e. we would see the light get redder, but at some point in the future the galaxy just goes <em>poof</em> and quietly disappears from our telescopes?</p>
<p>About how long would we have to watch to see this happen? Are there any known galaxies out there which are close to this time (that is: which crossed the CEH long ago and whose last visible light is about to reach us)??</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Looks like the further the galaxy the slower it's time for us as we see. So in the end furthest galaxies will be just frozen in time, and we will be seeing them forever.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The first thing that this will happen to is the CMB itself, followed by the galaxies nearest it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is confusing to me, in the context of nothing being on the edge of the universe because it's expanding everywhere.  How can something be closer to the CMB than anything else?</p>
<p>Am I thinking about it wrong?  Maybe if we see galaxy X very close to CMB, and galaxy X observes us at the same time, they'll see us as also close to their view of CMB?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the CMB is if at some point in time in the distant past, every point in space emitted light in every direction.</p>
<p>Then to us, at any given moment in time, what we see as the CMB is all the points around us at a certain distance such that this light is finally reaching us.  Assuming a simplistic, static and infinite universe, this would be a sphere around us increasing its radius at the speed of light.</p>
<p>A galaxy we would see as &quot;close&quot; to this ever-moving CMB is something much closer to the &quot;edge&quot; of our observable universe than it is to us.  And, yes, folk in that galaxy would have their own observable universe sphere.  To them, we would be close to the their view of the CMB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also find it difficult to understand. After the big bang, everything was in that &quot;particle-soup&quot; and was relatively close to each other. How did we get so far away so quickly, that we can now see the CMB coming from that same event we were participants in?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>so quickly  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's been almost 14 billion years.</p>
<p>At 14 billion light years away from us, space is expanding faster than the speed of light.  One way to think of this is as a spreadsheet.  Open one (excel, google sheets, whatever).  Select all cells, and then drag one of the columns so that it's a tiny bit bigger.  Think of that tiny bit as how fast the universe is expanding at every point, which is a tiny amount.  Column C moved a little bit further from Column A.  But Column F moved very far from Column A.  Column Z is holy crap far from Column A.</p>
<p>The universe, at some distance, expands faster than the speed of light because it's expanding everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. Because the further we look out into the universe the younger that part of the universe seems to us (because of the travel time of the light that reaches us). So in that sense, looking at the farthest galaxies is looking at galaxies formed not long after the cosmic microwave background, which is at almost the same &quot;distance&quot;. </p>
<p>At least that is how I understand it. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.</p></div>		</li>
