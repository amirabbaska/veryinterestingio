			<div class="markdown"><p>Saltwater fish are almost exclusively caught, not bred. Only a couple species have been successfully bred at any scale, and only recently. Offhand, clownfish (Nemo) are the only one I can think of that are commonly captive bred.</p>
<p>This is the main environmental problem with saltwater tanks: most of what's caught doesn't survive. It can be very hard on reefs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the majority of saltwater aquarium fish are wild caught, but you're incorrect about the scale and timeline of saltwater captive breeding operations. The first commercial saltwater breeder to turn a profit was C-quest back in the early 90s. Unfortunately their facilities were destroyed by a hurricane (Bertha?) not too much later, but they are still around.</p>
<p>We have two other major breeders in the US, <a href="http://www.orafarm.com/" target="_blank">ORA</a> and <a href="http://sustainableaquatics.com/" target="_blank">Sustainable Aquatics.</a> Both breed multiple species of anemone fish as their bread and butter, but they both breed a number of other aquarium species from an assortment of families. If you're in the hobby, you've probably seen these fish offered for sale and didn't even know they're tank raised. There are also a number of other smaller scale commercial breeders domestically, not to mention private hobbyist who breed fish for fun and/or profit. </p>
<p>And that's just what's going on in the US. I know there are big commercial breeders in Asia, but I don't know too much about them.</p>
<p>Oh, and <a href="https://reefbuilders.com/2016/07/20/captive-bred-blue-tang/#" target="_blank">this</a> is encouraging as hell for the future of the hobby.</p></div>		</li>

<p>is relatively recently. The context is selective breeding.</p>
<p>I don't disagree with what you've said.</p>
<p>I have an ORA Ocellaris pair in my tank, trade frags and most the corals are from frags. Most of my live rock is homemade (cement, rock salt, and time).</p>
<p>You've taken my comment a bit farther than I intended. &quot;The largest problem&quot; is solvable and improving, but still something many are not aware of. Certainly not an inditement of a hobby of mine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't completely true. The majority of people who own saltwater and reef tanks realize there is an issue with reef destruction caused by the pet trade.  I would say a decent amount of fish used in the hobby come from breeders. This may have been the case 15-20 years ago, but now there a plenty of groups out there who are dedicated to breeding fish in captivity.  You can check out ORA, probably the most notable of them all.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.orafarm.com/about/ora/" target="_blank">http://www.orafarm.com/about/ora/</a></p>
<p>The majority of corals are also grown in captivity or are maricultered.  See LiveAquaria.com's definition &quot;Maricultured Corals are propagated overseas and grown out in shallow protected lagoons or in outdoor raceways using natural sunlight and ocean water. They have been held in our facility for two weeks to ensure they will maintain their color in captive conditions.&quot; </p>
<p>But you are correct, very few fish caught in the wild make it to the fish store, and those that do stand a chance of catching disease from weak immune systems caused by high stress. I try to practice sustainability with my tank by buying captive bred fish, and corals that have been propagated by other hobbyists.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What /u/lazyanachronist says is most certainly true. There are only a few captive bred marine species in fish stores, the rest are wild caught. And those you see are only a small fraction of the fish that are caught. A SMALL fraction. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just selection bias.  If you take the most colorful fish from salt water, and the most colorful fish from fresh water, you're going to be much more impressed by the salt water selection. </p>
<p>Granted there are colorful fresh water fish like tetra and chichlids.. but they don't compare to what you would see in an average salt water aquarium.</p></div>		</li>

<p>When I was a kid, I introduced tiny oscar into my tank of neon tetras and guppies. In not too long, they had all disappeared. Then I got a much large angel fish, thinking it could at least fend for itself. That turned out to be false.</p>
<p>Finally, the pet store suggested if i wanted another fish I should get a Jack Dempsey, so I got a small Dempsey. The oscar started getting its fins nibbled off, and one morning I found it on the floor beside the tank. I assume it tried to jump out of the tank to get safe from the Jack Dempsey.</p>
<p>After that, the tank was just the Jack Dempsey and a blue channel catfish that only came out out when it was safe at night.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: don't mix tetras and cichlids. Also, don't mix cichlids and cichlids </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can mix the right tetras and cichlids.  Discus live just fine with cardinals, serpaes, etc.   Something called a Jack Dempsey doesn't live with much unless it is channel cat tough! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of those answers on r/science that's just sciency enough to not be recognized as &quot;not science&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyone can surmise that the answer &quot;may be&quot; a matter of a selection bias. Anyone can speculate that we have a certain impression because saltwater fish have been bred in captivity...</p>
<p>After stringing those things together, you finish with a definitive statement. &quot;So you end up with...&quot;</p>
<p>It seems to me that it's not the flagrant freestyling that's the problem in our thinking, so much as the way we plausibly speculate our way to a certainty â€” exactly as you've done here, and have been voted to the top of this page.</p></div>		</li>
