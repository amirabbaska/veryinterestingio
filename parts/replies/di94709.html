			<div class="markdown"><p>They are unified. You can always use Einstein physics for all problems, it would just make the calculations unnecessarily difficult. </p>
<p>Most of the terms associated with relativity would simply drop out for the types of velocities and masses we see in our solar system. Then, it would simplify essentially down to Newtons laws. </p>
<p>All of this assumes that you can equate very small values to zero, as opposed to carrying them through the calculations for minimal increase in accuracy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From my very basic understanding is that relativity and quantum physics, not Newtonian physics are the two that aren't unified. That's Bohr, Heisenberg, Feynman territory.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Note: the spookiness is on our minds, not in the physics. It isn't physics that is crazily being a complex-valued probability wave, it's just doing it. We are the ones with the crazy idea that real things should ever act like solid things bouncing off each other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Either very small or very fast.  I'm a chemist and the gas laws are much like this.  You just use ideal law for almost everything because it is, as our friends in engineering would say, close enough.  That is, until you get to VERY LOW temperatures or VERY HIGH pressures.</p>
<p>Same sort of rules apply here: Still part of a larger system but the calculations are superfluous unless certain criteria are met.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IIUC, Newtonian physics is an approximation which produces virtually identical predictions to Einsteinian physics <em>for certain phenomena</em> (like those observed in our solar system) but is wildly inaccurate for other (relativistic) phenomena.</p>
<p>So they aren't &quot;unified&quot;. One is just a coarser, often handy approximation of the other.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are unified in the sense that Newtonian physics is a strict subset of Einsteinian physics, i.e. the set union of the two is Einsteinian physics.</p>
<p>What <em>isn't</em> unified is Einsteinian physics and quantum mechanics. Taking the union of the two yields a contradictory (i.e. impossible) result. Some as-yet-to-be-discovered physics is the strict superset of both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think of it this way:
Newton seems perfectly accurate if you assume that space is has a constant shape. Relativity is all about bending space, so if your measurements need to be so precise to the point that space itself is becoming an issue, use Relativity. </p>
<p>It's like the trampoline analogy for Gravity. Most of the time the individual fibers are a straight line, and a rubber ball falling on it doesn't change that enough to matter too much. If a bowling ball bounces across it you now need to account for the fibers bending under it to understand its path.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you're saying the real world is described as Newtonian physics + X, where X is relativity etc, and this is always the case, but in most everyday scenarios, X is close enough to 0 that we can safely ignore it? And  at the quantum scale, even the Newtonian part of the equation is so small, that the near 0 value of X is actually pretty significant?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Newtonian physics is an approximation of general relativity for large distances and slow motion.</p>
<p>Newtonian physics is an approximation of quantum mechanics for large momentum.</p>
<p>General relativity and quantum mechanics are expected to be an approximation of a universal theory that we don't know yet.</p>
<p>It is not &quot;Newtonian+x&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All of these effects (relativistic, quantistic, you name it) are <em>ALWAYS</em> in play all the time, no matter of scale, although some have a pretty insignificant influence outside certain conditions (atomic scale, approaching lightspeed, proximity of a significant space-time warping mass).</p>
<p>We just don't have a single theory effectively describing the situation. We have 3-4 theories which only work on their separate &quot;environments&quot; and completely break otherwise.</p>
<p>We know very well they're imperfect - but this is all we have for now, and have managed to build pretty amazing stuff with them. Very smart people have been working for many many years on the so called GUT (Grand Unified Theory) - </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually we have exactly two (rather than 3-4) accepted theories that don't overlap: Quantum Field Theory/the Standard Model and General Relativity. Every other significant* theory of physics has been merged into these.</p>
<p>Newtonian or classical physics (and special relativity) can be derived as an approximation of either one, so they meet in the middle nicely, but we aren't yet sure how to get from QFT to GR or vice versa.</p>
<p>There are a few more open questions in physics (hierarchy problem, standard model free parameters, ..) but those aren't a problem of merging two conflicting theories to make a GUT.</p>
<p>* There are of course untested, not widely accepted, or plain wrong theories floating around too. Some of them which do explain QFT and GR are the candidates for GUT like string theory and loop quantum gravity, but they haven't been fully developed or tested yet.</p></div>		</li>
