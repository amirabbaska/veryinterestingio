			<div class="markdown"><p>I have anxiety, though I'm unsure as to what degree.  I like to think of possibilities of anything and everything happening to prepare myself.  That includes jumping off a cliff.  There are times when I feel scared too.</p>
<p>Compared to my more level-headed buddies, I think they just soak up the fun instead of contemplating things.  They're more confident and outgoing or at least I don't think they worry so as much as me.</p>
<p>I also like to experiment - I'm a curious person and my career as a programmer enforces this mindset.  I like to know how things work, and at times, I like to explore my own conscience, sometimes seeing where the boundaries are.  And yet there are times when I feel too fearful to do something logical.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what your mindset is like, but hopefully this can shed some light.</p>
<p>Also this guy talks about this more:

			<div class="markdown"><p>This happens to me sometimes too.  I'm not a psychologist or anything but I always thought it was some combination of: 1. Having to think about the extreme just to remember that it's an option (which I would normally ignore to the point of possibly forgetting), and having to think about how to do it so I can be sure to not actually do it; 2. Ruminating on how long it takes to build or create anything and how fast it can be destroyed; 3. Interest in doing something powerful and exciting, even if negative, when I would normally just be doing something boring like not jumping (I call this the desire for drama). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I too, am not suicidal. I don't think this feeling is common at all, but rather, people talk about it, and you hear about it occasionally enough to think it is common. It's like bisexuality. A lot of us hear about it a lot, and think it is pretty common, but Psychology tells us there's what, a 1% bisexuality rate in the population?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You misunderstand.  It's not a suicidal impulse.  It has nothing to do with your happiness or desire to live.  It's just a bizarre subconscious impulse with no apparent rationality.</p>
<p>I'm afraid of heights.  I'm not suicidal.  But when I'm in certain height-related situations, I'll have this momentary subconscious thought of jumping.  It's not as if my mind is saying &quot;Jump!  Kill yourself!&quot;  It's not a conscious debate like that.  It's not about trying to end your life.  It's just as a strange primal notion of &quot;What if I jump?&quot;  Which is of course immediately answered with &quot;Then I'll die, idiot.  Back up.&quot;  But in the few brief moments in between those thoughts, it's like your mind starts playing out the events and you have an almost out-of-body experience where you imagine yourself leaping over the edge.</p>
<p>It's strange.  I always thought these were examples of Intrusive Thoughts though.  Am I wrong?</p>
<p>If I had to guess, I'd say it's a sort of protection system built into your mind.  By playing out the impulse in your mind, you're able to &quot;experience&quot; the end result without actually doing it -- thus, you're able to envision the consequences and thus avoid taking the action.  I get this same notion with fire alarm pull stations.  Whenever I walk by and see one, I get this sudden anxiety of accidentally pulling it.  Obviously there's no way to accidentally pull a pull station just by walking by it.  And the irony is, because I have his mild fear of this impossible situation happening, my brain will start to act it out subconsciously.  I'll get this strange impulse to reach out and pull the pull station.  I've never actually reached my hand out to do it, but in my &quot;mind's eye&quot; I can see/feel it happening.  This only happens though when I consciously notice the pull station.  It's almost like breathing.  You never think about it normally.  But then when you start thinking about it, it sort of switches from an unconscious to a conscious act, and suddenly you find yourself 'manually' breathing until your mind switches back over.</p>
<p>It's kind nuts.  But I do think it's some sort of built in protection system, and it probably manifests mostly with things we already have some fear over.  I do think it's an example of an intrusive thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like the guy above said I've never had the urge or impulse to do this. Or the pull station thing. I don't &quot;envision&quot; it. I understand it's an option but it's not one I ever actively consider, or visualize. </p></div>		</li>
