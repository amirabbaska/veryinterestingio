			<div class="markdown"><p>Would you think it will shorten my lifespan or give some sort of disease like Alzheimer's in the future? Apart from that:
Either Gordon Ramsay, Donald Trump, Nicolas Tesla, Uberman sleepers, Da Vinci, and all other people who claim to sleep 3 hours are liers or something is not right. If they are doing it, how are they able to function, I'd imagine they are not retarded. I do feel retarded when I sleep 3 hours even for one night, however I still question if this is a discipline issue or just that it's impossible to focus on this amount of sleep, or I need some time to adapt. Honestly, no idea. I am trying to cut down on sleep though so that is why I am exploring ways to achieve that safely and sustain-ably.</p>
<p>Thank you</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Different people have different sleep needs.</p>
<p>The average is 7-9 hours. I imagine it is possible for some people to need less than 7 hours, and others to need more than the 9 hours. </p>
<p>But the &quot;bad&quot; thing is for individuals to have less sleep than they, personally, need. If you cut down on sleep and had less sleep than your brain personally needs, then you would see a decrease in productivity, physical health, and mental health. Eventually you'd burn out/collapse.</p>
<p>The optimum amount of sleep for human beings is the exact amount it takes for that particular individual to not be tired. I.e. to feel refreshed on waking. This changes depending on the individual.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, some of these personalities may, in fact, be lying. They are likely to have some narcissistic traits, and therefore would want to make themselves seem super human. So yes, it is possible they are liars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I do feel like I am burning out, I really cannot put myself to study like I used to. It's hard to focus, not glance on a page pointlessly, and keep my work ethics maxed out. Perhaps it's self discipline, but I doubt it is. It's not like I am multitasking, the only task I am doing is studying. So maybe it is sleep deprivation like you said. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if it's wiser to function less efficiently and die maybe 5 years younger and live the life you wanted to live (High life is what I hope to achieve if I put in a LOT of work) or just live a normal life working just to save a little on the side. What would you pick? Weighing the positives and negatives. I guess more time available means a higher chance of someone becoming richer/more famous/whatever goal one has.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really do not mind because I will not be interacting with a lot of people when I am getting my tasks done. I don't mind the bad mood either, I tend to turn it as a motivation to work so I can be in a happier circumstance, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>Thank you</p></div>		</li>
