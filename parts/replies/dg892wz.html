			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't buy that it is an indicator of responsibility.  There are many ways for good folk to fall through the cracks.  I guess in a statistical sense it sort of works as in people with low scores (for any reason) will default more times than not.  I can also statistically say that a random black man is more apt to commit a crime.  These thought processes lead to marginalizing generalizations.</p>
<p>I am the definition of financially responsible but an outsource Comcast rep who didn't speak english fucked me and got me a higher mortgage rate.  Comcast could have easily just... called or emailed me... for the $20 but they didn't.  The corporate machine charged off my account.</p>
<p>I've paid every credit card in full for TEN years, never had more than 5% utilization, paid every bill, never stiffed a landlord but my score (as based on the older algorithims used by mortgage lenders) dropped to the 670s since I had &quot;one negative item&quot;.  A $20 bill was scored the same as a $10,000 charge off since they are both &quot;negative items&quot;.</p>
<p>The mere threat of collections can be used to bully people by landlords and businesses thus circumventing the judicial system.  People just shut up and pay the bullshit fee, right or wrong, so they don't ding their score.</p>
<p>I want to see more leeway in the lending process where management looks at the actual line items on the credit report and makes a decision.</p>

<p>Well, that's exactly how it's used. Whether it's fair or ethical isn't relevant. It might be shitty, yeah, but at the end of the day, it's still the method multiple organizations, from financial to defense, use to determine whether you're responsible enough to pay a mortgage, handle classified information, etc.</p>
<p>I mean, if you have 1000 people with a negative on their report, and 50 of those have it for a bullshit reason, that's a low rate for false positives. I can definitely see how lenders would still considerate it the best metric they have for dealing with a huge number of people.</p>
<p>Looking at the score instead of a full report I assume is just a streamlining measure. You're a landlord, so you probably have under a hundred tenants. Shit, you might have under 30. </p>
<p>Citi Bank probably has several million. I'm not an expert, but my guess is they consider using credit scores a better use of man hours.</p>

<p>That's life. I'm not disagreeing with you or saying the system is perfect, but it's still the system that's used.</p>
<p>I actually once had a collections agency sent after me for an unpaid electric bill. The bill was for the month after I moved out, and I had proof that I'd paid for the last month I lived there and had the power shut off before I moved out. </p>
<p>I fought it for several months before it went away. So yeah, I know things like that can happen and ding your score for a bullshit reason, but my credit score is still what lenders use to gauge how financially responsible I am.</p>

<p>I would also like to see a little more leeway in the lending process where a member of management can look at the line items of the report and toss obviously junk ones.</p>

<p>That sounds awesome, but I feel like it would take a ton of investigation to figure out who was at fault -- the borrower or the institution.</p></div>		</li>
