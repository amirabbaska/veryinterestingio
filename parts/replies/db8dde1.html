			<div class="markdown"><p>/u/Ryltarr I totally understand the &quot;they get away with it because they can&quot; argument. I guess my question is FedEx, USPS, Amazon, could all do the same thing, but from my personal experience and others shared experiences they actually try to operate with integrity. What is it about UPS in particular that allows them to just not care? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>UPS is unionized, so firing a guy for shitty performance is neigh impossible. Sounds like you just got a guy who doesn't give a fuck, and there is not much you or anyone can do about it. You can NOT use UPS, but that's like trying to not use credit cards or something in today's day and age. </p>
<p>Sorry folks, I grew up a Ford man in Michigan raised from union dollars. No more. You became what you fought against - big business intertwined with corruption.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Being a union worker does not absolve you from meeting your company's standards.</p>
<p>They're simply hasn't been enough complaints to warrant a reaction by the company.</p></div>		</li>

<p>All of those carriers <em>do</em> try the same thing. The world is rife with anecdotes of the same or similar stunts being pulled by them. At the end of the day it all boils down to the individual delivery driver and how lazy he is feeling.</p>
<p>At present there is no oversight for what, exactly, the driver does throughout every single stop of his route. There is, however, immense pressure on him to get that route completed as soon as possible, so in order to save time some drivers will cut corners by deliberately failing to deliver packages to places that they know are going to take a lot of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My company used to use UPS. One day when they RETROACTIVELY changed the status of tracking information to &quot;Business Closed&quot; that we could no longer file a claim. Another time, my employees stayed late until 8pm for a UPS pickup for our urgent package going out, who never came. We called repeatedly until at around 7:50pm they said the driver noted that, surprise, our &quot;business was closed&quot;. That was the last straw. Our company now exclusively uses FedEx and has rejected all attempts for UPS sales reps to solicit our business in the last 5 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there is extensive oversight on UPS drivers.  Sensors in the car track everything from the cars location to when the driver is in the seat, to how long he was not in the seat for package delivery.  So if you called the local UPS office and put enough pressure on them to investigate, they can actually investigate.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with UPS and companies in a similar situation, is that you aren't their customer. The end user isn't the customer, and doesn't make the decision, so UPS is insulated. You can complain to Amazon, but they'll explain that UPS is not Amazon, and they had no control. They do have control, though, if they lost business for UPS not doing their job, but that's unlikely to happen, or more unlikely than when a company messes up for the end user directly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Something to keep in mind during the holiday season--UPS stores are owned by individuals, and while they have no control over truck drivers, if you call them and explain to them NICELY what your problem is, many of them will go out of their way to help you. I work for a business that doesn't have in house shipping so we partner with UPS stores nearby, and let me tell you those guys are the nicest people but if you call them screaming at them about a package out of the thousands they get every day, anyone would lose their patience. </p>
<p>TL; DR: if you're nice to your local UPS guy chances are he's going to be nice to you too. It's Christmas time, don't be a dick to people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually Amazon isn't the customer a lot of times either. Amazon uses something called Blind Dropship a lot, where when you place an order they actually just pass it along to the manufacturer and then the manufacturer ships the package while labeling it as if it came from Amazon (Amazon Packing Slip etc). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Amazon will give an additional free month of Prime if a Prime delivery is delayed. I dunno if they attempt to recover damages from the shipper, but it's nice to get compensated for the inconvenience. Just send an email and get your free month. UPS has bought me two free months in the last 30 days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can call the Amazon customer service line and request UPS no longer be used when they have discretion. For some shipping choices they don't; for others, they do, and will respect your preferences.</p>
<p>I did precisely this after UPS kicked off their new &quot;if we miss you on the first attempt, we won't come back and you can drive to our store to pick it up&quot; strategy. Combined with drivers that don't even bother with a first attempt, I contacted Amazon full of anger, and told them - politely - that a business model that involves buying stuff in stores already exists, and it's not their strong suit.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm glad they do this, it's better than waiting another day (or more if it fails again) to get it delivered.</p></div>		</li>
