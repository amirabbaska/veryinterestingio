<p>Great summary. </p>
<p>I also want to point out that in a significant number of these bases, the &quot;majority holding&quot; is of the host nation. The base I'm at is &quot;owned&quot; 51% by the Japanese government, and &quot;49% owned&quot; by the the US forces stationed here (edit: to clarify, &quot;owned&quot; means &quot;used by,&quot; we have no actual property ownership or management, etc; everything we do the the buildings, even painting, requires a contract for local workers to come in and repair, etc. We pay for the upkeep and energy/water consumption, etc, which is what I meant by &quot;owned.&quot;)</p>
<p>We are VERY MUCH AWARE that we are <em>guests</em> in a foreign country. It is drilled into us every Friday before we go on weekend liberty that &quot;we are ambassadors of the United States of America. No matter what we're doing, we are always representing America.&quot; </p>
<p>And, we are also aware that one colossal wrong-doing by one sailor, <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/03/23/national/crime-legal/u-s-sailor-admits-okinawa-rape-police/#.WTOZWmjfqUk" target="_blank">like the Okinawan Rape Incident</a> has repercussions like <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/25/obama-apologizes-japan-marine-charged-murder/" target="_blank">having our President publicly apologize on our behalf</a>, or <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/06/06/national/u-s-navy-confines-sailors-to-bases-in-japan-bans-alcohol-after-okinawa-dui-incident/#.WTOaAmjfqUk" target="_blank">restricting all US military in the entire region to their local bases</a>, and even <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2016/06/20/asia/us-military-base-protests-okinawa/index.html" target="_blank">the possibility that America would have to pull all of our forces out of the country</a>. </p>
<p>So, yes, as you said: we are there because the countries allow us because of SOFA. Smaller reasons we are also there includes stuff like we pour a lot of money into their local economy and because we offer--and greatly benefit from--international training and exercise operations. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me that Okinawa had quite a stretch of shit happen last year. The sailor with the DUI and then the <em>contractor</em> who happened to be an ex-Marine with the murder (not that the media cared it was a contractor - they rolled it all up as if it were a <em>current</em> Marine, and everyone got to pay for it anyways)</p>
<p>I will say though - the Air Force can stand to get rid of some of their ridiculous numbers of golf courses and give it back to the Okinawans.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have been in country since ~2010....it's been a roller coaster. The murder of the taxi-driver &quot;because we didn't have enough money to pay for the fare, so we stole the car to drive home&quot; escapade, the rapes, the murders, the thefts, <a href="https://japantoday.com/category/national/u-s-seaman-found-dead-in-train-station-accidental-electrocution-suspected" target="_blank">even when a sailor accidentally kills himself through alcohol and negligence,</a> we of 7th fleet all get rounded up for more &quot;training&quot; and &quot;liberty plans&quot; and curfew &quot;adjustments.&quot; While this paints the US forces in a horrible light, it's not that frequent that we go all law-breaking-full-idiot-mode, and comparatively to the incidents of our forces in the US, it's actually way lower. But American military in Japan are headlining news, <a href="https://www.navytimes.com/articles/sailors-marines-rushed-to-aid-of-car-crash-victims-outside-yokosuka-navy-base" target="_blank">even when they save lives</a> <a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/12/31/national/car-drives-off-parking-garage-yokosuka-killing-three-injuring-two/#.WTOiA2jfqUk" target="_blank">(Same story from Japan Times, but I can't get behind the paywall.)</a> </p></div>		</li>

<p>You'll note too that the four nations with the most US troops overseas are Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Italy. Three of those four are the vanquished Axis foes of WW2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Somehow I had never thought of it like that, and it gave me a real sense of the past and future colliding. Felt very ominous.  </p>
<p>This is an excellent explanation and a great insight into the world of geopolitics and military negotiation and cooperation. It's fascinating to know the huge and (for the most part) positive effect our military agreements have with other countries. We help act as a deterrent to the enemies of our allies, and we help lift up others alongside us. </p>
<p>Makes me feel a little bit of national pride to remember how important we are to the world. God knows, I was starting to forget what that felt like.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm a huge history buff so i felt the same way. Kind of crazy thinking that the US is occupying a lot of bases once used by our enemies in WW2. For instance, Yokosuka Naval Base near Tokyo is headquarters of the US Seventh Fleet. It was once a Imperial Japanese Navy base.</p>
<p>And yeah, it's crazy how many troops remain in those countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japan - 39,000</li>
<li>Germany - 38,000</li>
<li>South Korea - 28,500</li>
<li>Italy - 12,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Those all have more than Afghanistan, an active war zone</p>

<p>There is SO much that goes on behind the scenes that the public doesn't hear about. </p>
<p>For instance, the US Air Force offers 'scholarships' to developing nations to send their military pilots to Air Force flight school to get exposure and training to aviation. This program is for developing nations only - students from places like Benin and Senegal and other places will come and take language courses, aerospace physiology courses, etc. and get time flying trainer planes</p>
<p>Every branch has programs that train others. The Coast Guard hosts hundreds of foreign troops on counter smuggling and waterway security, for instance.</p>
<p>For myself, in flight school, I trained with: Brits, French, Singaporean, Kuwaitis, Italians, Saudis, Spaniards, etc.</p>
<p>I've flown in the same airspace in the US currently used by test pilots from: the UK, Netherlands, Norway, Germany, French, Denmark, etc.</p>
<p>Heck, some nations send entire branches of their military here for special training. All Italian Navy pilots, for indtance, attend US Navy flight school. All French Navy aircraft carrier pilots are trained by the US Navy as well.</p>
<p>That's a lot of trust we place in one another </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I know how depressing all the news is, but behind the scenes a lot of us are working very hard. Cooperation between nations doesn't grow overnight, and we have built close ties with many nations around the world through various military exchange programs, joint exercises, and long standing programs to train one another.</p>
<p>As a commanding officer once told me: the military lasts longer than any President. And rest assured that we all are working hard to maintain those relations behind the scenes, no matter what political grandstanding happens</p>
<p>(When nations start withdrawing forces or kicking us out, then start worrying...)</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is actually a fascinating aspect of the &quot;United States Empire&quot; vs the Empires of Ancient, medieval and the near past. I'm more than certain had one of the past empires put a garrison in another territory, the yoke put upon the local populace would at best be tax farmed to famine or at worse rape pillage and genocide. Japan had a post war economic miracle thanks in large part to American investment and decades of rebuilding. I'm sure there is a lot of anger and animosity but as the old addage of the Roman Empire went &quot;Romans make a wasteland and call it peace,&quot; at least America tries its hand at nation building in hopes that peace will come. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. Great breakdown. I'm so sick of all the damn USA bashing. It's &quot;cool to hate the US&quot; now. Give me a break. People forget these things, and the charity we give is staggering. They say we ignite chaos, but we hopefully do more to contain it. Ultimately there are a bunch of fantastic nations, and a bunch of rotten ones. At the heart, I believe most all nations peoples are great, not their leaders for the bad ones.  But it's great to see the alliance and trust as you say we have, and the scholarships and things that our done to maintain this idea of world peace.  </p>
<p>I know we're not perfect. But I'll be damned if someone tries to take away the greatness we do. </p>
<p>Your post was so well needed. I just came out of a post on a person who lost their local helper in Afghanistan, and than I come here next. It's a great dose of knowledge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason why Singapore has strong ties to the US is in history if not for the Americans, we would still be under Japanese rule and the Japanese were very cruel and torturous. If not for the US winning the war, I strongly doubt we would have the peace we are experiencing now.</p></div>		</li>
