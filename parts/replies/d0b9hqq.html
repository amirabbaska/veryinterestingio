			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to get even more technical, I've seen some Chinese bloggers make the distinction between a traditionally processed oolong and a semi-oxidized black tea, which Darjeeling falls in the latter. Darjeeling doesn't undergo the complex firing and shaping process of other oolong teas, and is processed more like a black tea but is left to oxidize only partially. Of course, tea-making is not a rigid process and there are many teas that blur the line between different types.</p>
<p>For reference, the brewing technique it sounds like you described for oolongs is called gongfu cha, where tea is brewed with a high leaf to water ratio and concentrated flash steeps are made. A good tea can last about 10 rounds or so.</p>
<p>OP, the only thing that will infuriate tea purists is that you used a tea bag ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the expresso of tea,  done in exotic earthen ware. Not unlike the trouble ppl go to and use a thousand dollar expresso machine imported from Italy.  It's labor intensive and uses top grade ingredients  (tea and water).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like other craft drinks such as beer, wine, or coffee, there's a range of quality in tea and equipment, from the cheap mass produced stuff to the rare, high end stuff that you can only get from special connections. There's also overhead if you went to a tea house. I live in the States so I'm unfamiliar with how Chinese prices compare, but the tea places I've been range $10-$25ish for decent gongfu cha. Online I've seen 8 grams of high end loose leaf tea go from $40 and up, and pots ranging from $100-$300. It can be an expensive hobby!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Some of it could be a tourist trap costs, others the price of using expensive yixing pots and excess boiling water used to warm up the vessels rather than brew tea. The tea itself (probably puer) might be expensive, though you don't need many grams to make multiple servings of 50ml or so. If you want that tea for yourself and at a sane price, /r/tea should be able to help.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Earl Grey is cheater's tea. Make no mistake: I love Earl Grey, but a common origin story for it was that it was invented because the East India Company kept getting large batches of crappy tea that they had to make somehow palatable. So they drowned the garbage quality with bergamot oil, which has a strong flavour and aroma.</p>
<p>It's actually similar to how Starbucks technically &quot;burns&quot; its coffee beans: they require an absurd amount of beans, so they can't source them all from the same place. To standardize the flavour, they essentially burn the complex individualized flavours out of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually bought a tin of the loose leaf &quot;Federation issue.  Tea.  Earl Grey.  Hot.&quot;  It was actually pretty tasty (though a bit expensive).  It had tea leaves, orange peel, and bergamot flowers in it, visibly.  Not sure if cheaper ones use oils or extracts or something.  I just fill the tin with other tea now because it's cheaper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I picked up some of the brand &quot;Twinings of London&quot;, which actually seems like a legit brand, much to my surprise. I was totally expecting to be saying &quot;but it's American, so who knows&quot;, but that doesn't seem to be the case! Anyway, I rather enjoy it. I don't have nearly enough tea experience to offer an &quot;educated&quot; opinion beyond that, but I like it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, and it's even more true as you go to higher qualities. It depends on the type of tea, but for most &quot;leafy&quot; tea (i.e. not dust or fannings) you can generally get at least three steeps, and for puerh people sometimes get as many as 20 steeps. Of course, that all depends on how long each steep is and you are generally trading off which types of chemicals and how much of each are being extracted. Doing multiple short steeps and getting a small &quot;slice&quot; of each extraction profile is one of the best parts of enjoying premium tea.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, too true. I'm trying to remember how the Chinese proverb goes. Something like: &quot;first steep for your enemy, second for your friend, third steep for you&quot;. There's a couple different versions of it.</p>
<p>For puerh, usually the first steep is a rinse because the production process can get stuff you don't want to drink on it. For shou puerh (the heated, piled version), people often do two rinses.</p></div>		</li>
