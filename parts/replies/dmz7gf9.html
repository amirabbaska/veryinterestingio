			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some neat theories about that. There's also some about a possible fifth planet that got shifted into the asteroid belt by movement of the Jovian system and it got broken up and a large chunk smashed up Mars. It's also theorized that if the borealis basin was caused by an impact it could've been enough to demagnatize the core and might explain the massive elevation differences between the two hemispheres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, it would be one of the many challenges of colonising Mars - protecting from solar radiation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also the reason Mars doesn't have an atmosphere to speak of. With no magnetic field, solar winds strip away the molecules that would make up the atmosphere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also theorized that the reason earth's axis is so <em>stabile</em> is because of its large moon. Just because mars' axis is what it is TODAY doesn't mean it's always been that way. It is thought it could &quot;wobble&quot; about on its axis over time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More on this.</p>
<p>One theory is that a big rock smacked Mars retrograde(opposite its rotation). While it would be quite a jolt on a planetary level, it wasnt quite enough to stop the cores rotation and convection currents. its suspected that the amount 'cold rock' the impact introduced into the mantle changed its viscosity just enough to eventually drag it down and kill the dynamo.</p></div>		</li>
