			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine there should be a reasonable amount of literature given the prevalence of combat soldiers who are increasingly surviving traumatic brain injuries.  Maybe less so about the direct sensations and experience of the injury rather than how to treat/heal/rehabilitate them, but its worth a look for someone so inclined.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Instantaneous destruction of the <em>whole</em> brain would <em>definitely</em> not register. If you are killed by, for example, a bomb, and the bomb destroys the entirety of your brain, and the blast front travels faster than the speed at which neurons can signal each other across the same distance, then you won't have time to think anything.</p>
<p>With a bullet, yeah, the parts that are not destroyed beyond their ability to signal will continue to signal, and that may or may not qualify as &quot;registering&quot; depending on which parts are still working. (If everything is destroyed apart from e.g. your sex drive, you won't really be &quot;registering&quot; the bullet in any meaningful way.)</p>
<p>It's worth noting that bullets travel faster than neural signals, so the parts directly hit shouldn't be doing anything very interesting.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Given that brain signals travel at about <a href="http://scienceline.ucsb.edu/getkey.php?key=1950" target="_blank">300mph</a> and bullets travel faster than sound, many times faster than brain signals, much of the brain will be destroyed before any part of it has registered the destruction. By that point, it's really hard to say what the remains feel. A brain that damaged probably just seizures and crashes with all brain function stopping in under 20 seconds from loss of blood pressure. From the perspective of a brain, that is basically instantaneous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The answer is that it all depends on caliber and shot placement.</p>
<p>The brain has a texture not too different from gelatin - the tissue will stretch, expand, and cavitate with enough force applied.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fX4ODh1g4eM&amp;feature=youtu.be#t=0m31s" target="_blank">Extreme example here</a>; notice the stretch cavity as compared to the path of the bullet itself.</p>
<p>Bullets do three types of damage to the brain: Crush trauma which occurs in a narrow channel directly crushed by the moving round.  Cavitation damage in a channel several inches wider than the crush channel.  And secondary damage caused by bleeding (which is like having a massive aneurysm or stroke) and swelling.</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy was hit in the head by a rifle round from a 6.52x52mm Mannlicher Carcano.  The bullet itself was 162gr (10.5g) moving at 2,300 ft/s (700 m/s), with an energy of 2,293 J.  We can see from the Zapruder film that it blew a sizeable chunk of his skull out and created a gore fountain a meter or so tall. That amount of energy likely annihilated any higher brain function at all; Kennedy never knew what hit him, and while it took a while for his brain stem to give up, he almost certainly lost consciousness instantaneously and never regained it.  The portions of his brain responsible for awareness may not have even remained in his skull.</p>
<p>His brother, Bobby, on the other hand was shot with a low caliber handgun, a 22 caliber revolver.  The bullet itself was approximately 30gr (2.1g) moving at roughly ~ 1,500 ft/s, with an energy of around 250 J (ballparking 1/10th the energy of the round that hit John Kennedy).  The bullet fragmented and spread through his brain, but the energy wasn’t enough to cause instantaneous widespead destruction.  Bobby clearly knew something was badly wrong:  He asked those nearby if everyone else was safe, and had time to say things like “Everything is going to be ok” and “Don’t lift me” before he passed.  His brain clearly (briefly) had enough remaining function to process what was happening before hemorrhage and swelling likely finished the job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For clarification, any remaining brain tissue tries to do whatever it normally does. Blowing out the front part of your brain will leave your brain stem to keep stimulating your diaphragm to breathe. Even with a sizable hole in the head people can &quot;live&quot; for quite a while. Definitely way longer than 20 seconds. 5 minutes on the short side to hours or forever on the long side.</p>
<p>Source: had a few patients with GSW to the head and face. Many were way less dead than advertised over the radio.</p></div>		</li>
