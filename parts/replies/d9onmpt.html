			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want a few examples:</p>
<p>If you type out: ni3 chi1 le ma and press space the bar the ime converts it to 你吃了吗 automatically(&quot;Have you eaten?&quot; basically the chinese equivalent of Hi&quot;). </p>
<p>The numbers are optional, they signify tones, if you don't specify and type out say si, the ime doesn't know if you mean say 四 (the number four) or another character that has the same pinyin. Then, when you press space you get a little pop down with all the si characters and you need to choose one. Smarter imes have word banks in them, if I write out ni chi le ma alone 99% of the time it will just figure out that that's what I mean, so if you type full sentences the modern systems kind of do a lot of handholding.</p>
<p>On my galaxy note device, I literally write out my characters as it has character recognition.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>I always found that really funny. Like, in Mandarin, tones are as fundamental to syllables as initials and finals are, but when typing they're essentially optional.</p>
<p>My guess is it's due to influence from Western keyboards (which are based around the Latin alphabet).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to test out the typing system, Baidu.com (the most common search engine in China) does this automatically. If you want a simple search, just search &quot;baidu&quot; or &quot;nihao&quot; or something. You can also search for public figures fairly easily but spelling is going to be a little different in pinyin than it is in English (for example Hilary Clinton is xilarikelinduen-- spaces are unnecessary in Chinese, so that's all smooshed together, but I suppose you could use spaces if you wanted to). </p>
<p>Or, if you just want to search in English, you can search in English too and it'll still give you the Chinese results.  </p>
<p>Often didi drivers (it's basically Chinese Uber) will have their GPS set up to use the touch-pad system, and most people have that system set up on their phones. It's pretty neat and you can probably see what it's like on your own phone, if you really want to see what it's like. <strong>PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO CHANGE IT BACK BEFORE TRYING THIS!</strong> But basically where your keypad is will turn into a big blank box, and when you &quot;draw&quot; the word, a row of possible results will show up on the top or on the side (depending on the OS).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FYI in Chinese there are two main types of IME, one is according to pronunciation and one is according to the actual shape of the characters. Pinyin and Zhuyin are the most used for pronunciation type IME, and Changjie and Wubi are most used for component type IME. Entering by shape has an advantage of entering weird new characters since it doesn't require you to know it's pronounciation and has a very high precision. It also depends on the region you are living in. In China you would find many people using Pinyin, while in Hong Kong you would find many people using Changjie or a simplified version of Changjie.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just to elaborate, <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-1277be5f41192cf7c8d6fe3de4f99339-c?convert_to_webp=true" target="_blank">here's what a standard keyboard in Taiwan looks like</a>, or at least my family had something like this in the 90s in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Those symbols are zhuyin, kinda similar to hiragana for Japanese - basically our own series of symbols to &quot;sound out&quot; characters. Each one corresponds to a sound (like <em>b</em> or <em>p</em>) and you just hit the ones that make up the character you want, along with the tone, and you'll get a list of characters that match (since as mentioned, there's usually a bunch of characters with the same pronunciation). If you're typing a compound word or sentence it's usually pretty good at guessing which exact character you want. </p>
<p>These days, my mom pretty much exclusively uses her iPad and phone, on both of which she just uses the touchscreen to write out what she wants. For a native speaker (writer?) it's pretty fast, since again it's good at guessing even if you're off by a little (like autocorrect). Before smartphones, we also had a drawing tablet that would also get used as an alternative (mainly by my dad who's from HK, so he doesn't know zhuyin). Windows also has a built in feature called IME pad that basically functions like this, it's a little popup screen where you can use your mouse (or a hooked up drawing pad) to write out what you want.</p>
<p>Personally, I don't formally know pinyin but being bilingual I usually find it easy enough to kinda guess from the pronunciation. I've spent too much time with QWERTY and not enough with the zhuyin layout for me to seamlessly switch between the two anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To elaborate more on the bopomofo input method:</p>
<p>I think for most Taiwanese if not all of them, there isn't an option of not choosing the 注音符號 keyboard as this is what it's basically taught in schools and used by everybody else. 注音符號 can be considered the Taiwanese equivalent of the Japanese kana and so as the kana keyboard, here's a standard bopomofo keyboard with all the syllabus.</p>
<p>Standard keyboard:</p>

What happens if you are using a new keyboard and you don't have the symbols on it?</p>
<p>Well... my observation is that people just memorize the 41 keys (that's how my girlfriend can use it even on a british keyboard) but even if they weren't able to memorize it, there's a &quot;standard way&quot; of ordering the syllabus, just like when you start spelling the alphabet. You usually start with A,B,C,D,E, etc but with bopomofo is ㄅ，ㄆ，ㄇ，ㄈ and as you can see on the keyboard, there's a logical sequence. There are other layouts like the Eten but I am not that familiar with it.</p>
<p>Also, romanization in Taiwan is not actually taught in schools so most people don't really know any form of romanization (they either try to romanize it using the English language, a la Hepburn or have to look it up on the Google translate, dictionary, MOFA website). It is mostly used for foreigners though it isn't really useful as even if you know how to spell it, most people won't actually know it.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to romanize the language and Taiwan uses a lot of them, there's the Wade-Giles, Mandarin Phonetic Symbols, Tongyong Pinyin, Hanyu Pinyin (the one used in China) Gwoyu Romazyth, etc. Wade-Giles is usually used for names and historical places (first romanization method). Most Taiwanese have their names in Wade-Giles, TP, MPS or some sort of combination of them. HP was introduced about 10 years ago and is mostly used for roads, MRT stations and everything else in the Northern part of Taiwan. The South uses TP.</p>
<p>The advantages of 注音 is basically speed compared to HP.</p>
<p>There are less key strokes. For instance ㄓˋ (2) is ZHI4 (4), ㄒㄩㄥˊ(4) is xiong2 (6). I am not sure if there's any desktop keyboard that allows it but on Android and iOS (since iOS 7) you can already type even faster because there's word prediction and no need to type the tone (you have to on desktop systems) therefore removing one keystroke for every single character. You can also type way faster for instance: ㄊㄞˊㄅㄟˇ (6 strokes) ㄊㄞㄅㄟ(4 strokes) or even ㄊㄅ (2 strokes) for Taipei.</p>
<p>Disadvantages are that you need to memorize the 41 key strokes if you aren't using a TW keyboard.</p>
<p>For language switching or English typing I actually think it's quite fast, you just hit either Shift or Caps Lock and you can start typing roman letters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Am Taiwanese, can confirm we just memorize the keyboard. For those of us who grown up using it, it's usually not a problem, but for those who didn't, are outside of Asia, and have no access to a Taiwanese keyboard, they'll have to learn and use pinyin.</p></div>		</li>
