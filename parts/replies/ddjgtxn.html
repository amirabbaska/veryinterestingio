<p>Plenty of religions know that in order to grow as a religion you have to grow your population/followers. This typically means things like frowning/shaming/banning contraceptives or proper sexual education.</p>
<p>Notice how in the USA, two different religious groups are both seen to have stereotypes of large families, and a very negative opinion of birth control/abortion.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think its a bit funny that probably the reason religion restricted sex, was at the time birth control was not available. It was a safe option to avoid unwanted pregnancy. Now, a loud religious group doesn't want birth control because they think it promotes sex out of wedlock which causes children which when added the poor issue, creates a welfare state where any form of birth control along the way would have been great but...</p></div>		</li>

<p>Uh I'm pretty sure they aren't, but maybe the will sooner than we think. I think what's more likely is fewer of their followers are taking birth control restrictions seriously and as the Catholic Church sees its membership plummeting in the next few decades it will lax up to try and appease its ever questioning constituents. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>lots of good answers, but for my family it was an acomplishment, or fullfilment. they couldn't go out and do stuff so they didn't have entertainment. they were gonna be poor anyway so it wasn't a deterrent.  they just had kids to keep them busy and have people to hang out with</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You hit most of the main reasons for sure. Education seems to be the one that most think is the biggest cause. It is a bit different, but it is similar to how in Africa, much of the population literally either had no idea or had no access to birth control before Western Countries started going over there.</p></div>		</li>
