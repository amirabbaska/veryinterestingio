			<div class="markdown"><p>I should point out that that's one of several likely scenarios (and also the opposite scenario of what I'd expect, since the Mid-Atlantic ridge would have to stop spreading and start subducting). Other scenarios mostly involve the Americas colliding with Asia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To make a related inquiry, when the continents collide in such a way that they become one landmass, from the perspective of someone on continent, would this be a violent process, or more like something that happens slowly enough to be barely noticeable over a lifetime?</p>
<p>As someone who doesn't know much about geology, my best guess would be that it would probably be slow, with maybe the most severe activity being an increase in earthquakes. How close am I?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's weird to think about this.</p>
<p>Like, eventually a city will be divided in two.  But when do the people living there actually realize that they are two?  </p>
<p>I guess it is the same human mental incompatibility with understanding evolution.  People have trouble grasping when X animal became Y animal.  But it is not something you can pinpoint down to a single step.  </p>
<p>The whole idea of nations and borders also seems silly when viewed on these geological time scales.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But yes, the Tibetan plateau has taken roughly 50 million years to become what it is today.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're pretty close in your guess. As /u/LordM000 mentioned it would be so slow that no single lifetime would be able to observe a large noticeable difference. And you're right that there will be times of sudden quick movements resulting from earthquakes that are from the sudden shift in tectonics, but we're talking no more than a few inches at most per year. </p>
<p>It is estimated to take another 250 million years before a supercontinent is formed again. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bQywDr-btz4#" target="_blank">Here's a short video showing what that could possibly look like, too.</a></p></div>		</li>
