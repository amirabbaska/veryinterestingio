			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty sure the AMA with the science team had a comment that the ISO is so sensitive that if they turned the camera to take a new &quot;tiny blue dot&quot; picture of earth, that the direct sunlight it would receive (there is no way to block it like they did with the original) would blow out the sensor.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The parameters were carefully chosen to make a good compromise between alignment stability and photometric throughput.</p>
<p>Note that the main CCD sensor is not used in a same way as in ordinary camera where the entire image is projected to the sensor at once and then captured, but rather the image is scanned across thin but long CCD arrays. </p>
<p>Here's what the sensor looks like: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/eugorQV.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/eugorQV.png</a></p>
<p>There are several CCD arrays (7, actually) on a single substrate that allows the camera to capture the images at different wavelenghts at the same time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A better aperture in this case would be a wider aperture. A fair question. However, it comes with its problems. A large aperture produces soft images. You want good sharpness. Also, it depends on how big the image sensor is. The larger the image sensor, the more you have to deal with depth of field. For example, on a pocket camera, f/7.8 would be too small. On a large format, it would be just sharp enough to give you a good image. A higher mm won't have that big of an effect on the light entering, as the mm dictates how much magnification (or lack of) the lens has, and how much image it can cover. A higher mm means the lens sees less, and magnify more. While Pluto is small, it is still big comparatively for a photo. If you want to take a picture of it with a long lens, you would have to stand back. </p>
<p>The lens used is probably the best compromise between size, weight, effect, image wanted, and cost. </p></div>		</li>
