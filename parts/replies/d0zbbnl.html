			<div class="markdown"><p>As Peru did with the Original Sol when they went to the Inti, Venezuela did by calling it Fuerte (Strong). In Ecuador they added 3 zeros to the end of the Sucre with sharpies and it was accepted as legal tender. </p>
<p>Chopping off 3 zeros is pretty common place. haha. Except Zimbabwe , they chopped off 9.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered by Japan and Korea don't both do this. I think it's a little more now but for quite some time 1 USD was about 100 Yen or 1000 Korean Won. It's not a big problem (Especially when Japan has one syllable counters for units of 10,000) but it doesn't seem practical having prices with so many zeroes. This car is only 3,000,000 Yen! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are some (understood but annoying) problems in dealing with big and very small numbers in  computing,  as well as the absurdity of having a single candy be 1 cent in the US but 1000 local whatever.  </p>
<p>If you are worried about counterfeit issuing a redenominated currency lets you clean up some numbers to do tidy math, and you get all new cash at the same time.  </p>
<p>It's not that you can't leave it as is,  but for lots of things very big and very small values people aren't so adept at working with them.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure where you got your numbers, but it's important to distinguish &quot;average salary&quot; vs &quot;median household income&quot; and &quot;median personal income&quot;.</p>
<p>The median households have, on average more than one earner, therefore the average salary or median personal income is actually a fraction of the median household income. </p>
<p>Using Median Household Income, and data published by Gallup in 2013, we can accurately compare purchasing power. This can be accomplished using the Gross Median Household Income in USD PPP (purchasing power pairity).</p>
<p>According to the data, the US ranks #6 at 43,585 USD PPP, and the UK ranks in at #19 or 31,617 USD PPP. </p>
<p>Therefore, a median household in the US has 37% more purchasing power than a median household in the UK. </p>
<p>For the record, median household income in the US in 2014 was $51939 or £36311. </p>
<p>The £27k figure is the UKs household net-adjusted disposable income per capita, according to the OECD, which is different than median household income. The average household net-adjusted income per capita in the United States is $41,355. This means, ignoring PPP, earnings were very similar in both countries, but as previously described, data suggests that money has much more purchasing power in the US. </p></div>		</li>
