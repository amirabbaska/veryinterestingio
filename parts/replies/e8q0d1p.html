			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, I'm curious about this! </p>
<p>I'd always heard the &quot;eating for two&quot; expression, but maybe a couple years ago while out to dinner with a group I made a reference to it, after a pregnant friend turned down a piece of a dessert for caloric reasons. She corrected me that it's really only about an extra 300~400 calories a day, during the 2nd-3rd trimester (I did google it after this and more or less confirmed she was correct). </p>
<p>Granted, she was a very active and health conscious person, and was still running and exercising during most of it, so I gather she was trying to avoid the &quot;treat yo'self&quot; frame of mind and stick to her normal diet as much as possible.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s interesting to me that your kid handles spice better. Does she like it? Does she experience less pain? This could explain maybe why in cultures where spice is more prominent people have much higher tolerances </p></div>		</li>

<p>when I was pregnant?? I definitely had a treat yoself mentality. I believe there's an element of that for a lot of women</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I personally believe that it's something that society ingrains is right (&quot;You're eating for two!&quot;) and not so much just because cravings. People use it as a free pass to leave their self-control and self-discipline at the door when it comes to food and exercise because that's what they've heard for years while growing up.</p></div>		</li>
