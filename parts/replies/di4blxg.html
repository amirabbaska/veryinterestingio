			<div class="markdown"><p>Then your house, or the main sewer, were not  built properly. This is not a problem in a properly installed system.</p>
<p>The drain plumbing stack is always full of air. It only occasionally has waste in it, when waste is being drained/flushed. A &quot;trapped&quot; air bubble will not fight it's way up to and explode your toilet. The only way for that to happen is if the drain itself is improperly vented AND sewer gas builds up (or in your case, it becomes pressurized due to gravity).</p>
<p>Every time you flush a single (residential) toilet you create a slug of waste that squishes down the air below it in the drain, and siphons the dirty toilet water out of the bowl. Normal stuff.</p></div>		</li>
