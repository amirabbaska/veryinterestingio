<p>Hah. Story time. I once had a little too much (courtesy of not realizing how strong it was). It was a blast the first few minutes. I decided to wash the dishes, because I like my apartment clean. Halfway through, I realized I couldn't do it, I just kept turning around and laughing at myself, saying &quot;Oh my god, you can't do this right now, you're too high,&quot; out loud. So I stopped and got myself a peach. And I should NOT have done that. I took a bite, and once I looked at the pit with the fruit surrounding it, my brain went into overdrive. &quot;Shit, you've seen that before, that pattern, the pit with all that around it.&quot; It made me feel awful. I tried talking to a few friends over facebook, only to find myself checking every time if I had actually said anything or if I had imagined it. It got so bad that I felt 6 different personas/flows/whatever trying to get a word in me. Ended up curled in a whining ball on my bed, experiencing pretty awful schizophrenia that mixed with me seeing everything as a <em>pattern I had seen before</em> and freaking me out like that for about four hours. Still glad it happened, though, it's an awful experience that is good to have. The worst part, I think, was the fear that it was going to last forever, me being trapped in that state and unable to do anything about it. Made me somewhat suicidal for that moment, made me scared.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That has happened to me a couple times. Last time was just a week ago. I ate two pot muffins, had some laughs with my friends and went to sleep. Turns out I have the slowest digestive system in the world, cause I woke up 4 ours later with all the symptoms you just described; the same I got the last time I had LSD. I found that the only thing that seemed to help was eating an orange, but YMMV.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, especially in people with heart defects, it can trigger this from the rapid heart rate and anxiety.</p>
<p>It's happened to me before, really fucking scary.</p>
<p>Triggering afib symptoms is more risky the older you get, and has a higher chance of cardiac arrest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the things I hate about weed culture. Everyone says weed is completely safe and there is nothing bad about it. I was relatively new to smoking and I went to Amsterdam, I ate a pot brownie and the guy told me to eat far more than I needed, I ended up tripping at a mind bending height for 12 hours, the whole time was incredibly scary and uncomfortable, I completely lost my mind and lost grip on reality, i was hallucinating and had a distorted view and perception, it was literally the worst day of my life. I still smoke regularly but I think the fact everyone promotes it as harmless is irresponsible and dangerous, weed can be a very heavy drug if you have enough and this is something that people should be aware of. My experience was so bad that every time I get too high I get flashbacks to that time and anxiety develops and I start panicking that I'll lose my mind again, weed can be a scary drug. </p></div>		</li>
