			<div class="markdown"><p>Side bonus:  Kids love them.  The ones in Toronto have their own trading cards with the horse's name and stats.  The cops are super friendly with kids too and will often let them pet the horses and tell them all about the animal and the work they do.  It's great PR and helps kids feel more comfortable talking to cops.</p></div>		</li>

<p>but I think a cop on a horse is seen as a bit more friendly and personable than a cop in a car.</p>

<p>I think you really nailed it, but that last part is more important then you are giving it credit for.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've shared this before but here goes again. In college my wife was coming back from a party drunk   and underage. At one point she took off across a field yelling at a mounted cop. Her friends quickly caught up to her and stopped her about half way to the cop. Turns out she knew the horse from the barn she was working at and really wanted to say hi forgetting it had a state trooper mounted on top.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is definitely sociological research about the perception of officers patrolling by car versus on foot, or in this case, by horseback. I think it has a lot to do with engagement with the public. Can't really stop to have a friendly chat with citizens, or simply give a smile and &quot;how d'you do&quot; if you're in a steel box all day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! I heard a lot of feedback from my Marine batallion on their second deployment to Iraq about their &quot;winning hearts and minds&quot; approach to patrolling the community vs the Army unit they took over. The Army would patrol in Bradley fighting vehicles, whereas the Marines performed many more foot patrols, and the Marines had a much better relationship with the community as a result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I feel that this is much more of a key tactic to winning foreign wars than we give credit to.</p>
<p>Winning over the hearts of locals is invaluable for gathering intelligence and deterring the enemy from taking refuge in communities to launch attacks from.</p>
<p>Our special operations personnel are highly skilled at this.  They are experts at building relationships with tribal leaders to help convince the general population that we are fighting a common enemy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that that's just opinion. Seeing an officer on a horse as friendlier than one in a car might be due to subconscious recognition of the bond between man and beast.</p>
<p>I.e: If the horse trusts him, then he must be trustworthy.</p>
<p>Also, a car is a solid boundary. This makes the officers seem less human or more withdrawn from the situation. A man on horseback can be see face to face.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is gonna sound odd, but you know, lots of us like to worship the past and everything so maybe seeing a cop on a horse equates <del>him</del> (edit: them) to a knight in our eyes.</p></div>		</li>
