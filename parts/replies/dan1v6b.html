			<div class="markdown"><p>$40/month is possible. Ive gotten close and I could probably break it if I tried. I have a rotation of meals I go through that last a week each and cost under $10 for the batch. Chinese dumplings cost about $8 in pork and dumpling wrappers, though if you made your own wrappers you could do it cheaper. Pulled pork is $8 for a week, plus some veggies and cassava for nothing. Chicken fried rice is $9 or $10ish. Kimchi fried rice is about the same. Pasta is 80 cents per box. Throw some ground turkey or pork, tomato sauce, and veggies in and boom delicious pasta. Slow cooked gumbo is a bit more expensive at about $15 for the week but its <em>delicious</em>.</p>
<p>Also, prices in India are super varied. You can eat the exact same food and it can cost $1 or it can cost $20. You have to know where you are.  </p></div>		</li>

Sounds like you you could retire in 5-years and live a baller lifestyle compared to the one you listed. </p></div>		</li>
