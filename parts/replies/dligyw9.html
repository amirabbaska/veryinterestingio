			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. So why is the entire semiconductor industry in such a close race in transistor size? Intel is investing a lot  more than everyone else into R &amp; D but Ryzen is still competitive with Intel CPUs.

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a feedback loop in the industry keeping it in lockstep.  It's the road maps created by semiconductor industry associations.   The industry is so big, so complex, as so optimized after so many years that one player can not act on their own, even TSMC or Intel.  Fabs cost billions.  Bankers to these companies sit on their board.  And hordes of PhDs are all working on innovations, all of which are required to take a step forward.  You cannot improve one little part of a semiconductor process and get a leap forward.  All aspects--light sources, resist materials, lithography, etching, implantation, metallization, vias, planarization, dielectric deposition, and everything I forgot--all have to take a step forward to make progress.  And all these supplier companies have to get paid.  That's why they agree to stick together.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intel is far in the lead in terms of manufacturing as I understand. Others that claim a certain size are talking about only one part of a circuit, Intel has most parts at that size. </p>
<p>As for why zen is competitive? The higher end chips are massive. But they were designed to be like that, where they essentially bolt two smaller processors together. Also a part of it is architecture. Steel is superior to wood, but a well designed wood bridge might be better than a poorly designed steel bridge. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intel isn't remotely as close to as far in the lead as people believe and in fact it's the opposite, Intel can claim the smallest theoretical feature size but the smallest size isn't either the most relevant size or the most often used. The suggested density of various Glofo/TSMC/Samsung and Intel chips all leads to the conclusion that Intel's average feature size used is significantly further from the minimum than the other companies. Intel's chips look considerably less dense than their process numbers would appear they should be while the other fabs appear to be the opposite, that they are far closer in density to Intel chips than advertised process numbers suggest they should be.</p>
<p>The gap has shrunk massively from what it was between 5 and 20 years ago. They lost at least around 18 months of their lead getting to 14nm with large delays and they've lost seemingly most of the rest getting to 10nm where again they are having major trouble. Both came later than Intel wanted and in both cases they dropped bigger/hotter/higher speed chips planned and went with smaller mobile only chips due to lower clock speed requirements and smaller die sizes helping increase yields. They had huge yield issues on 14nm and again on 10nm.</p>
<p>Intel will have 10nm early next year but only for the smallest chips and with poor yields, desktop parts look set to only come out towards the end of the year and HEDT/Server into 2019, but Glofo has their 7nm process( ignoring the names, it is slightly smaller and seemingly superior to Intel's 10nm) is also coming out next year with Zen 2 based desktop chips expected end of 2018 or early 2019. So Intel GloFo(and thus AMD) will for the first time be on par when it comes to launching desktop/hedt/server parts on comparable processes for the first time basically ever. Intel's lead is in effect gone, well okay, will be by the end of 2018. TSMC are also going to have 10nm in roughly the same time frame..</p>
<p>Zen shouldn't be competitive, both because of the process node(14nm Intel is superior to Glofo's 14nm) and due to R&amp;D spent on the chips themselves. Over the past ~ 5 years the highest lowest and highest R&amp;D per quarter for AMD is around 330mil and 230mil, for Intel the highest and lowest is around 3326mil and 2520mil, in Q2 this year the difference was Intel spending just under 12 times as much as AMD.</p>
<p>Zen also isn't particularly huge, the 8 core desktop design is considerably large than Intel's quad core APU, but EPYC is 4x 195mm^2 dies vs around a 650mm^2 Intel chip. However on Intel's process the same dies from AMD would likely come in somewhere between 165mm^2 and 175mm^2, as a rough ball park. That would put AMDs Epyc design roughly on par die size with Intel's yet having significantly more pci-e, memory bandwidth and 4 more cores. </p>
<p>In effect the single AMD die has support for multi die communication that a normal 7700k doesn't have, so  part of that larger die in desktop is effectively unused in desktop but enables 2 or 4 dies to work together extremely effectively.</p>
<p>Zen isn't massive, it's not like Zen is genuinely 50% more transistors to achieve similar performance. Zen is extremely efficient both in power, what it achieves with the die space it has and how much i/o it crams into a package not much bigger than Intel achieves. </p>
<p>The last part is right, it is seemingly a superior design to achieve what it has with a process disadvantage, it's just not chips that are massively bigger.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm an electrical engineer, and I have done some work with leading-edge process technologies.  Your analogy is good, but Intel does not have a process tech advantage any more.  Samsung was the first foundry to produce a chip at a 10 nm process node.  Additionally, Intel's 7 nm node is facing long delays, and TSMC/Samsung are still on schedule.</p>
<p>Speaking only about the process tech, there are a couple of things to note about Intel's process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Intel's process is driven by process tech guys, not by the users of the process.  As a result, it is notoriously hard to use, especially for analog circuits, and their design rules are extremely restrictive.  They get these density gains because they are willing to pay for it in development and manufacturing cost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intel only sells their process internally, so as a result, it doesn't need to be as polished as the process technologies from Samsung or TSMC before they can go to market.</p>
</li>
<li>Intel has also avoided adding features to their process like through-silicon vias, and I have heard from an insider that they avoided TSVs because they couldn't make them reliable enough.  Their 2.5D integration system (EMIBs) took years to come out after other companies had TSVs, and Intel still cannot do vertical die stacking.</li>
</ol>
<p>We have seen a few companies try to start using Intel's process tech, and every time, they faced extremely long delays.  Most customers care more about getting to market than having chips that are a little more dense.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Intel's marketing materials only push their density advantage, because that is the only advantage they have left, and it comes at a very high price.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intel was significantly ahead for years, because they made the move to FINFETs - 3d transistors - first.  The rest of the industry bet they could make regular 2d transistors work for another generation.</p>
<p>Intel proved to be right; everyone else got stuck for nearly five years.</p>
<p>AMD's 14nm process isn't quite as good as Intel's, but it's close enough, and AMD came up with a clever architecture with Ryzen that let them focus all their efforts on one chip where Intel needs four or five different designs to cover the same product range.</p>
<p>Also, AMD has been working on Ryzen since 2012.  The payoff now is from a long, sustained R&amp;D program.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's worth noting that AMD does not manufacture chips any more, so AMD doesn't have a 14nm process. They're actually using TSMC as well as GlobalFoundaries (AMD's manufacturing group that was spun off in 2009) to manufacture, now that their exclusivity deal with GloFo is up. GloFo was really holding them back initially, and is probably a large reason it took so long for AMD to become competitive again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Intel was ahead because Intel were ahead, they were ahead a LONG LONG time before finfet, they were 2.5-3 years ahead of most of the rest of the industry throughout most of the 90s and 00s(I simply don't remember about before that but likely then too). With 14nm they lost a lot of that lead, they had delays of around a year and then instead of launching a full range at 14nm the process wasn't ready for server/desktop/hedt due to yields, clock speed issues so they launched the mobile dual core parts only.</p>
<p>The rest of the industry didn't believe they could make 2d transistors work for another generation, the rest of the industry DID make it work for another generation. THat is, the industry was 2-3 years behind Intel and Intel went finfet at 22nm while everyone else moved to 28nm with planar transistors and those processes were fine.</p>
<p>The problem Intel had at 14nm and the rest had at 20nm wasn't planar or finfet, it was double patterning. The wavelength of the light used in etching is, I'll try and recall it from memory, I think it 163nm or maybe 183, I forget exactly. To use these wavelengths to etch things below a again I'll do this from memory, 80nm metal pitch I believe, you need to use double patterning. Intel had huge trouble with that which is why 14nm had far more trouble than 22nm. The rest of the industry planned 20nm for planar and 14 or 16nm(for tsmc) finfets on the 20nm metal layers(because in large part the metal layers being 20nm makes not a huge amount of difference). It was planned on purpose as a two step process to specifically not try and do double patterning and finfet at exactly the same time. Planar transistors just really didn't scale below, well 22nm officially but unofficially I think Intel's 22nm is a generous naming, more like 23-24nm and below planar just isn't offering good enough performance. </p>
<p>It was with double patterning and the switch to finfet that the industry closed the gap on Intel massively as compared to 22/28nm. With the step to 10/7nm, whatever individual companies call it, again Intel is struggling and has taken longer and their lead looks likely to be actually gone by the start of 2019.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of 14nm is really mostly 20nm. All &quot;<em>X</em>nm&quot; numbers are pretty much meaningless theses day and are more for marketing.</p>
<p>Intel is really, I believe, the only one doing real 14nm on a large scale. </p>

<p>It's all a trade off. The split L3 cache does impair performance in certain cases. </p>
<p>I.E. For the sake of scaling one design over a range, they cripple a (fairly important) part of the CPU. </p></div>		</li>
