			<div class="markdown"><p>But notably they don't do one per astronaut. They have a stock that is shared and they have a few in-built adjustments to fit them to different people.</p>
<p>The only bespoke bits an astronaut has are their gloves, which need to be individually tailored to give them some modicum of dexterity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm reading &quot;The Martian&quot; right now and just knowing what he uses the EVA suits for and how he mutilates them makes my head spin. I can only imagine how much money he &quot;wasted&quot; (don't really want to call it waste because he was using it all to survive) total fidgeting with all the equipment...I'm looking at you /r/dataisbeautiful for some answers ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Apollo era space suit was actually made by International Latex Corporation (known these days as Playtex), who had experience making brassiere and girdles. They still make women's underwear to this day.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is an article out there about the specialty sewing teams that not only sew dozens of layers of the weirdest stuff together, but also manage to get the stitching perfect down to the sub-millimeter.</p>
<p>As someone whose crowning sewing achievement is making a dress shirt once, I can tell you this is just short of voodoo and well worth the read.</p></div>		</li>
