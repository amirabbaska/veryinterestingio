			<div class="markdown"><p>No, because we can't make a field anywhere near that large on Earth. The magnetar field (which is lethal 100 km away, by the way) is around 10^(9) times stronger than any field we can produce on Earth, which means its energy density is 10^(18) times as large as any field on Earth.</p>
<p>Edit: The magnetic field is actually lethal much farther away due to its radiation.</p></div>		</li>
