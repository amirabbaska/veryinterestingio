<p>In terms of chemical engineering, we never consider these limits. Most of our equations discount these extreme effects. This ends up being frictional heat generation limited problem.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If we make some silly assumptions, such as an unbreakable tube with frictionless walls and a infinite pressure pump, then the speed of light is what stops you at that point.</p>

<p>No, even using infinite pressure, you can't accelerate it past the speed of sound propagation through that fluid.</p>
<p>Although if you add on another assumption, that the speed of sound equals the speed of light, then yeah.</p></div>		</li>
