			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh okay LOL moveable type went away with the invention of the Linotype machine OP, which was widely adopted in the first decades of the 20th century. A newspaper in 1971 would have nothing to do with moveable type or metal type, everything was photo composed by then at any major publication.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Those hot, greasy, clanking machines were pretty cool.</p>
<p>The video shows them at work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Curious about this, because back in the 1980s the print unions where I grew up were in the middle of a massive fight against the Murdoch press because (among many other reasons) the latter wanted to use computerization to slash printing costs, and the unions (whose members, to hear the Murdoch side tell it, had grown fat on ridiculous overtime rules like getting double time if they had to typeset things with foreign words in). So even as later at 1985 I think hot metal was still in use.  </p>
<p>Another data point is that the Guardian newspaper was infamously badly typeset and was riddled with errors every week, which surely would be harder to mess up with linotype.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Anyone who wants to check out what newspaper typesetting was like right before computerization should check out the short documentary, “Farewell, Etaoin Shrdlu.” It was filmed at the New York Times in 1978 at the very end of the “hot lead” Linotype era. It shows how type was set, articles laid out on a page, etc. through a completely mechanical process. It doesn’t have much on how they did illustrations, but the sheer physical effort and noise that went into printing each issue of a newspaper is fantastic to see. It’s free to watch on the Internet Archive, <a href="https://archive.org/details/FarewellEtaoinShrdlu" target="_blank">https://archive.org/details/FarewellEtaoinShrdlu</a></p></div>		</li>
