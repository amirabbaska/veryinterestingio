This may be a case of having to learn from nothing, but it appears possible. Merely VERY hard. The patients desire to learn and their ability to continue in the face of a LOT of failure would be the limiting factors, vice technology. As a psychology student, I think a modified version of the mirror boxes for phantom limb pain might be useful. Movies/pre-programmed movements of the limbs as the patient tries to move the limb, then slowly move control over to the patient while still using external controls, with eventual full control on the patients side. We've done this with monkeys to give them a third arm, so I imagine giving a human their first arm is doable, just hard.</p></div>		</li>
