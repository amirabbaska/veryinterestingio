			<div class="markdown"><p>In theory, there should be absolutely no difference in reaction and interaction between matter and anti-matter, and that's what the experiment proves.</p>
<p>Antimatter is the matter made up of anti-particles — each particle has its counterpart, for example electrons have positrons, protons have anti-protons. The anti-particles could be created in a lab but annihilate quickly — when they interact with a &quot;normal&quot; particle the two just disappear with a burst of light (well, gamma rays), and normal particles are in abundance around us (it's all there is around us).
There is no solid answer why the universe consists of matter and not equal parts matter and anti-matter, but current theory states that matter and anti-matter are exactly the same, just with opposite charges.</p>
<p>Atomic anti-matter is extremely hard to study. Creating positrons and anti-protons is easy, and it's easy to trap them in magnetic field, but when you pair them up to become the simplest gas there is — anti-hydrogen (one positron orbiting one anti-proton), it becomes way less magnetic and just drifts off to collide with the nearest &quot;normal&quot; matter and annihilate. And you can't trap anti-neutrons that are charge-free, so more complex atoms are not something that we would see any time soon.</p>
<p>The study shows that anti-hydrogen is, as it was expected from the current theory, the same as matter in its optical properties — same absorption spectrum, and therefore same basic energy levels, at least at the level of detail that were obtained in that experiment. And energy levels are what define the way atoms react to become molecules, and the way molecules interact with each other and light, and that's the whole chemistry.
So, the experiment supports our current knowledge of particle hierarchy and symmetry, and the idea that anti-matter would be indistinguishable from the &quot;normal&quot; matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instead of an opposite charge, they have an opposite baryon number — +1 for neutron and -1 for anti-neutron. The baryon number is a number that does not reflect on physical properties of a single particle and only comes up in a Shrodinger equation — so, important to chemistry, impossible to use to trap the particle in any sort of field.
The reason neutron and anti-neutron still annihilate is the same as with proton and anti-proton — they consist of quarks and anti-quarks, which annihilate on collisions, making sure there's noting left. So it's a little bit different from electron and positron, as they are compound particles, but the principle is absolutely the same.</p>
<p>And by the way that is how we know that the matter and antimatter will be exactly the same. If we replace all the quantum numbers (baryon number is a quantum number) in Shrodinger equation with their opposites, the solution (or approximation, for everything that is not anti-hydrogen) ends up looking exactly the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And by the way, the reason anti-neutrons were discovered is that anti-protons and protons are both baryons, composite particles.
When elementary particles, such as electron and positron react, they just eliminate each other with a clean sterile burst of rays — they release two gamma photons, which are just pure energy, basically light. Simple, sterile, efficient.
But the baryons are different. Protons and neutrons are shaped quite literally are like 3 tennis balls stuck together, if you replace tennis balls with dimensionless point-like particles that use the weirdest kind of force in the universe to interact. But they are in fact triangular, and when they interact it's not 2 opposite particles reacting. Their reaction depends on the angle of their collision, and the whole reaction is a complete hot mess — new particles get born, live for a short time and annihilate again, quarks show their weird relationship to each other, quantum chromodynamics gets involved. That is why anti-neutrons were observed in high energy collisions of protons and anti-protons.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Neutrons and Protons are made out of Quarks. There is an &quot;Up Quarks&quot; and a &quot;Down Quarks&quot;. A Proton is made of two <em>Up</em> and one <em>Down</em>, while Neutrons are two <em>Down</em> and one <em>Up</em>.</p>
<p>An Up Quark has a 2/3 Positive charge, while Down Quarks as a 1/3 Negative charge, thus Protons have a 1 Positive charge, and Neutrons have a neutral charge.</p>
<p>Anti-Neutrons and Anti-Protons are made of Anti-Quarks, where the Anti Up Quark has a 2/3 Negative charge, and Down has a 1/3 Positive charge.</p>
<p>So both Neutrons and Anti-Neutrons are a neutral charge, but that's only because their component quarks cancel out the net-charge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean, since antimatter is impossible to contain, it would be impossible to make a bomb out of it.
We are able to contain matter only with different matter. But antimatter would annihilate on contact with it. For charged anti-particles scientists use magnetic fields that allow them to keep them from touching any old regular matter. But then again particles with the same charge repulse each other, and you cannot store a lot of charged particles together — the amount of energy needed to keep them from together escalates exponentially with their mass.
And then there's mass. They have mass and will eventually drift towards earth, the more mass you try to contain, the more energy you would have to devote to that.</p>
<p>If we could imagine a giant anti-matter factory in space, somehow protected from solar wind (which consists of boring old matter) and interstellar gas, we would have trouble producing anything besides hydrogen. All the heavy elements, that is absolutely anything, was produced during fusion inside dying stars. Doing something like that remotely without touching anything and having contained chambers — just crazy difficult.
Now then. If we were able to produce some solid antimatter, say, anti-water ice, it would be a bomb on itself. Don't need a trigger, just drop it onto the Earth to create a huge hole in it. Anti-matter would not just smash everything up — it would actually destroy a mass equal to its own. No other bomb does that.</p>
<p>But the ball would destroy itself long before hitting the earth surface, so it would just shower the earth with deadly gamma rays. </p>
<p>Now, if you were to make an ATOMIC bomb out of anti-uranium and encase it into anti-steel case and explode it on anti-earth, it would produce exactly the same explosion as a normal atomic bomb would on Earth.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, assuming both of you are in a vacuum (otherwise your clone would annihilate with the air around him). You'd release roughly as much energy as humanity uses in a week, by the way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well since you're not a couple of leptons (such as electrons), you will burst into a huge explosion that would produce a whole lot of different subatomic particles, including exotic ones.
There will be a huge gamma ray burst though, across the entire spectrum, from all the annihilations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Within the realm of antimatter itself, anti-hydrogen and anti-oxygen can create anti-water, at least theoretically. I'm not sure it's ever been seen, yet, but it would stand to reason. It's also still unclear if antimatter behaves like normal matter under the influence of gravity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nothing, particularly, but it's the sort of thing we ought to check before we say we know. Maybe anti matter somehow has negative gravitational mass - that would put a twist in things! See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_interaction_of_antimatter" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>But gravity is such a weak force that it's exceedingly difficult to isolate its effects in an experiment that takes place under very short time scales and in a very confined area, so we don't know yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They would likely annihilate. The &quot;orbiting&quot; electrons would enter in contact with the &quot;orbiting&quot; positrons and annihilate.

			<div class="markdown"><p>In nature, nothing heavier than antiprotons has been found. In the lab we produced a lot of antiprotons (and caught some), heavier antihydrogen isotopes and some antihelium nuclei - but those were too spread out to capture them.</p>
<p>We currently don't have a way to produce heavier antinuclei. Collisions between heavy ions are the only way to get antihelium-4, the next stable antinucleus would be antilithium-6. The STAR experiment produced and found 18 antihelium-4 nuclei, and antilithium-6 is a million times rarer...</p></div>		</li>
