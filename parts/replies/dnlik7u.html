			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes but strictly the redshift is degenerate with the total mass, they can however measure the luminosity distance by fitting the event and then calculate the redshift. It's hoped in the near future (and there are some rumours) that there will be gravitational wave events with counterparts that can be detected with telescopes and hence measure the redshift. With that and the luminosity distance you can test cosmology like type 1a supernovae, the difference here would be that insprials should be extraordinarily clean where as supernovae require modelling and standardisation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe? I mean, redshift is due to the stretching of space, right? And gravitational waves are oscillations of space, so they're not inside space and can't be stretched by it like light, I think? Maybe not, maybe they can't be redshifted.</p></div>		</li>
