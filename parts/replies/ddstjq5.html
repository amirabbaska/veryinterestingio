<p>The 8-bit processor would itself come with a ROM - read-only-memory, which would provide basic functionality. To the best of my knowledge, this was actually hardware. As in, the programs were written with logic gates.</p>

<p>I suspect that it was more likely to have been a PROM chip. AFAIK most BASIC interpreters for 8-bit home computers were still written as code, not cobbled together using individual logic gates, that would've been way too time-consuming.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Windows (and Apple) changed things up by offering not just an operating system that let you organize your computer, but also offered direct support to integrate your programs into that system.  It's easy to forget that this was not a primary task of the operating system before GUI's started to take over.</p></div>		</li>
