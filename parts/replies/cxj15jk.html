			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how they used to design them. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was a chair designed for bottoms, by bottoms. Schreckengost molded a prototype of this chair out of plastocene clay in the Murray-Ohio factory and asked each employee to sit in it. A day's worth of body warmth — Spirk estimates hundreds of people sat there — softened the clay into a seat custom-designed for comfort. The metal chair was stamped from the clay prototype and mounted on a single steel tube crafted into a frame. &quot;You couldn't go in a backyard and not see a Viktor Schreckengost chair,&quot; says Spirk. &quot;It was a fashion statement in addition to being a functional piece of goods.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is done for a number of products, including medical diagnostic dipsticks like pregnancy tests or rapid strep tests. We call it stability testing. Finished packaged products from every single lot are kept at a range of temperatures/humidity from cool/dry to hot/humid and the various hot/humid tests can mimic longer shelf life periods. </p>
<p>Periodic testing of these lots at each condition is mandated for quality control and helps ensure expiration dates are accurate and kit materials work as specified.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. Stability of these, and many other, devices and products is tested at different temperature and humidity levels.  Things degrade more quickly at higher temperatures, generally at twice the rate for each 10 degrees C increase because reaction rates increase at higher temperatures.  This is known as the &quot;Q10&quot; effect.</p></div>		</li>
