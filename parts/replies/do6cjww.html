			<div class="markdown"><p>And yet I don't see my finger undergoing metamorphosis :( man it's awesome how life has been able to adapt and evolve. Do you have any idea how butterflies evolved to have extreme stages like that?  Most bugs have a larval stage yah?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a weird comparison, because AFAIK there aren't neurons in a finger.  There are nerve endings -- the extensions of neurons located in the spinal cord -- but the density of those is higher in a fingertip than in literally any other place in the body, so it seems strange to use &quot;neurons in the finger&quot; as a way to say &quot;an impressively small number.&quot;  Maybe I'm just not understanding your comment, or maybe my memory of anatomy is failing me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep pet insects, and for me, development is sped up or slowed down by a mixture of food and temperature. Lots of food and higher temperatures increase bug growth, less food and cooler temperatures slow it down.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never really thought about a mantis as a pet. I caught one as a kid and kept it in a bottle for a couple of days before releasing it, but that's about it.</p>
<p>If I were to make a Vivrarium, with a focus on having fish in the bottom with land and plants up top, do you think a mantis would be appropriate? It wouldn't eat the smaller fish, or go for a swim and become food for bigger fish, would it?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Its nervous system is nowhere nearly complex enough to allow it that level of choice sophistication.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worked with butterflies and moths for a while, and I'd get questions involving some level of anthropomorphizing of the insects and their &quot;decisions&quot; pretty frequently. </p>
<p>Felt a bit bad when I had to tell people bugs are basically little DNA-based robots, but it was pretty rewarding once (or if) they &quot;got&quot; it. </p>
<p>Part of the reason bugs are surprisingly easy to work with is because they're so predictable. Because they're basically little DNA-based robots. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actual 5 year old version:</p>
<p>When the caterpillar eats lots and gets fat, it sheds its skin. When the caterpillar gets to a certain age, instead of just shedding when it gets fat the caterpillar will make a cocoon so it can become a butterfly. </p>
<p>If the caterpillar hasn't eaten enough, the skin shedding or cocoon making won't happen as soon. It will wait for a little while so it can be ready.</p></div>		</li>
