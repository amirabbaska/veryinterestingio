			<div class="markdown"><p>This is all excellent data and makes a lot of sense. With more modern series' that benefit greatly from post-production and can limit preproduction, it can seemingly be very easy to make content with such speed (not saying that filmography is at all an <em>easy</em> job).  </p>
<p>In closing: thank you for this and if someone wants to make a ten-hour LOTR or Mad Max movie, I would be actually okay with that.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is mostly unique to animation but also large effects-heavy big-budget movies.   There can be a really lengthy pre-production period (the longest I've been involved with was 2 years but this can vary upward).   Once a project is greenlit which means it's funded, it goes into preproduction.  That can entail having a couple of people involved in developing the technical approach to making the movie (how are we going to portray an army of 10,000 giants on screen?  what will all these aliens and vehicles look like?).  This can take a long time but because it's only a couple of people, it's not such a big deal because of a low burn rate on the production costs.</p>
<p>Once you start ramping up staff to preproduction - more artists doing look development, more art directors, more assets and technology support personnel coming on the books for the project, then things need to start meeting some milestone deadlines to show steady progress.</p>
<p>Production itself can take months to over a year.  In animation, the bulk of it is in 2 phases - voice performance which can be expensive if you use a cast of A celebs - and then animation and rendering by the CG artists.  Once shots are lit (in cg) and start moving through the production pipeline, you are burning up all your render farm time 24hrs/day 7days/wk for months.  You start piling on more and more artists at the peak of production.  Hundreds.  Then, you start ramping down.  Early production departments roll off, leaving behind one on-call member to address any shot-specific technical issues (modeling changes, puppetry/skinning, textures and shading, crowd management and physics...) .  Toward the end of production people roll off like a commuter train pulling at each stop.  Once it reaches terminus, it should be just a bunch of  department heads and support technical directors coming off the show.  </p>
<p>Simultaneously, editing continues to assemble and stitch the movie.  Soundtracks get refined to the timing, color balancing is done in post to assure continuity.  </p>
<p>The reason a GoT gets so many episodes done is that the truth is a movie could very easily be 8 hours long.  Editing is constantly refining and distilling the movie into the most time-economical way of telling the story.  I'm not saying that GoT stretches things out purposefully but its story telling does involve &quot;saving revelations&quot; to later episodes and so it can afford to stall out certain aspects of its many character sub plots.  </p>
<p>GoT is primarily structured like a soap opera.  Same character amounts with similar story arcs - big overall crisis over smaller mini-crisises.  Cliffhangers.</p>
<p>Movies have to wrap it all up within 90-120 minutes.  You have to do it all in 3 acts (sometimes 4).  It's more restrictive.  The movie has to resolve its ending.  GOT can figure out how it'll end in 10 years.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Out of curiosity, how are these people paid? As in, are they paid hourly for actual work on a specific movie? If you are the remaining &quot;on-call&quot; person for your department, are you compensated for making yourself generally available in this fashion? How free would they be to start work on a different production? Or are these people just general employees of the studio or something and get moved around as needed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're general employees of the studio hired on permanently.  For production accounting and billing purposes, you get assigned to be on a specific movie crew.  You roll off one production and ideally the producers time things so you're needed at another production.  EDIT: it's not unusual to be on two productions at once.  You split your time however you need to and your contract is billed to two movies on some fixed ratio - i.e. 40% on Fast and the Furious 8, 60% on The Martian 2.  </p>
<p>Despite facts to the contrary, studios do try hard to avoid having to hire and lay off on a per-movie basis when it comes to CG work.  The training is expensive and finding talent is hard so once you have a functional crew it's best to keep it working.  But sometimes a movie bombs and you have less funding for your next 3 movies so you have to go down to 2 and that means laying off 30% of a crew.  (This is where pirating hurt business and artists - diminished revenue means cutbacks based on diminished expectations of future performance)</p>
<p>Pay is usually salaried.  If you're lucky to be in a guild/labor union, you'll be compensated for overtime.  The contracts usually have some overtime built into it.  One way to think of it is that you're expected to work 5-10 hours of overtime each week for your salary.  Another is that if you don't have to work overtime, you still get paid the same amount.  If you have to pay over 10 hours of overtime, you actually get paid for that as extra compensation on top of your salary.  It all depends on your contract however.  Some shops will make you work all night without extra pay.  it's illegal but it's rampant in VFX.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the structure for a soap opera so broad that literally most if not all shows can be lumped in that category? When I think of soap opera I think of Days of Our Lives.</p>
<p>But people say GoT and Walking Dead are structured like soap operas and that means absolutely nothing to me. There are fundamental differences. What other &quot;structures&quot; exist for TV drama? Are they also broad enough that almost any drama can fit in that structure, too, like soap operas?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>A soap opera is <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/soap%20opera" target="_blank">continuing stories about the daily lives and problems of a group of people</a>. Sometimes people define them as shows that need to be watched serial to make the most sense.  Walking Dead, Chuck, the various Star Trek franchises, Gray's Anatomy, etc. Each episode is part of many story arcs. While it may have a single plot point for the episode, you generally cannot pick up one episode, say Season 2 episode 6, watch it, and be complete. Each episode advances some of the problems but you need to watch long story arcs to get the full experience.</p>
<p>Probably the extreme opposite end are shows like Mythbusters, you can watch any episode independent of the rest of the series and it is complete.  There is no &quot;tune in next week to see what happens to Kari and Grant!&quot;</p>
<p>Comedy formats (sit-com, rom-com, dramatic comedies) tend to avoid the soap opera format. The world is basically reset at the end of each episode. You can pick a random episode of one of these and watch it independent of the others.  Pick out a single episode of MASH, or Saturday Night Live, Futurama, and it stands on its own. They reuse the same characters between episodes and occasionally have a plot point when gaining or losing a character, but otherwise are independent of each other.</p>
<p>Other shows try to follow a common pattern with minimal serial-development. Police dramas are often good at this, the show is about a single event, like murder, theft.  Some of them have soap opera components where their personal lives have bigger story arcs, other shows are fully independent with no character growth.  Pick any episode of Matlock or Perry Mason and it stands alone. Others have some soap opera components, like Psych that mostly stands alone but also has evolving relationships between Shawn and Juliet and Gus's series of girlfriends.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong, but I think it implies that character arcs and relationships evolve throughout the course of many episodes/ seasons and the plot is a continuous thread. The opposite of a say, a sitcom, which just resets with each new episode. </p>
<p>I agree though it's an unhelpfully broad classification that could apply to many shows. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Screenwriter here (film/television/video games). </p>
<p>This is helpful but it isn't entirely correct (incidentally, a lot of the GOT &quot;sets&quot; are primarily CGI).</p>
<ul>
<li>Many films shoot much longer than a couple months (eg. Apocalypse Now) because they are scheduled to take longer to shoot. It's just acceptable as the process.</li>
</ul>
<p>Television schedules are much more demanding on the time front.  For reference, a television show will shoot 3-12 pages of script a day (usually around he 7-8 mark for 1hr. dramas). A film may shoot a half page in a day - or just one line of stage direction in several days (eg. Stunt sequences).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While film releases can be pushed a few months without major problems, television shows don't have that luxury (they'll lose audience, lose actors they have on hold, etc.). Not a lot of fans will tolerate a season of a show being pushed 6mths or a year. </p>
</li>
<li>The style of shooting is very different in television and film. Television directors generally have fewer cameras to work, fewer lights, fewer cranes, etc. Basically fewer options for shooting because the budget is more restrictive. Fewer options and fewer moving parts means fewer opportunities for things to take a long time, mistakes to be made, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>For reference, a television director typically has 2/3 cameras to work with to shoot an episode while a film director may have 6 cameras rolling just to capture an actor jumping a fence (which was the case in one of the Taken movies).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In addition, film directors are permitted to do &quot;auteur&quot; things like only shoot using natural light (Revenant) or only shoot during &quot;golden hour&quot; (Days of Heaven). Obviously that slows production down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prep time is extended for films. A television episode may prep for 2-3 weeks (depending on budget). A feature can prep for months or even years. </p>
</li>
<li>A lot of this is about budget. A feature can cost $200 million to make so the scripts, actors, directing, will constantly be tweaked based on what the studio thinks will get them the best return. </li>
</ul>
<p>For example, It isn't uncommon to have a script written by 8-10 different writers, one after another (each rewrite requiring tons of time to implement notes from the lead actor, studio, director, etc.) if the studio thinks the movie is going to miss the market it's intended for, they'll scrap it, reshoot it (eg. Back to the Future), etc.</p>
<p>Conversely, a television show can shoot a pilot for as little as $500k (up to maybe like $10million which is rare). If it fails, they scrap the show and move on. With less skin in the game, it's easier to walk away and chalk it up as an acceptable loss. Not a lot of folks are inclined to give up on a project with a quarter of a billion sunk into it so they rebuild it instead.</p>
<p>There are notable exceptions where there isn't much difference between how a TV show and feature are shot in the new world of TV (eg. House o Cards) but there aren't - lot of shows like that. </p></div>		</li>
