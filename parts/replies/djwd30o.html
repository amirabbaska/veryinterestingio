			<div class="markdown"><p>I've wondered about this too, I've seen several maps all projecting the same thing, but no one ever explains why they think the Atlantic becomes a subduction zone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is what I would think, too. The Atlantic Ocean has been growing, and it still is growing today. What would change the direction of continental drift?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the last one is called Pangea Ultima because considering the age of the Sun it will be the last time Pangea will be able to be formed.</p>
<p>I think I read on the wikipedia that the formation of super continents is cyclical. Once a super continent is formed it separates again. At a certain point they start to merge again.</p>
<p>However at some time, I don't remember when, the Sun will become a Red Giant, and the Earth will be so close to the Sun that it may be swallowed by our star. If Earth isn't eaten by the Sun, then it will be so close that the strong solar wind will blow away all the water from our planet. Once there is no water, continental drifting will stop because the water is needed to lubricate the tectonic plaques.</p>
<p>Sorry for the Engrish. No auto corrector here.</p></div>		</li>
