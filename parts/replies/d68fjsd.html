			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that the words don't always mean anything.  Aikido is very philosophical in nature, where as Kendo is almost nothing more than a sport, and Judo is more of an offshoot of Jujutsu.</p>
<p>Gotta do your research/get into the &quot;hobby&quot; to start getting a better sense of things.</p>
<p>There's actually a school of Aikido which is extremely violent in its responses, which might actually be frowned upon by others as being unnecessary.</p></div>		</li>

<p>To add to that, your research should include not just the martial art/sport you're interested in, but the schools for it in your area.  What the martial art is supposed to teach and what the schools in your area actually teach don't always line up.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It was my understanding that that was exactly what Kendo was, maybe more theater than sport even. My instructor even pointed out that the outfit and movement had nothing to do with practicality and where purely there to add to the appeal of watching it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Martial arts in general have changed greatly over time. The majority of them have gradually become less lethal and more focussed on the practice of a healthy mind in a healthy body with a decent dose of sports and self defence.</p>
<p>Take for instance kung fu. The fastest ways of disabling opponents are often devastating for the opponent. Go back in the history of kung fu and many of the styles are full of techniques to break fingers and wrists, destroy joints, tear muscle lose from bone and pop eyeballs.</p>
<p>Essentially stuff that'll immediately remove your opponents ability to attack you without increasing the risk by dragging out the fight.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, since many martial arts are practiced as sports, there are rules, for instance by defining no strike zones. Where there are rules, people play to take advantage of those rules. For instance sportsmen don't guard zones that don't aware the opponents points for striking them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting that you'd correct the Wade-Giles transcription of &quot;kung fu&quot; to &quot;gung fu,&quot; instead of the pinyin standard of &quot;gong fu.&quot; Do you know Cantonese perhaps? Otherwise, I'm surprised you used &quot;gung fu,&quot; as it's neither of the standard romanizations for 功夫.</p></div>		</li>

<p>10v1, you'll have 10 attackers panting while the defender might have a light sweat at best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, can you clarify what you mean by this?  You don't actually believe this do you?</p>
<p>Edit:  The amount of people here who think life is like a kung fu movie is honestly baffling.  Aikido is about as effective as Tai Chi or Yoga in a real fight situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the attackers are your average thugs and don't have guns, I can totally see this happening. If the defender is skilled, practiced, and smart enough, they can easily fend off multiple attackers. When it comes to multiple attackers you can have at max only four people attacking you at once, and that's only if they surround you. If you make sure you don't get stuck in the middle of a group, say by keeping one or two people between you and the rest, you can take them down one by one.</p>
<p>That, and aikido is very good at dodging and using people's attacks against them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'd love to see this in action, because watching, for example, stephen segal in action, I'd put my money on three unarmed thugs beating the snot out of him, or any other aikido master.</p>
<p>sure the organized dancing they do looks pretty, but the master would get floored if any of the attackers actually, you know <em>attacked</em> them</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an ex doorman, this is easier than it sounds 3 attackers is actually harder than 4. 4+ just fuck up each others lines and it's very easy to start pushing them into each other and piling them up. Adrenaline then kicks and crowds gather, if there's to many you end up with a bunch of confused people who aren't sure who to swing at. And out the door they goo.. that's without aikido, just experience in large fights. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's basically the key to a lot of it, just taking advantage of them getting in the way of eachother and helping that to happen.</p>
<p>Two people run at you in a 90 degree arc, and you move one of them into the way of the other and you've completed two defensive actions with one movement.</p></div>		</li>
