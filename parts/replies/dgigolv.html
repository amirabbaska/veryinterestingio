			<div class="markdown"><p>Fantastic explanation! Thank you. This is a great springboard for further research. I didn't even know &quot;antibonding orbitals&quot; were a thing. In all my studies of chemistry, I've never come across that term before. PCET is also a new concept to me and I'd never heard of nitrogenase before either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Antibonding orbitals are something you typically learn about in your senior year as an undergraduate chemistry major, so you're definitely not alone.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more, look into molecular orbital theory.</p>
<p>EDIT: A lot of people are saying that they learned about MO freshman year. Yes, we got into it freshman year briefly as well. But I'd argue that you don't really <em>understand</em> it until you take a course on inorganic chemistry and appreciate the quantum mechanics and group theory behind it. It's a lot more complicated than they initially let on in general chemistry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good to know! </p>
<p>Funny thing is, when I was in high school, I <em>hated</em> chemistry with a passion. I went for a decade afterwards thinking I hated chemistry. I only recently discovered that I actually really like it. I'm bordering on fanatically obsessed. It's so endlessly fascinating! Unfortunately, much to my dismay, it's also endlessly DEEP! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, yeah. I'm just a dorky little enthusiast so it's REALLY making my head spin. :P It's a highly abstract concept and it's hard to visualize. I think I understand it, it was very well explained, but I'm still going to need to do some research before I feel confident in my understanding of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You should definitely take microbiology classes (will learn about enzymes such as nitrogenase) as well as molecular bio, &amp; obviously biochem. If you want to learn more about pathways I took a great class called physiology of microorganisms, it's really the basics of metabolism </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Important to note that this is not something that most organisms can do. It's usually specific types of soil bacteria, and they are so important for plants that some kinds of plants have special root nodules just for holding these kinds of bacteria. </p>
<p>Pretty much everything else gets their nitrogen by eating organisms that have already incorporated the fixed nitrogen into things like amino acids and proteins. Nitrogen is an important part of plant fertilizer for this reason. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Today in biology we cut open one of these nodules to observe the presence of N fixing bacteria.  Nodules turn a pink or red color when fixation is active and occur most commonly on fabaceous plants (members of the bean and pea family which includes many trees as well).  I took <a href="http://imgur.com/BT1EZs5" target="_blank">this picture</a> today in class showing a bean plant with the excised nodule.  It is important to note that this fixation benefits the host plant which eventually dies.  The decomposition of the host then releases the nitrogen into the soil profile allowing other plants and organisms to benefit from the process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just one strain or species, there are whole families of them. Life is highly interconnected and different organisms fill different niches. Plants and phytoplankton can turn CO2 and sunlight into sugars, animals can't.</p>
<p>Humans are pretty near the top of the food chain, we depend on lots of lower level organisms. We can't turn sunlight into sugar, we can't fix nitrogen, we can't make any of the essential amino acids, or any of the vitamins (except Vitamin D, from sunlight). We get all these things from our food, which is made of living matter. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons it will be so incredibly difficult to establish a human colony on Mars or the moon. If we want to survive longer than whatever food we packed with us, we'll need to figure out how to make all of the things our bodies can't make. We don't get our nitrogen from ammonia or nitrate, but we do get it from protein and if you go far enough back in the food chain, the nitrogen in the protein we eat started out as N2 that got fixed by a bacterium (or more recently from a synthetic fertilzer that did it with something like the Haber-Bosch process <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process</a>). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've noticed your tag is inorganic chem and bioinorganic chem. The second one seems a bit counter intuitive. Is that to do with the roles of different inorganic ions like Na+ in a nerve impulse, or Phosphates/Nitrates in plants? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So you must be on top of the couple really unique metal centers in the nitrogenase complex. I saw a really good guest lecture senior year about the complex, but have moved away from enzymes in my graduate studies. </p>
<p>Do you do any work on nitrogenase? Love to hear more about it. </p></div>		</li>
