			<div class="markdown"><p>Bears and raccoons and such tend to kick over logs to raid insect colonies, where they can harvest large quantities without much chase. See also: the ant eater and the honey badger. </p>
<p>But yeah, chasing individual flying insects so you can eat them one at a time? That shit’s for the birds!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I wanted to reply to my own comment to point out that there <em>are</em> a lot easy to gather bugs, like grubs, some worms, termite mounds, etc.</p>
<p>But the problem is that the easy to gather bugs usually don't exist in sufficient quantities to keep a community alive for any length of time.  Even one person can take the easily accessible ones in a short period of time. And then he's left wandering looking around for <em>which</em> log to flip over, or flipping them all over and hoping there's something there.  We can't smell them the way a bear can, after all....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True. The more I think about it, the more curious I am about birds. Don’t they have pretty high metabolisms to support? Are insects actually a big part of their diet? I had thought so, but they don’t really have what it takes to raid a colony.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Some Australian Aboriginals used to rely heavily on termites for food during some parts of the year. This is probably one of the few instance where it <del>camel</del> can work, though, as the termites live in large above ground colonies so the density and availability is high.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not entirely true. However, we should first start by saying that &quot;insect&quot; is probably not scientifically intended, and &quot;bugs&quot; would be the better term. We're not talking about strictly 6-legged arthropods, I presume, but we could include worms, spiders, millipedes, etc. </p>
<p>While it's certainly true of chasing grasshoppers down in an open field, then cooking them only to be left with a tiny bit of nutrients per bug, there are lots of ways to beat those numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type - grasshoppers look big, but there's not a lot of &quot;meat&quot; on them. It's mostly legs that make them seem bigger than they are. Caterpillars or worms, on the other hand, are much more dense with less exoskeleton. </li>
<li>Source - find a rotting log and you may well find a handful of maggots. Cook 'em in a stew, and you might get a whole lotta calories there. </li>
<li>Trapping/farming - using an artificial light source, you could probably catch a lot of flies. I'm not sure if the nutrients would be all that good, and the flavour sure isn't, but ya gotta do what you gotta do. </li>
</ul>
<p>I don't think anyone's on the verge of advocating for cricket cookies to replace hamburgers, but it's more tasty than you think and a lot of protein. </p>
<p>With all that said, the best bet is probably still to bring hook and line, and use it to catch fish. </p>
