			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah &quot;migraine&quot; as a term is often overused. People who say &quot;oh yeah I had a migraine earlier today but I feel ok now&quot; did not have a migraine, they had a headache. If they had a migraine, they would not be speaking to you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I kinda wish people wouldn't declare that their experience is the only valid one.</p>
<p>My typical migraines run almost like clockwork: wake me up at 3am, in bed wishing I were dead til noon, when the vomiting starts, and then it starts to break around 3pm. So I <em>do</em> manage to drag my sad, disoriented self to my second job on some migraine days, and by &quot;ok&quot; I mean I'm upright.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily.  Migraines can last as little as 4 hours. If I have a chance to take medicine and sleep it off, I can say that I had a migraine earlier in the day and feel better later in the day. It all depends on your type of migraine and how you manage it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I am gauranteed at least 2 days a year where I am completely non functional due to migraine pain.</p>
<p>One happened to be when I was camping last fall.  Pain, auras, vomiting, all the fun stuff.</p>
<p>Friend gave me an 800mg Motrin.</p>
<p>Puked 45 minutes later.</p>
<p>2 hours later, I was somehow functioning.  4 hours later, I was almost normal, with just a touch discomfort... And surrealism.</p>
<p>I was pretty happy about that.  Those usually put me down for a day, and wreck the next two.</p>
<p>Longest was a 3 day pain fest.  Never came closer to suicide than on that stretch.</p>
<p>Migraines are not to be fucked with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nobody knows is spot on. The vascular constriction theory is somewhat outdated. More recent research has been looking at Cortical Spreading Depression, sort of a wave of misfiring, or non-firing, neurons across the brain.  </p>
<p>Migraine is technically considered to be an ongoing disease. What we normally call a &quot;migraine&quot; is actually a single episode of the disease.  </p>
<p>There are 4 stages to a migraine episode:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Prodome: all those weird symptoms (mood changes, food cravings, stiffness, incessant yawning) that can start days in advance and give you that &quot;somebody else is driving&quot; sensation in the pit of your stomach.  </li>
<li>Aura: sensory disturbances so bizarre that you totally understand how Carroll wrote Alice In Wonderland without drugs (visual, auditory, and/or sensory hallucinations; complete numbness on one side of the body; thinking someone is touching you when there's no one there; aphasia, the loss of or scrambling of words...). Not all migrainers experience aura. Lucky them.</li>
<li>Attack: the star of the show. The Ice Pick. The Vice Grip. The Sucker Punch. The Mudhammad Ali. The Sarah Winchester. Whatever your type of pain, it is as unique to each individual as the special little snowflakes we all are.  </li>
<li>Postdome: The Hangover. Really. And like the movies, by the time you have the third one, you're seriously at the point of, Just shoot me now.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That migraine hangover though... past the worst, but raising blood pressure causes these waves of pulsing headaches, and moving your head quickly hurts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I get all of that about 1-2 a month. It's usually weather-related. I've had far fewer migraines since I moved to Los Angeles from New York. </p>
<p>The prodome for me is trouble speaking and/or numbness in my fingertips.  Or I get a sharp throbbing pain in my neck just under my jaw. I asked my migraine specialist and he never heard of anyone getting that kind of throbbing.  :::shrug  lucky me:::</p>
<p>I get the aura. To me, it looks like a sparkly rattlesnake that grows and takes over my vision and gives me a 40 minute window to take my migraine medicine before the real pain makes me want to kill myself. </p>
<p>If I take my Maxalt at the first sign of migraine, I don't get the pain, usually. Sometimes the meds only knock it down to a very bad headache and then I need an ice pack for my head. </p>
<p>But the absolute worst part for me is the postdrome.  My legs feel ike 100 lb cement blocks, each.  I'm so mentally out of it and this generally lasts a few days.  I really wish there were some cure for that or some way to shorten it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think my migraines are somewhat weather related (The frequency definitely increases with changes in barometric pressure). I live in middle TN, (apparently one of the worst places to live with this sort of disease) any tips? and do you think moving to CA would help me?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prodrome can sometimes feel thoroughly blissful to me, albeit in a muted way, a bit like a high quality alcohol hangover. There isn't much left that can feel down, but a worn down speck of myself. I won the battle though, things around me slowly begin to put themselves back into place and normality settles in, gravity is nice, and I'm just happy to be alive.</p></div>		</li>
