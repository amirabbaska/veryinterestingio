			<div class="markdown"><p>It may seem like that, but at relativistic speeds, velocities don't add up like they do at &quot;normal&quot; speeds. If two objects are traveling away from you at 0.5c in opposite directions, they will measure each others' speed to still be less than c, even though traditional physics tells us otherwise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't see yourself traveling at .99999c. You are at rest in your own frame, and see light traveling at c. Some else, who observes you moving at .99999c will also see light moving at c. This is not a paradox since different observers will experience different time and space intervals due to time dilation and length contraction. In relativity, speeds don't add linearly and never add up to more than c.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is an awkward question really. The answer is yes but the more fundamental issue is that you aren't moving at 0.99c, you are always stationary from your own point of view.</p>
<p>If you think about it, this does coincide with your everyday experiences. You can build a card castle on a plane and you can throw a ball up and down a train just as you could on the stationary ground outside. In fact if you close your eyes or just don't look out the window it is hard to tell how fast, or even if you are moving.</p>
<p>So is it that surprising that if you shine a flashlight when you are on that train the light moves at the speed of light? I think the answer is no.</p>
<p>What is strange is that no one else agrees that the light from your flashlight is moving away from you at c. If you think about a third party who will measure that the light is at c (everyone always agrees on this) and they will measure you at &quot;less than c&quot; and they could calculate the difference between these values and it would be some number that is not c. If you are going at 0.99c from their point of view then they will measure this difference at 0.01c.</p>
<p>It is this disparity between the measurement you made (of c) in your inertial frame and theirs (of 0.01c) that is the essence of special relativity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>See, I always had a hard time trusting this. I mean, the theories are overwhelmingly supportive of this, but I am just to thick to not understand that if something moves at the speed of light, or as close as possible, and we'd fire off something really fast - which would have to be faster than the speed that we are traveling at plus the missing part and then some. I have had it explained to me before, but my mind just can't wrap around that there is a maximum speed... Don't mind me, I'm just yelling at clouds...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll try.</p>
<p>Imagine you are at .999c and there's something you let off at 1c. You would always be trailing behind. At (relatively) short distances the difference is indiscernible, but over huge distances the difference is noticeable. </p>
<p>There's no adding beyond 1c, since anything that is moving at the speed of light experiences infinite time dilation and infinite length contraction. In other words, lightspeed objects arrive instantly or to put it in another way, experience no distance and do not experience time.</p>
<p>It wouldn't make sense to experience negative distance moving forwards, nor would it to arrive faster than instantaneously, would it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To simplify <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/SR/velocity.html" target="_blank">this</a>: additive velocities relative to a stationary observer combine with the formula V^sum = (v1 + v2) / [1+ (v1 x v2)/c^2 ]</p>
<p>This formula is fascinating; as it applies to every additive velocity even at low speeds. At low, non-relativistic speeds (v1 x v2) is so small it approaches zero when divided by c^2 , so you're left with [(v1 + v2) / (1 + 0)] = v1 + v2 = V^sum , which is what you would expect. However when your two  speeds start approaching c, you get (~c + ~c) / [1 + (~c Ã— ~c / c^2 )] = ~1.999999c / (1 + ~ 0.999999) = ~2c/~2 = ~c</p>
<p>It's kind of hard to show here because limits are weird, but in this case because the numerator is additive and the denominator is multiplicative, the denominator value will be closer to 2 than the top multiplier, so they don't just cancel out but result in an end total multiplier of slightly less than 1 (as the denominator has the larger value) and so your sum value is still less than the speed of light!      </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Asking why you can't reach the speed of light by going faster is similar to asking why you can't obtain a perfect circle from a square by adding more sides. A five-sided shape is noticeably rounder than a four-sided shape, but a &quot;googolplex plus one&quot; sided shape is not much rounder than a googolplex sided shape. A perfect circle is a limit; something that can only be approached, but never reached from any other initial state. Likewise, as the speed of light is approached, additional energy transfer has diminishing returns of additional velocity. This property isn't intuitive because we only ever experience relatively minuscule velocities in our daily lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you mean 3rd person? An outside observer won't see anything different. He would see you travelling as fast as light.</p>
<p>From your perspective, you reach infinite time dilation and infinite space contraction, so you would reach any distance in an instant while the observer's clock would tell whatever it took(c/d) 10 years, 100 etc</p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm having trouble understanding the results. How does the wavelength change if the calculations only give me velicity?  </p>
<p>For example, when I plug in 0.5c, my v(observed) is 211,985,280 m/s. how does that change the wavelength of the green light to the observer? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, very much like that.</p>
<p>The difference is that you can (theoretically) go faster than sound in the car, carrying the air inside with you, so that you can still hear the music even though someone standing outside can't hear it until the car has <em>already passed.</em> You can't do this with light: You can keep going faster, but the amount faster that you go gets smaller and smaller, and you never actually reach the speed of light. Someone standing in front of you will always end up seeing the (blueshifted) flashlight before you arrive at their location.</p></div>		</li>

And the solar system is orbiting the galactic center. Then the galaxy is expanding our front the center of the universe(most likely). So right now you are booking it through space but everything looks like it's standing still. </p></div>		</li>
