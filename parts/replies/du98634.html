If you test only blood that has a low likelyhood of being HIV positive, you reduce the likelyhood of a false negative (and also increase the risk of a false positive, but better safe than sorry in this case)</p></div>		</li>

By excluding groups that are more likely to have blood ultimately rejected, you are able to spend your resources to collect more usable blood.</p></div>		</li>
