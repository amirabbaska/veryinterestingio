			<div class="markdown"><p>Best and most accurate answer. As a long-time host to Rheumatoid Arthritis I can attest to joint pain being the worst when pressure drops, as little as a few hours but typically 3-4 days prior to a storm system (where I live in the Intermountain West @ 4200 ft elevation). Conversely I start to feel much better when the storm system is imminent, anywhere from 8 hours to just a couple hours before the storm hits. During the winter I can also tell if a snow storm will result in &quot;wet&quot; or &quot;dry&quot; snow.</p>
<p>I hate my superpowers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I also have RA, and it sucks when the weather is about to change. I tell people I am a human barometer. I can feel about 2-3 days prior to extreme temperature change or precipitation (which sucks living in Ohio). You are absolutely right about when the storm hits. Once it rains or snows it is like a release and I feel more &quot;normal.&quot; However, temperature change makes me miserable until the temperature becomes more consistent. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So... your experience goes directly against the air pressure argument almost entirely. </p>
<p>The air pressure drops only upon arrival of the front, or, more specifically, the moisture. </p>
<p>When there is more moisture in the air, pressure drops. Basically, H2O = 2x hydrogen + 1 oxygen, which weighs less than 2x oxygen and 2x Nitrogen which make up most of the air. So, water weighs less than air. So, more water = less mass per volume = lower pressure. </p>
<p>Also, the pressure drop amounts to little more than the pressure change of going from 4,200' to 4,500'.  If you are in the west at 4,200', you probably experience that change just getting groceries as there are few large plains at that elevation. </p>
<p>My guess would actually be that the cold that typically accompanies clear skies preceding a storm is the actual cause. The cold air needs to be warmed much more to bring to room temp and the resulting warm air will have a much lower relative humidity and this pulls water from your skin. </p>
<p>After the storm arrives the source air is usually warmer and definitely wetter and this raises your indoor relative humidity enough to re-hydrate you, or at least slow the moisture loss so you can keep up. </p>
<p>When you experience the &quot;storm coming&quot; aches, eat bananas and drink WAY more water and see if your superpowers wane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so I may have had it backwards, but I can feel a storm coming like nobody's business. Fast-moving storms can be predicted to within an hour, slow-moving storms I can pretty much nail the day. I've proven it time and time again within my family and circle of friends. I don't check the weather until after making my predictions, and on many occasions I have accurately predicted storms where the forecast said there were none. </p>
<p>I'll try the bananas &amp; extra hydration you've suggested. I do naturally drink a lot of water (1.5+ gallons/day) and I eat at least one banana almost daily, so maybe I've been self-medicating all along? ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't suffer from RA - but I do suffer from rather painful sinus headaches that are almost certainly triggered by barometric changes. If left untreated, these will turn into migraine headaches. Luckily for me, if I treat them early enough with a large does of ibuprofen (800-1000mg) - I can usually make them disappear.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dude, this pressure change thing is bro-science at its worst. </p>
<p>Sinuses are very quickly and effectively affected by humidity changes. All time &quot;before a storm&quot; is just time &quot;between storms&quot; and the air is usually colder and always drier. It is definitely WAY drier when warmed to room temp. </p>
<p>This dehydrates your sinuses first, rest of your body second.  Your symptoms are from mild dehydration. </p>
<p>When someone is talking about bones aching, we can pretend it's pressure, etc. but when you say your sinuses are affected first, you are definitely getting dehydrated!!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This makes a lot of sense. One of the &quot;home remedies&quot; I somehow intuitively figured out was to take a super hot shower and cup my hands over my nose while the hot water runs over them - allowing me to breathe in steam. This usually makes the pain go away immediately. </p>
<p>It makes sense now why when most Drs recommended to drink caffeine that that always made my headache worse. </p>
<p>My headaches are not as bad now as when I was a kid. I would get some absolutely debilitating headaches as a kid.</p></div>		</li>
