			<div class="markdown"><p>The eyes... When we have such a wonder of engineering right in our skull, it's not surprising that we made it our primary sense. The more I learn about that stuff, the more amazed I am.</p>
<p>The eye in itself isn't even the most amazing thing. It's the different adaptations around that which are amazing. The muscular handling of the eye to scan the room, the reflexes in place to stabilize the image, the freaking lens and the way we express emotions with our eyes.</p>
<p>And the neural process after the image is taken. Instant pattern recognition, and pattern-breaking events, perspective inferred from the comparison of the two eye but also from visual cues. Colors treatment, and modification of colors depending on the surroundings. Reconstruction of the 3D environment in a matter of seconds... </p>
<p>A neat fact is how most of our spacial memory isn't even encoded in the brain as &quot;cup is on table&quot; but in term of where in the 3D reconstruction it is. When asked &quot;Where is the cup&quot;, your eyes jerk to this location immediately, analyses the image once again and find that &quot;the cup is on the table&quot;. Like, the analysis process is so quick, it is more efficient to rescan the room than to remember it.</p>
<p>I've been studying biology for 5 years now, mostly cellular level. But there's no doubt than at the level of the organism, the eyes are the thing that I'm the most amazed at. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, definitely. Some processing is already happening in the eye itself. You might say before it's sent to the brain, but then the retina is really an outgrowth of the brain. And going back to saccades, there are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsaccade" target="_blank">microsaccades</a> showing just how ingrained they are. Everything is adapted to everything else so well. Amazing how evolution can have the appearance of design, if you overlook the hints revealing it.</p>
<p>Not that other senses like that of hearing should be underestimated. Vision is very capable and useful for getting around. Hearing is more often taken for granted. If you lose it, you lose all sorts of things like verbal communication, things happening out of sight and music. Also an advanced sense in using phase offset and changes in 'texture' to position sounds in 3D. Humans are actually relatively bad at it, but it's still really neat. I'm saying this as much as I'd appreciate some quiet, being sensitive to noise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also we're covered in skin which is pretty damn impressive:</p>
<ul>
<li>it serves as a sort of armour, protecting our innards from damage, environment, etc</li>
<li>it flexes and stretches to allow mostly unrestricted movement without tearing (usually skin isn't the limiting factor, or at least not the only one)</li>
<li>it repairs itself, and any puncture is quickly sealed from within (blood deserves credit for this too)</li>
<li>it provides a cooling system (sweat) and heating (hair/fur which automatically raises to work as a blanket)</li>
<li>it's full of nerves that let us pinpoint any damage or danger, by sensing any abnormal deformation (eg being poked), temperature, moisture, or texture (eg wind, friction, roughness)</li>
<li>those nerves are sensitive enough, in key areas, to let us precisely manipulate things with our hands (we can feel the texture in great detail)</li>
</ul>
<p>Skin is a marvel of natural engineering. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the most interesting things to me is that you perceive and react to sounds faster than light. It makes a lot of sense once you think about how much information and processing it takes to construct a 3d reality out of what your eyes take in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with your comment that eyes are fucking amazing, but some things you said stuck out to me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The eyes... When we have such a wonder of engineering right in our skull </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'd hardly call it engineering. The eyes, although incredible, have some pretty serious flaws. <a href="http://cdn.bigshotcamera.com/images/fun/buildables/blindspot/anatomy_of_eye.jpg" target="_blank">We have 'cables' that literally run directly through our retina and lay ON TOP OF our light sensitive cells. Seems pretty silly, doesn't it?</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like, the analysis process is so quick, it is more efficient to rescan the room than to remember it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think this might just be because we aren't very good at remembering things like this! I think its incredible how the brain works. We tend to ignore things that are common or consistent. For instance, even as you read this your ears are probably picking up several different sounds. However, your brain just completely tunes them out</p>
<p>Back to the eyes, you see a lot of stuff that your brain doesn't think it needs to care about. Why remember every detail in every scene? Odds are we don't care about every blade of grass, where the cup is etc, so the brain just doesn't bother remembering. I think that is the truly incredible thing. How does it decide what's important?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, of course the eye in itself is not the most incredible sensor ever. We have sensors that are more precise than the eye. But the post-processing ? As I said, it's not really the eye in itself, it's the stuff that evolved around it to make the most out of it. The difference between what you can perceive just opening your eye for a split second and what you can perceive letting them open for 2 seconds is incredible. </p>
<p>It's all about post-processing, but god it is centuries ahead of what artificial neural networks are able to produce. What ever you say, right now, those things need a ton of resources, processing power and energy, whereas our eye and the entire brain is 40cm long (give or take) and runs on sugar.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The eye's blind spot is covered by the other one though, it's a simple little hack, likely simpler than everything that would have the change to move the optic nerve.</p>
<p>The photodetectors in the eye are super impressive as well. They're sensitive enough to pick up a single photon, but scale their sensitivity well enough that they're very difficult to blind, using a little feedback mechanism with ions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of what you mentioned is processing by the brain.  The pathways beyond the optic nerve are the most complicated in our entire bodies.</p>
<p>In my neurology residency, we had a neuro-ophthalmologist who said, &quot;I'm not a religious man, but the eyes and pathways involved make me wonder.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And one of the most intelligent man I know told me something among &quot;the more I learn about genetics, the less I believe in evolution&quot;. Of course, he 'believes' in evolution, but once you dig in that stuff, you really start to wonder &quot;but how in hell did those spawn out of inert molecules&quot;. That's the beauty of this field, in my opinion. The more you dig in, the more stuff there is to discover. And that feeling when you finally know enough and all the pieces fall into place and you start to see the whole picture ? Man, I'd kill to feel that again.</p>
<p>Like, I get why biology is... dull for many physicists, because biology teachers just give lecture on stuff on different scales and you just have to remember it. And then, one day, you know enough about how the different scales interconnect and you can start to really <em>understand</em> biology. You start to make your own reasoning, you can make hypothesis and such, and then it becomes a 'real' science.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Eyes have evolved to track whatever it is you're looking at, so the image of that is stationary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would also say it is the brain too. Your brain takes all of these images and makes them into a stationary object. That's why people with nystagmus aren't blind. The brain &quot;rewires&quot; itself to take that rapid movement and create a stationary object.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's all connected. When I say the eye, especially in ELI5, I really mean the entire visual system.</p>
<p>As for nystagmus and other ailments, the brain can adapt very well. It's not necessarily going to be useless. Just not as good as it normally is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have nystagmus myself. Thank you for explaining it well. The brain does adjust but when the nystagmus is strong enough, like in my case, there is only so much the brain can do. I am considered &quot;legally blind&quot; since my vision, as best we can measure it, is 20/200 in one eye and 20/700 in the other one. I can see &quot;well enough&quot; for most things but need to adjust in many ways. For instance, reading is easy enough if I bring the book or screen within 6&quot; of my face.</p>
<p>I don't see any blurry images - I just lack details. I can see people down the street but can only recognize who they are when they are within a few feet of me. Unless they wear clothes I can recognize. Facial features are extremely hard for me to discern. Which makes it annoying to watch movies where everyone wears the same clothes - such as military movies for instance.</p>
<p>Still, the brain does an amazing job of dealing with my multiple saccades per second - horizontally and vertically - so that I never get headaches or dizziness from just looking around. The head's reflex to adjust to eye movements is interesting though, as I have involuntary head quirks - very small, almost micro-movements, but it's visible if you look at me for a minute.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can move my eyes smoothly side to side without having to track anything. Following a line makes it easier though. When I move my eyes like this everything is blurry, like looking out the side window of a moving car, but in slow motion. I have to actively override the instinct to jump from point to point though, and sometimes an object in the way will make my eyes &quot;trip&quot; or stumble and focus for a split second on it before continuing smoothly. I'll try to get a video up that shows the smooth scrolling without tracking an object!</p>
<p>Edit: tracking an imaginary object behind my wall: <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4934737/20160902_185821.mp4" target="_blank">https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4934737/20160902_185821.mp4</a></p></div>		</li>

In short, it's difficult to do unless you rob yourself of a clear image, taking away sharp stimuli for the eyes to latch onto.</p>
