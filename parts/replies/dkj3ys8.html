<p>This was the most helpful explanation for me. Thank you! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that while this explanation is entirely correct, if a material existed that wasn't held together by atoms in this way it <em>still</em> wouldn't work. It's not a materials problem, it's still an energy problem. </p>
<p>Spin a ruler in your hand, then spin a yardstick. It's harder to do right? More mass, more inertia to overcome. Any material with mass is going to require energy to move, and the faster you want it to go he more energy is required. As you approach C the energy required tends toward an infinite amount. You cannot put enough energy into the system, any system you can contrive with mass, to ever reach C. End of story. </p>
<p>Not trying to be pedantic, but the materials explanation always seems to lead to some jackass speculating about a better material, not understanding that it breaks because of a fundamental property of atoms. </p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> added clarification. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it be a materials problem before an energy problem though? As the rod accelerates the imperfections in the material would cause it to warp and rip apart. Would not the fact that a perfect material doesn't exist ensure the energy experiment fails?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is what I was looking for. Assuming the rod is not being affected by gravity, it would stay reasonably straight. However, being that materials aren't perfect you would see either side break before the other causing a critical imbalance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It wouldn't, because you would need to speed up to 1rps first, and until all pieces rotate &quot;equally&quot;, the inner one would go faster than the outer end. </p>
<p>And even if you skip the acceleration, I am not quite certain that the rod would be straight, since the inner and outer parts would actually move at different speeds and would have different forces affecting them. An engineer or physicist should correct me here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you skipped the accelleration phase (accellerate very slowly over billions of years for example), had no gravity or other external forces, and had perfect rotational motion with no vibrations. Given those conditions, under newtonian mechanics (&lt;0.01c) you would get a straight, but stretched rod because of centripital force along the rod. With a long enough rod and high enough angular velocity, the rod will fail in compression.</p></div>		</li>
