			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow... your answer is almost exactly what I wrote the last time this came up.  After reading the translator's notes for the various bible translations, I also settled on the ESV as my translation of choice.</p>
<p>A few things to add to this excellent explanation:</p>
<p>The formation of &quot;modern&quot; English is actually very tightly tied to the KJV; Johnson had his dictionary, but prior to the KJV, there was no canon text for the English language, and spellings and meanings of words and phrases varied widely based on locale and station in life.  With the printing of the King James bible, there was suddenly a large text that did not change (much) over time or place, meaning that the words and phrases printed in it meant the same thing to everyone who spoke English.  This stabilized the English language more than the burgeoning fad of reactive dictionaries, and the result was that the KJV actually formed the English language and even the English culture that we know today.</p>
<p>As such, many English protestant Christians consider the KJV the authoritative translation based on tradition, the manner in which it was translated (which was amazing at the time but sub-par by modern standards), and the fact that due to it shaping modern literature and language, it has a poetic feel to it that is missing from most other accurate translations (which sound more stilted as they are attempting to accurately translate ancient Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many people still refer to the King James Bible as the only authoritative English text, and yet have no grasp of 17th century English, where words and phrases used today can have vastly different meanings than they did then, due to semantic drift.  Translations such as the ESV tend to correct for that drift, and incorporate notes and changes based on original manuscripts that have been discovered since the writing of the KJV that have corrected a few mis-translations of Hebrew and Aramaic words (old testament) where the sources that the KJ translation team had used were too faded to be completely certain as to which original word actually existed.</p>
<p>It's also useful to differentiate between Bible translations (KJV, NKJV, MKJV, RSV, NRSV, ESV, NASB, NIV, ISV, NET, WEB) and Bible interpretations, such as the Bible in Basic English, The Message, the New Living Translation, the New International Reader's Version, etc. which attempt to re-tell the meaning (according to the authors) of the original biblical works in contemporary or simplified language.  There was a boom in Bible interpretations in the 1970s that lined up with the charismatic movement, and many conservative christian's dependency on the KJV as the authoritative English translation today is in direct response to this -- because interpretations, while good at exposing specific readings of the bible, also obscure potential original meanings, and prevent a thorough study of the original text.</p>
<p>So this answers the question &quot;Why the KJV?&quot;</p>
<p>To answer the other question &quot;Why trust a book written 1500 years after the latest events it records?&quot; you need to look at European politics among other things.</p>
<p>The King James bible was written to stabilize the Church of England, which had splintered off from the Catholic Church.  In the Catholic church, the Latin Vulgate was the canon Bible; it had been directly translated from the original Aramaic, Hebrew and Greek in 382 AD, but didn't become the official version until the end of the 16th century.  Before that, each diocese used whichever collection of translated texts they had on hand, which was usually a copy of the Vetus Latina, which contained a better translation of many texts compared to the original Vulgate.</p>
<p>So what happened with the King James bible was one of the first concerted efforts to go back to translating original documents in over 1200 years, checking against transcription error (since before the KJV, all bibles were copied by hand) as well as misinterpretations of the meanings of the original Aramaic/Hebrew/Greek words during translation into Latin.  The scientific and religious effort put into translating the King James bible eclipsed pretty much all translation work that had been previously attempted, meaning that unless you wanted to go back to the original Aramaic/Hebrew/Greek texts, the KJV at the time was the best translation of the entire Bible into a single language.  Since this translation underpinned much of English society during the following 300 years, through colonialism and into the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, it continued to exist as a constant authority in the Church of England.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The NLT isn't a retelling, it's dynamic equivalence (as opposed to formal equivalence). Retellings aren't proper translations at all- they translate English into different English. NLT is a proper translation. </p>
<p>The NIRV is also a bit of an exception- it's equivalent to the NIV, just with more restrictions on how to translate to English. It uses a more simple sentence structure, often breaking up independent clauses in a single sentence into multiple sentences. While it's possible that could subtly alter the meaning of the text, the audience it's aimed at is people who speak English as a second language, or people with undeveloped language skills. I know a church group that uses it for people with intellectual disabilities. For the target audience, something they understand is a lot more <em>accurate</em> than something they don't understand. Think of the Reader's version as being a distinct dialect of English, and it's more apparent that the translation isn't any less accurate for people that speak that dialect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are correct; however, both the NLT and NIrV still fall under interpretation, even though they aren't a re-telling.  I intentionally included those two specifically to point out the difference between re-telling in general and the edge cases of interpretation.  The Message is another interpretation that goes from original manuscripts into 1970's era English vernacular; Peterson is actually a very adept translator, but chose to write that version in dated vernacular to provide a more accessible version for people who didn't study ancient languages.</p>
<p>The BBE on the other hand... is just a re-telling of English translations using only Basic English, which is a simplified form of English using only the key words in the English language.  The NLT is essentially a re-do of this using proper source materials.</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with using interprative versions of the bible, as long as those using them are aware of their strengths and limitations, and we don't end up with a new round of KJV-only-itis where people who don't actually understand 17th century English still rely on a text written in 17th century English for their understanding of their religion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, neither -- but I did my university thesis on the formation of the English language via 17th century literature, and also as a result of that did some study on the formation of the biblical cannon.</p>
<p>I also figured that if I wanted to know if I believed something based mostly on a single translation of a historic book, I'd better do my research so I could at least know if what I was reading was at all trustworthy or just complete dogma.</p>
<p>Interesting side note is that most bibles printed today have a lot of this information printed at the front, but many people who claim to follow the teachings inside never bother to read that part to understand how it came to exist in its current form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It might be neither, I had to memorize fairly unimportant stuff for confirmation (giving middle schoolers a class with a test to see if they really understand Christianity/accept Jesus). Learning why your church uses a specific translation is probably in there right next to why the denomination split from the other, which split from the other, on and on.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We should be clear, lest we make things sound too idyllic before the 16th century, that the Vetus Latina just means all the various old Latin translations before the Vulgate. They weren't standardised, and they were very variable in quality and content. There is no 'Vetus Latina' Bible. There are, for example, several different Vetus Latina translations of the Gospels.</p>
<p>That's why a standardised Bible was necessary, although many of the older translations survive in pieces used for Liturgy.</p></div>		</li>

<p>its language has become entrenched in English-speaking society. And people like tradition. It feels weird to change how a holy text reads or sounds. People stick with what they know or what they're used to. Therefore the KJV is still around and will still be around for many years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Certainly. But I think it's also taken hold for so long because, from a purely secular perspective, it's one of the greatest literary works written in English. I am a literature professor (and secular Jew) and frequently teach the KJV as a work of poetry –– although I think our sense of its language being harmonious with its subject matter certainly benefits from association with Shakespeare, and our association of Elizabethan language with loftiness overall, there's no denying that the artistry alone of the KJV thrills in a way none of the other translations come close to achieving.</p>
<p>Some years ago, Isaiah 60:1 in the KJV was voted the best sentence ever written in English by a group of scholars:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD is risen upon thee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-1.htm" target="_blank">Here is the sentence in other translations</a>. Note how none really satisfy the ear the way the KJV version does. Its structure of gradually widening vowels (I-I-I-I-IH-UH-O-O) until you come to &quot;LORD&quot;, which then descends until you come to the long EE in thee, is suited perfectly to its cadence –– nearly all the versions that don't duplicate the KJV version feel clumsy or anonymous in comparison.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because it was so widespread, the KJV has had influence far beyond the realm of religion, which helps explain a lot of its relevancy beyond the Christian sphere. </p>
<p>Around the time of the KJV is when the printing press was invented; this helped the London dialect become the dominant standard of English and roll across the country a variety of linguistic changes. The Chancery Standard spread and dominated or influenced many other dialects, all the way to Scotland, mostly aided by the KJV, which everyone at the time would have to be familiar with in some form or another. And that's just when England begins to spread across the world, carrying its language and its translation of the Bible with it.</p>
<p>As a linguist I'm not afraid to say that modern day English, whether US or UK, certainly wouldn't be the same without the KJV translation. Crystal traced back about 250 modern-day idioms back to this particular Bible, as well as specific semantic ranges and orthographies - which makes it far superior to Shakespeare in terms of linguistic influence. Makes sense, as people at the time would have had much more access to the church-mandated and mass printed KJV. I don't know how many Christians follow the KJV solely out of linguistic tradition, but even the first version is still largely accessible to modern-day readers already innately familiar with several of its imagery. I think that even if it's not your favourite version, it's always interesting both for Christians and non-Christians to check it out, if just for its value as one of the most influential English-language books of all time.</p></div>		</li>
