			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't have time to adequately explain this phenomenon, but what you describe here is known as supercooling. The water has nowhere to form ice crystals at, so it just keeps on cooling down. If an impurity is added, or the bottle is jostled enough, ice crystals will form rapidly.</p>
<p>Again, have a look around for explanations of supercooling, or even look around on this thread. Certainly another Redditor had more time to explain this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a short explanation; inadequate if you actually want to understand the mechanisms of how and why it works.
I didn't explain why the water has nowhere to form crystals, why it needs a place for it, the thermodynamics of supercooling, etc. Plenty of details left out. :)</p></div>		</li>
