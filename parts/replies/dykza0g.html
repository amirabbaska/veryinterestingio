			<div class="markdown"><p>Now with Europe looking like <a href="http://i.imgur.com/wSeJklC.jpg" target="_blank">this</a> the few wolves remaining in some isolated mountains are basically for generations selected for being shy and afraid of humans. It was not always so. Just one historical incident: in 1450 pack of wolves driven almost insane by hunger in winter attacked and killed 40 people in Paris. There were other examples, most famous is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beast_of_G%C3%A9vaudan" target="_blank">Beast of Gévaudan</a></p>
<p>Back in the day when European primeval forest was a thing wolves regularly attacked and killed wanderers or children or isolated settlements. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. I guess wolves eating children playing in the woods (which was most of Europe back in the day) can make that a reality. Thanks for reference. Did not know about that one. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell about the ghost from the history breathing at your neck. This brings to me memories of my good mountain climber friend who said that nature while beautiful is set out to kill you. This is why you <em>respect</em> nature. With the sheltered life most of the people have right now this key lesson can be forgotten for generations. Anyways thanks for this info. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the parts of Romania that is not mountainous.</p>
<p>It's not necessarily population density.</p>
<p>In one country you can have a population of 10 million people spread across 1000 towns, in another you can have 10 million people spread across 10 big cities, and on that map the former would have way more dots than the latter.</p>
<p>It's basically up to how the country is administratively set up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it is the plains under the Alps. I believe the white crescent next to it is Alps. If you check google maps and zoom around Braşov then you can clearly see the number of villages increasing to the southeast. It is especially visible on satellite map with fields and cultivated land overtaking <del>forest</del> timber plantations in Transylvanian Alps. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An aurochs is basically what our modern domesticated cows and bulls are descended from.</p>
<p>They are to the cows you know as wolves are to dogs.</p>
<p>You would recognize one as some sort of big cow if you saw one and then you would be quickly dead because they were known to be extremely mean and aggressive.</p>
<p>Imagine an angry bull charging at you and then scale that bull up as large as any bull can get and make them a violent prehistoric version of a bull not the nice and cuddly, tame version that bullfighters play with. Basically an angry tank meat of meat and horns and hoofs and hatred.</p>
<p>They used to be very common all over Europe but because them and humans were an either/or thing, they became less common over time as civilization spread over the continent.</p>
<p>They held on in isolated pockets were there weren't many humans around and occasionally interbred with domesticated cattle. (Which must have been quite an experience for those cows).</p>
<p>The last one died as recently as the 17th century in some forest in Poland.</p></div>		</li>
