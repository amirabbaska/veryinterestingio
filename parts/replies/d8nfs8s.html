<p>I can see a lot of political problems coming from this already. If Mars is full of rare and valuable materials, and they are easy to ship back to Earth, there will probably be a lot of fighting amongst people claiming land on Mars.</p>
<p>I always just thought of Mars colonies as bunkers on Mars full of scientists destined to die on an alien planet. Didn't know they would give benefits to us back on earth.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>To my mind this is the single biggest misperception about Mars colonization, and the stuff pro-Mars people say sometimes furthers the perception.</p>
<p>The truth is that backup plans are great and all, but no amount of scientists in bunkers are suitable as a way to preserve humanity, and even if they are it would be <em>much</em> easier to keep the bunkers on earth.   But bunkers aren't the point.</p>
<p>Mars is useful as a stepping stone.  It's earthlike, but still presents us with all the problems (life support, transport off earth, harsh environment) that we will face in space.  The end goal on Mars isn't a few people isolated in a colony, it's a growing, expanding economy.  It's a city.  It's something that will draw people and money into space and encourage them to invest more there, to learn how to live there. </p>
<p>If we crack the problem of living on Mars we'll likely also crack the problem of living on the Moon, in Earth orbit, and on asteroids.  If we manage to make Mars economically viable, we'll likely also make industry in those other places viable as well.</p>
<p>The end goal here is to have Earth be no more important to human civilization than the Near East is to urbanized civilization: the place where it got started first but not the place where the most people or most activity still is.  Not a civilization on Earth with an outpost on Mars, but a Solar system full of civilization, with one important but nonvital component on Earth.</p>
<p>A few primitive colonists on Mars is just a tiny first step, but it would be an important one.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This. We are only at the start of becoming a multi planetary species, people are going to be doubtful. We don't know how long it will take, or if humanity will survive long enough to see it through. </p>
<p>But it's got to be believed that civilizations like this already exist in the universe.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you don't believe in knowledge for knowledge's sake, then this is basically the reason to do <em>anything</em>. Any time someone asks you &quot;what's the point?&quot; on some new information, some fundamental knowledge about the formation of the universe or life on Mars or the formation of life on this planet or the movement of the Earth's core or how people decide which direction to walk to work - this is the answer.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When lasers were first invented, people thought they were neat but essentially useless, &quot;a solution without a problem.&quot; What's the point of wasting money developing this useless toy?</p>
<p>Now look at how many important uses we have for lasers. You probably use lasers every day of your life.</p>
<p>The immediate purpose or application may be uncertain, but if you don't pursue it in the name of scientific curiosity, you will miss out on that amazing invention.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ha! Yeah, by way of dumping CO2 into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, the martian atmosphere is mostly CO2, so we're going to have invent new ways of fucking up the planet's atmosphere. No need to fret, we've got top guys working on it. One such idea is to mine nearby asteroids and comets for ammonia to dump onto the planet.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't it be more efficient to redirect the asteroids to impact Mars? The resulting dust clouds would further help trap the heat along with releasing the ammonia without the effort of mining and transportation.</p></div>		</li>
