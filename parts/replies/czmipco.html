			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus even if it was perfectly balanced, the inward forces on the very large hoop of steel would exceed the strength of the metal.  It's like trying to make a bridge arch that spans the circumference of the earth: we don't have any material that has a strength to weight ratio high enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I keep thinking through this, but I don't think this would actually apply. </p>
<p>Normally when we look at beam deformation, you integrate the forces to get shear forces then integrate again to get bending moment. </p>
<p>However, in such a case, the bending is actually opposite gravity more analogous to a cantilevered beam. Except that it's not cantilevered, but rather not fixed at any point. </p>
<p>It's almost analogous to an arch, but it isn't, because the gravitational forces all act normally to the curvature (unlike an arch, which has uniform downward weight).</p>
<p>The math is, admittedly, beyond what I can conjure from my mechanics of materials days, but I don't actually think it is as clear cut that the ring would fail as it might seem, especially given a sufficiently large and properly curved I beam or something. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Since gravitational force is not equally spread out along the Earth's surface (stronger some places, weaker other places) then balancing such a structure by itself would be next to impossible &amp; it would be like trying to balance a ball on a crooked and lumpy saddle </p>

<p>Balancing a static, motionless ball is difficult even for an NBA player. But while its  spinning? Easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really matter that gravity isn't constant.  There would still be a &quot;sweet spot&quot; where the ring could be placed around an uneven gravitational well like the earth's.  It would simply have to orbit the planet geosynchronously.</p>
<p>The problem then would become that a) things on planet earth move, and b) other gravity wells like the sun and the moon exist.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That would be easier than a perfect saddle though, since you could find a crook for it to rest in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is this true though? Id need to whip out the old vector calc book to confirm, but if I remember correctly, this would not be a stable state. If one side is in contact with the surface, it's true that the force on the opposite end would be less, but remember there is more ring on that side because the ring is of center. So gmM/r has a lot more m on the other side, albeit r is greater.</p></div>		</li>
