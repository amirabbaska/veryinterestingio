			<div class="markdown"><p>They are possibly more plentiful than we once thought, but space is also much more vast than anyone can conceivably comprehend. The likelihood of encountering one has not changed much at all. Even if we discovered a trillion more black holes, that would hardly make a dent in the vast &quot;space&quot; within space. The chance of a space probe coming into contact with a black hole has possibly gone from infinitesimally tiny to infinitesimally small at most.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well aren't they only dangerous to be close to if they're relatively small? The larger ones may swallow up more but if you're outside the event horizon you are okay where is the smaller ones could rip you to shreds if close. Or that's how Kurzgesagt explained it in their <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_hqbn0r_NAhWB0h4KHYyPAtEQtwIIJDAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D8nHBGFKLHZQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGF7e2CJ7_sItMcdM4dzPvfnRdJyg&amp;sig2=0GlLsitEeO9ty_l1emvF7w&amp;bvm=bv.125221236,d.dmo" target="_blank">Black Hole in your pocket video</a>.</p>
<p>edit: to clear it up I do recognize them as the ULTIMATE danger either way I'm just pointing out that since the singularity is farther away in giant black holes you wouldn't necessarily be killed if near one unless you passed the event horizon where as if you even got close to a relatively small one you could get spagettified </p></div>		</li>

<p>Don't worry, they dissipate in femtoseconds, before they can swallow up enough particles to keep from dissipating.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably not. There are highly speculative models that would have that, but there is absolutely no evidence for those models.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We can detect black holes by looking at what they are eating. The ecreation disks of Active black holes produce a variety of emissions that we can detect. If a black hole were &quot;dormant&quot; and at the edges of galaxies it could be very difficult to detect as it won't emit anything and the lensing of a single black hole would be too small.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, if you're really close to them. A black hole the mass of the sun would be the size of earth and its obvious gravitational lensing might extend to two or three times that distance. The lensing from a black hole the mass of even the largest stars wouldn't be visible from earth. We can barely see the lensing from our own star and it's crazy close to us. We know of a few black holes and we can't see their lensing either, even the Sagittarius A* is too far away to notice any of it's lensing and it has a mass totaling many millions of stars.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well yeah, that is <em>precisely</em> what dark matter is supposed to do. The problem is that there are many other candidates for dark matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The wikipedia page lists PBH masses at 10^^17 to 10^^26 grams.  Elsewhere described as having a mass range like asteroids.  There's mention of them passing through the Sun or Earth without causing many problems, and they are alluded to as smaller than an atom.</p>
<p>Can you tell me the approximate sizes for that mass range?  Smaller than atoms?  The size of a nucleus?  Or golf ball sized?  I am at a loss and don't want to attempt the math.</p>
<p>edit: <a href="http://www.whillyard.com/science-pages/p-b-h.html" target="_blank">this guys webpage</a> says the minimum mass results in a black hole with a Schwarzschild radius of 1.5 x 10^^-14 cm, or about 1/10 of a hydrogen atom.  He also says a black hole with an Earth mass is 1/3 of an inch.  The Earth is 10^^27 grams and max PBH is 10^^26 grams.  So our PBH size are between those two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational lensing observations (well, the lack of more of them) discourage too many of them, and the x-rays they should have produced in the early universe should have left some effect on the cosmic microwave background. Those things are a bit model-dependent, however, but so is the idea of many 30 M_sol black holes.</p></div>		</li>
