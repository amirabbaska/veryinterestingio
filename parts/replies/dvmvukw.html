			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only as you describe, all day users in a specific program will optimize very far over the course of a few years.  All those obscure key bindings, button placements, workarounds, and undocumented tricks have an effect.  A savvy, capable user will spend lots of time (more than the license cost) relearning and making the actions automatic.  Hell, Micro$oft moving to the ribbon in their office suite probably costed me more than a few hours.  Old habits die hard.</p></div>		</li>
