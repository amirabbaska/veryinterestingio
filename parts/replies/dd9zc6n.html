			<div class="markdown"><p>Just writing to confirm this:</p>
<p>in Polish, both &quot;not guilty&quot; and &quot;innocent&quot; are the same word - &quot;niewinny&quot;, which is formed of &quot;nie&quot; (not) and &quot;winny&quot; (guilty).</p>
<p>I'm sure there are a lot of other languages that don't differentiate the two.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Came here to say this, the same applies in Czech, innocent= nevinen, not-guilty-nevinen. The problem here is the language itself, not the legal system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not the language.</p>
<p>Not guilty means the same as innocent.</p>
<p>However, in court all one has to be is not proven guilty.  That's a completely different thing.</p>
<p>&quot;Not proven guilty&quot; does not mean the same thing as &quot;not guilty&quot;, but it is essentially what a not guilty verdict means, and that's what UK and US law take &quot;not guilty&quot; to mean.</p>
<p>This is referred to in the presumption of innocence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just, in Norwegian we have the word uskyldig (same as unchuldig), which literally means innocent, but also the expression &quot;ikke skylding&quot; which means literally not guilty. I would not be surprised if the german justice system also had some sort of &quot;nicht schuldig&quot; as a verdic. </p>
<p>Note that the word uskyldig also means not guilty, but has a added meaning of being pure, innocent etc. in a general way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, the verdict can be both &quot;unschuldig&quot; or &quot;nicht schuldig&quot;. In the article (<a href="http://www.humanrights.ch/de/internationale-menschenrechte/aemr/text/artikel-11-aemr-strafe-gesetz" target="_blank">you made me go look for it)</a>, the person is supposed to be considered &quot;unschuldig&quot; and &quot;not guilty&quot; is not mentioned. But there is zero difference nor law-abiding formality to consider between the two in a verdict. </p>
<p>Again, the problem OP is mentioning arises from something else.</p>
<p>First, OP is mentioning a saying that's translated from Latin and not citing an actual lawful article. Secondly, English uses both, &quot;not guilty&quot; and &quot;innocent&quot; to describe the same thing. The two words come from two etymologically completely different corners. &quot;Innocent&quot; from Latin, and &quot;guilty&quot; from Old English. German, on the other hand, uses in this case only words from the same origin: &quot;unschuldig/nicht schuldig&quot;. So, when you translate the same saying from Latin into German, OP's problem cannot come into existence. </p>
<p>Such is life with translations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that, we also mangled the &quot;innocent if not approved to be guilty&quot; one.  Saying that someone is &quot;innocent <em>until</em> proven guilty&quot; implies that they will be proven guilty -- it's just a matter of time.</p></div>		</li>
