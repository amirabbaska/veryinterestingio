			<p>Interesting...Sorry that I'm not familiar with your work (my own field of virology keeps me too busy for much pleasure reading), but if this &quot;new&quot; base pair does not have hydrogen bonding, isn't a sequence incorporating these bases inherently less stable than it would be with natural base pairs?  Wouldn't you expect this base pair to activate excision repair mechanisms?<br><br>edit: does NOT have... </p>		</li>

			<p>Thermodynamically, within the context of an otherwise natural DNA double helix, the unnatural base pair has a melting temperature intermediate between a GC and AT base pair, so the interactions keeping them together are on par with hydrogen bonding.<br><br>We were worried about base excision repair mechanisms (because we do know from structural studies that the unnatural base pair does slightly distort the helix structure) but they seem to either not recognize the unnatural base pair as damage and/or they cannot process it because the base pair is pretty stable in vivo.</p>		</li>

			<p>How many hydrogen bonds does this guy have? Just one? Also, does the double purine-like structure produce bulges that may cause attenuation or induce DNA repair mechanisms? If so, would you consider peptide nucleic acid (PNA) to help reduce the size? These molecules are very awesome and interesting. Keep up the work!<br><br>Edit: Sorry I didn't realize these questions were mostly answered!</p>		</li>
