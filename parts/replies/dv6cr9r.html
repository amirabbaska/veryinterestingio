			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the equivalent of the people who get paid to deliver those terrible free newspapers but instead of delivering them, they just toss them in a dumpster.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, the home next to me was empty after it was foreclosed on.  The garage lock was broken because it was empty for 3 years and some kid was using it to dump those free papers in rather than deliver them.</p>
<p>When someone finally bought the home, they had a garage about 5 feet deep full of old newspaper they had to dump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depend what type of recycling you're talking about.  No one is throwing away aluminum.  People literally dig it out of other people's garbage for the money.</p>
<p>The problem is that we've been indoctrinated into recycling other things, like paper, or cardboard, or glass, which, while possible, is often more expensive, causes more pollution, and yields an inferior product.</p></div>		</li>
