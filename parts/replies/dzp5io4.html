<p>What you’re thinking right now is the app that’s open in front of you, e.g. the Reddit app. What you were thinking about previously is the app that’s in the background...say, maybe the clock app. So while you’re browsing on Reddit, the clock app continues to tick and may send you a notification/alert when it reaches a certain time.</p>
