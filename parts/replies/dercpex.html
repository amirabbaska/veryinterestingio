			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider this situation: you, as an adult, are ready to go to lunch at work. Suddenly someone appears and tells you that you should go shower, and forces you into the shower, closing you there. You enjoy having showers of a certain length of time. But the person appears and orders you to get out, before that length of time was complete. </p>
<p>Children have the same desire for freedom as we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's why it's so important to tell them what's going on, all the time. Have you heard of Emmi Pikler? According to her view on kids you start from day one with this. Announcing you're going to pick them up instead of just yanking them up in the air, describing what you are doing when changing their diaper etc. I find it a very respectful way to deal with our tiny human.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why don't kids like to transition from one thing to anything is what you mean, 1) Kids don't want to get in shower 2) kids don't want to get out of shower 3) Kids don't want to go to sleep 4) Kids don't want to wake up.</p>

<p>I'm almost 34 and those apply to me. Except the going to sleep. I'm always down for going to sleep.</p></div>		</li>
