			<div class="markdown"><p>This is true, but I thought the consensus for such thought experiments was to place the object in a 'frictionless vacuum' to eliminate everything but the specific effect we're looking at.</p>
<p>So in the consttucted universe specific to this experiment ordinary friction would not be a concern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gravity travels very, very far, even if it's a very weak force. An object spinning in space would still be subject to the gravitational waves of nearby celestial bodies, even if said bodies were lightyears away. If we take OP's question literally, then yes, any object spun in space would <em>eventually</em> stop spinning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My point is that OP specifically asked about the emission of electromagnetic radiation as the reason of the slowing down. </p>
<p>Because this is a thought experiment, we can let the universe be however is needed to answer the initial question, and the way OP has worded it implies (to me) that they only care about the EM effects.</p>
<p>In this case, constructing a hypothetical universe that contains nothing but the spinning magnet is the most straightforward way to answer this question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The leading edge will always have more resistance than in the trailing edge. It perfectly comparable to spinning something down on earth in perfectly still air. The air is just way less dense. </p></div>		</li>
