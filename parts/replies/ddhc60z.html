			<div class="markdown"><p>That is a wealth of information to get us on the path.  I'm quickly learning there are way too many species and we cannot just generally answer that question.</p>
<p>Do you know of any publications that group spiders by which would not be able to handle the cold?  Or which would try to get out of cold scenarios?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for this information!  I really appreciate your help.</p>

<p>No, I doubt you'd be able to find something like this.  First, studies of habitat preferences usually investigate a small number of species, and it's not always safe to generalize the findings even to other species of the same genus.  We simply don't have enough information on most spiders for a &quot;list of heat-seeking spiders&quot; to be particularly meaningful.</p>
<p>Second, the categorization of spiders into &quot;heat-seeking&quot; and &quot;cold-seeking&quot; can be misleading.  It is unlikely that all spiders - or even most spiders - prioritize moving to find an ideal temperature, or that spiders will not move to a cooler site in some situations and move to a warmer site in other situations.  A laboratory test of temperature preference might not apply to the field, where a spider has many considerations other than temperature, and field tests have the difficulty of separating confounding factors - for example, a spider may appear to prefer cool areas, but this is only because cool areas have more prey.  For some animals, such as warm-blooded mammals in cold climates, we have good reasoning for why these animals would have a preference to move towards warmth, but for ectotherms such as spiders it would be a mistake to assume a priori that there exists a significant temperature drive.</p>
<p>Is there a particular context that motivates this question?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense.  Now I'm curious to see if there are any entomologists with published studies that fall in this arena.  I'm going to be driving by a few colleges next week so I'm going to check if there are any at those schools.</p>
<p>The context...I don't know how to explain.  My mind just gets stuck on a subject and I can't let it go until I learn enough to satisfy it.  Some subjects grab me for good and I continue to learn as much as I can for decades.  As far as this issue...There are many different factors.  Like can I use spiders for pest control in my greenhouse?  If so what conditions would be optimal and would they survive a winter?  Adding to that, I've noticed a link between a heated blanket and spider activity which is coincidental but leads my mind to the same place.  Not to mention that when I worked construction years ago I took notice of trends with spiders in wall cavities that seemed to be consistent with &quot;heat seeking.&quot;  That is only the tip of the iceberg with where my mind is currently. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a study in undergrad on the effects of temp and web building in cellar spiders; they tend to live in cool, damp areas but the best web was build at room temp (25 C) in the dark as opposed to 40 C or 10 C in the dark. This however isn't generalizable even to the family of cellar spiders; just the North American ones.</p>
<p>TL;DR Every spider species likes different temps!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if there is a good resource for spiders who don't like the cold, but I can tell you for 100% certainty that Hobo Spiders will absolutely move in as it gets cold in the fall. If you are in the northwestern US, you have Hobo Spiders. They produce <a href="http://tandjenterprises.com/images/hobo%20spider%20web%20inside%20big.jpg" target="_blank">webs on the ground or in corners</a> that resemble that lame Halloween webbing. If you find the webs and live in the northwest, you have Hobos. Hell, if you live in the northwest, you have Hobos. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hobo spiders are part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agelenidae" target="_blank">Agelenidae</a> family of spiders, which includes all manners of funnel-web spiders (except the Australian funnel-web). While the hobo is common in the northwest, there are plenty of other Agelenidae species that are also common in other parts of the U.S. They can be found almost everywhere in the United States (and really the world) in some form.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What about places that are y'know, frozen hellholes? Every time it's winter here in Canada it feels like the indoor population of spiders explode.</p>
<p>But now that I think about it, it's possible they're simply moving to locations that still have food - or they're more desperate for food, and thus more out in the open? I don't pretend to know these things but yeah.</p></div>		</li>
