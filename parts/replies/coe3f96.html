			<div class="markdown"><p>As a child, I wanted to put some vanilla extract on my vanilla ice cream. I didn't taste it prior, so I dumped a ton of it on. It tasted so horrible and my parents made me eat it all for having used so much. To a child, that was like eating whiskey icecream.</p>
<p>Edit: Since it seems my use of &quot;made me eat it all&quot; was not taken as lighthearted as I meant, I wanted to clear up that my parents didn't actually force me to eat it all. They were just laughing and saying that I had to eat it all since I poured it. Even I was laughing through how bad it tasted and I was stubborn little idiot, so I tried to muscle through it. I could have given up at any time, and probably should have since it made me feel sick afterwards. It was a happy moment, not a moment of parental abuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, haha I didn't even know that. I was just saying the flavor was so harsh and rough, it was rough to eat and made me feel like puking.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Modern house hold vanilla is normally artificial and has no alcohol. How do I know this, well highschool kids can be err creative sometimes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It wasn't so bad, I was a kid so it wasn't that much ice cream, just a couple of scoops. Certainly something I don't look back on negatively. It was more of a jesting notion than a &quot;you can't get up until you eat it all!&quot; thing, &quot;You poured it, so you eat it&quot; while laughing situation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I never understood the whole &quot;eat it all because we paid for it&quot; logic. It's just as wasteful to eat too much as it is to throw it away but now it's also potentially unhealthy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that's true for the vast majority of things that are flavored. They just use artificial coloring. </p></div>		</li>
