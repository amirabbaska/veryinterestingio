			<div class="markdown"><p>This was a great pitch for straight razors, but doesn't really answer the question. Why not make a microns thick blade out of something other than regular steel?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can, but all materials, no matter how hard, will corrode and dull at that thickness. Steel is just really, really easy to sharpen and really, really cheap, so we prefer to use it. It's really hard to sharpen carbide, diamonds, obsidian, etc. The average person doesn't have access to the kind of tools you'd need to sharpen those things.</p>
<p>Compare that to, say, a cheap steel blade and a strip of rough leather. Both inexpensive, requiring no formal training to use, and you can get them just about anywhere. You can replace the leather every few years for a few bucks. </p>
<p>Razors are just really sharp wedges, which mean they don't actually have a shearing force at all. You're literally using a doorstop to try to cut hairs that are 50-150 microns thin. The tiniest of imperfections in that wedge is going to prevent it from working correctly; and worse, cause you to cut your skin instead of your hair. These imperfections form naturally on all surfaces at that thinness, even diamonds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This and the fact that they dont want to lose the monopoly on &quot;cheap&quot; razors the refills are how they make money and if you just sold one blade to last a long time they would go bankrupt </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would an obsidian razor work? Afaik theyâ€™re pretty durable when it comes to keeping their edge; I may be mistaken though because it has been a while since I read that so I could very well be misremembering.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because regular steel is an <em>amazing</em> material to use for manufacturing. It's super cheap, to start with. Add a little bit of heat, and it turns into whatever shape you want with practically no effort. It's super hard compared to people and hair, but it's delightfully soft compared to abrasive grinding wheels. It's capable of attaining an incredibly sharp edge without the risk of that edge splintering. That failure mode of reliably going dull is actually a very attractive safety feature.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've used a straight razor for a while now. Even after getting it professionally sharpened, I don't think it ever really is as sharp as a disposable (double edge) razor blade is right out of the pack.  Still gets the job done, and like you said, does give a &quot;sense of pride and accomplishment&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It took me about 20 brands of razor blades, 8 different creams, and 2 actual razors to find one that didnt pull on my hairs. The combo i have i can make a down and up pass closer than any disposable ive tried. The only downside is it takes longer to prep the shave.  Sample kits are your friend. </p></div>		</li>
