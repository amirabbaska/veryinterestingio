<p>I imagine cells to be a fragile little, filled with tiny molecular machines. I wonder if they get damaged in any way?</p>
<p>What  a neat thing this is. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the main differences with animal and plant cells. Animal cells tend to be able to dehydrate and survive but if they over-hydrate they die, whereas plant cells are the opposite.  When plant cells over-hydrate the cell wall keeps them intact while animal cells simply burst, however if plant cells dehydrate the cell membrane shrivels up and rips away from the cell wall causing death while animal cells can shrivel up and often survive until they are rehydrated.  Tardigrades are just better at this than most other organisms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just stopping by as your friendly plant scientist to point out that seeds and pollen are made of plant cells that survive exactly the kinds of dehydration water bears do.</p>
<p>It's all about preparation, mostly replacing water with other molecules that can protect the proteins and lipids of a cell from the loss of water. Mostly these are sugars and other solutes like proline.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tardigrade used the sugar trehalose to protect the crystalline structure of their proteins during this dehydration. Also, after the tardigrade reabsorbs water, a number of genes are unregulated to reconstructs proteins and DNA that were damaged during dehydration</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of work has been done in sea monkey, Artemia fransiscana, resting eggs. The phenomenon is called cryptobiosis. There are some theories that involve sugar molecules forming glasses upon dehydration that stabilise the cellular membrane. If you have access to scientific journals  look up James Clegg and his work with cryptobiosis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The tardigrade is normally at normal amounts of intracellular water. When dehydrated, cellular water decreases by up to 85%, and the tardigrade goes into stasis. It cones out, no worse for wear, when rehydrated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While desiccated they can survive similar very high radiation doses as when hydrated so it is very possible they have active living processes maintaining their DNA and biological integrity in both states. There is yet a great deal of mystery remaining in Biology. Tardigrades are <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0133658" target="_blank">studied</a> because their capabilities are still some of the most mysterious. If Tardigrades extremophilic capabilities were just a result of dehydration and stasis, the many papers which have studied Tardigrades in particular should include at least one reference to support that conclusion.</p></div>		</li>
