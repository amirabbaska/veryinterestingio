			<div class="markdown"><p>Electronics engineer here. Missing part of above explanation goes as follows: magnetostriction. It's a property of conductive metal - during magnetization of such metal it is changing its shape. And magnetization in charger comes from alternating current from our sockets. Since frequency of current is around 50Hz, or 50 times per second if You will' it means that you should be able to hear a low tone hum. And indeed High voltage cables and transformers are humming as You probably know. But since in switch mode power supplies you are creating higher frequencies it's not low tone hum but high pitched noise. Pitch of this noise should depend on switching frequency. Not perfect and complete explanation but should be enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In case of hearing - sure they can. About disturbing I suppose it should be similar to waterfall or stream - it's noisy but constant so should not be so disturbing or at least You can get used to it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, not only part vibrate because they are loose, but it also dilate and contract due to... when it dump energy in the transformer, it heat up, which cause it to dilate, then it cool down and contract.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not really the case. The switching occurs about 50.000-1.000.000 times a second, the thermal capacity of any real transformer is WAY to high that this would be able to have any significant influence.</p>
<p>As another poster said, a main reason is actually magnetostriction, magnetic materials actually DO deform a little under magnetic field. It's not really much but the reason why a transformer is never soundless.</p>
<p>Loose parts are much louder in general, tough.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may not be the main cause, but nonetheless it is part of the reason... But yeah, lose parts, magnetostriction then thermal... Mostly lose parts...</p></div>		</li>
