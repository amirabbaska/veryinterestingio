			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple of other small nitpicks: </p>
<ul>
<li>the page watermarks are a bit too high-contrast and make page reading harder</li>
<li>the in-article questions are too close to the previous paragraph</li>
<li>on page 7, the figure description is too close to both the figure and the rest of the article</li>
<li>also on page 7-8 - since this is a digital format, pages are essentially free, so there is no need to start the next article immediately after the references of the previous one; it might be better to start each article at the top of it's own page (if you don't like having an almost-empty page, you can always fill it with a &quot;mini-question&quot; that's simple and has a direct answer, but is interesting nonetheless)</li>
<li>rounded corners make for uncomfortable boxing, unless the margins do not include the roundings (just a personal feeling though)</li>
<li>maybe try finding a less generic font for the headers, make them more distinct</li>
<li>the subreddit has a nice logo, why not use it as part of the logo of the magazine?</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The content is very good, so my critique is purely from a typesetting standpoint. The layout issues I found:</p>
<ul>
<li>Headings in the paragraphs have no spacing, the text becomes very dense.</li>
<li>The font used in the said headings is has an eye-cachingly larger letter spacing compared to the paragraph text.</li>
<li>The footer font could be smaller/more oblique.</li>
<li>Page 8 and 10: The DNA watermark graphic has green lines, that align with the text and could look like there's an emphasis on those lines. It looks a little messy altogether.</li>
<li>Page 11: Page number overlaps the figure</li>
<li>Page 12: The equation is wider than rest of the paragraph</li>
<li>Line spacing in references does not match rest of document</li>
<li>References heading has a colon in it, bugs me a lot, but could be just me.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's mostly small things, but they add up. </p>
<p>I can't wait to the next issue, keep up the good work!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll put out a light second on this. It doesn't offend me or anything, but there's a reason that generally speaking, even the most hipster mags still use caps for titles. Titles are supposed to draw your eye, and upper case words typically announce to one's brain that &quot;this is something important&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another tid-bit of constructive criticism: I began reading the PMS article and I think a good editor who has experience with scientific writing is needed here. Example: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Second, it allows me to tell you another important fact: the hormone progesterone (the blood concentration of which increases over 10 fold during the luteal phase) is a potent anaesthetic when injected in the blood stream, and is able to reduce the occurrence of catamenial epilepsy in about 75% of sufferers.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I cringed when I read that sentence, especially the portion in parentheses. Overall, I'm really impressed with what the authors were able to accomplish with their first issue and I really look forward to reading more of these. Hopefully, a good editor will volunteer that can help smooth out the writing so that this publication can become something that is as well respected as publications like Scientific American, Popular Science, etc. I believe that can and will happen based on the potential here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If /u/AsAChemicalEngineer and the others are interested, I work for a media agency for pharmaceutical companies, and I work with a few medical editors who might be interested in lending their expertise. I've also done a lot of proof-reading myself of regular literature, and would be happy to help correct mistakes like those I noticed on pages 8 and 14 (&quot;... turning it into the oxygen we breath&quot; and &quot;... a lot of applied maths isn't really like anyway&quot;).</p>
<p>Fantastic reading though, I enjoyed it. Super excited for the next issue, I love astronomy! </p></div>		</li>
