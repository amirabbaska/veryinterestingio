<p>When someone who always sleeps on there side gets a really nice firm mattress they aren't going to like it. It's going to put too much pressure on they're shoulders and hips. Same way with a back sleeper switching to a soft mattress, it will not give them nearly the same support that they're used to. </p>

<p>I'm a side sleeper and I made this mistake with a too firm mattress. Couple months later I just bought a mattress topper and it's been perfect since.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a side sleeper, I like the combo of a basic but decent-quality firm innerspring with a separate 2-3&quot; memory foam topper, and then a quilted-polyfill cover or layer on top of that (Tip: a twin comforter covers the top of a queen mattress handily).</p>
<p>The quilted-polyfill layer can be laundered and provides cool breathability and fluffy cush on top, while the foam conforms to the body, and the innerspring provides a durable and reasonably firm foundation to limit sinking in -- not to mention remaining conducive to bedroom recreation (a common challenge with all-foam mattresses like the Tempurpedic). This also works well for co-sleepers who sleep in different positions; the firm innerspring gives a back-sleeper the even, solid support they need, while the foam topper conforms to a side-sleeper's body.</p>
<p>By doing it in modular layers like this, the innerspring remains flippable, and any component can be replaced separately if/as needed -- unlike a pillowtop that can't be flipped and has to be replaced entirely once the pillowtop wears out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me right now. My shoulder hurts because I've been living off hand-me-down mattresses that are too form for my sleep style. Ive learned to fall asleep on my back but I inevitably roll over onto my side during the night and subsequently wake up. Time to go topper hunting!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We have a water, dust, mite, everything, proof cover on ours. It is amazingly helpful knowing that we won't have any issues on our mattress even 5 years and 100 spills later. And we even have a cover over that which is washable if needed. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When it comes down to it, it really is all about what you prefer. What I was saying is just general knowledge and does not apply to everyone. The only thing I would recommend is tossing a little pillow under your lower stomach to help with the stress on your lower back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The salesmen here all advise firm mattresses for stomach sleepers, to protect the back. A softer mattress allows your back to go hollow (and you are already laying at an angle) which is the worst position to have it in, and can give you back issues.</p>
<p>They all recommended the pillow under the stomach as well, if you must sleep on your stomach. And a tennisball sewn into your shorts to help you learn not to. The consensus was to never sleep on your stomach though, it's bad for you.</p>
<p>Source: have back issues, spent most of the weekend talking to mattress salesmen in about a dozen stores.</p></div>		</li>
