			<p>I'm going down the #2 route. Cheap college or community college are amazing. I went to a CC and received $9500 in aid/scholarships and my total expenses for an AA degree was ~$5100. Now I have a 4.0 that I can use to transfer to any college and get transfer and good grade scholarships. I used the extra money to buy a car that I fixed myself and is 100% paid off and insurance is cheap due to grades.<br><br>Often people stress &quot;prestigious uni or you're worthless&quot; or &quot;&quot;cc is for stupid people&quot; but at the end of the day, the student who went to uni 4 years has the same degree as the one who did cc then finished his last 2 years at uni.<br><br>Another big thing here is picking the right career path. I chose accounting and get offered nice jobs and I'm not done with school yet. My buddy went compsci and also gets good offers. My friend who went psychology doesn't get any offers. Picking a marketable major is highly important.</p>		</li>

			<p>I was feeling pretty good about myself. I spent the last 6 months busting my ass (working more than full time) to earn enough money to afford the last 2 classes I need to qualify for graduate student loans. These last 3 weeks, I've been working 13+ hour days, every day, and it's damn near killing me. <br><br>Since June, I've been working and I finally made my goal. The 7 credits I need are going to run my $7800. I'm fortunate I've been allowed to live with my folks all this time, because I can't see how I'd be able to afford this while also being responsible for room/ board over this past half-year. Heck, I don't even see how I could live off of what I made for 6 months. </p>		</li>

			<p>Where the fuck do you people live where you don't need a car? A lot of metro areas have public transpo sure, but living in those metro areas cost more. Pay $600 rent + $300-400 on car/gas in a suburb and commute vs. pay $1000+ to live in the metro and use public transpo. Neither one of those options allows you save enough to go to Europe!!</p>		</li>

			<p>Just stay there.<br><br>Joining the Army was the second biggest mistake I ever made.  Leaving the Army was the biggest.<br><br>It is easy to complain about how little the military pays as an unmarried lower enlisted soldier, but take a step back and you realize that you're making a <em>lot</em> of money.  Don't pay for the roof over your head, don't pay for your food, don't pay for healthcare or dental.  Then you take home 1500 a month which is essentially disposable income.  That is an absurd amount of disposable income and it goes up pretty quickly from there.<br><br>Work hard, get married, and in a couple of years you're making 50-60k a year all totaled between base pay, housing allowance, and food allowance.  You and your family have free healthcare and a solid list of benefits.  That is at an easily obtainable paygrade and only a few years.  It isn't even counting incentive pay.<br><br>All the while you're earning time in the rarest and most special unicorn of benefits:  a pension.  A fucking <em>pension.</em>  Santa Claus and leprechauns and griffons are more common in the US of A than pensions.<br><br>Then you get out and <em>nobody</em> gives a fuck about you.  Nobody cares what kind of responsibilities you had or how many guys you were in charge of.  The media has done a special kind of spin where everyone is supposed to respect soldiers and know that they're &quot;broken,&quot; but not care enough to hire them or pay for them to get help.  Employers want certificates and diplomas for the most basic of jobs.  When I got out the decent jobs needed a Bachelors, fuck your military experience.  In the time it took for me to get a Bachelors it came to need a fucking masters to be competitive.<br><br>The American economy would have to <em>radically</em> change for the common American to get a better deal outside of the military.  There aren't nearly enough good jobs in the country and the military is a good fucking job.  The job market is broken, the military works.</p>		</li>

			<p>Option 4 is actually not an option for many people though.<br><br>E.g. the Navy is limited to having about 323,000 sailors or so on active duty at any given year. The numbers for the Air Force and Marines are even lower, and the Army isn't that much higher given our withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan.<br><br>I'd certainly recommend looking at joining a service if you're qualified, but if everyone who could join tried to join, you'd see that many still don't ever make it in because there's no room for them.<br><br>With all that said, the Navy has set me up in a very good position as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>Go ahead and join, it's a good way to get off on the right foot, but.. You probably won't get as much for marketable skills as you think. And you have to keep in mind that if you get out after 4 years and want a job doing that, there are tons of other people getting out after 4 years with the same training and number of years of experience. You'll get paid plenty, though. I joined the air force with the same thinking, but the job training isn't what it was cracked up to be. <br><br>However, you'll get 4 years of good pay, and all you have to do is show up on time, shave, and pass a physical test once or twice a year. And not do drugs. </p>		</li>

			<p>Most states have some decent public schools. There's no correlation between the price of tuition at a school and the value of a degree from that school. There are many expensive private schools that aren't selective or prestigious, and some of the best universities in the U.S. are public, and very affordable for instate students. <br><br>For most people, it is more important to choose a career-track degree and pursue internships or other meaningful job experience than to attend the most prestigious school you can get info. An electrical engineering major from a local state school can have better job options and far less debt than an anthropology major from Vanderbilt. </p>		</li>

			<p>I'll agree with you to an extent about the [lack of a) need for university's prestige. It depends not on national recognition, but rather recognition within your field.<br><br>Sure, Yale or Harvard have big names that people recognize across the country, but that doesn't mean they're what you need. You need a school that has a respectable program in your field. An engineering degree from Yale isn't as cool as one from MIT, CalTech, UC Berkely[?], or, more locally to me, Rutgers, Rowan, NJIT, or NYU Polytech. Rutgers does have the additional national recognition of having a strong football team, but that doesn't get you into Boeing; the well-known, accredited engineering program does. Similarly, you wouldn't go to MIT for an elementary education degree. In NJ, you'd go to Rowan (formerly Glassboro state before Mr. Rowan donated $10mil to start an engineering program) or The College of NJ (TCNJ, formerly Trenton State). <br><br>Rutgers, Rowan, NJIT, and TCNJ are all in the mid-$20k range (with housing). NYU Poly is about $35k. MIT is around 55. Harvard is around $58k and Yale is around 63.<br><br>Additionally, it's not about where you spent your entire college career. It's about where you got your last degree (provided they're all the same major). Going to a county college right out of high school has a bad stigma around it and may be embarrassing, but if I could go back, I think I would have. Why, you ask? Because going to a county college <em>after</em> 3 years at a 4-year university is a lot more embarrassing when you drop one major for a new one. I have a plan and I've regained my academic traction, but now I'm on a 6 year plan (total) for just a Bachelors degree. If I started at county, I might not have been any closer to the degree, but I would have spent a lot less on tuition. My county college costs $4,000 a year. My former university costs  $24,000. That's $72,000 spent poorly.<br><br>What does a county college degree get me? Not much in the way of an engineering career, but quite a bit with a 4-year engineering program. My university of choice actually has a matriculation agreement with my county college: county associates = bachelors admission. <br><br>The point is that when I graduate with my bachelors degree from a 4 year university, no one is going to look at my county college's associates degree.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; I know plenty of people in the millennial range that make mid-$100k's with degrees from public schools<br><br>&gt; The keys? Marketable skills, showing up and putting in enough of an effort to make yourself stand above your competition. And frankly, as lazy as I see many (I didn't say all) millennials acting, you can do that if you truly want to.<br><br>Yes let us support this fallacy that people get those jobs as a direct result of hard work....<br><br>Most people I know who got jobs right out of college have a personal relationship with the company.<br><br>There are many public schools that will fuck you when it comes to networking.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fallacy my foot.  Every single one of those people I'm thinking of got the job on their own, and have proven themselves.<br><br>No offense intended, but your post seems like typical entitled rhetoric.  There are jobs out there for people who are willing to work. If you're expecting to have a high paying job handed to you, you're going to end up disappointed.

			<p>Well, we're talking about entry level jobs here.  So, the primary basis for the work is what you did in school. If you were smart, you did part time work while in school to help add to that, making you the more attractive candidate.  In other words, if you put two candidates in front of me, both with relevant educational background, but one has a low GPA and didn't do any kind of work, guess who I'm not picking.<br><br>As for resume stuffing, anybody who's interviewed more than two people can sniff that stuff out like a fart in a car.  Example: I interviewed a guy for a networking position a couple of years ago. He put all sorts of Linux and Unix experience on his resume. I asked him two simple questions that told me he was completely full of crap.  1. What's your editor? Answers you'd expect are vi or emacs. He told me he would use a Notepad on a PC. 2. What's your shell? I'll never forget his answer. &quot;I don't like to work in a shell, If prefer to work down in the main system itself, directly in the kernel.&quot; It was difficult to not burst out laughing.  See what I mean? Resume stuffing is terribly easy to shed light on.<br><br>Twice now, you've referenced &quot;interview tricks.&quot; The first time, they were even &quot;weird interview tricks.&quot; What are these tricks you keep referring to?</p>		</li>

			<p>Im no longer sure that cheap schools = crap jobs anymore.  <br>  <br>In fact, I think it would impress an interviewer if you explained that the choice to attend a specific university was calculated to put you in a place where you has manageable debt, and a marketable degree.</p>		</li>

			<p>There is a huge difference between a premium school, and less expensive school with a good reputation. No one said go to an unknown school.<br>  <br>West Texas A&amp;M, for example, costs $8312, for an out of state attendee, and is a well known, high ranking university.  <br> <a href="http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/slideshows/10-colleges-with-affordable-out-of-state-tuition/7" target="_blank">http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/slideshows/10-colleges-with-affordable-out-of-state-tuition/7</a>. <br>  <br></p>		</li>

			<p>Cool but my point still stands that a person with a more prestigious backing is FAR FAR more likely to get a job.<br><br>MSU is a great school but unless you have affiliation the interviewer would know that a UofM graduate would be a better choice.<br><br>Of course this is not a set rule just pretty much common sense...</p>		</li>

			<p>It helps , but you have to consider the <em>value.</em>  <br>  <br>What good is it to just have a better chance at a job if you have saddled yourself with crushing debt for it?    Because the debt is a guarantee.  <br>  <br>There are more entry level jobs out there there are graduating students from premium universities. (Depending on how broadly you define premium, if course).  <br> <br>And as soon as you have a few years work experience under your belt, your degree is much less of a factor.  <br></p>		</li>
