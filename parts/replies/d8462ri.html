<p>1) If your microwave is properly shielded this won't happen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every microwave on the market &quot;leaks&quot;: They have shields and seals, and so on, but a few watts will leak from any model on the market, short of outrageously irrational shielding. So no, your advice is wrong -- buy a new microwave and in the same situation you'll likely have the identical problem. As the top post mentioned, wifi operates at a very low power level, so even a tiny amount of radio noise will knock it out.</p>
<p>The people who have this problem usually have a specific scenario where a small amount (e.g. <em>normal</em>) of microwave leakage causes issues. A microwave between the AP and the consumer, or with a consumer with an iffy signal where the load of the added noise disrupts it. Etc.</p>
<p>And there is another post that says &quot;If your microwave is knocking your wifi offline, you have leakage and shouldn't be using the microwave.&quot; - that's just ridiculous. There is no health impact of a microwave having a tiny, normal amount of leakage, and if you go and replace the microwave you are almost certainly going to have exactly the same outcome with the replacement.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I finally bit the bullet because in my building there are 10+ 4-5 bar strength 2.4 GHz routers in range, all the channels are saturated. I started noticing that video streaming would get interrupted like my ISP was having trouble and eventually figured out my neighbors act like a giant wifi jammer network because of all the crosstalk.</p></div>		</li>
