			<div class="markdown"><p>That might help a little, because learning the heritage of your disease might help you shortcut your way to fighting it.  If it's a slight variant on something else, you can take what you already know about that other disease, and apply it.</p>
<p>In practice, most of the vaccines we have are for things that have been around for a very long time, and were just made based on the virus that's already floating around.</p>
<p>Additionally, to be honest, at this point finding that specific person is probably slower than straight-up genetic sequencing.  Get sample of new disease, send sample to lab, get genome, use genome to identify what it is.  I believe there is at least one that can do a full-sequence of a human (notably a much harder task than a virus) in something like 26 hours.  &quot;Hey look, it's 99.4% the same as this other thing, except with these few changes to this part that makes it way more virulent.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Depends on whether or not you can't actually culture that virus.  You need a certain amount of genetic material to test and you need to be able to single out virus DNA from whatever else is around.  It can be quite challenging, despite the fact that there are likely fewer base pairs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You go through healthcare records (if they exist), news stories, word of mouth, etc. to try to find the earliest cases, or the area where all the earliest cases happened. From there, you can interview patients, use records of families, and if present healthcare records, to see who got the disease before the others. It's like following a breadcrumb trail, where one hospital says their first patient came in from a different town, and then you go to that town. The town says that person who left to seek better medical care was just one of a whole list of people infected, so you look at the list of people infected, to see which ones were in close contact with one another, and if anyone from a different place came into the town from elsewhere who could have been carrying the disease. </p>
<p>Sometimes other methods can be used. With HIV, the virus mutates very quickly, so you can actually sequence the HIV RNA from multiple patients and compare them to each other. The patterns of mutations tell you which patients' viruses are most closely related to one another, allowing you to figure out who likely caught it from who. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, many diseases (as you've mentioned) have animal vectors. If you keep going down the line from patient to patient and find one that interacted with (or ate) a known carrier you've got a pretty good candidate for &quot;patient zero.&quot;</p>
<p>As I said in another comment, the last ebola outbreak was traced to a child who may have been playing in or around a tree filled with bats. Afaik, however, they were not able to conclude exactly how the disease was transmitted. The bats were gone if I remember correctly so they had to go with eyewitness accounts.</p></div>		</li>

It's a telling of the story of figuring out what was up with cholera in England and how water borne illness works. Part of the story is the hunt for patient zero as well as the beginnings of tracking the spread of disease relative to the source.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add onto hatherence's response, you'd likely do full interviews with people. People are smart enough to mention anything they did that was different for them, if they came back from vacation, interacted with animals, etc. You'd also dig for exact details. Theres a lot of bases covered in the interview, nothing is dismissed if its the breakout of a new disease. </p>
<p>You'd closely examine the lives of certain patients, and go from there. You may also examine the lives of healthy people, who did similar activities without contracting the disease. No stone unturned, but theres a lot of narrowing to be done.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What you're describing is what we call a cross-sectional study in which exposure/disease is established simultaneously</p>
<p>What epidemiologists have discovered is that people are surprisingly bad at identifying possible exposures if they don't contract a disease, making it doubly difficult to figure out <em>how</em> important the exposure was in the path to disease</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct! <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/02/24/tracing-the-long-convoluted-history-of-the-aids-epidemic/?utm_term=.4dc1310be0c0" target="_blank">Here's a WaPo article</a> about HIV's origin as a zoonotic virus. It references an excellent book called <em>Spillover</em> by David Quammen. </p>
<p>In his book, Quammen interviews Beatrice Hahn, a member of the study team that discovered the zoonotic origin of HIV via genetic testing of a similar virus found in chimpanzees. That virus, SIV, is now theorized to be the genetic ancestor of HIV.</p>
<p>Hahn's team was able to trace the origin of HIV back to chimpanzees living in the jungles of the Sangha river on the border of Cameroon and Congo. These chimpanzees were infected with a strain of the SIV virus, and the tests were able to closely match two clusters of SIV strains with human strains of the HIV-1 M group (90% of HIV-1 infections are group M).</p>
<p>It's thought that the virus became zoonotic–meaning that it jumped from one species to another–when a bushmeat hunter was injured and his blood mixed with that of an infected chimpanzee. Thus, the virus that causes the AIDS-like disease in chimps was able to find a suitable human environment wherein it mutated into a strain of the virus that we now call HIV.</p></div>		</li>
