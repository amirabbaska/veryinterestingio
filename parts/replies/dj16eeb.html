<p>Sounds like an awful lot of faffing about when you could just open the curtains.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So do the electrons physically leave the photovoltaic cell? That is to say when charging a battery for example, is it possible for some of the electrons to be captured in that battery or do they always return to the cell?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons leave the cell at the same rate as they enter the cell. Imagine a loop of tubing full of water driving a small turbine, driven by a pump, so it's Pump - Tubing - Turbine - Tubing - Pump (closing the circle). Here, the pump would be the solar cell, while the turbine is the charging battery, and the tubing is the wires. Does the water get stored in the turbine? No, it flows past it, imparting its energy on the turbine. Likewise, the electrons are not caught in the battery - one enters, one leaves. At any point, the circuit is stuffed full with electrons, with very small deficits like those caused by the impact of photons as described in the top post. These deficits drive the whole thing around, like the pump creating a &quot;lack&quot; of water on the side it is pumping from.</p>
<p>To make a crude analogy with water of what a solar cell does: Imagine a tray of water, and next to it, slightly higher, an empty tray. Now you throw marbles (photons from sunlight) at the lower tray. The marbles knock a little water out of the lower tray into the upper tray. Now, we connect the upper tray with a turbine (to use the power) and the output side of the turbine with the lower tray, thus closing the cycle. The water gets knocked up, runs down and does work for us, and then lands back where it started.</p>
<p>The analogy fails in several ways, but I guess it is a start.</p></div>		</li>

<p>As others have explained, when light hits the cell, it &quot;knocks&quot; electrons free</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By that do you mean the photoelectric effect ?</p>
<p>Also, there's something I don't get, when the electrons are excited and go back to the n-type doesn't that just bring us back to where we started ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The photoelectric effect happens in the same way, but no, this is less intense. Basically, in the crystal there are a number of energy &quot;bands&quot; that electrons can be in depending on how much energy they have, it's the crystal version of electron orbitals around atoms. The electrons are knocked free by jumping from the valence band, where they have low energy and are attached to an atom, to the conduction band, where they have high energy and are no longer attached to an atom. It's still within the crystal though. The photoelectric effect refers specifically to when elections absorb photons of such high energy that they're actually ejected from the material entirely. This is easiest to observe in metals.</p>
<p>And about the electrons returning to the n-type, that's a good question. The short answer is yes, but this only happens once the cell has reached its open-circuit voltage. How this works is that a depletion region is formed right at the junction. As soon as the two sides touch and diffusion occurs, the holes in the p-type are filled with the extra electrons from the n-type. This recombination happens within a certain distance from the junction until equilibrium is reached, at which point the positive and negative sides of the depletion region are settled and will be ionized as long as the equilibrium stays. That ionization in the depletion region creates the electric field, but only in that region, and that's what separates the free charges to one side or the other of the cell. When the cell is not under light, the diffusion and drift currents equalize and there is no voltage created. But the electric field is still there.</p>
<p>When light hits the cell, it generates a lot of new free charges that are separated by the electric field. And yes, they create a voltage that opposes the electric field. Once they have built up enough to cancel out the field, net flow stops. But the voltage remains! This is the maximum voltage a single cell can produce, the open-circuit voltage where no load is connected. When a load is connected, charges can flow out of the cell through it, so the voltage drops but current flow within the cell begins again because the depletion region field is no longer cancelled out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you allow me to rexplain it in shorter terms, to figure out if my understanding is correct? </p>
<p>n-type has extra electrons, p-type has less electrons (more holes), electrons diffuse from n to p creating an electric field towards n (I'm assuming there's no voltage now ? since the distribution is even) then comes the role of sunlight, which excites more electrons at the n-type, creating a potential difference in the opposite direction, thus weakening the electric field, by the time the electric field is gone (no forces acting on electrons, they remain where they are), the n-type has more electrons, while the holes in the p-type are filled, and is that what created the potential difference ?</p>
<p>Also thank you for explaining the difference between the photovoltaic and photoelectric effects, I've learned a bit about band theory in school. it is customary that the semi conductors used have  a small forbidden band so that the photon are able to make the electrons 'jump' to the conduction band, is that correct ?</p></div>		</li>
