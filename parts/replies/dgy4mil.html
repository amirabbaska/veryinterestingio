			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had multiple doctors and PAs tell me that medication are labeled to expire long before they actually lose potency or become dangerous.  It's in the pharmaceutical companies' best interest for things to expire sooner so you have to throw it away and buy more.  Unfortunately, since they aren't putting a true expiration date on there, you still legally have to follow what they put on the bottle.  </p></div>		</li>
