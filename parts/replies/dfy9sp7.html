			<div class="markdown"><p>A note about prepped readings. Several psychics have been caught with recording devices and/or spies in the theater lobby. People coming in will often talk about what they are hoping to hear about. It doesn't take many details being correct to make even a skeptic start to question themselves and hearing a psychic say &quot;I'm getting a Mary who died last year after a long fight with cancer... Maybe someone's mother?&quot; and being bang on the money will have the crowd eating out of the palm of their hand.</p>
<p>For more general info about cold reading techniques, there's a great South Park episode that covers the basics while ripping the scam apart.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I taped a seminar where a guy did exactly that. On the one hand it felt very obvious and see through. On the other hand... I kind of felt like these people, who were obviously in horrible pain over the loss of their loved one, finally got some closure. Doesn't make the guy taking their money less of a scum bag, but I really think it helped a lot of people to, say, hear that their dead son is happy and loves them. </p></div>		</li>

<p>shotgunning - is a basically a technique which gets used all over the place where you say things that are in reality very general but relate to people personally so sound very specific. (see buzzfeeds X number of things show you come from X. hint: they are all very similar)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is similar to things like horoscopes right? The outcomes they give are very vague/general and could apply to almost anybody reading it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  </p>
<p>Opportunities present themselves in strange places, if you are ambitious.  Relax, don't stress; your day will come.</p>
<p>Blows my mind that people can't see this stuff for what it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of my high school teachers basically proved this. He gave us all what he said was our horoscope and asked us all how accurate it seemed. Like 75% of the class thought it was dead on... he then revealed he had given us all the exact same horoscope (I believe it was his).</p>
<p>If you believe in that kind of stuff you will be able to make anything reinforce that belief</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes it's a very similar thing. </p>
<p>For people that are looking for it to be right, they are very willing to bend a vague statement to fit their own ideas. </p>
<p>fortunately, people who do not believe it, tend not to read it either :). </p></div>		</li>
