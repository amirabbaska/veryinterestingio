			<p>I'm not a biologist, but <a href="http://www.manta.com/search?ftoggle-frontend-prod-on=abTests.revenue.responsive_12162014_control&amp;amp;utm_expid=82789632-30.8Ue3RXoXRoWAwC0cgSs_wg.1&amp;amp;search_source=nav&amp;amp;pt=40.6999%2C-89.5951&amp;amp;search_location=Peoria+IL&amp;amp;search=biology&amp;amp;location=Near+Peoria%2C+IL&amp;amp;utm_referrer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.manta.com%2Fsearch%3Fftoggle-frontend-prod-on%3DabTests.revenue.responsive_12162014_control%26search_source%3Dnav%26pt%3D30.068893%252C-81.5621%26search_location%3DJacksonville%2BFL%26search%3Dbiology%26location%3Dpeoria" target="_blank">some of these companies</a> might be hiring people like you. In a field like yours (or mine, engineering), you pretty much go wherever the work is and it probably pays pretty well, right? In a response to a comment similar to yours, I posted another link from the above website that showed 15,000+ companies in nearby Peoria. There's certainly opportunity there for people who are willing to leave their comfort zone and branch out a little bit.<br><br>Cheers.</p>		</li>

			<p>Great example, its only a 3hrs / 175 miles commute to Chicago or any other major city where you'll find good paying jobs.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm pretty sure <a href="https://caterpillar.taleo.net/careersection/cat+university+cs/jobsearch.ftl?lang=en&amp;amp;portal=6140124208&amp;amp;src=CWS-10005" target="_blank">most of these jobs</a> for recent college grads would pay for that little house or one that costs two or three times as much. Don't wanna work for Caterpillar? That's okay, how bout working for one of the other 15,000+ companies in Peoria? Surely, there are opportunities to be found there if you'd uncross your arms and stop tapping your foot, waiting for that gig at Google (also not in a huge city, mind you) to pan out. You don't have to live in one of the biggest cities in the western hemisphere to have a job that pays well.<br><br>Cheers.</p>		</li>
