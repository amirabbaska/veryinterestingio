			<div class="markdown"><p>Dry aging is different. Jerky you run low humidity air over it so the outside completely dessicstes and bacteria can't live. Also you usually use liquid smoke and high acid marinades. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh, not always, most of the brands I get don't salt them (I HATE salty foods, any salty taste is too much for me).  Tomatoes are pretty acidic and dry pretty quickly though so I'd imagine that helps them a lot</p></div>		</li>
