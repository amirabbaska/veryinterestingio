			<div class="markdown"><p>There's descriptions from people with it over on /r/aphantasia, from what I've read it's as simple as them not having a minds eye (or a poor one). Some also lack the ability to have a voice or any type of sound in their head.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is perhaps going off on another tangent, but how would you verify that a condition like aphantasia exists if all you have is people's testimonies to go on? An MRI while asking them to visualize objects?</p>
<p>Due to the qualitative nature of describing metacognition, and qualia in general, for all you know people overestimate how vivid the experience of visualization is supposed to be, and thus conclude they're unable to do so.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, scientists have put people with aphanatasia in MRI machines and seen differences in brain activity when asked to visualise something.</p>
<p>Here is an article from the New Scientist on it: <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gjpFY" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/gjpFY</a></p>
<p>Prof Adam Zeman from the university of Exeter has written some papers on the condition as well if you are interested.</p>
<p>I have aphantasia and I can assure you I'm not just overestimating the vividness of what you can see, because I don't see anything at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I actually emailed Prof Zeman the other day to see if he still needed studies completed. Waiting to hear back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, how do you recall memories? How do recall a house you used to live in or event like a concert?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can people with aphantasia play chess?  Can they imagine what the board would like if they moved their knight to a different spot?  Can they figure out traffic patterns that might happen in the future?  Can they do geometry in their heads?</p>
<p>For me, images seem to come from a black place, but I can do the above and think through movie scenes.</p></div>		</li>
