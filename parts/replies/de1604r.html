<p>It seems like this will never be paid...</p>

<p>I agree with the answer, I'm just following up on this one point.</p>
<p>When you buy a bond, there is a maturity date on it when the government will give you cash in exchange for the bond.  You get paid on that date.  That the government will never be &quot;debt-free&quot; has nothing to do with your payment.  You will get paid on that date even if the government has to sell new bonds to make your payment.   But there's always a high demand for these bonds.  Sales of new bonds are always successful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly.  Now if all of a sudden the interest rate that we had to pay on that debt went up dramatically, that would be something to worry about.  We currently pay about $220 billion in interest on the debt per year and this is with historically low interest rates.</p></div>		</li>
