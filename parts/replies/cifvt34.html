<p>There's no way we wouldn't still have slaves today... I can't even imagine what we'd be living like</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's pretty cool, but what keeps the captured ants in the new colony? Why don't they just go back &quot;home&quot;? I assume they go out and roam around looking for food and things to bring back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Basically they steal them as children and then stockholm syndrome them into thinking this is thier normal home. Ants are run on pheromones, they use them to determine thier role, loyalties communication and to determine where home is. if the prison is all they've ever known there not inclined to insurrection. Does make you wonder how they got the first slaves though.</p>
<p>from the wiki: Polyergus obtains its Formica work force by stealing pupae from nearby Formica colonies and carrying them back to its own nest. Back in the Polyergus nest, Formica workers are eventually helped to emerge from the cocoons and pupal exuvia by Formica workers already living there. The new workers quickly assimilate the characteristic odor of the mixed-species population of the Polyergus colonyâ€”without violence or coercion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the eggs, but the pupae. The slave ants seem to think they're caring for eggs of their own species of ant, but when they hatch, they can tell the other ants are foreign by smell.</p>
