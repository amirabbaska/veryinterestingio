			<div class="markdown"><p><em>Photons</em> are absorbed and re-emitted in the medium.  This is absolutely what happens.  To photons.</p>
<p>Photons in a medium are not independent objects doing their own thing, they're part of a super-position between the ambient electromagnetic field and that generated by the atoms of the medium. In this super-position, electromagnetic waves travel more slowly; the quantized energy packets, however, always travel at c between atoms/molecules.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See now I'm unsure what to believe. A professor in <a href="https://youtu.be/CiHN0ZWE5bk" target="_blank">this video</a> stated pretty clearly that photons do not get absorbed and re-emitted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With both of those you're still dealing with the physical object, but a change in terminology because of its 'status' if you will, a piece in the air versus a piece that reaches the ground. I think I see your meaning, the interaction of the material with the atmosphere.</p>
<p>However, I just wanted to stress that in the case of the polariton we're dealing with behavior &quot;like&quot; an object with specific properties existed. However, this specific object doesn't literally exist, it is a manifestation of the interactions of the &quot;actual&quot; components of the system as a whole (our photons and the medium). </p></div>		</li>
