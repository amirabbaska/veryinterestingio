			<div class="markdown"><p>Worker bees' responsibilities change with age, but it's reversed: they spend their first 3 weeks as a &quot;house bee&quot; and then transition to being a &quot;field bee&quot; after that.</p>
<p>House bees are in the hive maintaining the comb, feeding larvae, guarding, ventilating, etc.</p>
<p>Field bees are the ones out foraging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Activities involving flight may start from the third day after emergence from the brood cell, but the young worker begins her actual foraging activity later. Between the 18th and the 21st day, her hypopharyngeal and wax glands have become too weak to function, so that she cannot produce royal jelly to feed the queen and the young larvae, nor wax to build comb cells. But by this time she is in perfect condition to fly and knows the geography of the locality. She therefore starts field work, fetching nectar, pollen, propolis or water, but always concentrating her activity on the immediate needs of the colony.</p>
