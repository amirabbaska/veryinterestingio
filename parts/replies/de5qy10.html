			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory which describes this. I work on it. Its called the standard model extension. It involves adding to the lagrange density all possible lorentz violating terms. The coefficients of these terms act like a background field against which an idea of absolute motion may be formulated.</p>
<p>And yes there are many effects. One is that momentum and velocity are generally not aligned. Another is that CPT symmetry sometimes does not hold.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. If there was such a thing as an absolute zero speed, it would also have absolute zero movement which would make that mass attain absolute zero.  </p>
<p>Of course, there is no way to have an absolute frame of reference so you'll never be moving at absolute zero speed, and the uncertainty principle means that you can't have an object at absolute zero temperature or energy because you could then predict its position with 100% accuracy, which is not permitted in quantum mechanics.  In QM, those sorts of things are always probabilities, there is always some little bit of jitter or uncertainty as to where a particle actually is until the waveform collapses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using the transformation rules for velocity in special relativity (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula</a>) we can clearly see that the speed of light is the only speed everyone can agree on. If you have something that is at rest in one frame, it will be moving in a moving frame.</p></div>		</li>
