			<div class="markdown"><p>May have been a political concession when the NHS was developed. It was a wildly unpopular idea among doctors and many politicians to begin with so I wouldn't be surprised if it is a result of compromise</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it seems to be the way that patients treat it (or have been advised). </p>
<p>everyone i know with glasses gets a test done every 6 months or should. similarly dental checkups are advised 6 months and i know a lot of people who maintain this. </p>
<p>on the other hand, most people don't request a physical every 6 months  tending only to go to their GP when something is wrong. </p>
<p>So GPs and hospitals tend only to see people who are vulnerable (children, elderly, pregnant women). </p>
<p>Whereas I see a lot more of the working age population in the dentist waiting room. </p>
<p>I think it's because teeth and eyes are the most intricate parts of the body, difficult to manage and easily damaged. </p>
<p>for instance,  it's perceived that our hearts will beat until it's our time to go but our eyes and teeth will  give us problems throughout. </p>
<p>in short, teeth and eye problems tend to be minor but frequent while other general practice issues tend to be infrequent but major. </p>
<p>medical resourcing aside, we'd all have 6 month physicals and even mental health checkups</p>
<p>this in my opinion is the big advantage of a private health care. if you're paying a lot you're going to demand value for money and your doctor will be there for you like any customer assistant. however obviously it only applies to people who can and do pay. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My guess is that dental is mostly considered cosmetic. If your dental problems actually impose a health risk it can be covered by medical coverage, at least in the US as I understand it.</p>
<p>I expect there is similar justification for vision. For example, does NHS cover guide dogs or canes? I expect they do. Will they buy you reading glasses if you get a headache from reading for more than 30 minutes in a sitting, probably not. And yet if you can see well enough to read all the fine print regarding your prescription drugs, a pharmacist is legally required to read it to you and make sure you understand everything it says before dispensing a medication (at least in the US).</p>
<p>Thus, they are additional coverages on top of medical coverage for non medical issues.</p>
<p>Make sense? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's true, but compared to the article posted above where a root canal was quoted at $1000, subsided by the NHS it would come under <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/NHSEngland/Healthcosts/Pages/Dentalcosts.aspx" target="_blank">band 2 at £56.30</a>, or £244.30 if you needed a crown. That seems pretty reasonable in comparison. Being under 18 or pregnant (or recently pregnant) are  also always exempt.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nurse here I am the biggest advocate of the NHS lol it’s amazing, so I was in no way criticising the system. I just meant it was interesting that it’s separated in this country from the main body of healthcare too when a lot of the issues overlap. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're unlucky then your NHS dentist won't be able to do the root canal and it's a £600 bill from a specialist. Although in retrospect that seems quite reasonable too. Being able to chew is quite handy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The NHS does cover dental and vision, it is the body that pays and ensures value for money from dentists and optometrists. It’s just there is a tiered co-pay for dentistry depending on the treatment. So you only pay the co-pay if you are a working adult earning over a certain threshold (so only about 20% of people pay a co-pay). All dental treatments (except implants for purely cosmetic reasons) are covered.
For vision you are given a certain amount to spend on a pair of glasses or contact lenses and if you want to spend more (eg in designer frames) then you pay the extra.
Interestingly dentistry and vision were completely free for all at the start of the NHS but when they found out how many people actually needed glasses then they introduced the voucher system fairly quickly. Dentistry followed a few years later.</p></div>		</li>
