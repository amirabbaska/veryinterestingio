			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, you sure are supposed to. That's the full sugar development in bananas and it tastes really great when you use those. The bright yellow bananas are a no-no because they lack the full sugar development. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm pretty sure my family has figured out that my banana bread recipe calls for three ripe bananas. My kids stop eating bananas when there are three left and once they are solid black, I get asked when I'm going to make bread several times a day. Black bananas make the best banana bread! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, you're absolutely right about seeing more acidic fruits in sherberts! The makers would still have to do additional preparation with the apple to make it come through in sherbert due to the tartness and the dairy. It's a similar reason why you don't really see cranberry ice cream or sherbert either. You'll see them more commonly in sorbet form at restaurants. But as always, each tart fruit has to be treated a little differently because they have personalities that vary. :) </p>
<p>Sour fruits are way easier to tame because all it really takes is some extra sugar. Tart fruits just need more love! In the end, if it costs more to produce then the less likely they are to produce it. </p></div>		</li>
