			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak for the science behind it, but personally I know my body and mind have a 2.5 hour sleep cycle. If I sleep for that long or any multiples of it, I wake up feeling great. I strongly disagree with &quot;not having to wake up at 4:30&quot; because the extra 2 hours are gonna have minimal effect on the length of your day, compared to waking up exhausted because you interrupted your cycle. Maybe instead op should go to bed later, or maybe earlier to try and hit that sweet spot to wake up when he needs to. Just saying, every time I've gone back to bed after waking up naturally (because why not) my day has been complete and utter shit. Knowing your cycle will change your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not necessarily related, but in my experience, I always seem to enjoy sleeping in when I'm supposed to be waking up soon.</p>
<p>I'll gladly wake up early on a weekend and savour the day, but the five minutes before I have to get up for school is the best sleep I ever get.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same.  When I used to wake up at 5:00 for training at my new job I'd often wake up at 4:30 and just stay awake and feel fine.  Went back to sleep once and was dead to the world until I'd had enough caffeine to kill a lesser human.</p></div>		</li>
