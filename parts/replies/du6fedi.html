			<div class="markdown"><p>causality!=causation argument there. I think the elasticity of the rubber allows for the pressure wave to be released faster since and more evenly the more the rubber is stretched the faster it will pull back. The loud noise we here is not of a contracting band but a single large pressure differential which our ears precieve</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmmm.  we may be on the same page here. I blame the lack of coffee. Large pressure differential is what we hear. I just wanted to add that the material can affect the pressure differential. I didn't mention pressure since it was mentioned a few times already. If I am still not on track, let me know. It's been a long morning. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can see that rubber pulling back along the pressure &quot;bubble&quot; inside a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TafQvch0p9o" target="_blank">balloon here</a>. Note the rubber smoothly sliding around that bubble. Clearly the pressure wave the air forms is moving slower than the rubber is pulling back. This makes a step function of pressure that moves outward as the pop sound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>so, not exactly apples to apples, but if you fill a balloon with hydrogen gas and then &quot;pop&quot; the balloon with fire (igniting the hydrogen in the process), the sound is incredible loud - like breaking windows loud. Seems like lower molecular density argument is somewhat undercut by this effect</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is the rapid expansion of the air caused by combustion, nothing to do with the balloon. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and since it is a gas it will easily mix to fully combust, so you get one quick flash and a rapid expansion of the combustion gasses creating a pressure wave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun-fact: because that's the point. You don't actually want to compress the helium because that would increase density and decrease lift.</p></div>		</li>
