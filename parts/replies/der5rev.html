			<div class="markdown"><p>Good response. But what about stone? Some stone can be highly polished. It's not as reflective as polished metal, of course, but it's still fairly so.</p>
<p>Edit: Okay, from u/daafuck 's response below (at the moment), apparently the answer is higher density, which metal, various species of stone, and the harder plastics certainly have in common.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not the correct explanation. While true that the reflectivity of light from a surface incorporates the ability for electrons to move to freer energy states, i.e. the photoelectric effect, the reason why some materials can be polished to a shine while some cannot has to do with light scattering on a microscopically uneven surface.</p>
<p>A rough surface (think microscopic hills and valleys) will scatter light in all directions, making the material appear dull, while a flat surface will not scatter light in this manner.</p>
<p>The reason why stones and metals can be polished is because they have a microscopic crystalline structure. So when you polish them  (remove the hills and valleys) the material is basically uniform underneath. Woods and plastics have non-uniform structures, so when try remove the top layer you just end up with more hills and valleys. This makes them nearly impossible to polish (by mechanical means)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're correct, but missing a few key details.</p>
<p>First, we need to better define what we mean by &quot;polished&quot;. What you (and probably most people) think of it as would be in terms of a mirror - a piece of metal is polished when you get a good clear reflection out of it.</p>
<p>This only captures part of it though. To really understand it we need to split it into two separate concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reflectivity - this is how much light (and what wavelength) is reflected by a material</p>
</li>
<li>Surface roughness - this is how smooth a surface is (and in technical terms is generally what &quot;polished&quot; refers to)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we look at a piece of metal with a good reflection, it has high reflectivity and a very smooth surface. This means that it is not only reflecting light, but the light that is reflected doesn't bounce off in a weird direction when it hits a microscopic bump on the surface. In order to be what most people would consider a mirror, any material needs to have both these properties.</p>
<p>Now things like plastics and glass can absolutely be polished to have a very smooth surface, and if you look closely you will still see a very faint reflection off the surface. The reason we don't consider it a mirror is because the reflection is so weak that it is difficult to see under most circumstances. This is a case of a very smooth surface but low reflection (and as an optical engineer, glass/plastic/other material that has a very smooth surface is considered &quot;polished&quot; even though it doesn't provide a mirrored surface).</p>
<p>You can also think of a metal plate that is very rough. You can clearly see light reflecting off it, but it scatters very quickly so you cannot get good detail. On a microscopic level about the same amount of light is reflecting off the surface, but because the surface isn't smooth and flat the light will get scattered every which way and you won't be able to see a nice reflected image.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about materials like wood for a minute. It is possible to &quot;polish&quot; wood so that it has a much smoother surface, but you can't get as smooth a surface on wood as you could on glass or plastic. This is because wood is actually made up of grain and cells that are much larger than the particles that glass or plastic are made up of. This means that even if you were to perfectly polish a piece of wood so that there was a single flat layer of the wood particles, because those particles are bigger the overall surface would be more rough.</p>
<p>Imagine you have two boxes. In one you place a single tightly packed layer of small ball bearings, and in the other you place a single tightly packed layer of baseballs. The surface across the top of the ball bearings would be flatter and less rough than that of the baseballs because they are smaller, even though there is a single flat layer of each.</p>
<p>The size of the particle that any material is made up of will actually determine a limit on how smooth the surface can be polished. You can't ever make a surface smoother than it would be with a single layer of particles on the surface.</p></div>		</li>
