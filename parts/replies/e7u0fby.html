			<div class="markdown"><p>You can explain many different sorting algorithms in a manner in which a 5 year old can understand. </p>
<p>Bubble Sort -- handful of items to be arranged by height.</p>
<p>Look at two things and put the shorter one on the left and the taller one on the right. Then look at the one on the right and compare it to the next one to the right. Repeat until you reach the end. Then start at the left again and keeping going through all of the items until you don't swap any items around.<br />
There, a 5 year old understands bubble sort.</p></div>		</li>
