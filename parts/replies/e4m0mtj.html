			<div class="markdown"><p>Sure, changing to the composition of the cell membrane and efflux pumps can both make a cell more resistant to solvents like alcohol.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting, thank you.</p>
<p>Side question: This article is about Gram-negative bacteria. Is there any significant difference in the solvent toxicity between gram positive and negative bacteria?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Slight correction, the surviving (Whatever) probably already have some resistance to the given cleaning product which is why they survived, and with no competition will now multiply. These copies will mutate randomly (it's not exactly random but let's not go into that) spreading itself and it's resistance (assuming it's not mutated away) to whatever biome the (whatever) previously inhabited. Once the same cleaner, or a different one, is used on this new bacteria (whatever) then, again, the most resistant strains will survive while the others die. Rinse and repeat until you get some bacteria that can't be killed at all by whatever cleaning method has been used.</p>

<p>The process of evolution in action. It's so effective NASA can't clean Mars probes of bacteria entirely, there's stuff that's evolved to resist high levels of radiation, alcohol, whatever. It's a big concern when trying to detect life on Mars (and whatever moon some probe will be sent to later, etc.) because you don't accidentally want to detect bacteria you brought with you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Microbiologist here. Probably the most studied radiation-resistant organism is the bacterium <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans" target="_blank"><em>Deinococcus radiodurans</em></a>. It maintains several copies of its genome and has a very impressive suite of DNA repair enzymes. It seems that most methods of radiation resistance that have evolved mitigate instead of prevent damage from ionizing radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>General answer:  They can develop/adapt the pumps they have on their surface to push out substances poisonous to them (like antibiotics) or keep vital stuff in (like water).  They can also have very many repeats of very simple instructions as their genetic code to increase the chance of enough working parts remaining intact to stay alive in spite of radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait, wait, I thought this was near-impossible? Every time this question is asked, people said alcohol resistance evolving in bacteria was like &quot;throwing grenades at people and those that survive will slowly become immune to grenades.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I haven't read that article specifically, but read a few when that article started making the circuit. It would make sense that some bacteria would have a mutation that makes them more resistant to alcohol, and through repeated exposure would start to develop that resistance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The difference is mainly that beneficial human wall (i.e. skin) mutations are much less common, due to a combination of low reproduction rates, higher genetic stability, and the complexity of the human body (e.g. A mutation that hardens the skin could also mess up vital organs).</p>
<p>If we had a greater variety of macroscopic phenotypes, the analogy would work fine. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are able to, would you,very kindly, be able to direct me to a solid piece of scientific literature that explores this phenomenon?  </p>
<p>This has always been a very specific topic that has interested me since my sophomore year of college. In fact, the chem professor I performed research under in college originally had planned study this to some degree, but due to grant restrictions on the department was forced to give up on this idea completely (we ended up researching molecular composition changes in whiskey mashes, for the record, which isn’t nearly as interesting as it comes off was also less pertinent to me than his proposed sterilized resistance research)</p>
<p>More recently though, this is a topic that I have, on numerous occasions, gotten into,sometimes heated, arguments with various highly educated individuals. This arguments usually don’t even bother with whether this phenomen is actually happening, or whether it is something that needs to be worried about, but just that it is even possible to begin with. </p>
<p>I have done some light research into the subject during my less eventful free time. Unfortunately I haven’t been able to find the substances I need to either confirm or deny my position. </p>
<p>Thank you for the reply. If you could offer anything to follow up on, it would be greatly appreciated. </p></div>		</li>
