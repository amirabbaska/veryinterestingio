<p>Are astronauts required to have appendicectomies and cholecystectomies prior to their mission? If so, what about endometrial ablation? Given the radiation in space, have any female astronauts gone on to have kids? If so, have they turned out 'normal'? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>NASA absolutely does not surgically alter their astronauts. As for radiation, both men and women in the Corps are advised to avoid pregnancy for up to one year after living aboard the Space Station, in part, due to radiation, but also due to the physiological changes that occur in the microgravity environment</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. It was my understanding that people going for Arctic trips do require these procedures. It would seem logical that going to space would entail the same precautions. </p>
<p>Thanks for the answers everyone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The poles are actually further away from civilisation than space. If something goes wrong and you need a doctor it could take days to get you to safety. On the ISS all you have to do is get them off the station and point down (obviously there's a lot more to it but that's the basics)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, astronauts are not required to have appendectomies, much less cholecystectomies (which are quite a bit riskier).</p>
<p>And the radiation exposure in space is about 10-20 times higher than on Earth. So spending, say, six months on ISS is like spending 5-10 years on Earth. Do you know any women who spent 5-10 years on Earth and went on to have normal children?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You have to consider how low the average dosage on earth is though.    An average person on earth will receive ~4mSv a year.  To give some reference numbers Three mile island only released 1mSv and a head CT scan gives you 2mSv.  </p>
<p>Now, giving your 10x-20x number, an astronaut in a year would receive between 40mSv and 80mSv.  The EPA says that radiation workers can only receive 50mSv in a year.  And the lowest dosage that has been clinically linked to an increase in cancer is 100mSv.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its all about amount and type.  Alpha for example doesn't get far but what it gets to it fucks up quickly and badly.  On the other end you have gamma which goes really far but is likely to pass clean through without damage and if it does hit something does a range of damage depending on strength.  But to answer your question, in this case it is unlikely cause you have to consider how low background is on earth.  Even at 10x the normal dosage on earth, you are still under what the EPA dictates radiation workers can receive within a year.  </p></div>		</li>
