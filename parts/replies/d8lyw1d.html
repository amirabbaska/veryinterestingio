			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea. CSPRNGs are really slow compared to PRNGs, so you use PRNGs whenever you don't need to worry about security. Though <a href="http://hackaday.com/2015/12/28/v8-javascript-fixes-horrible-random-number-generator/" target="_blank">PRNGs can be flawed</a> too, so depending on your simulation, it might not be as random as you would like.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In this case, the NSA created a seemingly-secure CSPRNG that to a naive observer appeared to produce an output indistinguishable from random.</p>

<p>Actually, DUAL_EC_DRBG's output was noted to be biased really early on.</p></div>		</li>
