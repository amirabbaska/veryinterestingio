			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Also, 1rst-source ticket vendors aren't blind to what's going on... there's a lot [that will likely be] <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3021505/ticketmaster-stubhub-ticket-wars" target="_blank">happening in this space in the future</a>...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're only thinking of revenue, then yeah.  But if you take into account the effort and expenses of managing the ticket sales themselves, they might actually come out ahead with this arrangement.  They wouldn't do it this way if it didn't make business sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All true, but supply is not necessarily limited. I've heard many big artists claim they want to keep ticket prices low so that true fans can afford the show. All this does is create the market for the middle man. Big acts could add more shows in a town or tour incessantly if they really wanted to satisfy consumer demand.</p>
<p>I think Garth Brooks has done this in the past. He announces shows in a city and each time one sells out, he announces another one for the next night.</p></div>		</li>
