			<div class="markdown"><p>IIRC, Smoker's cough is caused by those cilia being destroyed by smoking. So the mucus just runs down into your lungs because there are fewer cilia to push out the mucus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>to add to that, smokers who have been smoking for a long time and then quit often get &quot;sick&quot; as the cilia revive from not being constantly killed off by smoke. im thinking about quitting soon and i am not looking forward to hacking up years of crap that should have been cleared by cilia.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most stuff gets stuck in the mucus and you cough it out. When things <em>really</em> go &quot;down the wrong pipe&quot; (aspiration) you will often end up with pneumonia. Getting stuff in your lungs other than air is a bad time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep. Nasal hairs are also part of the filtration system. I only trim mine when it looks like a family of spiders is trying to escape from my nose.</p></div>		</li>
