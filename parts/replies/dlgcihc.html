			<div class="markdown"><p>Great explanation, but I would emphasize that depletion of albumin (a protein that keeps water in vessels via oncotic pressure) leads to ascites, which is fluid in the abdomen. Kinda semantics but I differentiate between ascites and edema. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From UpToDate:</p>
<p>Multiple lines of evidence have shown that inadequate intake of dietary protein is not the primary trigger for edematous malnutrition. As examples, some patients have edematous malnutrition without hypoalbuminemia; others develop edematous malnutrition despite adequate proportion of protein in the diet (eg, in exclusively breastfed infants); and others recover from edematous malnutrition with supportive care even without enhancing the protein content of the diet. </p>
<p>Thus, neither protein deficiency nor hypoalbuminemia appear to be the primary cause of the edema in kwashiorkor. Instead, hypoalbuminemia appears to be a common complication and may contribute to the edema in many patients by permitting movement of fluid from the vascular space into the interstitium; this is compounded by retention of sodium and water by the kidneys. The carbohydrate component of the diet increases insulin levels, which further enhances renal reabsorption of sodium and water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi I have a dumb question, is ascites pronounced like &quot;ass-ites&quot; or like &quot;ass-ite-ees&quot;, or something completely different? I'm a second year vet student and we had a practise case study with ascites today and couldn't figure out how to pronounce it haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I am not sure, but as with any malnourishment issue, being hungry all the time/lacking sustenance probably isn't very conducive to happiness, so I would expect the person to be apathetic, fatigued and worn-out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those who are malnourished are likely iron deficient, which means they are anemic secondary to improper-inadequate red blood cell production, which would result in fatigue. Malnutrition also contributes to impaired cognitive development (I don't know this mechanism). </p></div>		</li>
