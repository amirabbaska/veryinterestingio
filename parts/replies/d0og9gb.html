			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. </p>
<p>The classic &quot;thought experiment&quot; is to consider two spaceships traveling at nearly the speed of light. I'm in one ship, you're in the other.</p>
<p>If the spaceships are traveling away from each other, and I point a yellow flashlight at you, you will measure the photons from that light as traveling at 'c' but they will appear to be deep red or infrared. (The color varies depending on exactly how fast we are going.)</p>
<p>Conversely, if our ships are traveling towards each other and I aim a yellow flashlight at you, you will still see the photons as traveling at speed 'c' but they will be blue, violet or ultraviolet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an analogy, imagine you're rolling a series of balls at someone. Normally you roll 1 ball every 3 seconds from a stand still at the same speed. Now, you roll a ball, run up a few feet, stand still again and roll the next one. You are rolling at the same speed but since you traveled in the same direction as your roll your next ball is closer to the first one.  The person you're throwing at will get the balls in quicker succession if you get closer to them each roll.  This is the equivalent to blue shift in light. Do the same but running away and you get a red shift effect.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I always get confused by the speed of light. If two spaceships were travelling away from eachother, wouldn't the spaceship measuring the photons measure their speed as much slower since that ship is travelling almost as fast as the photons are in the same direction? Or do you mean that the ship would measure the photons travelling at C when you took into account the speed of the ship?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup, its the same principle as the Doppler Effect that makes sirens high pitched when they're approaching and low pitch as they move away, only with photons instead of sound waves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>try checking out this game developed by MIT. It's called A Slower Speed of Light, and slowly lowers the transmission of information to walking speed across the game world as you pick up orbs. It will actually color-band the game world based on the speed the light is hitting you, so if you're moving forward light is blueshifted, if you're moving backwards it's redshifted. If you get a running start and collect a bunch of orbs you'll actually exceed the speed of light and a large black shadow starts following you (you can see this at 1:56 <a href="https://youtu.be/uu7jA8EHi_0?t=114" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The shadows aren't due to exceeding the speed of light.</p>
<p>In fact, they aren't shadows at all. Light is shifted so far in either direction that it is no longer within the visible range. This makes the appearance of a black void without any light, but that would be absolutely false.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Put a source of gamma emission above a detector, and measure the wavelength precisely. Then put the detector above the source and measure again. Photons going upwards, climbing out of Earth's gravitational well, vs. photons going downwards into the well.</p></div>		</li>
