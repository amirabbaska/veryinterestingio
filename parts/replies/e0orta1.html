			<div class="markdown"><p>That was an excellent analogy that I could actually understand perfectly, thanks. </p>
<p>Also, that explains why your skin is more likely to burn/get damaged in the sun when you’re using a chemical exfoliant found in many skincare items, like salicylic acid, because they cause your cells to reproduce faster. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Salicylic acid is a BHA, only AHA exfoliants have been shown to increase photosensitivity as far as I know. But if you overuse any exfoliant it will definitely cause irritation</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re right about that! I always get them confused. Other popular skincare ingredients that <em>do</em> cause photosensitivity are glycolic acid, lactic acid, and I believe benzoyl peroxide. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So genetic damage occurs every time our cells reproduce. Inside the cells in a compartment called the nucleus is our DNA. for those who may not know DNA is a long strand that contains your genetic information. Each cell has a copy that it uses to produce proteins, which help determine their function.   </p>
<p>When your cell reproduces, it needs to copy this information and reproduce an exact copy. But when you copy error are inevitable. especially on the ends. because of this the ends slowly degrade and break down with more and more errors. Since cells are reproducing from conception our body needs a way to prevent this from affecting us. This method is using what are called telomeres to the ends of our DNA. Telomeres are junk sequences that dont get used for any information, like the edge pieces on a puzzle. Every replication that get damaged and lost by just a bit, but the information containing DNA remains safe. This is a big part of cancer risk with age. Your telomeres have gotten so short in some cells that the errors and losses begin to occur in your actually important DNA more frequently. This is why rapidly reproducing cells take more damage, as their telomeres wear out and degrade faster.</p>
<p>On the topic of the original question above though this reproduction and telomere issue isnt why sun does more damage, Its why skin cancers are common, and these production cells do undergo damage form the sun but the two arent really connected. The real issue is what the UV rays do. As you may know light is radiation. All forms radiation are complex waves that carry energy. light is just the visible frequencies. What radiation does to our cells is transfer this energy to them. energy effects chemical reactions, breaking bonds of some molecules and causing them to form with others. DNA is just a bunch of chemical compounds bonded together in a very specific way the energy. Thus what UV light does is cause the breaking and reforming of bonds in out DNA. as DNA needs to be very specific in constriction this degrades the intended structure. Its like if we are a rug and our DNA is the dye, having the sun on it causes the dye to break down. The change from intended structure to unintended is damage, and if this new structure is still able to make a protein, but not the one it was originally supposed to its a mutation. This is the long term damage done by the sun.</p>
