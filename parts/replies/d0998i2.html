			<p>Here I'll Explain Like Everyone is 5: Hacker Hats<br><br>Black Hat hackers <strong>use or sell</strong> the problems they find with people's computers. Whether it be a new way in to that computer, or a way to break the rules of some software (for instance, a website or a shopping cart running on that comptuer).<br><br>White Hat hackers <strong>hunt for and report</strong> these same types of problems, with the owner of the computer or network's <strong>permission</strong>, in an attempt to locate or discover new problems. They will usually never publish information on a problem they've discovered until it has been fixed (if at all).<br><br>Grey Hat hackers generally neither use nor report the problems they find. They do not usually have permission from the computer or network's owner. Being Grey is more about exploration and knowledge than about money or reputation.<br><br>The person I'm responding to was effectively Black Hat, although calling it hacking might be controversial because they never really interacted with code, inputs or gained any system privileges from the exploit.<br><br>Regardless of the terminology, what this person did was <strong>illegal</strong> and, depending on your personal ethics, wrong. Just remember, in most cases a business would happily compensate you for finding this kind of exploit without taking advantage of it or publicizing its existence.</p>		</li>

			<p>Back in my youth, myself and some 'associates' used to exploit systems (without permission) and then patch/upgrade the vulnerability if possible, leaving a note for the system admins to inform them of what the vulnerability was and what we did to fix it. We never deleted or stole anything or did anything malicious (apart from the unauthorised access) - So... what colour hat is that? :)</p>		</li>

<li>No permission from the owner (+1 Black Hat pts)<br><br>- Used exploits after identifying them (+1 Black Hat pts)<br><br>- Modified system environment (+2 Black Hat pts)<br><br>- Modifications were benevolent (+1 White Hat pts)<br><br>- Left a kind note informing the admin you had exploited a security flaw, entered the system without permission, modified system, and patched bug (+0 pts)<br><br>I have your total at 4 Black Hat, 1 White Hat. So you've got a dirty, soiled grey hat.<br><br>If you were to do it again, it's definitely better to notify them and let them make the change than to make changes yourself.<br><br>_<strong>__</strong><br><br>Let me give you a more solid example of straight grey.<br><br>You're driving around with a laptop and a wireless antenna. You pick up and save WiFi network BSSID, SSID and basic stats about authentication type to the disk. Maybe you deauth a few users from their WPA2 systems and collect handshakes.<br><br>You take all this home, create or download some rainbow tables, and over the course of a few mins/hours/days crack the WPA2 password at home.<br><br>If you stop there, you're still pretty grey. You haven't done anything to anybody, you've just learned the process and successfully executed it.<br><br>If you take those passwords back out, find the corresponding wifi signals again, and enter the network. Black. Hat. You've done a naughty.</li>

			<p>In regards to your solid example: Is that not similar to  the preposterous legal situation in many places, wherein you are legally allowed to own marijuana seeds but as soon as you sow &amp; grow those seeds you are then breaking the law and therefore a criminal.<br><br>Surely if you were to spend the time to crack a WPA2 password, you would then want to access the network using that cracked password in order to prove that it was successful? </p>		</li>

			<p>You don't need to access the network to prove it was successful.<br><br>By deriving the password, you have mathematically proved it to be successful. There is literally no way to complete the hash deciphering and end up with an incorrect passcode. Either you get a match or you don't.<br><br>Again, you've not committed any crimes nor violated anyone's privacy. You have a legal right to listen to those radio frequencies, and you have every legal right to do as much mathematics as you please. It's a great proof of concept, and can be very interesting to try out on your own network even.<br><br>Again, there are some much better examples of sketchy behavior you could pick. For instance, chipping the ceramic tip of a car's sparkplug into little sharp pebbles is not a crime in and of itself. However if you're picked up by police (who must have a reason to search you to begin with) and found with those little ceramic shards, many jurisdictions would find you in possession of burglary equipment (ninja rocks can easily break car windows at relatively low speed, hand thrown).<br><br>Luckily you can't infer criminal intent quite so easily with public wifi data collection</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Surely if you were to spend the time to crack a WPA2 password, you would then want to access the network using that cracked password in order to prove that it was successful?<br><br>Not necessarily, what if you want to know the statistics of how many people used weak or non-complex passwords?<br><br>What if, for your own research and discovery, you're trying to find a new way to crack WPA2 passwords without a rainbow table, and you need information regarding a large variety of networks?<br><br>In this specific example, a rainbow table will only give you a correct match when the full hash fits an existing decrypted password, making it a fairly reasonable assumption that it's actually the correct password.</p>		</li>

			<p>To add a little more context to what went down, when I initially discovered this exploit, I placed an order valued around $300 and discounted it to $10. I called up customer support and explained the exploit. They canceled the order, and said they would pass this information along.<br><br>6 months later, I noticed the same exploit still existed. So I had the mentality of &quot;well, I warned them&quot; and started buying stuff for cheap.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, plenty of script kiddies and pay-to-play idiots. I wouldn't call half of that hacking, but to a consumer or their target it might as well be.<br><br>silver lining, bullshit like that makes the InfoSec field a hundred times more valuable. Plenty of busywork to be done in keeping low-skill &quot;hackers&quot; out of your systems with basic maintenance and easy to implement precautions.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Try setting your iPhone's year to 1970<br><br>I have once used a similar exploit, to buy a macbook pro 15 inch. There was a shop with a 10% discount code. They wrote in the email they sent me with the discount code that the discount code couldn't be used on gift cards, but in reality they could. So what I did was:  <br>1. Buy a 200 dollar gift card for 180 dollar (because of the 10% discount)  <br>2. Buy another 200 card for 180 dollar using the first gift card.   <br>3. Repeat  <br>FYI: I first tried this trick with an 10 dollar gift card, before I stepped up to a 200 dollar gift card.  I wouldn't call it hacking though, it's just an exploit. </p>		</li>

			<p>I feel if that business had proper internal controls (outside of the website), goods shipping below approved margins should have been flagged anyway. <br><br>Sounds like they were weak on all counts. </p>		</li>
