			<div class="markdown"><p>I can't specifically comment on how it speeds up or slows the healing process, but it does physically age your cells due to the oxidative stress they undergo when something bad happens to the body. I remember reading about an experimental IV synthetic anti-oxidant they were trying out on ICU patients which would help buffer the stress, dunno where the therapy is in the pipeline nowadays. </p></div>		</li>
