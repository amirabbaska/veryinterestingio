			<div class="markdown"><p>yeah, that's also why they tend to hate Vacuum cleaners; </p>
<p>they generate a lot of ultra sonic overtones (frequencies higher than what we can hear [human= ~Max 22kHz]), at intensities much louder than normal ambient sounds.  </p>
<p>Imagine someone just flipping the switch on a jet engine in the same room.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Damage has a lot more to do with the amplitude than the frequency. Just like in human hearing, some frequencies can be perceived as more &quot;annoying&quot; than others, so if your dog or cat responds to a sound negatively, it could be from a dislike of the frequency and not necessarily that they're experiencing damage. </p>
<p>The NIH has some good info on human noise induced hearing loss. I'm under the impression that most land mammals are governed by the same rules.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would assume its because they are a lot quieter and a lot less powerful than a standard plugin vacuum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should not be very harmful to your hearing. I have only second hand knowledge of the biochemical papers describing this damage but it should happen through two processes. The first is direct mechanical damage to the hair cells in the ear. This would require very high energy sound, but could occur from any frequency, I doubt the energy from your fingers is high enough. The second process is inducing the the hair cells to die by over-stimulation and oxidative damage. This should only occur with sound that can activate the nervous signal from these hear cells. So you should be safe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, the hairs in your ears actually sense sound as the fourier transform of the sound--i.e., you sense things in the frequency domain which is then converted into sound in your brain.</p>
<p>This is opposed to a &quot;sound wave&quot; which is the sum of the intensities in the time domain. </p>
<p>Anyway, those cells can't be damaged unless their resonant frequency is sensed, essentially.</p>
<p>(not quite true for high enough energies where your ear drums get dammaged, but that won't be the only thing being disrupted)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally no. Your ears are tuned to resonate at certain frequencies and do not respond at all to frequencies outside that range. Things might change at extremely high intensities, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Frequency does not damage hearing. Amplitude does. And by amplitude I mean how loud it is. </p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether the sound is low dubstep or high frequency screeching, if it's loud, it's going go damage your ears. </p>
<p>This is true for all classical waves. I mean, when you're at the beach, you're going to be afraid or the large waves. It doesn't matter how frequently those waves come. </p>
<p>No source. </p></div>		</li>
