			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe this actually IS the primary explanation. They found evidence that people were producing melanin, but it was getting bleached. </p>
<p>That being said, I don't think it's settled</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There doesn't really seem to be a lot of scientific evidence linking stress and a loss of hair pigment. There have been verified cases of extreme stress affecting the hormones responsible for hair production, and leading to bald patches, etc, but in general, hair colour is predetermined.  </p>
<p>There is a lot of anecdotal cases of hair going grey at an early age because of stress, but if you think about it, most human adults are constantly under stress. When people go grey early, it is almost always easy to find some sort of new source of stress that can be used to explain it, instead of understanding the biological reason behind it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I read a long time ago that when your hair grows gray is genetic. You'll get gray hair around the same age your parents did,  has nothing to do with stress, for the most part. </p>
<p>Conveniently I just found this article: <a href="http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/what-causes-gray-hair-influence-genetics-and-other-factors-hair-color-324622" target="_blank">http://www.medicaldaily.com/pulse/what-causes-gray-hair-influence-genetics-and-other-factors-hair-color-324622</a></p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body stops producing melanin in the hair follicles IIRC, it's not strictly an old age thing, can happen whenever. Some people are more genetically predisposed to get gray hairs at a younger age. Some people are born with patches of no melanin in their hair as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok I'm a hairstylist and I have a question regarding people who are born with patches of hair that don't have melanin. I have a client and she has a patch like that and it will not color. It is a birth mark and I thought it would be similar to grey hair since grey hair lacks melanin so I used a grey coverage color on that spot to try and it faded out in days. It doesn't react the same and she isn't the only client I have had this issue with. What makes these melanin lacking hairs different from hair that turns gray in older clients?  Is t lacking a medulla or cortex?  </p></div>		</li>
