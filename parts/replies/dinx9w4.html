<p>Asian were doing opium, Mexicans marijuana, and blacks coke. </p>
<p>In order to keep minorities down and not be a competitive threat racist white lawmakers targeted minorities drug of choice for recreational purposes making it criminal. </p>
<p>This why alcohol is legal since it has been a part of white culture for so long. </p>
<p>White House wives would go to the pharmacy and get heroin cough syrup and get high of that. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason they had to craft whole new sections of legislation is because marijuana is considered a schedule 1 drug, right next to heroin and  they didn't just want to say &quot;marijuana is legal,&quot; they wanted to make money off of it. They made it so that in CA you can grow your own marijuana, but only 6 plants, and only 3 of them can be in &quot;bloom&quot; at once. You cant sell marijuana, but you can give small amounts to friends. So all marijuana you buy is taxed by the government.</p></div>		</li>
