			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t do research and i only have a master’s degree in physics, so i might be wrong. But my understanding is that all fundamental forces described in the standard model are interactions via particles. For the electromagnetic force it’s the photon (w/z bosons for weak, gluons for strong interaction). “Virtual” in this context means that the particle itself may violate the momentum- and energy conservation principle. I am not sure anymore how this exactly works but i think the idea is that the bosons (“carriers of the forces” - photon is also a boson) are spontaneously created and annihilated and can’t be detected in experiments, thus they are virtual. </p>
<p>Anyone who knows better please correct me if i’m wrong, genuinely curious. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am not quite sure of bertrussell logic, but I think he/she/they are talking about the way the feyman's diagrams add up in each situation.
Don't remember in my uni years solving a problem where I saw differences in correlation functions from comparing the action (S) of the system with and without spatial translation, but i guess it is not technically impossible. </p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Analogy time (and a very close one mathematically); think about a child’s swing.  If you give it a shove and let it go, it will swing back and forth with a time period that is always the same, no matter how hard was the initial shove you gave it.  This is the natural motion of the swing.  Now compare that regular, smooth,  constant back-and-forth motion to what would happen if you started giving the swing a shove many times during each of its back and forth swings.  Well, the swing would start jiggling around all over the place, in a very unnatural motion, and it would not swing smoothly at all.  The poor child on the swing would be furious at you, as you’d be making his or her ride very uncomfortable.  This unpleasant jiggling motion — this disturbance of the swing — is different from the swing’s natural and preferred back-and-forth regular motion just as a “virtual particle” disturbance is different from a real particle.  If something makes a real particle, that particle can go off on its own across space.  If something makes a disturbance, that disturbance will die away, or break apart, once its cause is gone.  So it’s not like a particle at all, and I wish we didn’t call it that.</p>

<p>Without anything to interact with, there would be no way to even know if such a field existed.</p>

<p>Is this true? The electric field is usually represented by a point test charge, to answer the question of what force would be applied to a unit charge at that point. Am I wrong? Or are you only referring to the case whereby the charge is moving?</p></div>		</li>
