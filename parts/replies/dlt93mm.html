			<div class="markdown"><p>The 8 glasses of water a day thing is a myth. The sentence following the one that prescribed that amount was &quot;Most of this is contained in prepared foods&quot;. Meaning you are already getting some water (or even most of the water you need) in the foods you eat and other beverages you drink. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I've heard, and read, it's that you should be drinking enough water that your urine is clear in colour, or at the most slightly yellow. Dark yellow means you're definitely not getting enough water. Of course much much you need to drink depends on your day. Also if you're thristy then you're already dehydrated, so it's best to keep a water bottle with you, and take a sip or a glass of water from time to time, rather than waiting to be thirsty. </p></div>		</li>

<p>One of those things to remind you to drink is still useful even if you're over drinking. As long as it's not causing you pain there's absolutely no harm in drinking a little bit too much water. Most people don't drink enough.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are drinking 8-10 full glasses of water a day, plus drinking other beverages and eating normal foods, you could probably cut out half of your pure water intake easily. Basically if you feel you &quot;thirsty&quot; you are 1-2% dehydrated. So it's not really a good ballpark, instead doctors recommend listening to your body and drinking when you are thirsty. Obviously if you are doing hard work or playing sports outside you will need to be more aware of your need to replenish fluids, but in general day-to-day life you won't need anywhere near 8-10 glasses a day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no magic number. Just have to pay attention to your body. Learn the early signs of being thirsty and anticipate your needs for the day. Sitting in an office? You won't need much water. Moving around outside all day in any amount of sun or heat? You'll need more than 8-10 glasses.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Living in Denver? You'll need approximately a gajillion glasses of water. I live in Denver and no matter how much water I drink my pee never goes completely clear, . My throat also regularly feels dry, even if I've been drinking water regularly throughout the day. In Denver I basically feel like it's impossible to drink enough water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>you should definitely increase your water intake to flush out all the pee you drink.</p></div>		</li>
