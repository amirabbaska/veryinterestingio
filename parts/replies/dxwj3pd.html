			<div class="markdown"><p>I found <a href="https://www.grownyc.org/recycling/facts" target="_blank">this page</a> citing 12,000 tons of waste per day so 7,000 tons of plastic sounds believable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/oct/27/new-york-rubbish-all-that-trash-city-waste-in-numbers" target="_blank">This Guardian article</a>  says 7,000 tons of waste per day again not specifying plastic</p>
<p>Edit: More reputable source <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/docs/about_dsny-collections-FYTD.pdf" target="_blank">Direct from NYC.gov</a> 8,248 tons of waste per day of which 918 tons is &quot;metal/glass/plastic recycling&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of which... There should be lessons on how to Google better than simply old articles suggesting features like boolean that have been removed.
Something like figuring out exact what writing people would use to phrase the thing you're looking for, how to avoid spam and lateral thinking (I. E. search for phrases numbers because that's more unique?) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yea, I'm sort of amazed that after years and years of having plastics, the total amount that made it into the ocean is just one day's worth from <del>one city</del> all cities.  (Edit: see below.)</p></div>		</li>

<p>A lot more has made it into the ocean, it just hasn't met up with it's band of friends in the pacific patch yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't think that compacting it into a sphere is quite the right comparison.  I think it makes more sense to have it, say, as a collecting of 1m\^(3) blocks, arranged into roughly a square.  This would be (by your calculations) between half a km and 1.5 km per side.  That seems like it should be visible depending on the zoom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fudging the numbers a bit based on your sphere with a 40m radius, If you wanted to make an island/barge out of it that was 1m thick, it would be a approx 250,000 m^2 or 500m on a side.  </p>
<p>Not visible if you were fully zoomed out, but if you zoom in to the scale where you can see details of Hawaii, a square that is .5km on a side would be a pretty noticeable object.  Plus Google would probably build an offshore server farm on it or something...  :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Scrooge McDuck once - in an attempt to sidestep environmental pollution regulations - built his factories on icebergs.
I guess if he had had the idea now, instead of 30 years ago, he would try building on trash. You get hailed as a saint for taking care of the trash and can pollute to your hearts content.</p>
<p>Scrooge does not own Google. IIRC he owns Scroogle. Now I wonder why he never sued DuckDuckGo for using his name.</p>
<p>My point? I don't think I have one. How about: Don't look at Google for crazy futuristic ideas. Look at McDuck and Gearloose. Self driving cars, cars that grow like living beings to perfectly adapt to a job, oil eating bacteria, shrink rays... McDuck did all that decades ago. Let's also not forget that he once redirected part of the gulf stream to increase the value of his property in Greenland.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In the cartoon, they raised a sunken ship by filling it with ping pong balls.  A few decades later that idea was patented but then voided by a court because of the cartoon.</p></div>		</li>
