			<div class="markdown"><p>Even if OP agrees with you that isn't the question being asked. As it's worded, the question asks why is it Facebook specifically that you have to log into for all of these websites? Why not Reddit or MySpace. What makes Facebook the default for so many places as opposed to others. This questions addresses both the social and technological factors related to the phenomenon. If people are answering the question wrong, as you say, it's because it is worded poorly. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, this is an easy way for websites to make ad revenue from you. Facebook makes money because they can track what websites are using your log in - perhaps it turns out you log into Pokemon Go daily, and read Washington Post articles, and play Club Penguin pretty regularly. Any site that uses your Facebook log-in supplies usage data to Facebook. These facts are worth roughly $0.07 each.</p>
<p>From the other side, the website you just logged-in to can tie your use data to an email that is part of larger database sets. This website can collect their own information about you and then sell it to other advertising companies, and the information is more valuable because it is connected to the Facebook email address used in multiple locations - so a lot of data from different places can be aggregated easily. Alternatively, now that the website knows your Facebook email, they can specifically buy data about you from Facebook or Google or whomever in order to tailor your experience with their product/service.</p>
<p>You might only log in with your Facebook email, but it only takes seconds for your gender, age, and marital status to be learned and used to feed you 'relevant' ads.</p></div>		</li>
