			<div class="markdown"><p>That's directly related to the decrease in atmospheric pressure with increase in altitude. Water boils at 212°^F at sea level and for every 500ft of increase to elevation from sea level, the boiling point of water decreases by nearly 1°F. Since sterilization by exposure is what we rely on when boiling water — in this case, high temperature over time rather than freezing — we have to increase time as the maximum temperature decreases.</p>
<p>Since liquid water never exceeds the boiling point temperature at a given elevation (atmospheric pressure), increasing time is the only way to balance the equation — other methods of sterilization notwithstanding. Of course this doesn't work all the way out as, at some point, the water won't be able to reach the appropriate tempurature to kill the unwanted pathogens over any reasonable amount of time. I mean, you could seal a container to enable a positive feedback cycle to reach higher tempuratures when at higher altitudes, but without a gauge and decent bleed valve mechanism you're more likely to create a small radius IED.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things. One is some bacteria form a biofilm on a surface, especially plastic and other uneven (on a microscopic scale) surfaces.  These can resist oxidation and temperature to some extent.  Time at temp helps there.  Second, your food isn’t going to get to temperature instantly, especially internally, so you need time at temp there as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, it's important to note that temperature and time are both needed: 45°C will kill things but very very slowly. 200°C will only take moments to kill most everything. So boiling water at lower temperatures will probably kill bacteria, but will take longer to do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ah yes. I remember this slide being passed too quickly for me to take notes on. Something about some foods being heated a low temp for a long time vs. other foods being superheated for a very short time (a few seconds). Ultra pasteurized or something?</p></div>		</li>
