			<div class="markdown"><p>Just the one l. </p>
<p>The exact nomenclature varies by country (America's top rank is General of the Army, Germany used Generalfeldmarshall in WWII) and some countries implement an even higher rank called the Generalissimo. A few examples of that would be France's Foch in WWI (Weygand and Gamelin in WWII), Spain's Franco after the Spanish Civil War, Suvorov of the Russian Empire, and America's Pershing in WWI. There were a few ceremonial ones (Kim Jong-Il and George Washington [As General of the Arm<strong>ies</strong>] were promoted posthumously, Stalin declined the title). So, in the most basic terms, the Generalissimo outranks and thus &quot;controls&quot; the Field Marshal.</p>
<p>But since the Generalissimo rarely existed (even those countries that used the title only used it sparingly, for what are probably obvious reasons), the Field Marshals (whatever name they go by) would answer to a General Staff of some sort. These are the Combatant Commands of America (with names like USCENTCOM) and, prior to it being disbanded and the German General Staff (since disbanded), just to give you an idea of how diverse naming conventions were. The German General Staff itself morphed into the Oberkommando des Heeres (Supreme Command of the Army) and Oberkommando des Wehrmacht (Supreme Command of the Armed Forces), which was superior to the OKH, during the course of WWII. </p>
<p>In all cases, though, the Field Marshal is invariably subordinate to either a civilian (the US Secretary of Defense) or a collection of high-ranking officers that specialize in <em>managing</em> a war rather than fighting it (the German General Staff). And then whatever body he is subordinated to is, in turn, subordinated to the head of state (the POTUS and the Kaiser, respectively). </p>
<p>So, to recap, the Field Marshal is subordinate to the Generalissimo or some kind of General Staff. If he were part of a US-based system, he'd be a Combatant Commander (COCOM), but that's only a 4-star rank. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also worth noting - the US typically does not have a General of the Army. It's a rank that's only been used in wartime, and even then, we've often fought wars without one. The last man to hold the title was Omar Bradley, who gave it up in 1950. It hasn't been awarded since.</p>
<p>I think the structure is still in place to name one if a president wanted to. I'm not sure. But it's not something that's been done in nearly 70 years. </p>
<p>Under the current structure, the US divides the world into regions and appoints an officer to oversee efforts in an entire region of the world. Those officers are called &quot;combatant commanders,&quot; and will typically have overall responsibility for an entire continent, or a large portion of one. </p>
<p>Interestingly, they answer directly to the president. So while each armed service has a chief who is its highest ranking officer, and together those Chiefs make up the Joint Chiefs of Staff, they're actually <em>not</em> in the chain of command. The Chief of the Army is the president's chief adviser on the army and helps plan for its future needs, but if the president wants to give an order to the army to, say, intervene in Somalia, he doesn't relay that order to the chief of the army or even the chairperson of the joint chiefs of staff. He goes around them to the head of the combat command for Africa. </p>
<p>Sure, he'll almost certainly talk it over with the Joint Chiefs first. But they're outside the chain of command. It's a historically strange configuration but it's been in use since, I think, the mid-80s. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Would you or someone else mind elaborating on that for me? Is it just too much power/too much to handle for one individual or is it something else? I believe I've only heard of the word Generalissimo in the context of video games and ignorantly assumed it was simply Italian for &quot;General&quot; so I'd like to learn more.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A Field Marshall is the highest possible rank in the army, and many armies don't even have them. A Field Marshall is the commander of multiple separate full armies. You'd usually only have one Field Marshall but when you have a situation like WW2 where you have millions of men in uniform you might get 2 or 3.</p>
<p>The Field Marshall will be controlled by the Commander of the Armed Forces who is usually a politician. In the USA it's the President, in the UK it's the Queen but her authority is delegated to the Prime Minister.</p></div>		</li>

<p>So while the Queen is supposedly a figurehead without any actual power, she is much more plugged in to events and probably can exert influence in many ways. Also, our soldiers takes oaths to the Queen, not to the prime minister and if you have big enough balls she is the one who gives you a medal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In the US, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of each Branch, the Joint Chiefs, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Combatant_Command" target="_blank">Unified Combat Commands</a> serve this role, coordinating all the distinct branches of the Military.  They advise and report directly to the President and the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p>The Joint Chiefs are senior officials from the different branches who serve as advisors for the President, DOD, and Homeland Security.  The Unified Combat Commands are headed by Generals and are divided out by geography (Africa, Middle East, Asia, etc) and by function (Special Operations, Strategic, and Transport)</p>
<p>Edit: overlooked the Branch Secretaries. Secretaries from each branch of the Armed Forces are nominated by the President and confirmed by Congress to manage the operations of their branch and report directly to the Secretary of Defense, and by law must be civilians (in the vast majority of cases having served with merit in the armed forces beforehand).  The Joint Chiefs are the most senior active-duty officers in their respective branches, and serve as deputies to their respective branch secretaries and advisors to the top levels of command.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In warfighting, though, the CoC goes:  </p>
<p>CiC<br />
SecDef<br />
Unified Combat Commander<br />
Individual service units/Joint Task Forces<br />
Individual units under the JTFs</p>
<p>The Branch secretaries are Administrative.<br />
The Service Commanders, i.e. Chief of Naval Operations, are also Admin and not in the Tactical/Strategic CoC.  </p>
<p>The Joint Chiefs are an advisory council, and they advise and meet with the President and SecDef, but they are also <em>not</em> in the Chain of Command.  </p>
<p>When there is an issue of personnel, say women in combat, the Pres will meet with SecDef and the Service Secretaries, and the Service Commanders, to define policy and issue orders.  </p>
<p>When there is a war operation, the Prez will meet with SecDef and the JCS, then issue orders to SecDef.  </p>
<p>SecDef then issues orders to the Unified Combat Commanders.  </p>
<p>From there the orders make their way down a traditional Chain of Command.  But, you could have an Air Force squadron under a Marine command in some cases.  And the JTFs have a mixed Command/Staff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reply only talked about comissioned officers, the regular people you think of soldiers are often regular enlisted, known as &quot;non-coms&quot; which, in the case of NCO, stands for Non-Commissioned Officer, which are the higher ranks of enlisted.</p>
<p>One of the smaller groups that is actually in the field, you'll eventually run into a situation where it is a single officer(not always an LT(lieutenant), they're usually pretty fresh and don't get put in charge of much), a few NCO's, and a few ranks of enlisted under them.  </p>
<p>Ideally, if it is a lieutennant, he's paired with a grizzled old NCO who has been deployed a lot and knows just as much if not more, from actual experience, where primarily, the LT mostly has an education.  There is usually one higher tiered NCO per officer who kind of acts as a liason to the less experienced enlisted men.</p>
<p>The officer says &quot;Get Job X done&quot; and the NCO will break id down to individual squads Assigning a few enlisted to each smaller NCO(or two, all depending on the make-up of enlisted).</p>
<p>The idea is so that there is little to no micro-management.  An officer giving a lot of direct orders to all of the varied levels of NCO and lesser enlisted isn't doing his job correctly as that is a lot of shit to do.  Things get delegated on down the line simplifying each job an individual has on down the line.</p>
<p>Kind of like in a business, say, a store.  You have stockboys and janitors at the bottom, then sales people, then supervisors, shift managers, store managers, then regional managers, and then you start getting into corporate who make the bigger decisions.  The CEO isn't directly hiring stockboys, ideally he'll never even know their names unless something goes wrong, generally speaking, though there are exceptions(say dolling out awards, or someone touring facilities).</p>
<p>Being hired off the street(enlisted) will usually only climb so far.  Someone with a big education will usually start a good deal higher up the chain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit: not across the board, I was thinking of the people I met which were in leadership roles so not all E4s are NCOs. Only Marines, maybe Army and some Navy. Not airforce until E5.</p>
<p>Non-commissioned officer. They are enlisted. Think of your average 18 year old going to bootcamp. When they graduate they become Enlisted 1 or E1. Then they get promoted to E4. Across the board in all US militaries, E4 and above is an NCO. E6 to E9 are considered Staff NCOs. Those are venerable positions in the military but on average it's still your same E1 that graduated highschool long ago and stayed in the military. Some may have degrees but it's not required.</p>
<p>Then you have your Commissioned Officers which are the officers. They have a university degree first and foremost and then go a different kind of bootcamp. More rigerous, more demanding, more classes.</p>
<p>To understand it, think of a hospital. Think of the nurse who has been there 10 years. She knows her job well, can tell what a doctor will prescribe for common symptoms, and lead a whole group of other nurses. The young officer/doctor will be a little lost at first and take their cue from the nurses who have done their rounds, look toward others for guidance but eventually all those years of training and education will kick in and then they'll be in charge and responsible for all deaths under their command.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Non-Commissioned Officer. People who didn't go through a commissioning source (that usually means having a college degree although many NCOs have them). </p>
<p>Those people in your high school who joined the Army right away? Typically they're enlisted, and as they come up through the ranks they become Non-Commissioned Officers. As /u/IlluminatusUIUC stated, an Officer issues orders, an NCO makes them happen </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just make it happen- they are key to planning on the ground - In fact, most troop NCOs have de facto command on the ground. </p>
<p>Until you get to above Lieutenant-Colonel your rank as an officer is paired with an NCO to 'advise'. It is a rare day when a troop commander goes against his troop sergeant. </p>
<p>Troop commanders are quite young, whereas the troop NCO will be mid 30s, and a veteran of several tours of duty. They arent just the loud disciplinarian you see in movies - they are experienced soldiers who have real input into the planning of assaults and success of missions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The only thing I might add... The logistics chain is essential to modern combat and in itself a massive organization.  The generals sound like they have it easy in this story but in reality they are also coordinating getting equipment, consumables, and men into the field.  In your modern video games your units don't (generally) need supplies or equipment or munitions or fuel and often modern combat is actually determined not by military might but by logistical might.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd love a game that incorporated supplies and troop deployment. For pre WW1 combat the logistics are crazy. Moving men in columns allowed for rapid movement to an area but they were highly vulnerable traveling like this.</p>
<p>Supply lines being severed were as big a threat as actual combat. Raiding areas for supplies and equipment were a big part of cavalry duties. Some cavalry units were late to Gettysburg because they were capturing shoes.</p>
<p>So much of modern games is amassing your troops and deathballing your enemy. A smaller force rarely has a chance of defeating the big guy in these games. When historically small hit and run skirmishes against the main body in travel or its supply line could be devastating.</p>
<p>I know of a few games that capture this kind of spirit but would love to know of more games that actually do this.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing you're asking about computer games, but there is an excellent series of hex-and-counter wargames that make logistics a central part of the game called the Operational Combat Series (OCS): <a href="http://www.multimanpublishing.com/Products/tabid/58/CategoryID/7/Default.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.multimanpublishing.com/Products/tabid/58/CategoryID/7/Default.aspx</a></p>
<p>The games range from small affairs like the game Reluctant Enemies (British/Free French vs. Vichy French in the Levant) to huge games that cover the entire eastern front (Case Blue, 1941-1943 invasion of Russia).</p>
<p>In each the building, maintaining and defending supply trains is incredibly important if you don't want to suffer quick and embarrassing defeat. You get re-supply (never enough) throughout the game and you have to choose how to deploy it. You can even capture and use enemy materiel.</p>
<p>Anyway, they are an alternative that might scratch your logistics itch.</p></div>		</li>
