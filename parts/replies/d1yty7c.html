			<div class="markdown"><p>I once used POV-Ray to simulate the Ringworld based on its quoted dimensions. Looking along the circumference it did indeed look flat and the horizon got lost in the atmosphere. Then looking up above the mist of the distance it re-appeared with the width looking very small. This was because with a radius of 1 AU it takes a large distance for it to &quot;lift&quot; up above the horizon.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ringworld is flat on the width of the ribbon. The &quot;water recycling mountains&quot; on the lip of the ring are usually far enough away to be invisible. That would be a true flat plane view.</p></div>		</li>
