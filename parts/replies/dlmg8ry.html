			<div class="markdown"><p>If you ever have the time, the following YouTube series is highly recommended if you are interested in learning more. Basically the guy shows how to build a fully working programmable computer using simple logic gates in addition to how these basic components are made up of transistors or other logic gates. It does take several hours, but it is worth the time IMO, the guy is really good at explaining it.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is my all time favourite channel. Coming from software world it's just mind-blowing to see and understand what actually goes on in the electronics level of CPU.</p>
<p>These videos also made me order a shit-ton of components and start tinkering with electronics by myself and what a great hobby it is.
Infinite amount of thumbs up to Ben Eater!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had a logic course, you're probably aware that NAND (or NOR) is sufficient to build every type of Boolean logic. Transistors can be used to build either (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOR_gate" target="_blank">NOR</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate" target="_blank">NAND</a> based constructions are used) in really compact, cheap ways – <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photolithography" target="_blank">photolithography</a> allows us to etch billion-transistor CPUs on a silicon chip the size of a fingernail. </p>
<p>There's other ways to build computers – vacuum tubes have been used before –, but transistors are cheapest, most compact <em>and</em> fastest way we have.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This deserves to be higher up.  The first transistor itself was just a slight miniaturization of the vacuum tube which itself was a slight reliability enhancement from the mechanical relay.  Trying to use a standalone MOSFET transistor like the original ELI5 post described would still result in something filling a whole house and still being far less capable of doing what any smartphone can do.  Photolithography and CMOS (basically, inventions to make transistors into <em>Integrated Circuits</em>) are equally to thank for our modern information age.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Using transistors for digital logic is extremely important for modern computers, but it's only half the story. Transistors are also often used in analog as well; think: amplifier. </p>
<p>The best way to describe the use of a transistor as an amplifier is with the water faucet analogy. The main power path of the transistor (what /u/silentraven127 described as power and ground) in this analogy can be thought of as the water storage (before the where the water is stopped from coming out) and where the water comes out (at the nozzle). Now, by just using a little bit of energy in twisting the lever, you can control a much larger amount of energy. The more energy you input to the lever, the more energy (in the form of water output) you get. The same goes for a transistor, the amount of electrical voltage you put into it is amplified at the output. </p>
<p>Now there's a million different utilizations for an analog transistor in a modern computers , in addition to an audio amplifier. But I'll give the most common that I use on a regular basis, and that is for error control. Using the above analogy, you can take a very small error in an electrical signal and amplify it, so it makes it easier for whatever control circuitry you have to adjust the output to correct the error.  This is the start to how feedback control works. </p>
<p>The water faucet analog also helps explain the digital switch operation of a MOSFET transistor. But, in that case, you either turn the faucet on all the way or you turn it completely off. Same goes for a transistor; you either allow all electrical current available to go through, or not at all. </p>
<p>Hope this helps. Source: graduate degree in electrical engineering, and I still do and love it every day. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Huh. I understood the relevance of transistors to digital logic circuits, but never really understood why handheld or portable radios were often referred to as &quot;transistor radios&quot; when I was growing up.</p>
<p>Now I know.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Electronics systems tech, roboticist, and biomedical engineer here. Hijacking this awesome comment for a brief metaphor that should be even shorter and easier to understand for most without going into detail on things like the depletion region, etc. A transistor works like a stop light. The stoplight is posted on a one way street so traffic can only flow forward and not back. It turns green and allows the flow of traffic from one side to another. When it turns red traffic stops. In a transistor theres usually 3 pins. The first two pins are the emitter and collector. They act like the one way street flowing from emitter to collector. When there's voltage on a specific pin called the base it acts as the stop light turning green and allows electricity to flow like the traffic from the the emitter pin to the collector pin. When there's no voltage on the base pin the light turns red and no traffic/electricity flows.</p>
<p>It basically just makes it super easy to make switches. On or off. Which allows binary and therefore programing. It's the building block of serial and parallel data and by association programing. Every computer for the most part runs on binary data of some sort even if it's translated into hexadecimal right away.</p>
<p>My metaphor though only covers one very basic and very common type of transistor. There are more that do different things and different configurations that allow thing alike amplification. The basis of most audio amplification is done by transistor if it's done digitally. But that is the complicated bits that lose people.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Mix and match these combos of transistors and you can build &quot;logic gates&quot;.  AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.  These transistor networks give a single output based on the combinations of 2+ input.</p>
