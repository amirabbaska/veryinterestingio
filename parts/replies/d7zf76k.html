			<div class="markdown"><p>This is the correct answer. The cell resistance increases while it is in use (this happens during both charge and discharge), and the term for this is called polarization. Polarization can happen for several reasons that depend on the battery chemistry and battery cell design. In some cells, the polarization happens within the electrode particles - for instance, there could be slow motion of Li within active materials. This happens in Li ion batteries during charging - the graphite electrode can only accept the ions at a certain rate, then it needs to slow down or rest. Think of it like having a rush of people into the door of a building, then waiting a moment for them to diffuse within the building before letting more people in. </p>
<p>Another type of polarization is due to concentration buildup. This is an issue in virtually all batteries. During operation the concentrations of salt change at the electrodes because only one of the ions is exchanged, but both ions traveled together to the electrode before the exchange takes place. This concentration gradient buildup causes an electric field to form that opposes operation of the cell. After resting, this gradient relaxed and that opposition goes away, allowing charge to be drawn from the battery again.</p>
<p>There are other effects, but these capture the predominant issues folks would see in most modern devices.</p>
<p>The response above about reactants being &quot;used up&quot; is not correct for lithium ion batteries.. In lead acid batteries this analogy is ok because both ions of the H2SO4 react on different electrodes.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The weird shape at low temperature probably comes from self-heating of the cells. The cells will be very resistive while cold, and polarize rapidly at the beginning. That will generate a lot of heat,  which reduces the impedance and allows the voltage to recover.  With time, heat continues to generate and the rest of the discharge starts to look normal. If the temperature gets too cold, the cell will lose heat too fast and the voltage will drop too low and turn the cell off before this happens.</p></div>		</li>
