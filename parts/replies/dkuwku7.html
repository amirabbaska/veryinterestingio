			<div class="markdown"><p>I was a BBS user back when zip was invented. The most popular format before than was ARC. There was an official converter. Then And Katz had a program called pkarc to create .ARC files and one called pkxarc to extract them. The company that created ARC didn't like that and sued Katz.</p>
<p>Katz eventually created the zip format because of that. Because of the law suit, people started hating the .ARC format. Within a few months, everyone was distributing .ZIP files instead of .ARC files. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are meaningful differences. Zip is more commonly supported. So if you send emails with zipped attachments anyone will be able to open it whether they have winzip installed or not. Windows support zip format natively. So even your great grandpa and grandma can unzip fairly easily. Rar and 7z and zipx or ace are less common formats. 7z in general has higher compression result compare to the rest (though the best I've seem is kgb format). Rar has one unique features no other compression format has...that is it can embed recovery information and do repair to some of the corrupted rar archive. If the  compressed file is huge and will be downloaded accross Internet, one should use rar format with recovery set to at least 2% to 5%. I am a power heavy end users for more than 20 decades and work with many of this compressions format across multiple platforms and scenario uses.</p></div>		</li>
