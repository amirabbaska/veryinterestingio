			<div class="markdown"><p>La Croix is great if you like that sorta thing.  But it's one of those things you either love it or hate it.   I decided to cut soda out of my diet and I love pretty much anything carbonated.  So I tried LaCroix after seeing Rhett &amp; Link testing flavors on their YouTube Show, I didn't even the stuff existed.   So I gave it a try.  It's literally just flavored carbonated water.  It's not sweet per se but it is flavored.   Some of the flavors are really good, some are pretty bad, but it's all really bad if you drink it warm so don't do that.  But ice cold they're really refreshing.   Kinda pricey compared to kroger or walmart brand flavored sparkling waters.   The difference is that LaCroix is calorie free and has none of that artificial coloring or sweetener crap in it like Kroger or Walmarts does.   </p>
<p>My fav. flavors are Berry, Cran Raspberry, Tangerine, Grapefruit and lime.   Definitely worth a try, but like I said it's something you either love or hate.</p></div>		</li>
