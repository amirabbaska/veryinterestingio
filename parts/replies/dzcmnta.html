			<div class="markdown"><p>Language aptitude was a bigger part of life in the ancient world. We now take for granted that an entire (modern-day) nation speaks one language with a common spelling and vocabulary, but that’s a product of the printing press. The town a few miles away might have a different dialect. 30 miles away they might speak a different language. </p>
<p>Educated men in the Middle Ages had to know, at a minimum, their native tongue and Latin, but likely more. Once you’ve learned two or three languages then you know a lot about how to learn another language. </p>
<p>Memorization was also a common skill that non-literate (or at least an age without vast libraries) societies tend to master. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This brings up a good point in how learning was done in generations past.  The written word is a relatively recent phenomenon, and humans were reliant on memory and verbal knowledge acquisition (rather than reading) with stronger memorization skills borne out of necessity. </p>
<p>I realize this is completely anecdotal, but my memory is crap compared to where it was 10 years ago, not just because I'm getting older, but because I rely so much more on my technology to store my 'memories.'  As a kid, I knew 50 phone numbers of my friends, as an adult I honestly only know my wife's by heart.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We just remember different things now. You’ve memorized some websites and passwords and usernames instead of phone numbers, for example.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another thing is that early humans didn't travel very far. So most foreign languages they encountered were related. Think about how long it would take to walk from Frankfurt to Berlin. The neighboring village/encampment was a day away at most. Their language would not be mutually intelligible but it would be similar enough to be able to communicate. Now if trade was or war was frequent enough there would be several people fluent in both languages. </p></div>		</li>
