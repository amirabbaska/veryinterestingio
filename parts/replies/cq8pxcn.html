			<div class="markdown"><p>That is speculation. In nothing I've ever read on sleep did it ever have any information about what precisely we fight against to wake up in those situations. The research simply hasn't been done. Adenosine, imo, doesn't make sense as the right answer. I can only speculate as well, but it is educated speculation, and I'd say it is our conscious mind attempting to reach parts of our body currently under paralysis from sleep. If our consciousness/attention can be alerted enough, we will become awake (like if something touches us or our name is heard), so we have to alert <em>ourselves</em> while asleep and dreaming in order to wake, which isn't terribly easy. Bottom-up attention is when something has grabbed our attention, and top-down is when we have forced our attention on something. While asleep, top-down attention is greatly hindered. </p>
<p>EDIT: because it is relevant, <a href="http://www.psypost.org/2015/04/what-is-going-on-in-your-brain-when-you-sleep-33254" target="_blank">here's this article</a> on what is going on in our brains when asleep. I just saw it in /r/psychology. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like /u/tendorphin said, it's speculation.</p>
<p>All kinds of things may play a part in this, along with adenosine, such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>histamine</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>orexin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>catecholamines (dopamine, nor/epinephrine)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>serotonin</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>neuropeptides</p>
</li>
<li>other unknown mediators</li>
</ul>
<p>We know some things, but there is so much more we don't know. I do not think we have enough information to conclusively answer OP's question.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There <em>is</em> no one word answer.  Things like adenosine play different roles in different parts of the brain, so it's a whole mess of chemicals hitting thousands or millions of specific neurons that are responsible for large-scale coordinated effects like falling asleep or staying awake.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adenosine is related to why we get sleepy progressively during the day, but isn't the reason we fight to wake up. </p>
<p>Fun fact: caffeine exerts its primary effects by antagonizing adenosine receptors.  (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20164566" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20164566</a>)</p>
<p>As for fighting to stay awake, the major issue is the inhibition of the reticular activating system (RAS).  The reason why it's inhibited is a complex interaction of the endocrine system, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and the preoptic area (POA) of the hypothalamus.<br />
(<a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_activating_system" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_activating_system</a>)</p>
<p>There isn't a single clean answer to the question. There never seems to be with the brain - the best we can usually do is associate functions with a few key areas.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess the best way to directly address the original question is that it's a conscious fight to deliberately excite the RAS by focusing our attention in some fashion, while the RAS inhibition works to prevent our ability to do so.</p></div>		</li>
