			<div class="markdown"><p>They live in a hypotonic environment (More solutes concentrated in the water than relative to the shark). This is mainly due to dissolved salts in the ocean - like Na+. </p>
<p>Yes, it is &quot;consuming&quot; some water when it eats. But the shark doesn't perceive it as such, as it has been evolutionary adapted to deal with the hypertonic environment around it. </p>
<p>The water it consumes is used in the blood stream, as sharks consume dissolved oxygen from the water. On top of that, the sharks digestive tract utilizes the extra water as a means to dilute its waste products without wasting energy to water down the nitrogenous urea in its intestines. If I'm remembering correctly, sharks excrete straight ammonia, where we excrete diluted urea. We have to put forward energy in our kidneys to dilute the urea our bodies produce; otherwise, the urea would irritate our urinary tract. Sharks did not have to evolve these mechanisms of waste dilution and removal because they were never put under evolutionary pressure to develop said type of kidney. Water is everywhere relative to a shark, so their physiology has been primed to use the aqueous environment to their benefit. </p>
<p>Tldr: So they don't drink water in the conventional sense. It's all around them. Sharks have been evolutionarly prepped to use a hypertonic environment to their advantage, much like terrestrial creatures and their lust for air. They breath it, utilize it's dissolved oxygen via gills, and excrete the excess water as a method of diluting the very  nitrogenous ammonia it produces as waste.          </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several problems with this answer. First of all, urea isn't acidic, but uric acid (which birds use) is. Your body needs to excrete urea in order to remove nitrogen waste in a relatively non-toxic manner (urea is way less toxic than ammonia), and doesn't spend energy diluting urea, but rather concentrating it. The body wants to retain as much water as possible, and the kidneys act to concentrate urea, not dilute it. Urea has an extremely high affinity for water, to the point that high concentrations act to &quot;dehydrate&quot; proteins, causing their structures to collapse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sharks are usual isotonic, and often hypertonic to the ocean dude. The high concentration of urea in their tissue ( because they dont pee, they excrete it dermally) can cause salts to be absorbed. That was a really long explanation that starts totaly backwards. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In one sentence you say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They live in a <strong>hypotonic</strong> environment</p>

<p>Then in another sentence you say:</p>

<p>I understand this was probably a typo, but since those two words have opposite meanings, this might be very confusing to people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are looking at this the wrong way.  Try looking at it this way.
When you eat any kind of food don't you get large amounts of air into your body?  Your body doesn't go crazy and start over inflating your lungs or filling your stomach with large amounts of air.  It exhales it out or if it builds up in your stomach too much you tend to expel gas.  This is pretty much the same way that aquatic animals treat the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not <em>really</em> though because our digestive and respiratory systems both have intake through the same oriface. Fish have their eating hole and then fills for oxygen intake. It's a reasonable question </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because of my tongue and ability to create saliva, I swallow nearly NO air when I eat.  I do, however, swallow extra liquid of my own production.</p>
<p>Do sharks have tongues?  I still want to know if they swallow buckets of water with every bite.  Even with their biology explained, THIS question still hasn't been answered.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want to research further the process is called osmoregulation. Basically fish in seawater have the problem of too much salt and not enough freshwater. To solve this they have special cells in their gills to remove salt-called chloride cells. They also do not drink water (like freshwater fishes) and urinate very small amounts of urine, however, their urine is very saturated with salt. So they keep as much freshwater as possible but remove as much salt as possible.</p>
<p>Sharks I believe have a slightly different system-where they produce urea instead of urine and use  an organic chemical called TMC (which they produce) to detoxify the salts, therefore, they have the same salt concentration as the water outside (Although I am no expert on this). TMC also is used to stop sharks from sinking too because it is less dense than water. It is a scientific mystery as to whether sharks first produced TMC to detoxify or to provide lift.</p></div>		</li>
