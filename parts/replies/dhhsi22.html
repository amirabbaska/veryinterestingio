			<div class="markdown"><p>It keeps astonishing me that we can replace any organs at all. Humans are a complicated mess â€“ how come the functions of organs have evolved to be so well compartmentalized? Why do we have hearts solely focused on pumping food while the liver is involved in virtually everything?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The liver is basically the grand central station for everything  hydrophobic in the body.  It's the first organ after the small intestine to be exposed to the food we eat.  It samples all the nutrients and sucks up anything that is fat soluble and a lot of other compounds.  From there it sorts everything either to be secreted as VLDL or targetted for detoxification and secreted in bile.  Most of the liver function can be attributed to that process.
It's function is similar to the kidney in a lot of ways, except the kidney focuses more on hydrophilic compounds targeted to urine.  </p>
<p>There's a major epidemic of liver disease in America right now.  Over 30% of the population has fatty liver disease, which is directly related to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and liver cancer.  We don't know how or why this happens.  The best solution if for everyone to eat better, but in lieu of that we don't have effective treatments.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Similarly, ECMO is a lung replacement - though it's far from being &quot;portable&quot; in any sense.</p></div>		</li>
