			<div class="markdown"><p>I found a memoir from an English relative of mine in the 1860s. The impression that I got based on the names I encountered therein was that all the men back then were named Edward and all the women were named Mary. Must have made choosing a name for your son or daughter a rather straightforward matter.</p>
<p>Of course most of young Edward's siblings died in some gruesome manner or another before or shortly after reaching working age-- one had a horse fall on him, another toddler was crushed when the nursery maid overturned a heavy table onto him. Still another died by getting just a bit too close to the coal stove and catching fire, while a teenager died of cholera after (against all advice) staying too long by the bed of his cholera-stricken love. </p>
<p>So maybe after awhile you stop fussing so much over names. &quot;Edward, another one's popped out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Spose it'll drop dead this time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't rightly know. What shall we call it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it a boy or a girl?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Boy, it seems.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well call it Edward; I've work to do. And would you mind popping out a few more children? Edward and Eddie just got sucked into the wheat thresher this afternoon.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course, my love.&quot;</p>
<p>A simpler time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, the past was brutal.  I wrote a few papers on the civil war in undergrad, and I remember being struck by a lot of the letters I read.</p>
<p>A 17 year old woman writes to her husband, (whom she was unaware had already died in battle), explaining how one of their children had just died of a fever, and that how she was struggling to deal with the shortage of supplies and local stores price-gouging during wartime.</p>
<p>Then I thought about what I had been considering a &quot;big deal&quot; at 17, and felt pretty goddamn silly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok. I'm both amused and intrigued. Has your family done anything with the memoir? Has a historian ever looked at it?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I doubt anyone outside of my family has seen it, and even then, only a few of them know about it. Years ago my grandfather transcribed the handwritten pages and bound a text himself, which has been sitting on a shelf at my parents' house ever since. I found it when I was in college and read through it.</p>
<p>I'd like to put it online; it is indeed interesting. Although I suspect ol' Edward was getting on in age when he wrote it, as the second half starts to ramble on into a long, dry account of family &quot;begats&quot;. But the first bit is juicy and full of plenty of gory deaths and childhood tales.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In Great Britain, Queen Elizabeth II was named after her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_The_Queen_Mother" target="_blank">mother</a>. The Queen's grandmother, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_of_Teck" target="_blank">Queen (Consort) Mary</a> was named after her mother (Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge) and passed the name along to her only daughter (Princess Mary, the Princess Royal). Queen Victoria also named her eldest daughter after herself.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Interesting thing I read recently: if the UK had the same succession system then that it has now (where first born daughters can become Queen), then within three months of Victoria's death, her grandson Kaiser Wilhelm would have been King of Great Britain.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My grandparents on my mom's side were Francis and Frances(Fran and Fran. Phone calls were confusing). My Mom's middle name is Frances, mine is Francis, plus several of my cousins have one or the other as well. Of the next generation (the generation after my own) there are six kids, and 3 of them already have Franc(i/e)s as a middle name. My mom calls it &quot;the name we all hate, but keep passing on&quot;. I've grown to like it, so I'll probably be passing it along as well.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Getting post to my parents house when I lived there was confusing. If it arrived addressed to <em>Mr S Lastname</em> then that meant there were three possible recipients...</p>
<p>If it was addressed to simply <em>S Lastname</em> that total jumped up to five...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This goes for both men and women. In my family it was common for the men to have 2 names. The firstborn son would be either Jan or  Dominicus, depending on the previous generation. I'm glad my grandparents broke with that tradition, although I probably wouldn't have known better if they didn't :p. For the rest of the children, they would name them after other family members (which is still done, but mainly using middle names (? the dutch word is doopnamen, which means names given when baptised).</p></div>		</li>
