<p>This situation is a very good (even if imperfect)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In case anyone is wondering why it's imperfect, it's because the universe probably isn't a sphere. To the best of our knowledge it's flat, like a plane.</p>
<p>An ant on the sphere can walk a finite distance in one direction and get back to where he started, like going around the globe. In our universe, this probably doesn't happen. If you keep going straight the distance from your starting point will only increase - again like an infinite plane. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, it's still an incredibly useful analogy for visualizing metric expansion. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bingo. An infinite plane doesn't have an objective center. Any coordinate system is just as good as any other. Generally, the thing worth calling the center is the place where you're standing, but that doesn't make that spot any better than any other. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think of a torus as the 2D surface of a donut, sitting in ordinary 3D space, then this surface is not flat. It has positive curvature on the outside (where you start eating), negative on the inside (where the hole is). Near the hole, the surface looks like a saddle, and that's the hallmark of negative curvature in 2D surfaces.</p>
<p>But you can also make a flat torus, as in the video game Asteroids: take a flat square and &quot;glue&quot; the top to the bottom, and then &quot;glue&quot; the left to the right. Somebody who leaves the square to the right will re-enter on the left. (Don't think of this &quot;gluing&quot; operation as something you could actually do with an existing piece of paper, because you can't: it would crumple terribly.) This &quot;Asteroids&quot; torus is a flat 2D surface.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You've done a marvelous job of explaining things. But I think it would help to connect some of the dots to the OP's question.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>isn't it expanding from a center point? Or am I not even understanding what the Big Bang actual was?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The universe is not expanding away from a center point, like objects blown away from the epicenter of an explosion. But that is a common misconception. Rather as /u/crnaruka points out everything is expanding away from everything else. Even the atoms with you are trying to separate, each one away from its neighbor. But, the forces that bind you together are far far stronger.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I always thought that if something can be measured, it would have to have a center.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The universe is bigger than it is old. What I mean by that is that we know light travels at a certain speed, and we measure distances based on that speed. Well the universe is only ~13.8 billion years old, but we know for sure that it has a radius of greater than 13.8 billion light years, as we can see that far in every direction. This means that we can't see things that are further away than 13.8 billion light years. Hence the term &quot;visible universe&quot;, which is commonly used. And a fun fact is that we are always at the center of that. Each person is the center of their own visible universe. But the universe itself appears to have no center, at least to our knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But <em>if</em> one were to be able to take into account the entire universe, rather than just the observable, if everything is expanding away from everything else, assuming that one could use a point of reference outside the system, there would have to be a locus point within the center wouldn't there? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other response, you can probably consider that the universe DOES have a center point, and from our perspective, that center point is both not-measurable and functionally/mathematically unimportant.  The center point may be shifting with the expansion of the universe; we've yet to reach a technological or pan-universal point to where that information is measurable or relevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A couple comments have melted my brain, but I'll do my best to explain why there isn't a center. As I've come to understand it, the universe is a plane with each point expanding away from every other point. Since the universe is an infinite plane, there really isn't a zero. Sure, all points were stacked on top of each other at a specific point in time, but ever since the Big Bang, the plane of space time that is the universe extends to infinity in all directions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hands-down the best explanation in this entire comment thread. What people keep forgetting to mention for the layman is that:</p>
<p>A. The actual physical universe is far larger than what we can observe.</p>
<p>B. The maximum radius of any being's observational sphere, regardless of their position, is limited by redshift due to the continuing expansion of space, and that by the time you hit that radius, all photons reaching you from that region were released within the first second of the universe's existence, and so are all just immensely redshifted infrared rays (which are now cosmic microwaves). Basically, if you want to see what the singularity was back in its first second, when space was still tiny, and to see the &quot;center&quot; that it all originated from, you can look in any direction and focus on the CMB and that point was (and the way we're seeing it - <em>is</em>) right there at the epicenter of the big bang.</p>
<p>C. The universe may well be infinite, in that spacetime (the axes of our coordinate system itself) may go on for ever and ever. But just because the coordinate system has no end point, does not necessarily imply that the distribution of matter across that spacetime is also actually infinite. For instance, the sphere (assuming that the pre-bang singularity was spherical, and retained that shape, expanding in each direction) of matter that we live inside, may be about 2-3 times the radius of our obervable sphere, or even 25 times the radius (we will never know). But it may have an actual physical radius, and end at some distance from us, while the coordinate system that it is expanding into will go on and on for infinity. A spacecraft sitting at a world on that &quot;border&quot; could very plausibly venture out into the emptiness and keep going forever, and behind it, would be every speck of matter that existed since the big bang.</p>
<p>D. (now this one I'm not 100% certain about but it does make sense) Ignoring the &quot;observable universe&quot;, if we were to magically come to know the position of <em>all</em> the matter in the actual, physical universe, we might be able to find a physical center, using the position of the outermost physical matter (assuming there is a real, finite limit to the quantity of matter, and that spacetime isnt curved into a giant sphere or toroid or whatever) as a reference frame, and finding the geometric center of the matter-distribution. Practically, that is impossible, because no point can see further than the CMB and that becomes the limit of its observable field.</p></div>		</li>
