			<div class="markdown"><p>I may not have worded that exactly the way I wanted to. Yes, I believe for most people, taking a 25% hit would really hurt. I know it would for me. But if you owe $50k in credit card debt and they are garnishing $7-800 a month? It's going to take a long time for them to get that money. That was my only point. Garnishing is not a good option for them either. Not to mention, many people can just switch jobs and they have to go through the whole legal process to garnish you again. Many people use this strategy when they have the kind of job that makes it easy to get another job. Like say Construction for instance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I should take that back. Found a couple of other comments that weren't bullshit.</p></div>		</li>
