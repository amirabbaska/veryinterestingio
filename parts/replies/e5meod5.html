			<div class="markdown"><p>The event horizon of the black hole(s) will not be spherical during the merger. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00712" target="_blank">This paper</a> describes an extreme case where one black hole is much (much much) larger than another so the event horizon can be approximated as a plane. The event horizons of the two holes merge in a droplet-like fashion. In general, the event horizon will not ever return to a spherical shape from the perspective of an outside observer. Further for spinning black holes the event horizon is not spherical to begin with. These are described by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric" target="_blank">Kerr solution</a> and the event horizon and ergosphere are only symmetrical about the axis of rotation. If two spinning black holes collide they can exhibit a recoil due to the asymmetry of the emitted gravitational waves. This recoil is greatest for equal magnitude spins in opposite direction and is described in the paper in my other comment. There is also a ton of other <em>weird shit</em> that happens within the ergospheres of spinning black holes so I assume that if they didn't fully merge you could get some other real exotic behavior.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Just after a merger the resulting black hole is distorted and non-spherical, but it rapidly relaxes towards its final Kerr shape while emitting gravitational waves in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_black_hole#Ringdown" target="_blank">ringdown</a>.</p>

<p>I guess what it even means to be spherical can be hard to define in arbitrary curved spacetimes, but at least in the standard Boyer-Linquist coordinates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric#Important_surfaces" target="_blank">Kerr event horizon's radial position has no angular dependence</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>its been a while since I have studied the kerr solution so I was struggling with the words to describe it. Thank you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ringdown I was aware of, but as to the outside observer theorem of no-hair I assume this is correct as well?  All black hole mergers must become a sphere.</p></div>		</li>
