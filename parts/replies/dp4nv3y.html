			<div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly it caused some minor problems in early days of space flight. Hinges, for instance, would stick and took a lot of strength to get closed, which almost boned the first Russian to perform a spacewalk. Thankfully he was able to overcome it and force the hatch closed. The Galileo spacecraft in 1991 had issues deploying it's high-gain antenna attributed to cold-welding.</p>
<p>So it's a double-edged sword; it can make construction in space easy if done right, but can also cause issues without the right precautions. Countermeasures involve using different materials between pieces that come into contact with eachother, putting thicker oxide layers on parts, and thin layers of lubrication between the parts.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is a welding technique that kind of works like cold welding.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction_stir_welding" target="_blank">Friction stir welding</a> An important point about FSW, is that the friction tool does not melt the material.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid-state joining process that uses a non-consumable tool to join two facing workpieces without melting the workpiece material.[1] Heat is generated by friction between the rotating tool and the workpiece material, which leads to a softened region near the FSW tool. While the tool is traversed along the joint line, it mechanically intermixes the two pieces of metal, and forges the hot and softened metal by the mechanical pressure, which is applied by the tool, much like joining clay, or dough.[1] It is primarily used on wrought or extruded aluminium and particularly for structures which need very high weld strength. FSW is also found in modern shipbuilding, trains, and aerospace applications.[2][3][4][5][6][7]</p>

<p>A simpler material shows that recombination can happen though: a block of aluminum. If you cut aluminum in half, you can't just press the halves back together and get your block back, because the brand new edges are exposed to air and form a new oxide layer. However, if you polish the halves in a vacuum, you can just push the blocks together and they just become one block. This is the principle behind cold welding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed this, atoms/molecules don't care if they were previously connected or not, if a new atom is placed as close to another group, it's going to bind just as tight to it as the rest. The problem is to make two groups of them fit well, one atom bonding here and there isn't going to hold the two pieces together, at maximum some atoms will change side if you try press two pieces together. Because, in general, surfaces are always polluted and rough at an atomic level, and you just can't get rid of all air in between no matter how hard you try to push them together. But cold welding show that, done right, it's perfectly possible.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cutting in a vacuum gets away from much of those problems. That is why the spacecraft hinges would get stuck. The sliding motion scrapes the surfaces together. Much like the friction welding I noted.</p></div>		</li>
