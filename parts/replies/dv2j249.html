			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we used that too.  Basically, you want to bite the bullet money wise and build a stainless steel system,  You can heat sanitize it,  Even with peroxyacetic acid, ozone, bleach, alternating the three, plastic = biofilm.</p>
<p>A lot of problems would be avoided if drinking water was used more.  The organic chemists hate it because the residual chlorine might cause trace impurities.  I sympathize, but I recommend they try the process with drinking water before spending a fortune on a purified water system.</p></div>		</li>
