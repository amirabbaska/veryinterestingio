			<div class="markdown"><p>Like how a warm tea gets cold and an ice tea gets warm. But they are both stabilising to room temp. Same can be said about baked goods. If you are a smoker you would be familiar with this concept, specifically cigars. You keep them in humidors to make sure they stay moist and don’t get dry. When in Europe in the mountains the air is super dry and the cigars start to crack and crumble in a few hours if not kept properly, when In Brazil during rainy season you don’t even have to put them anywhere as the humidity is already perfect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of one of many painfully obvious awakenings I’ve had in my life. For the life of me I couldn’t understand why hot coffee got colder over time while cold water got warmer. I was like 6-7, I wondered about that for so long until I asked my dad and he explained that they were both approaching ambient temperature. 30 years later I still feel like a fucking idiot whenever I think about that. </p></div>		</li>
