			<p>One thing I'd like to add is the pressures that shifted the value of a HS degree to be worthless, and to make a college degree take the place of the HS degree, didn't just disappear once the switch happened. In fact, those pressures are accelerating. The value of the college degree will be pushed aside just as easily as the HS degree was pushed aside. What will take the place of a college degree? Nepotism and cronyism will be the only path to good jobs. In other words, POLITICS. High paying jobs will become limited to a wealthy and deserving class and everyone else will be left to fight for scraps from the table. Education will be required for a good job, and so will having the right connections.</p>		</li>
