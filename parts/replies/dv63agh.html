			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly correct except you don't turn fat into sugar, that is how glucose works. The stored body fat will be used by conversion into ketone bodies or &quot;ketones&quot;. </p>
<p>Also, you become hungry because your body releases a hormone known as ghrelin which stimulates hunger. After a short time with no food the body stops creating that hormone because it doesn't seem to be working and goes to your body fat stores.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So is that why the Keto diet works? Because you force your body to produce ketones to fuel itself from fat ? At the same time limiting carbs and sugars but upping healthy fats like Avocado?
At what point does your body start breaking down muscle as fuel ?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kind of, the idea is to take your body off glucose which is the most easily used fuel source as it doesn't have to spend as much energy/time to convert it to usable fuel.</p>
<p>Unused Glucose is converted into fat, so the idea with the Keto diet is to cut out sugar, bread and anything else that converts straight to glucose and just consume fat. This means your body has to adapt and start focusing on burning fat for energy. When it runs out of the food you eat it goes to the next available source, the fat on your body.</p>
<p>To prevent muscle from being used, they always suggest to pair the Keto diet with some form of light resistance training. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, I'm actually doing keto right now and I'm a huge fan.</p>
<p>So basically if you're not fat adapted your body will start utilizing muscle as fuel when you are no longer in a positive nitrogen balance. Working out with weights and eating protein heightens your nitrogen balance.</p>
<p>So, if you're very out of shape and not already on a high fat diet your body will start breaking down muscle and some fat as soon as there is no more calories being derived from incoming food sources. </p></div>		</li>
