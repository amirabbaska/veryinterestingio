			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answer, I see from reading this thread that there's many more factors to this than I originally thought!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At some temperature carbon dioxide <em>will</em> precipitate out of the site as dry ice &quot;snow&quot;, but that temperature is very low because there is very little CO2 in the air, about 0.04%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I can ask a follow up question while keeping this in mind. So would it be possible to calculate the air temperature needed to observe actual CO2 &quot;snow&quot;? Or the temperature at which the atmospheric CO2 would start to frost on surfaces?</p></div>		</li>

No actual &quot;snowing&quot; going on there though. Only deposition/sublimation due to the low pressure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The fun thing is that the Martian atmosphere is 96% CO2, so even though the overall pressure is very low, the partial pressure of CO2 at the surface comes out at something like 20 times what it is on Earth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing is, when it does condense, all of the air will condense together, including the oxygen and nitrogen.</p>
<p>You get snow because it's frozen water that has already separated from the air. You'd be better off asking why water separates from the air and carbon dioxide doesn't</p></div>		</li>
