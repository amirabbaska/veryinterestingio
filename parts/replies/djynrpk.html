			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body is sweating as a natural reaction to the heat, but you often don't notice because you're already in water. This is why you're often so thirsty after being in a hot tub or sauna.</p>
<p>If you remain in the hot tub or sauna for too long, you will overheat.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DRUMMONDVILLE, Que. -- Three Quebecers are going to prison for their role in the extreme-sweating death of a woman who was wrapped in mud and cellophane at a spa.<br />
[...]<br />
They were found guilty in December 2014 of criminal negligence causing death.
Frechette was considered a spiritual guide and organized the personal-growth seminar in Durham-Sud, while Duclos and Fontaine were her assistants.
During the fatal session, participants were plastered with mud, wrapped in a plastic sheet and a blanket and had their heads covered with cardboard boxes for nine hours. A coroner described the process as the equivalent of being cooked alive.</p>

<p>But, for short stays (under 10 mins) it's quite fun. Intoxicating even.</p>
<p>Poison is all about the dose.  A poison in small amounts can be fun.  See alcohol and nicotine.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Temperature plays a major role in determining the rates at which enzymes (which are made of proteins) react.  Basically if your internal temperature tips too far off from its ideal, instead of a finely timed series of chemical reactions keeping you alive you get several hundred reactions ticking off at rates they weren't designed to work together at.  Tip the balance far enough and part of the system enters a cascade failure, which ends up killing you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And this, as is my understanding, is why we get fevers.  We're sensitive to temperature changes but invading organisms are often <em>very</em> sensitive to them.  A few degrees extra will make you feel like crap but it'll kill them, or hobble them enough to help your immune system do its thing.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If i remember correctly, once your body gets too hot the proteins in your body start to break down. Too cold and some of the chemical reactions stop taking place. Both cause your body to start shutting down.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, many proteins denature at 41C. This is why they say if you have a sustained fever of 40C, it is time to go to the hospital. If you hit 41C sustained, it is very likely there will be permanent damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The human body is a finely tuned machine that can handle some adversity. Within the body, reactions are fine tuned to occur at specific rates in specific conditions every second. There are hundreds of these reactions. When you change the temperature of the body, some of these reactions occur too fast, others too slow. Some don't even occur at all due to denaturing (deforming so that an enzyme can't do its job). This sets of chaos in the body and subsequently death. Any one reaction failing would (likely) not kill a human. When the entire system is off though, catastrophic failure occurs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For an average, naked, resting human, the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17929604" target="_blank">thermoneutral temperature is 27C</a>. This is the temperature at which the human body is not spending additional energy at controlling our internal temperature. OF course, that's not really &quot;operating in&quot;, but it's the closest answer I can find.</p>
<p>Unrelated, but interesting: if we are naked, we will (eventually) die of hypothermia at an ambient temperature of ~20C. The human body is superbly adapted at keeping cool, but we are shite at staying warm without technology.</p></div>		</li>
