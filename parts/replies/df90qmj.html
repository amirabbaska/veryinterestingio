<p>People underestimate the value of reference librarians in the age of google, but we can be a huge asset in finding the information you need and making sure that it is from an accurate and reliable source.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Can't stress this enough. If you need basic-level knowledge for your personal curiosity, then Wikipedia and Google are fine. But if you need advanced to expert level knowledge, particularly in something outside your own discipline, then a subject/reference librarian is a HUGE asset. It's incredibly hard to find the most relevant information when you don't know where to look (What databases aggregate this field? Is this an article-focused field, book-focused, conference-focused, product-focused, etc.? Which journals/publishers do people use?). And when you don't know what words people use to describe the thing you want to know.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I took a course in college called <em>Media and Memory</em>. One of the things that we talked about was that libraries were a way for society to retain memory form generation to generation. For my final paper, I chose my thesis to be something like <em>The Internet is Killing Libraries</em>. Of course, I tried to do all my research online. For weeks, I was only able to identify a couple measly articles that I used to stretch out to 2-3 mediocre pages.</p>
<p>With one week to go before the paper was due, I swallowed my pride and went to the university library. Within an hour of arriving and speaking with a librarian, I had a stack of books so high, I looked like I was in a cartoon. I changed my thesis to something like, <em>Why Libraries are Still Important in the Age of Information</em>. I busted out 25+ pages, got an A, and changed my opinion about libraries henceforth.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep! When doing any kind of academic work, the difference between bad and good work is often your sources. When I was doing my MA thesis there were dozens of sources I simply could not get online. A lot of information and sources are on google or in online journals, but SO much of the world's knowledge is not. And even if it is available electronically, how would you know where to look? A good reference librarian with access to vast library systems and databases is absolutely invaluable. Thinking everything you need to know is on the internet or accessible to the average researcher is incredibly limiting.</p></div>		</li>

<p>And thank you! I think Summer reading is what gives most youth services librarians burnout. I'm pretty new to the job, so I'm not there yet, but hopefully this Summer does not do me in.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, thank you for all you do.</p>
<p>And this is exactly why my post is a &quot;1 size doesn't fit all&quot;. The Role of a Librarian is expanding violently in all directions, you need much more than simply a knowledge of where a single book goes and how to find it now days.</p>
<p>It's easy to look in from the outside and say &quot;I can do that&quot;.</p>
<p>A Masters in Library Sciences keeps those people from attaining jobs that otherwise need to be handled by true professionals like yourself.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not to mention so many more places use librarians. No one ever talks about Corporate Librarian or a Law Librarian being a thing. </p>
<p>A look at the Partnership job board gives an idea of the diversity of librarians and library techs out there.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! There are so many different types of librarians. I have a huge list of things that I do and my duties are almost completely different than those of, say, an academic librarian. We are both librarians, but we play very different roles.</p></div>		</li>
