			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly my line of thought too. For example, the number 2 is very common as a constant in various situations and mathematical equations. But we don't generally think of it as a &quot;magic number&quot; mathematical constant, it's just regular old 2.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Forgive my stupidity, but why 100%? There are infinitely many of both rational and irrational numbers. I know Cantor proved a thing a while back about one infinity being different from another, but I don't think that applies to calculating probability in this case. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in service of the post, I'm not entirely sure randomization is a serviceable answer to the original question. Are there truly no rational constants?</p></div>		</li>

Thus, it has a Lebesgue measure of <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/508217/showing-that-rationals-have-lebesgue-measure-zero" target="_blank">zero</a>.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question. Does the uncountability of the irrational set <em>imply</em> that there's more of them? Or just that we can't effectively list them?</p>
<p>Edit: I just saw your link, and attempted to read it. It is, however, beyond my knowledge of math. Does it invalidate my question?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wait real numbers are countable? I was under the assumption that Q was infinitely large and infinitesimally small. So how is that countable? I'm going to assume you're right and I'm just misunderstanding the meaning of countable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things can get a little weird when looking at probabilities relating to real ranges (allowing decimal numbers).</p>
<p>We can calculate the odds of selecting one option from a list using the formula (1/total number of options). If I'm choosing a random whole number between 1 and 10, there's a 1/10 chance I choose any one number.</p>
<p>If I was to choose a real number (allowing decimal numbers) between 1 and 10, we say the probability of choosing any specific number is 0%. This is because there is an infinite number of decimal numbers between 1 and 10, and our formula becomes (1/number of options) = (1/infinity) = 0.</p>
<p>The example above was a sort of inverse of the example I gave. You can use similar logic to come to that result.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In probability there's two concepts of 100%  (and also 0%).  You have what is known as &quot;sure to happen&quot; and &quot;almost sure to happen&quot;.  In the &quot;sure to happen&quot; case it is the 100% you are thinking of where it is a guarantee to happen. </p>
<p>The &quot;almost sure to happen&quot; case happens a lot when you get into probabilities over infinite sets.  It implies the event should happen, but there is still a chance that the event does not.  For example if you flipped a coin an infinite number of times there is an &quot;almost sure&quot; chance that you will eventually get a tail, but it is still possible that you will get nothing but heads. </p>
<p>Since there are infinitely many real numbers on any given interval the probability of picking or not picking a number falls into this category. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In probability you asign a chance of 1 (or 100%) to things that happen 'almost surely'. With continuous numbers, possible outcomes have what's called positive density, not positive probability.</p>
<p>For example, let's say that you could measure length with arbitrary precision. You then blindly throw a dart to a board and measure the distance from the dart to the center. The distance can be any number between zero and the radius of the board, but the probability that it is exactly any given number (e.g. 0.542759274880000...) is defined as zero (or one infinitesimal if you wish).</p>
<p>The intuition of this is hard to explain without going into the details. You could say that a probability is like an area and any possible outcome is a line. Lines have no area but when you join many together you get a positive one.</p>
<p>Another way to see it is that, given that there are infinite numbers, if you say that numbers have a probability greater than zero, when you add them up you'd get a infinite chance of drawing all numbers, which doesn't make sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider the set of real numbers except one specific number, like pi for instance. For a continuous probability distribution, the probability of picking a number in this set is 100%, yet it is not sure since there is no way to rule out picking pi.</p></div>		</li>
