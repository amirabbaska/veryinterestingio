			<div class="markdown"><p>Reductions make a large difference, and the differences are more or less proportional to consumption.</p>
<p>If people ate half the amount of meat, then by most measures the environmental impact of meat production would fall by about half as well.</p>
<p>One of the biggest strategic errors of vegetarianism and veganism was to frame it as an all-or-nothing <em>identity</em> issue. Someone who reduces their meat consumption by 95% is doing a great thing for environmental impacts and for animal rights and suffering, but they are still not a vegetarian or vegan. The identity issues turns meat consumption into a political issue, which tends to further entrench people's lifestyle choices (via their values) rather than encouraging change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This exactly! I don't want to give up meat but I have beef once or twice per month and try and not eat meat at all a couple of times per week. </p>
<p>This is down from meat once or twice a day. </p>
<p>I think what I'm doing is much easier than cold turkey and can have a measurable impact if a significant chunk of the population did it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same.  My children have decided to become vegetarians so I (somewhat reluctantly) have given up eating meat at home.  I only eat it out at restaurants now, so maybe 3 or 4 times per month.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm really glad you said this. I've been trying to reduce my meat consumption, but I feel like people don't take it seriously unless I commit to being a vegetarian. I'm down to eating meat one day per week and I'd like to cut that to one day every other week. I want to take it slow so I don't give up to cravings or anything. It takes time to develop habits, you know?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Only if <em>all</em> people reduced their intake by half. However if just those currently able to afford regular meat reduced their intake by half it would lower the price of meat globally, allowing others who want to eat meat but were unable previously (for economic reasons) to consume it. The relationship is not a direct one in the real world, though there would be a net negative effect on global meat production.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If every meat eater would eat veg every 2nd day, then half the meat production would be needed. This is with a constant world population, however the population continues to increase. Still, as a meat eater, this is the really interesting option that we should hear more about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An other way to reduce meat production is to reduce food waste. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/issues/food-waste" target="_blank">US for example</a>, 40% of all food bought is never eaten (so production inefficiencies and losses in the supply chain do not count). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unless this just caused them to increase meat the other days? I eat meat, but I don't eat it every day, just when I feel like it (fairly often I guess), but since I am not eating every day, if I have some specific days I don't eat meat, I doubt my overall consumption would change at all? Would be an interesting basis for a long term study.  </p>
<p>I think more realistically, there are so many people who will never stop eating meat... it might be better to decrease certain types of meat (beef) in favor of less harmful meat (like chicken or pork) for example.... </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's mainly about getting people off of Beef to start with. Beef requires 28 times more land, 6 times more fertilizer and 11 times more water compared to non-beef meat sources. It would be a lot easier to convince people to leave the beef rather than giving up meat entirely.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Primarily because we feed them corn and soy(made possible by government subsidies). </p>
<p>Grass fed/finished cows can be very green. Cows graze one lands not suitable for farming. Grass is a perennial, capturing C02, and growing larger root systems which prevents soil erosion. Pasture land also provides more biodiversity than crop land. </p>
