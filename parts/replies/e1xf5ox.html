			<div class="markdown"><p>There's a few things going on here; it used to be that the power pin was always live, and tolerances in fabrication were looser.  This meant that plugging in upside down would potentially cause electrical issues.</p>
<p>The big breakthrough came with smart systems that plug in with low power and can ramp up after negotiating parameters and checking resistance.  The result of this was that pins can be closer together without causing issues, allowing for the ability to put the contacts on both sides of an insulator in the same configuration.  USB came about right during that transition phase; Apple should have been able to make Firewire the first connector to plug in both ways, but I seem to recall there is some fascinating story involving Apple and Sony and IBM that resulted in the connector that was used instead (and the second one that was different but also not reversible).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When Apple was rolling out FireWire they were at the low point when they almost went out of business. Despite FireWire being demonstrably better than USB the PC manufacturers wouldn't us it and chose USB instead because using FireWire would have given Apple licensing fees and helped them not go out of business. Later, after Steve Jobs return, Apple kept using FireWire because it was night-and-day better than USB, although they did start putting USB ports in iMacs initially (if I remember correctly.) Sony developed a similar format to FireWire, it was actually the exact same thing they just used a different connector (kind of the exact point the original post was about) to get around the Apple licensing fees. Because of the differences FireWire was relegated to niche markets and eventually phased out. It's sad because FireWire was so powerful/adaptable/capable who knows what might be different if it had become the port of choice.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Firewire WAS better than USB 1. It and USB 2 were more equal. If I remember correctly, firewire had faster speeds for sustained transfers (for huge files), but USB was good if the file wasn't huge. Then USB continued to be updated and eventually surpassed firewire 400.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, I still have a firewire external hard drive connected to my mac. (Firewire 800, through a tunderbolt port) I don't think firewire 800 is faster than USB 3 though, in fact I'm pretty sure it isn't. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wall outlet are only power. And they are AC. </p>
<p>You have to worry about power going to a signal pin and causing things to let the magic smoke out.</p>
<p>Also, AC has no positive or negative, it just oscillates. So it direction doesn't matter in most cases.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wall outlets are &quot;reversible&quot; because of AC. &quot;Reversible&quot; is in quotes because there are plenty of plugs that aren't, grounded ones, etc. All the stuff that decides how it gets converted to DC is in the thing you plug into the wall. </p></div>		</li>

<p>For a long time, they designed connectors purposely asymmetric so that people COULDN'T plug them in wrong. Look at DVI or VGA or old style parallel port. (The connections are parallelograms, not squares.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that these connectors have a lot more pins than USB.  The more pins you have, the harder it is to make it reversible.</p></div>		</li>
