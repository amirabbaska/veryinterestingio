<p>Could something as fast as, say a SLR camera mirror be used to bounce the initial flash into the setup and then flip out of the way?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, you're underestimating the speed of light. An SLR mirror moves out of the way at around 1/8000th of a second (assuming top of the line mirror mechanisms) but light moves at around 186,000 miles per second, so in that 1/8000th of a second that the mirror is getting out of the way, light has already bounced back and forth the distance of around 24 miles. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd also need a perfect mirror that reflects all of the light that strikes it. These don't exist, so they absorb some of the light on each 'bounce.'</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The surface of the mirror isn't perfectly flat.  Would these imperfections eventually reflect the light out of the path of the 2 mirrors in any case?   I'd imagine light entering and exiting the system in almost equal measure. </p></div>		</li>
