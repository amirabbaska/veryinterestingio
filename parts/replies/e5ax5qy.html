			<div class="markdown"><p>KSP shows some of the counter intuitive things about orbits. If you are in the same orbit as another object and you need to reach it, what do you do? Point your nose at it and apply thrust, right? KSP let's you try it out, and you'll find that it doesn't work, you'll move away from the object. Why? Because you will go into a higher orbit from your extra velocity.</p>
<p>Want to get back to Earth? Don't bother pointing at Earth, point in the opposite direction of your orbit and apply thrust. You need to slow down to lower your orbit. But what happens if you point at Earth and apply thrust? KSP will answer that question for you because I forgot.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>interesting. never thought of it that way.</p>
<p>but why do you have to cancel the 67k mph? even if you just face the sun and go at, say, 1000 mph, won't you eventually reach there, even if you're also going parallel to the earth at the same time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It helps to think of velocities rather than speeds. That is, think of a speed <em>and direction</em> rather than just your speed.</p>
<p>If you don't cancel that 67k mph then even if you are pointing at the sun and accelerating really quickly, once you get close to the sun you're going to still be going 67 thousand miles per hour right past it due to the shape and direction of your orbit.</p>
<p>Also because you're constantly circling around the sun (aka orbiting) it is really difficult to just point yourself at the sun, since where it is relative to you is constantly changing.</p>
<p>Finally: cancelling that 67k mph is the easiest most fuel efficient way of getting to the sun, because going slower means that gravity pulls you closer; you're essentially letting the sun's gravity do all the work of pulling you closer by lowering your orbital velocity.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is that movement in space is <em>weird</em> and counter-intuitive, partly because of the fact that you don't get slowed down unless you expend fuel to do it, but mostly because you pick up velocity via gravity of various celestial bodies and have to take that into account, and specifically when you're orbiting something, orbital mechanics are really counter-intuitive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope. That would be a radial burn, which would lower part of the orbit and raise its opposite side, relative to the sun. It's like driving North at 67 mph while being blow by a strong wind 1 mph East. You're still heading mostly North but with a slight offset to the East.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Edit - I just had an epiphany. Anything that exits the earth won't keep going parallel to it,  it would go at a tangent. Duh!! I think I get it now. Thanks! Also I listened to a part of your video and I'm lost. I don't get why an object thrown down from the space station would go up. Yeah.</p>

<p>What you're saying seems along the lines of what I mean. I didn't understand the first sentence at all but that's OK.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's like driving North at 67 mph while being blow by a strong wind 1 mph East. You're still heading mostly North but with a slight offset to the East.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So in this analogy I assume the Sun is in the east. But what if the wind is at 1000 mph?</p>
<p>I actually think reversing the analogy would make more sense, since the earth's motion would be more analogous to the wind and driving would be more analogous to the shuttle.</p>
<p>So if my destination is 1000 miles away, and I'm driving at 1 mph (rocket) and the wind is at 67 mph (earth's trajectory), correct, it'll take a long time to get there - but assuming the wind blows me in a big circle (which is what the earth's orbit is doing in space) I assume it'll still take the 1000 hours that it would've had there been no wind. No?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>orbits and velocities don't work that way.  if you point directly at the sun now,  you're going to be pointing directly away from the sun in half a year.  adding a vector of 1000 mph in that direction will merely shift your orbit slightly</p></div>		</li>
