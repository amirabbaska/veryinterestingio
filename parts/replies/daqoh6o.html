			<div class="markdown"><p>can imagine lots more areas of science where properties of snow can matter. aerospace engineering for example, plane landing and taking off conditions as well as flight conditions. same counts for satellite launches, rocket launches, ... Road engineering, traffic scienc etc. etc. All forms of transport really.  </p>
<p>then of course agricultural sciences</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Understanding the densities and layers present in a snowpack is really important in winter time back country travel and recreation.</p>
<p>Anyone going backcountry skiing, snowboarding or snowmobiling should know how to examine a snowpack to understand if there are unstable layers present. Part of this process includes examining the crystal structure of the snow using a Snow Crystal Card like this:

			<div class="markdown"><p>Imagine it like this:
The first molecules make a hexagon shape. The charges are close to balanced internally, the &quot;corners&quot; are the most unbalanced and attract the next molecules. The face of the hexagon has very little charge imballance and anything that tries to stick just slides to the nearest corner.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually it gets large enough that charge no longer can direct all water hitting the snowflake, but by then the flake is not spherical and has a distinct flat hexagon shape budding, leaving the points more exposed to the cold air. As water hits the flake, the water on colder, more exposed areas will freeze, and add to the snowflake, so those points grow faster than the whole &quot;hexagon&quot; and quickly become spikes, even more exposed, which grow even faster. That is why there is sensitive dependence on initial conditions (chaos) in terms of what flake will form: tiny bumps along the side of early arms quickly become huge spikes. By this runaway process, those 6 arms are always growing quicker than the flat side of the flake, and the small deviations on the flat side that would have built arms earlier are now so outpaced by the arms that they are irrelevant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a hard question.  Seriously...like PhD level thermodynamics.  Here's a good write up that explains most of it</p>
<p><a href="http://www.storyofsnow.com/blog1.php/how-the-crystal-got-its-six" target="_blank">http://www.storyofsnow.com/blog1.php/how-the-crystal-got-its-six</a></p>
<p>Tldr;  the hex structure happens to coincide with the fact that the hydrogen bond angles (104.5 degrees) closely match the tetrahedral angle (105 degrees).  That means you can arrange water molecules into tetrahedral structures (one of which has a  hexagonal projection) without bending the bonds that much.  HOWEVER, this lattice (ice Ih) is one of several, with both <a href="http://www1.lsbu.ac.uk/water/images/ice-miller.gif" target="_blank">cubic and trigonal^1</a> structures being possible...so seeing hex-ice in the environment is really just a product of the outside world existing in the right place on the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/725px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">phase diagram</a>.  Why we see hex ice at these temperature and pressures is the hard question, with its roots in the statistical mechanics of crystalography</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think to be clear you need to back up just a little bit.</p>
<p>A hexagonal plate of ice <em>can</em> become thicker when water molecules stick to its sides. It's a 3d shape with thickness and not just a single layer.</p>
<p>However, those bonds do not build up anywhere near as quickly as the ones at the edges. This is either because they do not form as fast or do not last long as the ones that grow the crystal outwards.</p>
<p>The in-plane bonds are stickier than the adjacent-plane (perpendicular to plane) bonds.</p>
<p>Why?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You'd have to come up with a reason for them to be asymmetrical. They're isolated bits of solid matter floating and tumbling around in a constantly moving gas mixture, so there's no reason for them to develop other than symmetrically. They'd be spherical if it weren't for the shape of a water molecule. And if they don't form slowly and gently enough, they basically do become lumpy spheres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a reason: because deposition of water vapour on each of the sides of the hexagon is random and so the shape of the crystal t+(a few microseconds) will be asymmetric.   From there further asymmetry will grow.</p>
<p>Clearly, this reason is incorrect.  Can't Reddit come up with a counter involving symmetric electric fields or something?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's not a scientific answer. The molecules on one side don't communicate with those on the other side. Plenty of processes aggregate material randomly. The symmetry is not obvious. </p></div>		</li>
