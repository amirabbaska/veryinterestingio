			<div class="markdown"><p>The fuel pellets inside a uranium-based fuel rod do not “burn” at the same rate so when a spent fuel rod is removed from a reactor there is indeed still useful material. There are countries that re-process the spent fuel to remove specific nuclides to minimize waste volumes.  There’s an <a href="http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/te_1587_web.pdf" target="_blank">IAEA document </a> that describes options.  </p>
<p>Thorium based fuel or liquid fuel based reactors have better promise for burning fuel more efficiently but those reactor designs are no commercially available...yet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the controversial detractors of thorium reactors is that it produces U-233 which is better than plutonium for weapons use. Though in reality it is contaminated with U-232, but a concern none the less. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Protactinium in thorium reactors is undesirable and usually removed - this decays into fissile uranium which can certainly be weaponized. The solution is either to leave the protactinium in, even though it has a large cross section and therefore catches neutrons slowing the reaction or try and reduce the production of protactinium to near zero (and both are in play for thorium fast reactors). Thorium itself is a fertile fuel and has to be bred into fissile uranium to be useful. In the same line, nuclear waste is fertile uranium and can be bred to fissile plutonium and used as fuel. Both require fast neutron reactions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Worst part is it’s possible to regulate the amount of bomb usable plutonium and still burn all the long lived isotopes, but yay for political pressures kiboshing the more safe and up to date reactor designs...</p>
<p>Edit: I realiZe this comment is extremely vague.  My comment was referring to the ability to breed and burn fuel without ever having any plutonium on hand to actually be used.  It’s always in the reactor or in the reprocessor which can be made under the radiation dome.  The mass of plutonium not in the reactor being fissioned can be kept extremely low to comply with any governmental/international agreements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not <em>political pressure</em>, it's just straight up the nature of the international system.  Right now the US have agreements on how many nuclear weapons they can have, etc.  This is done with an eye towards avoiding the kind of large scale weapon build ups that defined the cold-war era and heightening tensions.  And a large part of that was defined by not being sure how many weapons the enemy has.  </p>
<p>If the US were to all of a sudden begin recycling nuclear fuel which just by <em>coincidence</em> could also be used to produce the kind of material that is used to make weapons, what is Russia supposed to do?  Just trust us when we say, nah bruv, these are just recycling plants.  We'd definitely never secretly produce more nuclear weapons to have a trump card over you.  If you're Russia, you all of a sudden need to worry about whether there is a secret arms race going on that you've been out of the loop on.   So it's time to start making more weapons.  </p>
<p>And you know what, if the roles were flipped the US would do the exact same goddamn thing.  </p>
<p>And need I remind you, the closest we ever got to nuclear catastrophe was based on the premise of <em>who has more weapons and whether one side could wipe out the nuclear capabilities of the other in a first strike</em>.  Both sides believed they could destroy the nuclear capabilities of the other in a first strike, and hence probably should.  Looking back on it, we now know that both sides were <em>wrong</em>, and it almost certainly would have been the end of the world as multiple waves of nuclear weapons were detonated in the Soviet Union and the US.</p>
<p>So those <em>politics</em> people like to bitch about is very much a part of how we stay safe and sane in a world where <em>nuclear weapons</em> exist.  Transparency about weapons capabilities and the avoidance of suspicious activities that could conceivably mask the creation of additional weapons keeps us from engaging in nuclear arms races with other countries.  Transparency helps other countries trust you when you say your nuclear weapons are for defensive purposes only, and it helps prevent preemptive strikes in situations where you're not quite sure about the intentions of another country.  </p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where there is an accident between the forces of two countries (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/world/asia/malaysia-air-flight-mh17-russia-ukraine-missile.html" target="_blank">perhaps a plane is shot down by a seperatist movement</a>), so you get on the horn with their leader to find out what is going on and they're effusive that it was not intentional, etc.  In this world, it's unfortunate but not potentially world ending.  But imagine if you <em>also can't be sure with any degree of certainty what their nuclear and military resources are</em>.  What do you do then?  Just wait to find out if these are the opening shots of a war you weren't expecting or prepared for?  </p>
<p>Efficiency seems like a small price to pay for a degree of certainty.  </p>
<p>Edit: You guys are really missing the forest for the trees here.  I don't know or care about nuclear waste recycling, I care about game theory and the political science that supports how <em>mutually assured destruction works</em>.  Note how I didn't go on and on about technological aspects regarding disposal of nuclear waste.  My comment is directly in response to someone else mostly on the faith that they're correct in their assessment for why it isn't pursued.  I'm trying to give a good faith argument for why (if this is the case) we wouldn't pursue this type of recycling.  The politics of nuclear weapons is complicated, I'm not trying to be correct <em>in this specific instance</em>.  I'm not invested on whether this technology is used or not, I just don't care either way.  </p>
<p>What I do care about is dispelling the notion that there aren't good reasons to be careful with what we do and how it's perceived by other nations.  So please stop messaging me about the fact that other nations do this or whatever.  That wasn't my point.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This might be a dumb question, but if both sides thought they could win by striking first how come neither did?</p>
<p>EDIT: Ok, so the answer is that neither side thought they could win by striking first. Got it! ;)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so why doesn't the US re-use the spent plutonium in a reactor? The US already has 1000s of nukes. Everyone knows this. And no one is going to stop the US from building more nukes. So it would be pretty obvious that it was being used for energy.</p>
<p>Plus we wouldn't have to spend $billions digging a huge tunnel in Nevada that we're probably never to going to use anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plutonium is used up in the reactor. Nuclear fuel needs some fissile material like one needs kindling to start a bonfire.  Fissile material (enriched uranium or plutonium) is essentially material that is easy to react. The nuclear reactor also creates fissile material as the fuel burns.  Uranium based fuel usually produces more plutonium than it can burn so spent fuel always has some plutonium that is ripe for processing into weapons grade fissile material. Thorium based fuel reactors breed more plutonium, but can burn more of it before fuel is spent. That spent fuel is much more difficult to process for plutonium. </p></div>		</li>
