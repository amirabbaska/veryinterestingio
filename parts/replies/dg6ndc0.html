			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really accurate, the pressure in your veins is still higher than outside, it's just lower than your arteries, so the blood always flows from heart to artery to vein back to heart. There's definitely no &quot;sucking&quot; involved, the standard blood pressure is 120/80, with the 80 being the pressure in the veins. If you cut a vein, the blood still comes out under pressure, but differently than an artery because the pressure is less, and because veins generally don't have pulses because those get removed in the capillaries.</p>
<p>Also, the camera verification on the face is looking for color changes too subtle for us to see, not size changes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sorry have to correct a bit. The 80 is absolutely not venous pressure. Both numbers are arterial. Your arteries are not like a rigid pipe, they are an elastic tube. When your heart beats it stretches the tube and brings the pressure to systolic ( top number). Blood flow from artery to capillary to vein is not instantaneous, so the pressure does not drop to zero between beats. Instead it drops to the bottom number, called diastolic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We have two seperate blood systems. </p>

<p>This is a common misconception. This is one system. There is no physical separation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cutting a vein open some will get out but due to the underpressue most of it will stay inside.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cut open your vena cava and you will die almost immediately. The pressure outside your body is lower than the veins, so blood will preferentially bleed out of your body, not stay in. The same holds true for most internal bleeding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mechanism is much more simple than it sounds and you could easily rebuild it using a regular pump.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the <em>basics</em> are simple, in reality the cardiovascular system is incredibly complicated in both anatomy and physiology. No one on this planet has created a self-repairing, self-remodelling, self-correcting, self-pacing system such as the cardiovascular system. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The arterie which has overpressure and the vein system which has an underpressue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don't like this explanation. Blood wants to flow from high pressure to low pressure. It starts at about 120mmHg at the Aorta, and ends at about 2mmHg at the right Atrium. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Attached to those dead ends are many many tiny tunnels acting like a web all across your body were the blood gets pressed into and sucked out again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as suction : ). </p></div>		</li>

<p>Both systems are not connected via veins / arteries. They are separated by a third system. </p>

<p>Only because of gravity. If you cut yourself at the hand hold it up you will stop bleeding if you only hit a vein. </p>
<blockquote>

<p>I'm not sure how this is different from my explanation</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Relativity! If you pump a ballon full or air and let it go, the air pressure will equalize between outside and inside and it does not matter whether you explain it with the pressure pressing it out or the global underpressure sucking it out. It's the same. </p>
<p>I know my answer is a little rushed but it's an ELI5 and people often forget that. ELI5's can't be ELI5's and entirely correct at the same time. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm only going to respond to this because it is patently false. Veinous blood pressure, however small, is enough to overcome gravity. <em>If it wasn't someone would die/pass out (syncope) every time they stood up from a laying position</em>. While I understand that raising a limb decreases the overall perfusion of the linb it doesn't stop it. And again, if veinous pressure couldn't overcome gravity you would have a much more serious problem with your inferior vena cava which is at lower pressure than your peripheral veins. I don't know your level of understanding honestly, but please be careful not to send out stuff like this. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I think the main misconception is that people believe our blood system was a circle. You know, you pump blood in the arteries and all the blod flows in a giant cucular path all arround your body until it reaches your heart again.</p>

<p>Thank you for that. I couldn't understand why the OP was asking this question in the first place. </p></div>		</li>
