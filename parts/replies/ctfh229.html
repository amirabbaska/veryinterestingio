<p>I think this may be the most relevant answer to OP's essential question. The point of SETI is to search that which is searchable because if there were a signal to detect and we failed to discover it not because we weren't sophisticated enough or the signal wasn't coherent enough to reach us but because we didn't bother to look at all, we'd be idiots.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Besides that, SETI is also an exercise in data analysis, software and hardware. Those things in themselves progress our understanding and capabilities. The Search of Extraterrestrial Life is just an interesting subject to do it under (just look how it has inspired millions of people to donate money, hardware and insane amounts of CPU and GPU cycles to it).</p>
<p>More on the OP's question, Kepler 452b is supposedly around 6 billion years old, around 1.5 B older then our Earth.</p>
<p>If it followed the same progression of life and technology as we did, there could have been radio signals coming from there 1.5 Billion years ago. By now, they could have progressed far further (say use quantum entanglement for communication or something), or even more likely, went the way of the dodo.</p>
<p>We, at our level of technology, are also at risk of flaming out within the next few hundred to thousand years. If we don't murder the planet, we're still likely to murder each other.</p>
<p>If civilization on Kepler 452b progressed faster or much slower, there's a window, larger then the age of our Earth, several billion years, that they could be ahead or behind us. While there's only a window of a few thousand years we can actually detect radio signals in.</p>
<p>SETI is only for detecting signals in a rather limited timeframe, for rather limited useful distances in a rather limited chunk of space.</p>
<p>But as ademnus said, if we didn't even do the bare basic, it would be lazy to not cover the basics, since we can still learn from them in terms of data analysis, hardware and software.</p></div>		</li>

<p>We can't murder the planet.  Even if we drove the Earth's ecosystem to the point that we couldn't survive once we're gone it would eventually recover.  If life on Earth has proved anything its that it is too tenatious to completely wipe out.  A million years after we're gone the Earth would be flourishing with hardly a trace left that we ever existed, ready for the next intelligent species to have a go.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But we suspect that we're at least as likely to have dropped the keys here as anywhere else.</p>
<p>One of the only things we have to go on when looking for life is that our region of the universe <em>is</em> habitable (n=1, but it's a start).  The core is too hot and active for life to develop for a long time without being killed off, and the non-galactic parts of space are so dark and empty that candidates are spread very far apart.  We also know that our region hasn't had recent contact with nasty stuff like gamma ray bursts, because we're still here.</p>
<p>None of that makes the part closest to us better than the part a little bit further away, but it makes our general area a solid place to start looking.  So, we might as well start at home.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Probably more like looking for ants under a streetlight rather than searching the other side of the street.

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not only is looking close to home (comparatively) cheap, fast, and easy, we don't have a reason to think that anywhere else is better.</p>
<p>We don't have any evidence that there's some more-populated part of the galaxy than ours, and we have a bunch of reasons to suspect that anywhere else is <em>less</em> populated.  The rim has a lot of stars around to look at, but it's sparse enough that life has time to develop.  It also hasn't had any horrible disasters (gamma ray bursts) lately, or we wouldn't be here.</p>
<p>In general, our neck of the galactic woods is easiest to check, and at least as good as anywhere else.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think also there's the issue of <em>how</em> intelligent life would communicate if it's out there. We presume it'd be something like radio because that's the best way we currently have to do it, but maybe some advanced civilization has figured out how to communicate through quantum physics or some other elaborate way that we don't yet understand.</p>
<p>So given that we don't know if there's anything out there, where it is, what it would be saying or how it would be saying it, I see SETI as a sort of trawling net, just like &quot;let's see if we can find a pattern <em>anywhere</em> that's a bit weird, and if we get a bite then we can work on a more focused approach.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you, this is a very helpful answer.</p>
<p>If there are over 2 million stars within SETI range, wouldn't it be better for Kepler to first search in that range so that SETI could be more targeted?</p>
<p>After searching within SETI range, Kepler could move on to further out, so there would be no loss, and surely it would be in everyone's interest to look for potentially intelligent life supporting planets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Kepler stares at a very small star-dense patch in the sky continuously for very long periods waiting for planets to transit and cause a detectable dip in the brightness of the stars in the field it is watching. As we know from our own solar system, planets will only orbit once within months or years, and for a planet detection to be confirmed by Kepler it requires at least 2 occultations (to rule out it being a comet, asteroid, or kuiper belt object in our own solar system passing in front of the star).</p>
<p>In order to stay pointing at exactly the same spot for such long periods Kepler used 4 reaction wheels -- spinning at high rpm, acting as gyroscopes on multiple axes. In 2012 one of these wheels failed, and in 2013 another failed, effectively ending Kepler's mission. It is no longer detecting new planets. The announcements being made come from the processing of the vast quantities of data it already collected.</p>
<p>It would require at least 400 Keplers to watch the whole sky at once (in order to check all these millions of nearby stars). Besides there are other ways to detect planets around the nearer stars, that can be done with ground-based telescopes.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't 3 be required for good data?  If the 2 intervals matched, you'd have a really good idea what was going on.  2 could just be coincidence, couldn't it?  Or are the odds of it happening twice to the same star pretty low just because of how big space is?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow... that's fascinating to hear that Kepler has broken now and all the new discoveries are from sifting the existing data. All of the news reports make it sound like an active and ongoing mission (which I guess it is in a sense, but not in the way a layman like me assumes).</p>
<p>So if there are ways for ground based telescopes to find planets on nearer stars, is that being done in any way that coordinates with SETI's goals?</p>
<p>I know in a way it's kind of silly for some random person like me to be questioning the efficiency of various science teams who probably have all sorts of different technical and logistical concerns. I guess it stems from an impression that SETI is scanning all over the place (I used to run the SETI@home software and my impression is built on what I learned about SETI at that time). Maybe I'm wrong, but it seems like SETI was conceived before we had planet detecting capability, and I'm wondering if now that we're better at finding planets, does SETI use that in any way to be more targeted in their search?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Why the jump from 100 to 500? Does the 500ly range include some denser regions of the galaxy? My (possibly over simplistic) calculations indicate that, if the same density held for the 100ly number, the 500ly number would be less than 1/4 of 280,000...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks like he got that from <a href="http://www.solstation.com/stars3/100-gs.htm" target="_blank">an estimate of G stars within 100 light-years</a>. The same site lists <a href="http://www.solstation.com/stars.htm" target="_blank">the estimates for B, A, F, K, and M stars within 100 light-years</a> (far right column), and totaling all those (including G) brings us to 3848.</p>
<p>The other two numbers are likely off as well, but to be fair, estimates vary widely. Estimates from <a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/index.html" target="_blank">this site</a> give 260,000 stars in 250 light-years and 80 million stars within 2000 light-years. Scaling those for 500 and 1000 light-years gives us around 2 million and 10 million stars respectively.</p>
<p>Edit: It should be noted that the numbers from <a href="http://www.solstation.com" target="_blank">solstation.com</a> seem to be confirmed stars only. The numbers from <a href="http://www.atlasoftheuniverse.com/" target="_blank">atlasoftheuniverse.com</a> are estimates that keep much closer to the ~3.5 stars per 1000 cubic light-years that applies in the immediate stellar neighborhood. If we use the AotU's numbers to get the approximate number of stars in 100 light-years, we get ~15000, much higher than solstation's 3848. However, solstation's list of M-type stars is said to be incomplete. This makes sense as M-type stars are usually the least luminous. Supposedly, M-type stars are expected to make up 80% of all stars, and since solstation lists almost 2000 non-M-type stars, we'd expect there to be around 8000 corresponding M-type stars. That's 10000 total, much closer to the 15000. If we have 1/3rd of the non-M-type stars left to discover, that brings us up to 15000.</p></div>		</li>
