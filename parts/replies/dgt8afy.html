			<div class="markdown"><p>An impedance it's just a complex resistance so it's false to say it doesn't make heat, it can and in a motor it does. But the back emf limits the current and hence power and hence heat. As speed slows back emf drops, impedance drops, current rises, power rises, heat rises.</p>
<p>You don't have to stop a motor to lower the impedance either, any load on the motor will slow it which reduces back emf and increase current power and heat. My electric lawnmower overheats for example if I get to aggressive with the tall grass.</p>
<p>Compounding the issue is the fact that most motors are air cooled and the slower they turn the less effective the cooling becomes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, thanks - I realize I was taking a shortcut there. But I stand by the conclusion that the electric power that goes into resisting the voltage generated by the motor does not end up as heat in the motor - it ends up as the work being done by the motor.</p>
<p>And yes, as you load down a motor, the back-EMF drops, more current flows, and that higher current means higher resistive losses in the coils. </p>
<p>So, a motor drawing 1 amp from a 100V supply, but generating 90v of back emf, would be using 100W, 90W would be the power output of the motor, and 10W would end up as heat (Doubtless this is gross simplification)</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>As you load down the motor the speed drops which causes the back emf to drop. Back EMF is a function of speed. This causes more current to flow which does increase the total amount of energy lost to resistance but actually reduces the proportion of energy lost to resistance because the higher current also increases the power output of the motor at the shaft.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Nope.</p>
<p>Back EMF is a <em>voltage</em>, not an <em>impedance</em>. It doesn't resist anything, it just changes the effective voltage that the motor sees by countering the supply voltage. Veffective = Vsource - Vbackemf; lowering the voltage lowers the current as per Ohm's law which lowers the power as per Watt's law.</p>
<p>You are correct that most of the <del>power</del> energy consumed dissipated by a spinning motor under load is converted into work; the waste heat comes from the impedance of the coils and also friction and in an air-cooled motor aerodynamic drag.</p>
<p>You're incorrect to assert that back emf has anything to do with the work being done by the motor. back emf is a function of speed and actually reduces the motor's power output as speed rises. this is why electric motors have maximum torque at zero RPM's; no back EMF. They can and do output their highest shaft <del>power</del> torque at their lowest RPMs. This is also why electric motors don't spin up to infinite RPMs.</p>
<p>You can't calculate heat output that way. Heat output in watts will equal Z*I where Z is the impedance of the coils and I is the current flowing through them.  </p>
<p>A 100V motor that draws 1A at START will drop it's current to 0.1A if the back emf rises to 90v.</p>
<p>In a no load condition the back emf will roughly equal the supply voltage; the only work being done is to heat up the bearings and the surrounding air. Current is almost zero.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, I don't think that your last &quot;paragraph&quot; is a good way to think about this. </p>
<p>You should think about the total power transferred to a DC motor as I^2 R. Then, the output power of the motor is based on the efficiency curve which can vary drastically over the motor speed range. </p>
<p>In your example, if generating 100V back emf, then you would achieve the highest power output of the motor of 100W, but this is defeinitely not accurate. The efficiency plummets at the lowest torque ranges where back emf is highest. This makes sense because you would generate no power if there is no load (a condition necessary for the highest back emf).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Well if the impedance in addition to being complex, is purely imaginary, it is a reactance (e.g. capacitor or inductor) and it cannot generate heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I second this post. Over my years of attending scrapheap challenges at the university where we make robots out of printers, this story is not only consistent with the theory but also with the practice. Motors that can't turn can draw much larger currents than when they do. The explanation offered here is also in harmony with that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An old school simple solution for large motors was to use a series of resistors that clutch in and out on a centrifugal clutch.</p>
<p>So on start up the resistors limit the current draw, then once up to speed the clutch shorts the resistors.</p>
<p>There's no point in worrying about what happens if the motor doesn't turn, as it's maximum torque on start, if it doesn't turn then it will never turn. So that part can just be protected by fuses or breakers.</p>
<p>Extra edit: There's a lot of ways thats controlled these days, I just thought I'd add in an elegant old method for fun.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Prevent, or sense?
Preventing damage is easy - slow blow fuse is enough.
Sensing is a bit more difficult. You could meassure the current, you can do this with a shunt resistor (and meassure the Voltage drop across it), like others have said, or something more complicated, like a Hallsensor next to one of the lines.</p>
<p>A nother way of doing it would be to sense the motion of the motor instead of the current. This could be done optically with a lightbarrier or mechanically with a some sort of sliding contact.</p>
<p>Their's a ton of ways of doing it.
Depending on the type of Motor used, the controller knows the RPM without any extra sensing, because it needs to know the Rotor position anyways to control the way it drives the Motor. These tend to shutdown automatically if they can't get the connected motor running).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's called locked rotor amps.    </p>
<p>As the shaft starts to spin, it creates inductance and back EMF, which creates impedance  (resistance to AC flow). That's why initially motors are a resistive load and then quickly turn into an inductive load as shaft speed increases. </p>
<p>Motors burn up with seized shafts because the windings are not sufficiently large gauge to handle LRA for prolonged periods of time.    Each time the motor trips on overload, the insulation on the windings degrades a little bit until it ultimately fails open or shorts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but I would say it's more common to see a PC fan get dusty and have the sleeve bearing gum up or break.  PC fan gets slow -&gt; gums up/bearing breaks -&gt; fan stops -&gt; fan heats up -&gt; fan eventually dies.</p>
<p>Low amp PC fans can sit still for days before being noticed, and can even still be 'active'.  If this happened with a high amp fan I would expect to smell burning.</p>
<p>Also cheap PC fans use sleeved bearings.  Fans using real bearings (ball, 2 ball, fluid) will last much longer and be more resistant to dust.  I just bought 10 cheap fans because they were &lt; $2 per fan and will last a year each.  The packs of good fans were closer to $4 per fan and will last 2-5 years (maybe more).</p></div>		</li>
