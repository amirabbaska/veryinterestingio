<p>Now, most homes and small businesses only need 1 phase </p>

<p>That statement is depend alot of your where you are locates. I many places in Europe 3 phase electric stoves is common and so you often have 3 phase 400V 16A connector for it even in a apartment.</p>
<p>If electricity is used for heating you also need 3 phase to get enough power so 20A 3 phase 230v is common connection to a small house.</p>
<p>The 230V and 400V is the same system because the voltage depend if you use one phase and measure phase to neutral or use 4 phase in a delta configuration so you connect phase to phase and not to neutral.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Gotcha, I guess I was referring to typical US configurations.  In the US it is quite uncommon to have 3 phase residential.  Even our electric based appliances are 1 phase/220v (use the 2 sides of 110v that enter the home).  </p>
<p>I didn't go into this on my explanation above.  Essentially the distribution transformer on the utility pole takes in one phase into a core inside the transformer, next to it there is a winding of wire that transforms this down to 220v, 110v on each  end of the winding, these two wires are fed into the home's electric panel.  These two 110v circuits are 180^(o) out of phase from each other.  The two lines are fed down electric panel as buses and breakers are attached to these bus bars.  Every other row of breakers are on the same bus.  2 pole breakers that span two rows are the 220v circuits that feed our high power consumption appliances like dryers, A/C compressors, electric water heaters, electric ranges, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To deliver high power at relative low current and less wire usage. The amount of wire you need to deliver the same power is lower in a 3 phase system like many EU stow is lower then a 2 phase system like the US stoves.  3 phase is more efficient at the same voltage leves compared to 2 phase.</p>
<p>How electrical system are build is a bit different between countries and if you choose to have one/two phase with high current or 3 phase with lower current.</p>
<p>A US stove often have 40A at 240V. It uses 3  8 AWG wires  so it is 3*13.3mm^2=39.9 mm^2 wire. It looks like the ground wire is smaller so lets just ignore it.  </p>
<p>A europeen 3 phase use 16 amp and the wire has 5 conductor of 2.5mm^2 = 12.5 mm^2</p>
<p>So the amount of metal you need in the wires are lower in 3 phase system compared to a 2 phase. </p>
<p>There is also the difference for that the they are 120V two phase and 230V 3 phase.</p>
<p>With the same voltage and current limit on the wire a 2 phase 100V 10A has a singel 200V load at 10 A so 1<em>200</em>10=2000W and you need 3 thick wires and a ground</p>
<p>A 3 phase 100V 10A system  have sqrt(3)<em>100v= 176 V between the 3 phases at 10A  so a total power of 176</em>3*10=5280W   You will need to ad one wire so you have 4 thick wires.</p>
<p>The result is that you have 3 wires at 2000W or 666w per wire compared to 4 wires and 5280W or 1320 W per wire. Will also need a ground wire so the difference is higher.</p>
<p>So the designe of power system varies around the world.</p></div>		</li>
