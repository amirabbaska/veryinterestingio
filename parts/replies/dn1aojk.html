<p>Think of it in evolutionary terms. Much of our pre-history involves developing trust between people. An untrustworthy person could steal from you, kill you, or otherwise use you for their gain and turn on you when convenient. Earning and demonstrating trustworthiness as a reputation would have been important to survival. Those who proved untrustworthy, such as liars, could be punished, killed, expelled from the tribe, or even just ostracized and not selected as a mate. All these mean they were less likely to survive and reproduce. Those predisposed to fearing being judges as unreliable, and who instinctively acted to protect their reputation, would have reproduced more to pass on their genes.</p>

<p>I'm curious if you know how solid this model is? I always wonder how well evolutionary behavior is &quot;known&quot; vs &quot;supposed&quot;. I'm not disagreeing with you because what you are saying makes perfect sense to me, but I'm not sure what the state of the science is here.</p>
<p>And I ask because it seems to me there are a number of behaviors we have developed which might be good for us over the long term, but might be inferior to more selfish behaviors over a shorter period. Like I can use your same reasoning to infer how societal values against rape arose from the communal benefits, yet I would imagine being pro-rape is actually advantageous for distributing our genes (even if you are subsequently murdered for it). And this line of thought makes me question how reliable this model is considered to be? Perhaps a thorough explanation is a bit much for ELI5, and so this is just a basic overview? If you know...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That explanation is pretty flimsy.... it's from the school of evolutionary psychology, which has a lot of issues.
&quot;Scientists have used evolutionary theory to explain human behavior patterns, such as a female tendency toward monogamy and a male tendency toward promiscuity. However, other researchers argue that such explanations donâ€™t apply well to humans, because the theories stem from stereotypes. Humans behave in complex and variable ways, and factors such as culture strongly influence this behavior. Furthermore, it is difficult to tie variation in behavior to variation in reproductive success. Evolutionary explanations also raise controversy because people can use them to support various social and political agendas.</p>
<p>Some researchers criticize evolutionary explanations because anyone can work backward from an observation to develop an evolutionary explanation. These psychologists point out that the fact that a trait exists does not necessarily mean that trait is adaptive. The trait may have been helpful earlier in our human history but did not remain adaptive, or the trait could be a side effect of another adaptive trait.&quot;<br />
<a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/psychology/psych101/evolutionandgenes/section4.rhtml" target="_blank">Problems with Evolutionary Explanations</a>  </p>
<p>This would be more convincing if you found me a gene that is responsible for &quot;not changing your mind&quot; and then it might stand up, but there's no such gene that we are aware of.  You could make a stronger argument for the opposite perspective, that is, humans are excellent at being mentally adaptive, and have been able to thrive in the most diverse environments of any species. This is true with both simply &quot;changing your mind&quot; in a non-argumentative way (i.e., learning) and also with moral arguments. People don't necessarily change their minds instantaneously, but overall, people's opinions have been steadily changing over time. In the last 20 years opinions on marijuana use, gay marriage, whether or not God exists, have changed slowly, but steadily.  </p>
<p>To me, a better explanation is that historically and culturally, especially in very competitive cultures like in the United States, there is a strong correlation between being &quot;wrong&quot; and &quot;losing.&quot;<br />
<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_h_cohen_for_argument_s_sake" target="_blank">https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_h_cohen_for_argument_s_sake</a>    </p>
<p>So, to recap - There is no real evidence of the evolutionary psychology standpoint to explain complex human behavior. Culturally, especially the competitive culture that we see in many societies, especially in America, rely on a &quot;win/loss&quot; metaphor dichotomy. Many people DO change their minds when presented with new information. People change from religious believers to non-believers, or vice versa all the time. People also slowly change their minds, because challenging beliefs isn't something that happens instantaneously, especially if you are the one &quot;losing,&quot; and beliefs are complicated, and often intertwined with other beliefs. Finally - from an evolutionary standpoint - accepting change, and learning new things is massively more beneficial than being rigid in your beliefs/ideas.  </p>
<p>Edit: this also seems to assume that changing your opinion/belief through argument is the only way that someone can change their opinion/belief.<br />

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well let's use a real world example, vampire bats. When vampire bats go out to hunt for blood at night, the entire brood doesn't go. Some stay back at the nest to take care of the young and conserve energy. On top of that, not every bat is successful in the hunt. So the successful ones will come back and share blood on the premise that when they need that help, it will be reciprocated. A shallow understanding of evolution might dictate that the bat that takes blood from other vampires but won't give any woukd have a competitive advantage, but it doesn't work out that way. If a bat refuses to reciprocate and is proven to be unreliable, the entire brood excludes them and no bats will share with them in the future, which frequently leads to starvation. Being unreliable  would get you killed.</p>
<p>In your example with rape, sure. You <em>may</em> get a person pregnant. However in a small society, even if you don't get killed, that is likely to be your only chance. Let's say the stars align and you get the person pregnant. After that, you'll have no guarantees the mother will even want to raise the child (or other such guarantees to their survival). On the contrary, someone who doesn't rape has the potential of mating repeatedly and propagating their genes more often and has the added benefit of being more likely to ensure the survival of the child. An aversion to rape would be favored in the population because a woman would not want to mate with an inferior genetic specimen and a man would not want to share his mate and dilute the presence of their genes in the pool. Thus the action of rape would be selected against by the society and any potential mates and while the average rapist may get lucky, as a whole their genes aren't being passed down enough as a whole to favor that behavior. Natural selection doesn't always favor shirt term benefits. Because we are social creatures, actions that harm society  but benefit the individual can be ultimately selected against I'm the long term if nothing else than by frequency of propogation.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're ignoring war. A man who joins a peasant army and rapes 200 women in the process of a rampage across Europe might impregnate 25 of them. That's a very good genetic payout ratio, even if he dies in the end and/or his childen are slightly more likely to be excluded from society.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert by any means, but I'm familiar with the Prisoner's Dilemma and vaguely with game theory. My question really was, this model is certainly plausible, but are there other plausible models and how certain are we that <em>this particular</em> model is the correct one?</p>
<p>I understand that it's not an exact science where we can do double-blind studies of behavioral evolution and categorically conclude this as fact - just are their competing models that are widely accepted alternatives, and what happens if we examine OP's very excellent explanation under <em>that</em> lens.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The problem with 'long-term greedy' is that it takes an environment of trust built up over a lifetime to make people comfortable acting that way. You can't do it in a stressful or resource-starved environment, or one with tribal differences.</p>
<p>And unfortunately only small 200 or less person tribes are capable of spontaneously improving their trust levels. Past that size you're unlikely to interact with people often enough for 'long-term greedy' thinking to be a better survival stragety.</p>
<p>In large societies such as modern ones the tend is for less and less trust over time and fracture along political and racial allegiances.</p>
<p>Also unfortunately there's no fix for this problem. Things tend to get worse until society collapses and people <em>have</em> to trust eachother to rebuild it from the ashes. Then they can accomplish great things - look at China's success after it rebuilt from Mao, or America's from the Civil War, or Germany's from WWII.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think we can go even a step further:</p>
<p>In the case of religious believes and political views, it could mean admitting you are wrong but also that the people you trusted where wrong too. </p>
<p>For example, my grandfather told me how this political party was the best all his life. I tended to view it with HIS rose-colored tinted glasses. Even when they got caught in a huge scandal, I tended to say ''it's nothing compared to what other parties did'', and all that. Basically, I took the best from that political party and compared it to the worst of the other parties. </p>
<p>Now, something happened (a friend telling me I was a dumbass) and it forced me to choose between:</p>
<p>1- Keep my views and tell him he was the dumbass.</p>
<p>2- Take the time to think about what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Being a scientist, I chose option 2 and realised that indeed, I was unfair to other parties. But it meant calling my grandfather a liar (or at least not impartial) which was hard because he meant a lot to me and intellectually, he was the person I connected with the most, being the only other person in my family with somewhat of a scientific background (he learned it while working, not in academics).</p>
<p>Telling me I was unfair was pretty easy but blaming someone I trusted for this bias was even harder. In my case it was my grandfather but what if my father, mother, sister, etc. was of the same opinion? Now it would had been really REALLY hard to say you are all liars and I'm not. Therefore I might had chosen the easy way out: my friend is wrong and I'm right!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting point and related to the original answer talking about tying your world view and aspects of your life to a belief system, like clergy or some politicians do.</p>
<p>Your situation is somewhat similar to what happens to people who are raised up in strongly religious communities, where holding a different belief or questioning the fundamental beliefs, would put you at odds with your whole family, friends, and other people you care a lot about. It's a tough situation to be in, and there's no easy way out without causing some struggles along the way or, even, totally screwing up your relationship with some people forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I grew up secular and having an agnostic/atheistic view of the world, rejected any form of religion but I kept an open mind, thinking having an empty slate was the best way to go about my business. But I was somehow fascinated by the Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead. And ofc Stargate SG1 best shit ever to grace the idiot box.</p>
<p>Devoured that show with a passion. Many years passed. I encountered Buddhism. Got interested in the concepts of Bardo. Came across Hinduism and yoga teachings - so much detail in their books about the universe. Thought the whole shebang about Svarupa Shakti was a bit over the top like oh it's all one big dance? I still practice yoga but not as much as I used to.</p>
<p>Later on I did the deed. I took Ayahuasca. Four years ago. I wanted to know more. I felt the knowledge I had gained from reading books was lacking compared to the direct knowledge I heard from taking DMT. So here I go on the Aya trip thinking it would be all fun and games watching a pretty world of kaleidoscopic fractals. I had no idea how much of a ride I was in for. </p>
<p>Drank it. 10 mins later. I'm on my mate's bed. Whoa a screen appears behind my eyes. Similar patterns to what I see when I squeezed my eyeballs as a kid. But there was a sense of intelligence behind the fractals. </p>
<p>Oh wtf is that. A triangle inside triangles? Made of triangles? What it looks like a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Sri_Yantra_256bw.gif/220px-Sri_Yantra_256bw.gif" target="_blank">Sri Yantra</a>. Why the fuck you showing me that shit? And it's in 4D! What I don't even.</p>
<p>Oh there's a squiggly tree spirit elf. WHAT. He looks soo funny. Before I knew what happened I'm laughing my ass off so hard at this thing it was showing me.</p>
<p>That was when I realised my beliefs about the world around me was breaking down. But the ride into the Aya world would not cease. </p>
<p>The screen goes all black. Lines in 60 degrees form towards the center. Another Sri Yantra again! But wait. There's a hexagram in the center too? AND all the chakras forming lined up against the triangles in the Sri Yantra... Why you showing me the chakras? Oh and a meditation man appeared in dayglo color while in lotus pose? <a href="http://iasos.com/artists/alexgrey/Theologue-3.jpg" target="_blank">Hahahahaha you fucking showing me religious tool shit.</a> I did not ask for this.</p>
<p>Whoa he disappeared. Back into the screen. I feel like I'm on a ride into something in the distance in my head. Flames appear from the bottom and a <a href="https://www.metahistory.org/images/DMTdakini.jpg" target="_blank">motherly blobby thingy</a> appears and there's these hearts coming in and out of her.</p>
<p>Ok this is getting a bit creepy. She tells me to come forward. I mentally hesitated and she responds by disappearing back into the screen and a tunnel appears, with 2 intersecting impossible triangles in the center. Lined against the tunnels are interlacing lines and between them crows and monkeys formed. They were feeding into this triangle gateway tunnel. The tunnel became a dome and pushed towards my vision. The triangles grew until it filled the screen. I was like OK whoa that's soooo cooooooool a 4D impossble triangle door thingy? Take me! Taaake meee!</p>
<p>I felt my hands go up. An invisible weight landed on my chest. What. Shit. I can't get up. </p>
<p>Fuck. I'm paralyzed. And strapped onto the bed. </p>
<p>Then the weirdest thing happened. My ass felt like it got penetrated. I couldn't move. I wasn't expecting this at all. The visuals became spiralling ferns of flashing dayglo into pockets of infinity. Whoa. My mind was definitely taken over by this point.</p>
<p>The spirals gave way to hearts. Invading hearts that came right inside my body from where I was being penetrated below into my chest and finally my head. I was inside a spherical grid. The grid was being filled with these diamond shaped heart-eyes. Fingers formed between the hearts and grew to fill in the gaps. I was like where am I? Where am I being taken to? How do I stop this? It felt like I was being penetrated into a thousand pieces by these entities. I mentally ran. The hearts caught up with me. I tried to control them. They had a mind of their own. They kept getting closer and closer. I screamed out &quot;HELP!&quot; My friend was there and he said are you ok? I couldn't stop this. I couldn't do anything. I felt trapped on the bed. Subject to this invasion of this nature invoking heart eyed demon. I gave up. I finally gave up. And let it take over my ego.</p>
<p>I felt an undercurrent grow. I felt like I was being taken underwater. Into a tunnel. Inside that tunnel was a chasm to infinity. I heard the loudest voice ever. It was the most profound voice I ever heard. It spoke into my head. </p>
<p>&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>
<p>I am me.</p>
<p>&quot;NO. Who ARE you?&quot;</p>
<p>I don't know. </p>
<p>Immediately I saw myself as a speck of dust. In the vast universe. A huge prescence was towered above me. I felt insignificant. I felt so small. </p>
<p>&quot;Who am I then?&quot;</p>
<p>Are you God? </p>
<p>&quot;Am I God?&quot;</p>
<p>What</p>
<p>&quot;Am I god.&quot;</p>
<p>What is god</p>
<p>&quot;God is you&quot;</p>
<p>I am God?</p>
<p>&quot;Yes you are&quot;</p>
<p>I am God?</p>
<p>&quot;We all are God&quot;</p>
<p>We?</p>
<p>&quot;You are but the universe could be an imagination of God&quot;</p>
<p>Wait what did you say</p>
<p>&quot;The idea of God is but an imagination in your head&quot;</p>
<p>Wait what</p>
<p>&quot;God thinks the universe is an imagination in his head&quot;</p>
<p>What did you just</p>
<p>&quot;You are God&quot;</p>
<p>But did you just say</p>
<p>&quot;The universe is&quot;</p>
<p>Is what</p>
<p>&quot;The universe is&quot;</p>
<p>God? </p>
<p>&quot;The world is&quot;</p>
<p>God too?</p>
<p>&quot;Your brain is also&quot;</p>
<p>Also what?</p>
<p>&quot;The universe in the mind of God&quot;</p>
<p>Whaaaat??</p>
<p>At that point I was totally bewildered by these truths, and saw my brain repeat itself to infinity. All my beliefs shattered into glass shards in this dialogue I had with this Godhead. I wasn't even sure who I was anymore, just lost in this repeating mirror maze of infinity expanding and contracting on itself. I blacked out. Woke up 6 hours later in a funny fetal like position. I was relieved I was back to my normal self. The next day I felt sick to the stomach as if I was shown too much information. It shook me to the core. </p>
<p>And I spent the next few years trying to resolve this lack of belief. I felt like I was walking around everywhere unable to answer the chicken or egg conundrum that Ayahuasca showed me. So I mentally went to sleep, and tried to treat every moment and every day as if it merely is, and landed in severe depression unable to face what I saw.</p>
<p>It wasn't until recently I finally resolved it. I was able to address the fears that were brought up by Ayahuasca by taking shrooms. I saw my beliefs are mere constructs that the brain uses to understand what is going on and that the ego was simply overriding my sense of self from having gone through the Aya trip. From having a bad trip to having a profoundly awe inspiring trip. I was a changed person from then on and have never looked back since. </p></div>		</li>
