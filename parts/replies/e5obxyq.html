			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone explained to me, and maybe I read in college that the only real important things are the geometry/size of the hole and the upstream pressure. That it's evacuating into a hard vacuum doesn't mean anything really.</p>
<p>Also physicists talk about how hard a vacuum is but what they are really talking about is the amount of residual particles. From a mechanical standpoint they're all the same - minus 14.7 psig/103.4kpag</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, once the flow is choked downstream properties wonâ€™t have any effect on upstream properties or the mass flow rate, until the pressure downstream of the throat is high enough that the flow cannot reach Mach 1 anymore. If downstream pressure is high enough, then flow will unchoke and downstream properties can have an effect on upstream properties. Since the ISS is exhausting to basically a nearly perfect vacuum of basically infinite volume, you can feel pretty confident assuming choked flow. </p></div>		</li>
