			<div class="markdown"><p>There are at least a couple possible explanations for this.</p>
<p>In a coma, a person is not conscious, but that does not mean that the brain is completely inactive. The person might not be able to wake up or be aware of their surroundings at the time, but the brain may still be getting information from the world and storing fragments of it, as these tasks don't require conscious thought.</p>
<p>Also, while the person probably isn't consciously aware of their surroundings during a coma, the brain goes to great lengths to interpret whatever cues it's given in a way that makes sense. The brain of a person coming out of a coma might take context cues, confusing fragments of information, expectations, and familiar stories and construct memories from them to try to make sense of the world, and when these memories are similar to things that might have actually happened, other people notice and confirm those &quot;memories.&quot;</p></div>		</li>
