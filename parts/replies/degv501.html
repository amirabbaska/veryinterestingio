			<div class="markdown"><p>same here ! My mom is jpns. She has dark circles.  i dont remember if they were always there but i only started noticing them in 2004. no matter how much sleep I get i always look tired, regardless if i actually am or not so i guess it is hereditary. I haven't found the right makeup yet to cover it. </p></div>		</li>
