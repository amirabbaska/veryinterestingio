			<div class="markdown"><p>22lbs is 10kg, at 2 meters this will store and release (m x g x h) 200 joules.</p>
<p>200 joules is 0.055WH</p>
<p>So, you can light a 1w led during 3min, 10w during 18 seconds.</p>
<p>Whatever the mechanical trick, it's human power, and as you can see in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4O5voOCqAQ" target="_blank">this video</a> well fed German can't grill a toast.</p>
<p>Even if it's free, i am not sure they are going to use it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good points.  I was taking information directly from the Fast Company article, which appears to have been a little fast and loose with the facts.  On the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gravitylight-2-made-in-africa#/story" target="_blank">IndieGogo page for the current v2 model</a>, they specify that it generates &quot;just under a tenth of a watt&quot; and that &quot;a 6ft drop gives over 20 minutes of light.&quot;  So, yeah, I don't know where the Fast Co. article was getting &quot;hours&quot; from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that is pretty small. The concept is interesting though. If instead you lifted a platform up and then have weights you add on top, just some rocks cut into blocks to stack. That way you don't have to lift a ton but could cumulatively, they could still just be 22 pounds each which practically anybody could lift, but you could get way more potential by just lifting that relatively small a weight several to many times depending on how much power you need. </p>
<p>The material would be pretty cheap, just rocks and a simple machine to convert to power which has already been created and while I've never been to Africa I can't think that a few hundred pounds of rocks would be prohibitively expensive given how much reliable power you could generate for a long time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just replace the weight with a much heavier one and use mechanical advantage achieved through some gearing/pulleys/bock and tackle even to raise the weight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could set up two different simple machines. One to lift 220 Lbs, and one to release that same 220 lbs. The difference would be in the mechanical advantage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Related Question: How efficient could you make a bioreactor that could consume this plant mass for energy without combustion?  Similarly to animal stomachs, but more efficient?  This would allow a variable rate and less insulation required than a furnace.  Seems to me that if you could use this plant material at 90% efficiency with no need for batteries or overflow waste, it would be useful.</p></div>		</li>
