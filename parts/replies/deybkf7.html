			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly wrong. /u/l_the_Alligator has it correct.</p>
<p>There are certain airspaces where you're required to be in contact with air traffic control. Basically, within a certain radius and height of a tower-controlled airport (most airports are not tower-controlled) and above 18,000 feet.</p>
<p>There are also things called &quot;prohibited areas&quot; (such as over the white house), &quot;restricted areas&quot; (such as over military bases), and &quot;TFRs&quot; (such as over sports events, Disneyland, or wherever the president happens to be at the moment.)</p>
<p>Stay out of those places and nobody cares where you go. No flight plan or radio communications required.</p>
<p>Even if you <em>do</em> violate one of those airspaces, the consequences are not fatal. I saw a guy fly through the prohibited area over George Bush's ranch once, while Bush was in residence, and he didn't get shot down. He did get intercepted by fighters, ordered to land, and questioned by the police. And let go that evening with no charges filed.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the Air Defense Identification Zone. Originally, it was a zone all around the U.S. starting a few miles off shore. Now it also includes some airspace around Washington D.C.. If you fly into the ADIZ without a flight plan, you will be intercepted by fighters, but unless you do something really hinky, you won't be shot down.</p>
<p>Aside: look for a document called the 'Aviator's Information Manual' (AIM). It's probably online in pdf form nowadays. Probably at faa.gov. All these procedures are described there.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you refused to land when they signaled you to do so yes. The risk of damage that your wreckage would cause is lower than the risk of damage you refusing to comply indicates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Stay low (like 500ftAGL low) and avoid any towered airports. You're going to have to disable any ADS-B equipment, and turn off the mode C transponder. You'll need to avoid other radar towers, I only know of the ones in my area, but if your that low, you're only showing up briefly.</p></div>		</li>
