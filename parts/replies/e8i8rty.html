<p>A nearly intact Mitsubishi Zero was recovered by the US forces in 1942. It was flight tested and it was found that, amongst many other things, it could be rolled  much more easily to the left than to the right. Dog fighting tactics were modified accordingly.</p></div>		</li>

The first ever deployment of a &quot;special forces&quot; unit, recovery of the first intact Zero and the <del>only</del> first deployment of conscripted Canadian soldiers in WWII, which shaped the politics in Canada pretty heavily after the war. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually on some planes this was exploited as a part of combat tactics too - Sopwith Camel was famous for its tight turns when turning to the right where the engine torque assisted it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was more due the the gyroscopic effects of their <em>rotary</em> engines. Unlike radials where fixed pistons turning a crankshaft turns a prop, in a rotary engine the entire engine block is bolted to the propeller and spins around a fixed crankshaft, that amount of spinning mass generated serious gyroscopic torques.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I’m educated correctly, <em>most</em> Spitfires had a right-hand prop but the Mk XIV had a left-hand one. A famous NZ pilot, Tim Wallis, was flying his Mk XIV, (having already flown the XVI) took off and stamped on the wrong rudder, flipped the plane and skidded down the runway on his head.</p>
<p>He survived, with half a head and loss of most of his capacity, now needing 24/7 care.</p>
