			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not one to defend the bible much, but &quot;round&quot; is not the same as &quot;exactly circular&quot;. Looking at Dictionary.com, of the many definitions laid out, number 7 is &quot;free from angularity; consisting of full, curved lines or shapes, as handwriting or parts of the body.&quot; So, a curved arc could be round and have any non-circular dimensions. Of course, this passage has been translated but I imagine the original is not attempting to make a precise mathematical statement about circles, either.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, I doubt the passage was meant to be an exact measurement, but more of a general description. And &quot;it was about yea big&quot; <em>holds out hands</em> doesn't sound fancy enough. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not at all, most measurements in the Bible are approximates. Even funnier though is when translations fuck things up, like with the story of David and Goliath, where the translations place him as this giant 15 feet high, but the original puts it more around 6 foot 9.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and given the sizes incolved and accuracy of the measurement, I'd say its a pretty reasonably accurate description of a round-ish object, even though it all may be fiction.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>His point is that e\^(i*pi) + 1 = 0 no longer holds when using tau (it'd be e\^(i*tau/2) + 1 = 0). Honestly though, that formula working out is more of a coincidence than an important mathematical property. The important mathematical property behind it is that e\^(i*x) = e\^(i*(2pi + x)), which, again, would be nicer with tau. That, and basically every formula in physics involving pi. Honestly, if history could be rewritten, tau is the objectively better choice for pi. But, because history can't be rewritten, and we've all gotten used to pi and the downsides by now, I guess we'll just keep on using it.</p>
<p>There's a lot of these &quot;unlucky&quot; definitions and representations in maths, but even with different definitions, our results will not be different so often there's no point to switch now anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That can be rewrtten as e^(it) = 1. Still coincidentally pretty. Can be solved for zero if you want to include zero into the party.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But that property can be easily drived from e^(pi i)=-1 (since e^(x+2pi i)= e^x e^(2pi i)=e^x).</p>
<p>I'd argue that the more general property e^(ix)=cos x + i*sin x is much more important, since it clearly shows the connection between complex exponentiation and the unit circle.</p></div>		</li>
