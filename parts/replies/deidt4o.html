			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it mostly is.  Your biology is normally very resilient and able to repair a wide variety of damages at various levels without batting an eye.  However, if your DNA is damaged by radiation by such means as hard to repair double strand breaks, you've essentially wiped out the &quot;blue print&quot; that would be used to execute the repairs in the first place.  Every minute, every hour, parts of your DNA is being read by cells in order to make the proteins that keep things chugging along smoothly.  If such instructions are sufficiently shredded, your cells would no longer produce even the basic things that carry out routine metabolic functions.  Under such conditions, yes - cells, tissue, and organs will begin failing in a matter of hours with death following in days.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its also worth mentioning that cells can detect DNA damage and then commit suicide. </p>
<p>Even if the DNA is still 95% intact, the cell's DNA damage sensors may detect the double-strand breaks that have occured and trigger apoptosis. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everything in a cell is damaged, not just DNA, but because most things in a cell like proteins are redundant and easily replaced we usually don't care about that damage.  DNA is harder to repair and replace, so that's what we usually care about in terms of damage.</p>
<p>However, you're right, if the doses are high enough (hundreds+ of Gy) the bulk damage to the structure of the cell can be enough to kill it outright. For example the cell wall can fall apart and the cell just spills open.</p>
<p>As far as I know, nobody has ever gotten a dose of radiation large enough to kill them this way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;decayed stuff&quot; is the smaller bits the larger, unstable, radioactive particle broke into.</p>
<p>Some of it is in the form of energy (e.g. gamma rays &amp; x-rays), which comes from the energy required to hold the larger piece together. Because it is unstable (think &quot;contains too much stuff to hold together&quot;) it really wants to get rid of that energy and drop to a lower overall energy state. That energy is released to the environment when the bonds holding the big piece together are broken, but eventually absorbed by what it meets along the way. Think of it like sound waves at a rock concert. Being closer to the speakers will damage your eardrums, but a mile away won't do a thing, even though you are still getting hit with some of the music wave energy at that distance. Increasing distance between you and a radioactive source is your best defense to that radiation. Because it is energy, it can be difficult to block.</p>
<p>Some of it is actual tiny particles like alpha &amp; beta radiation. The particles themselves are not radioactive but can be released with some relatively high energy of motion, i.e. moving really fast, and when they physically crash into slower particles, some damage is likely if those particles are susceptible to it. But just like a golf ball launched at 200 mph, these particles will eventually come to a stop, at which point they pose no more threat. Alpha particles only travel a few inches at best and can be completely stopped by a sheet of paper. Beta travels a few meters but can also be blocked relatively easily.</p>
<p>Some pieces from the larger radioactive particle can themselves be radioactive. This is what happens in a reactor or explosion. But then these pieces go through the process described above as they start to break into alpha, beta, gamma, neutron, or x-ray radiation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When an atom decays, it just loses a tiny piece as a particle that is ejected from it. The particle goes on its merry way, usually hits something else eventually (some particles decay into other particles after awhile). The original atom is still there, just slightly changed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But I got a bit more curious: </p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li>What are the factors that decide if an atom is/becomes 'stable' or 'unstable'?</li>
</ul>
<p>Does that question even make sense or am I far off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The question makes plenty of sense; it's one of the fundamental questions in nuclear physics. But the answer is very complicated.</p>
<p>First of all, just some terminology to define. An &quot;unstable&quot; nuclide is one which decays. A &quot;stable&quot; nuclide is one which <em>never</em> decays, as far as we know.</p>
<p>Unstable nuclides decay because they can reach a state of lower mass (higher binding energy) per nucleon without violating any conservation law. This is the &quot;totalitarian principle&quot;; that anything which <em>can</em> decay <em>will</em> do so.</p>
<p>Now that the terminology is out of the way, we can talk about physics. What are the possible kinds of nuclear decays, and when do they tend to happen?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alpha: The nucleus emits a ^(4)He nucleus. This happens in heavy nuclei. In fact <strong>all</strong> nuclei above a certain point will in principle be unstable to alpha decay. Why are alpha particles so convenient to spit out? Because they are very tightly-bound, they have no spin, and relatively low charge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cluster emission: This is not a particularly common decay mode, but I place it after alpha decay because they're fundamentally the same process. You can think of alpha decay as a special case of cluster decay, where the cluster is an alpha particle. In general, cluster decay is when a nucleus spits out some cluster of particles. There are a few observed cases, a notable one being ^(14)C emission. But for the reasons I gave above, alpha particles are the most favorable cluster to emit in the vast majority of cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spontaneous fission: This is another process more or less identical to the above two, but more complicated. Fission is sort of like a cluster emission, but instead of some very heavy nucleus spitting out a light cluster, the nucleus splits into &quot;halves&quot; (it's not usually half and half, but regardless both fragments tend to be heavy). Physically, it's the same process as above. You have some potential energy holding the two &quot;halves&quot; together, and they quantum tunnel out of the potential well, leaving behind two unbound fragments. Just like alpha and cluster decay, this happens in very heavy nuclei. Particuarly deformed heavy nuclei, where the fission barrier (the energy needed to overcome in order for fission to occur) is small.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proton emission: Again, fundamentally the same process as above. A particle tunnels out of the nucleus. But this time, it's just a single proton (two-proton decays have also been observed). But this doesn't happen in very heavy systems necessarily, instead it happens in systems with very large Z/N. Think about it, you know that every element has some number of isotopes. The stable isotopes tend to be in the vicinity of Z/N = 1 (or a little lower for heavy nuclei). But what about very exotic isotopes like helium-2 (2p,0n), carbon-8 (6p,2n), or any other with many more protons than neutrons? These are so far from stability that beta decay (to be discussed later) doesn't even cut it. They would rather simply spit out one or more protons to get their Z/N back to a reasonable number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neutron emission: Similar for the proton case except at high N/Z. In this case the lifetimes tend to be even shorter because there's no Coulomb barrier to trap the neutron (although there may still be a centrifugal barrier). Extreme systems like hydrogen-7, helium-10, etc. would like to decay by emitting one or more neutron. Particles with extreme Z/N or N/Z which would rather decay by nucleon emission than beta decay lie outside the <em>driplines</em>. That means that if you try to add another nucleon to the nucleus, it simply &quot;drips&quot; off.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beta: There are three kinds of beta decay, beta-plus, beta-minus, and electron capture. Beta-minus happens in nuclei with N/Z large, but not past the dripline. A neutron becomes a proton, emitting an electron and antineutrino. Beta-plus and EC happen in nuclei with Z/N large, but not past the dripline. In the former case a proton becomes a neutron, emitting a positron and neutrino. In the latter case, the nucleus grabs an s-wave electron from the electron cloud, and turns a proton into a neutron, emitting a neutrino. EC is an interesting process because it's one of the rare cases where the electron cloud can influence the nucleus. If there are no electron around, there's no possibility for EC to happen.</p>
</li>
<li>Electromagnetic decays: There are a number of possibilities, the most common being gamma decay, internal conversion, and pair creation. These happen between excited states (or excited to ground) in a single species. They do not transmute the nucleus, meaning you start with one species and end with the same species. Gamma decay is just the emission of a photon. IC is giving th excitation energy of the nucleus to an atomic electron. This almost always results in the electron being kicked out of the nucleus with a definite kinetic energy. Pair creation happens in high energy decays, where instead of producing a gamma ray, the decay can actually create an electron/positron pair. The reason for these decays is obvious: an excited nucleus wants to reach its ground state. If we're just considering the stability of ground states, this is irrelevant, but you can't just talk about the details of nuclear decay and not mention electromagnetic decays.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now looking back at all those kinds of decays and under what situations they occur, I think it should be clear that stable nuclei are very very special. There are about 7000 nuclides predicted to exist. About 3000 of them have been observed. Less than 300 are stable.</p>
<p>So if N/Z is too far from 1 in either direction, the nucleus will be unstable to beta decay. Go out further to the driplines and you'll see nucleon emission. Go to high A and you'll find alpha, cluster, and spontaneous fission. Only a very special select few nuclides are stable. Why are they stable? Because they don't decay. Why don't they decay? Because the intricate balance of forces inside the nucleus (strong, electromagnetic, and weak) happens to like that particular configuration for some reason.</p></div>		</li>
