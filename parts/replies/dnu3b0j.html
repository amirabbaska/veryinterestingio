			<div class="markdown"><p>Flying in Japan <strong>is</strong> a luxury, because they have the bullet train and extremely well maintained public transportation. There's almost no incentive to fly unless you are moving from Honshu to one of the other islands, and even then you can stay on the bullet train. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was on vacation in Japan last month and the bullet train is pretty expensive, actually cost more than a flight would.</p>
<p>Took it Tokyo-Kyoto for the novelty and because Kyoto doesn't have an airport. Took Osaka-Tokyo flight on the way back and it was less than half the cost of the train.</p>
<p>Train was like $120, flight was 4500 British Airways Avios and $2.62. Even if I didn't use points for the flight would have been like $75.</p>
<p>Honestly the skinkansen seems like more of a luxury with it's pricing, but you don't need to buy those tickets in advance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I flew with ANA 5 weeks ago and I can vouch for that experience. The service is good and the overall experience is just like you said, enjoyable. The trip was from Jakarta-Tokyo, a 7h 30m flight duration, roughly US$ 375 for round trip.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m from Indonesia which is where Garuda come from. They are the most expensive local airline with average cost per trip about US$ 60-110 on low season and US$ 200 on high season for a 1.400-ish kilomeres flight. The experience is only half of what I get with ANA.</p></div>		</li>
