			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had a very wet plant catch fire, could it be relatively unarmed for the first few seconds?  </p>
<p>I'm trying to imagine a scenario where a damp swamp is on fire. </p>
<p>Would it have been possible for wet things to be <em>on</em> fire, without actually breaking down very much (for at least a few more seconds). Like, could a <em>wet</em> plant be on fire, and not be breaking down?  Or would it have to be dried by the nearby flames first, and then burnt once dry?</p>
<p>I'm a little baked, so I'm sorry if this formatting is a little confusing</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So leaf temperature is important for plant health, once leaf temperature gets above 40oC the internal leaf cellular structure breaks down. The high oxygen content allows for the combustion of even very wet vegetation. A plant could survive being on fire for a small period of time, but once internal leaf temperature gets above 40oC the plant starts to die, quickly. </p>
<p>Wet things don't &quot;burn&quot; but yes the dead vegetation would be burnt and decomposed, this is where we get the charcoal data from.</p></div>		</li>
