			<div class="markdown"><p>That gets brought up in a lot but my money is still on the c4 plants as they preform well in many different conditions as they can sequester CO2 so rubisco can work faster instead of loosing it throw normal respiration and diffusion like c3. Though the c3-c4 intermediate plants could be a contender as they have aspects of both systems. Though even with increasing carbon pressure  if it gets too hot then plants still suffer a penalty as they still need to protect their photosystems through quenching. Though the field is a bit divided on how global warming should be addressed in regards to crops, some feel that plants will benefit from higher co2 and higher temperatures as suggested by the model, I'm more on the camp that we need plants that can react rapidly to changing conditions (which plants are pretty quick anyway).</p></div>		</li>
