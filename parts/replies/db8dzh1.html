			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Atheism still isn't very common, but it especially wasn't back then. The problems people faced were being told by their government (usually a monarch) what religion they had to practice and how. Imagine being told today that our country is Catholic, and you can't practice anything allowed by Protestants, like divorce or birth control. </p>
<p>Our government is set up in a way that it can't set up a church. It can't endorse a church. Similarly, a church can't run our government. It can't endorse political candidates. In the US, they are separate, and that separation protects us all.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, the term &quot;God&quot; doesn't endorse a religion, even though not everyone believes in one god--including some religious people, like Hindus. Think of it like whatever &quot;God&quot; means to you--whether it's a religious creator or mother nature. They're not saying, &quot;In the Catholic God we trust.&quot; </p>
<p>In time, as people become more secular, it wouldn't surprise me if that motto is eventually removed from currency. But, for now, it stays because it doesn't violate our rights and doesn't endorse a specific religion.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or, at least, change it to a lower case &quot;g&quot; and add an &quot;s&quot; in brackets at the end, and then put the entire word in quotation marks. </p>
<p>Let's not kid ourselves; the courts may have decided that, written as is, it is broad enough to not establish any particular religion, but the intent of those who added that line to the currency was most certainly to affirm and enforce their Christianity on the rest, since at the time Christianity was considered as an opposing force to the USSR and communism. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but... The phrase is overtly religious even if we pretend that it refers to no specfic group of religions. The simple answer is that the US is about as secular as North Korea is actually the peoples republic. No offience to the US of course, most countries have identity problems like this. Its no big deal, really.</p>
<p>Edit: And the primary reason people have a hard time accepting this is because they can't accept that all these things are on a sliding scale. It's not like a country flicks a switch to be either secular or a teocracy. ALL countries are somewhere in the middle. There is not a single 100% secular country in this world. However, many countries strive to have a high level of secularization.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well it <em>wouldn't</em> be a big deal <em>if</em> we didn't know exactly what religion they're promoting and said religion weren't constantly used to influence policy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. Or atleast if people didn't try and pretend like nothing is going on here, like many people in these comments. I mean, you cant work for more secularization if people are like drones constantly repeating &quot;we are perfectly secularized&quot;. It just boggles my mind that people would say such an obvious lie. There are more secularized countries in the world than the US, how is that hard to accept?</p></div>		</li>
