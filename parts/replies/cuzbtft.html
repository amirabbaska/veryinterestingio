			<div class="markdown"><p>Check out the comment by /u/Beijendorf that links to a paper discussing high frequencies. It reports that while there are a few reported cases of hearing loss in workers that experience ultrasonic noise, the literature is not conclusive since there may have been other factors. </p>
<p>In general though, our high frequency hearing is more sensitive to damage than low-frequency hearing, which is why these frequencies tend to go first with aging. So it may be difficult to tease apart reports of high-frequency hearing loss potentially caused by ultrasonic frequencies vs. normal aging effects.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To produce sub 20hz frequencies greater than 120+ decibels is extremely difficult. Not to mention it would be very noticeable. </p>
<p>believe me alot of people wish it was easy to get those low frequencies at a decent SPL.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That doesn't negate my point. OP asked if it was possible, not how often it happens.</p>
<p>As to whether they're noticeable, both reviews I linked to discussed this. People often report feeling these sounds, and they can even cause aural pain (e.g. bursting the eardrum)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not difficult, just inefficient.</p>
<p>And it would not be noticeable because almost nobody can hear &lt;20Hz.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is it not difficult?</p>
<p>you can hear it if it is loud enough.</p>
<p>and you can definitely feel it.</p></div>		</li>
