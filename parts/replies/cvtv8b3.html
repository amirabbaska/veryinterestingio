			<div class="markdown"><p>This is about right. NSs have considerable equatorial bulges from rotation. With a first order approximation of setting the surface gravity of a spherical mass equal to the centripetal acceleration you can find the Keplerian breakup frequency quite easily - for a 12km 1.4 solar mass NS it's about 4100 Hz, <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=+sqrt%282*pi*%2812+km%29%2F+%28Gravitational+Constant+*+1.4+Solar+masses+%2F+%2812+km%29^2+%29%29" target="_blank">or a rotational period of 242 microseconds.</a> That's an overestimate of course. </p>
<p>Centrifugal force is in the neighborhood of 10% of the surface gravity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Spinning blackholes and neutron stars have been postulated to cause &quot;frame dragging&quot; in the highly curved spacetime in their immediate vicinity. Not sure I've ever completely understood what that means but thought it had to do with space actually being dragged along with the rotation of the object in a proportion to the distance from the object. Intuitively, this sounds like, from the perspective of an observer on the surface of the neutron star, they would not appear to be spinning as rapidly as we see the rotation from a distance because the space above the star is dragged along with the rotation of the star. Is this a correct interpretation of frame dragging? If so, what does that mean for centripetal acceleration? Would it &quot;feel&quot; less strong due to the frame dragging?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The name &quot;frame dragging&quot; makes it sound more awesome than it really is.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I think the dominant effect caused by frame dragging is precession. For example, gravity probe B observed this by measuring the precession of the angular momentum of a gyroscope on a satellite orbiting in the earth. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had never thought about the gravitational acceleration on the surface of a neutron star before. </p>
<p>1.8 TRILLION m/s^2 is insane. </p>
<p>At that acceleration, it would take only 0.166 MILLISECONDS to accelerate to the speed of light. Which would happen over only 31 miles. </p>
<p>Which makes me wonder - what would the gravitational acceleration be at 31 miles from the surface? How far would something have to be to from the surface to be pulled in in one second? (If <em>c</em> weren't the limit, and the force continued at that power all the way out, that would pull something from the orbital distance of Jupiter in one second!)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you're four times as far from the centre as the surface is, the gravitational acceleration is 1/4^2 = 1/16 times as strong.</p>
<p>Because maximum infall speed is the same as escape velocity, an object where you would classically reach the speed of light by falling in, is a black hole.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is only if you're stationary with respect to the body before you start experiencing its pull. If you throw a tennis ball through space at the moon fast enough, you can get it to hit the surface faster than the moon's escape velocity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This isn't exactly correct. Firstly you wouldn't get to the speed of light. Ever. You didn't perform relativistic equations. Anyway, it is really insane. The escape velocity is certainly a sizable fraction of the speed of light though.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly. The analogy works, but it would be more like a boat that had to avoid a single mine in many, many oceans. The distance between stars varies depending on the location in the galaxy (closer together towards the center), but on average it's something like 6 light years, with occurrences like neutron stars being relatively rare.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/cosmology-and-astronomy/universe-scale-topic/scale-earth-galaxy-tutorial/v/scale-of-distance-to-closest-stars" target="_blank">This video</a>, if you skip to about 4:30, gives a good idea of the scale involved.</p>
<p>Unless there are other unknown hazards in space, we would be able to navigate around things like neutron stars quite easily already. The only problem is that old age would kill us all before we could reach even the nearest star...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you are going to hit a neutron star, then you're more likely to hit regular stars, since they have so much more volume. Neutron stars have the same effect at the center of a solar system that our own Sun has. If you got within 100 mi of the center of the Sun, I'm sure you'd have problems on a scale similar to getting that close to a neutron star.</p></div>		</li>
