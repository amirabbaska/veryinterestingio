<p>Another thing to remember is that government weather covers larger areas from a specific point, while WUnderground is using more, smaller weather stations, which may be closer to you. </p>
<p>I've frequently seen where it rains on only one side of the street. So if your weather station is in the middle of that street, what do you report? </p></div>		</li>
