			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm no canologist, but I'd say the bitterness is a product of the sterilization step, which I assume is typically boiling/heating.  Vegetables get kinda bitter when cooked, so I don't know if glass canning (glassing?) would be immune to the effect.</p>
<p>Other methods of sterilization (from Wikipedia):
<em>&quot;To prevent the food from being spoiled before and during containment, a number of methods are used: pasteurisation, boiling (and other applications of high temperature over a period of time), refrigeration, freezing, drying, vacuum treatment, antimicrobial agents that are natural to the recipe of the foods being preserved, a sufficient dose of ionizing radiation, submersion in a strong saline solution, acid, base, osmotically extreme (for example very sugary) or other microbially-challenging environments.&quot;</em></p></div>		</li>
