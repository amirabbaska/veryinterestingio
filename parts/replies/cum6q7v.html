			<div class="markdown"><p>They may very well have used base-12 for some things - this is why we have the 12-hour day/night cycle, likely a holdover from the Egyptians by way of the Greeks. A Roman abacus, however, uses a base-10 system. Both of these things made their way into the middle ages and on to us, as did the old Mespotamian base-60 system. Ifrah theorizes the base-60 may have developed in ancient civilizations by counting the 12 knuckles of your fingers with the 5 digits of your other hand (5 x 12 = 60). This helped the Babylonians to divide the year into a nice neat (and surprisingly accurate for the time) 360 days, as well as dividing the sky into 12 distinct parts that eventually became various zodiac calendars.</p>
<p>Medieval people, of course, saw 12 as a good things because of Christ's 12 disciples -- though if you want to go tin-foil numerologist you might argue all these 12s are connected beginning with a 3 x 4 x 5 sided right triangle. Numerology is fun, but sometimes reads like a Dan Brown novel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is so god damn interesting I love it. It's funny how we simply take for granted the whole seconds/minutes/hours/days being in some 60/60/24/360 style format despite the difficulty in converting to some form of decimal.</p>
<p>Perhaps the people who developed such a format for time keeping were not the same people who needed to use counting fingers for a quick and universal counting system for trade (an abacus e.g.), hence the two systems were never really in conflict so both endured.</p>
<p>You're right though it does read like a Dan Brown novel. The more I think about it base-12 would make so many things so much easier these days however.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I commented about Base-60 usage with ancient peoples:</p>
<p>From pages 21-22 of Petr Beckmann's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/A-History-Pi-Petr-Beckmann/dp/0312381859/" target="_blank">A History of PI</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and states that the ratio of the perimeter of a regular hexagon to the circumference of the circumscribed circle equals a number which in modern notation is given by 57/60 + 36/(60)^2 (the Babylonians used the sexagesimal system, i.e. their base was 60 rather than 10).</p>
<p>The Babylonians knew, of course, that the perimeter of a hexagon is exactly equal to six times the radius of the circumscribed circle, in fact that was evidently the reason why they chose to divide the circle into 360 degrees (and we are still burdened with that figure to this day).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I've heard about the Mesopotamian base-60 system before, but 60 is such a big number. Did they have a unique name for each number 1-59? Why 60? It just seems like such a big and clunky number to me.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Worth noting though that we have 12 finger bones in each hand though.  If you use your thumb to point to each one to count, you get to 12.  Then if you keep track of each set of twelve with one finger on your other hand, you get to base 60.  Seems to have worked alright for the Sumerians.</p>
<p>That being said, I don't think people have suggested relic of a base 12 system in Germanic languages.  Insular Celtic languages are base 20 though, and that may be the origin of many of the base 20 terms in English (ie score, stone, yan tan tethera), and that itself may have been a borrowing from some pre-Indoeuropean language.</p></div>		</li>

<p>From the &quot;Numberphile&quot; channel on youtube.  It explains base-12, then there is also some light historical information provided regarding its usage (especially with regard to weights/measures/currency); as well as a breakdown of how people can count in base-12 on their hands with ease.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;-ty&quot; suffix used to be &quot;-tig&quot; in Old English, which was used to refer to decades or grouping of tens. So <em>twen-tig</em> = two-tens,  <em>þritig</em> = three-ten, and so on -- these were taken from older Germanic/Gothic forms. Old English usually continues in this way the same way they do for 1-12, <em>Twelftig</em> = 120 (twelve-ty), however Old English is a little funky and often adds the prefix <em>hund-</em> for 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120 before switching to <em>hund/hundred__XXXX</em>. This suggests the influence of a base-12 system.</p>
<p>In addition, in the middle ages, a &quot;stone&quot; wasn't usually 20 lbs., it often varied depending on what commodity was being traded and where it was being traded. A stone of wool was different than a stone of lead; a &quot;stone&quot; (often a literal stone) was a way to help standardize the weight of things, whatever its objective mass happened to be. The earliest attestation to a &quot;stone&quot; as a weight is the around 1400, according to the Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
<p>Finally, although a £1 = 20s (shilling), 1s usually = 12d (pence, the &quot;d&quot; is from the Roman penny, the <em>denarius</em>). Also, a pound of silver was originally 12 oz. (ounce means &quot;twelfth part&quot;), still used today to measure precious metals as troy weight. So while counting things by 20 may have had some Celtic origins, 12 seems to have a larger place in English counting -- £1 is often referred to as 240d in manuscripts, rather than 20s.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: The <em>OED</em> says &quot;score&quot; is of Old Norse descent, but did usually mean 20.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Generally you only see the subtractive method with duodeviginti and undeviginti (18 and 19), though in occasion with other numbers. </p>
<p>Edit: 18 &amp; 19's &quot;normal&quot; form are octodecem and novemdecem, though these are rarely seen. </p></div>		</li>
