			<div class="markdown"><p>They actually can test for more than chromosomal abnormalities now. In some cases, if it is known that one parent has a specific harmful gene, but potentially one copy of the bad version and one copy of the good version, they can use the biopsy to test for the presence of that specific harmful gene in the embryo.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. Previously, you couldn't do whole gene sequencing in this case because of the small size of the biopsy from a 5-day embryo (just a few cells).</p>
<p>Apparently whole gene sequencing of such a small biopsy was done successfully in 2015. It's not clear to me whether the process is publicly available yet.</p></div>		</li>
