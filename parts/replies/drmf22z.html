			<div class="markdown"><p>It's also noteworthy to say genetics are a big factor. The pear shaped body type (hips and thighs) actually leads to a substantially lesser risk of diabetes and heart disease than the apple shaped body type (stomach and shoulders) when comparing two people of the same BMI. The idea behind this is because the blood circulation in the stomach areas carries fat deposits directly into portal (liver) circulation, whereas the hips and thighs circulation has to go out to the extremities and then directly into the inferior vena cava. So the fat deposits take more time to get to the liver to cause destruction. Something I recently learned in my medical school biochemistry class. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I mean, you would still be getting X amount of fat per minute, regardless of how long it took to get there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another factor on top of all that is that we tend to store fat in the places where we already store it (existing fat cells get filled up before new fat cells are created). So e.g. if you go through a stressful period and put on a lot of belly fat, even if you lose that weight later your body will still tend to prefer putting fat on your belly. Similarly, the fat distribution you develop as a child will tend to stick with you throughout your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How can this be true?</p>
<p>If someone demonstrably accumulates fat on the hips, loses it and goes through a stressful period then he/she is not gaining fat this time in the belly in the same spot.</p>
<p>If this person has never been fat then the belly accumulation is also not where fat was before.</p>
<p>If a person has fat in the belly and loses weight and regains it, then it would seem this is just where the person accumulates fat.</p>
<p>Do you have a citation I can read?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I cannot recall where i had read this : That a person gains all the fat cells? they would have at end of puberty/ at maturity, that fat storage in these would expand to hold more fat, but not creat new ones. Could anyone explain this or correct me? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is similar logic as to why artherosclerotic changes are more dominant on the left arm va right arm. Left arm is closer to systemic circulation vs the right one.</p>
<p>The blood pressure readings are different, by sometimes as much as 10 points on the left vs right. Sometimes when pt. is asymptomatic for hypotension but the numbers are whacky, I'll re-re-do it on the left.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>do you know what it was about early HIV meds that resulted in such extreme cases of permanent lipodistrophy? I remember working with adults who had been on meds since the 90s and men tended to have a large fat deposit on their upper back, with none stored on the arms and legs. Women tended to store it all in their stomach much they way men do normally.</p>
<p>As  a result all the men looked ripped, except they had a hunchback and all the women looked very skinny but pregnant. The very unlucky lost the fat in their cheeks making some folks almost unrecognisable. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So u/niroby is right to point out that chronic corticosteroid use can lead to a Cushingoid habitus. However, if I understand your question correctly, you're noting a phenomenon known as HIV protease inhibitor lipodystrophy syndrome. HIV protease functions to cleave newly synthesized polyproteins to create the mature protein components of an infectious HIV virion. Protease inhibitors block this function, rendering the virus unable to assemble essential viral proteins correctly, making the newly synthesized virions uninfectious duds. </p>
<p>The lipodystrophy syndrome may be a result of the inhibition of 2 proteins involved in human lipid metabolism that have significant homology to the catalytic site of HIV protease-namely, cytoplasmic retinoic acid binding protein type 1 and low density lipoprotein-receptor-related protein. What this means is that these human enzymes &quot;look&quot; a whole lot like the HIV enzyme, and so the protease inhibitor has a bleedover effect of blocking a little human enzymatic activity as well. Because these human enzymes are involved in fat molecule manufacture, transport and deposition, ultimately this inhibition causes some fat redistribution. The buffalo hump, facial lipoatrophy, and abdominal girth all look a bit like what is seen in Cushing's, but is the result of a different process. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Corticosteroids likely. <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/cushings-syndrome/symptoms/#weight-gain-and-fat-deposits" target="_blank">Cushing's patients have a very classic style of fat deposition</a>. If your cortisol levels get all fucky then you see similar fat deposits. </p>
<p>For the women, my guess would be low estrogen/higher testosterone as well. Because that's what leads to that style of fat accumulation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Let’s propose just hypothetically that HIV doctors did recognize the dangers of using corticosteroids with an immune-destroying virus and perhaps didn’t prescribe them to patients in which this was contraindicated. Then maybe we could arrive at the original question, that of why antiretroviral therapy posed (and still poses) a risk of lipodystrophy. Anyone have an actual answer rather than counterintuitive associative conjecture?</p></div>		</li>
