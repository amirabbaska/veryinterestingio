			<div class="markdown"><p>Your intuition about what you ought to see is correct, for gravitational lenses which are perfectly uniform and perfectly in the way of the object you're seeing an image of. A black hole directly in the path between you and a very bright object would result in you seeing a continuous ring of light.</p>
<p>Most of the gravitational lenses astronomers have been able to collect images from are galaxies, and galaxies come in many shapes which aren't <a href="http://sings.stsci.edu/Publications/sings_3col/sings_3col.jpg" target="_blank">spherical</a>. The lenses we're seeing images through aren't uniform, so the images they reflect aren't uniform. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.robotroom.com/IRTest/Flir/Magnifying-glass-burning-stick-visible.jpg" target="_blank">Here is an image</a> which shows what you get when sunlight passes through a lens onto a surface and isn't focused in just a certain way: There's one very bright spot and one slightly less bright spot, because the light happens to be deflected that way by that shape of lens in that orientation. (That example doesn't have much in common with the gravitational lenses we've seen, aside from being nonuniform and creating a nonuniform image)</p>
<p>Galaxies, being shaped like galaxies instead of like magnifying glasses, tend to produce other numbers of images, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Cross" target="_blank">Einstein Cross</a> pattern.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, let's start at the beginning. The supernova occurs, releasing light in all directions. Because we're so far away, the light has been gravitationally accelerated/decelerated(relative to us, through bending at different angles) many times. </p>
<p>I would say it's conceivable that after being bent so many times, gaps in arrival times occur.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that Hubble only needs to observe the supernova for a certain period to get a clear image, and so a ring would never appear in an image produced by Hubble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not a perfect lens and its not perfectly aimed at the target galaxy where the supernova occurred. This means we only get some of the photons from the supernova that passed by/through the lens galaxy and the rest are shot off in other directions. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Quick question, how do people know that those lights came from the same source? I imagine even for the most power telescope, those lights would only be visible as a tiny rays of light, maybe a few dozens pixels in terms of the digital picture. Is there any other information that they can measure to differentiate these &quot;lights&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes! </p>
<p><a href="http://hubblesite.org/laserart/spectra.php" target="_blank">Here's a website</a> which explains how we can identify stars and other bright objects based on their spectra, which is essentially their color but not limited to the visible spectrum. </p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't know if we could tell the difference between a set of 4 very stars of very similar brightness, size, and age which happened to be arranged in a cross pattern, but the idea of a whole bunch of sets of stars arranged in that pattern seems very unlikely. </p>
<p>What I said is true for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Cross" target="_blank">Einstein Cross</a> formations, but for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring" target="_blank">Einstein Rings</a> we have no theories to explain the sight of a large glowing ring in the sky besides gravitational lensing, so I suppose it's a bit more cut and dry in that case.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. How precise is this spectrum measurement? Considering the amount of stars we have in the visible universe, are these spectra pattern/shape of each stars unique like a fingerprint? Or is it relatively easy to find several stars with the same/similar spectrum?</p>
<p>From what I understand, the spectrum of a star depends on the elements of the star, so if 2 stars contains similar elements but not exactly the same, how reliable is the measurement in noticing this small difference?</p></div>		</li>
