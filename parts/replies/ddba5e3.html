			<div class="markdown"><p>The adhesive on Post-It notes is actually very weak. Adhesives stop sticking as they're reapplied again and again because they pick up debris and start sticking to the debris instead of whatever you're actually trying to stick it to. What's special about Post-Its is that the pressure-sensitive adhesive on them doesn't leave any of itself behind. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First part is wrong, second part is right. Next time you look at a Post-it look at how thin the adhesive is. Look at the block in profile. Does the added adhesive increase the width of the block at all? In order to have an extremely thin adhesive that still sticks you need an extremely strong adhesive. </p>
