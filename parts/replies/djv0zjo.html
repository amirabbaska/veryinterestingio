<p>No. The answers here are incorrect. Mass is not in general conserved, only energy is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is true, but irrelevant to the question being asked.  OP is asking whether the environment is equally heavy.</p>
<p>The gravitational field is generated via the stress-energy tensor.  The time-time component is a function of the <em>relativistic</em> mass, which is given by the energy density divided by c^2 .  Converting mass to energy and vice versa doesn't change the overall energy density of the closed system.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But the question asked for a closed system, your answer assumes an open system where energy is somehow lost to the environment. In all nuclear and chemical reactions, there must be a conservation of momentum and energy, so if the wood is burning inside an insulated box full of air (a simple example of a closed system) then the net momentum and energy of the box must remain constant. If there are no external forces on the box, then it's velocity must remain unchanged, and so the mass inside must be constant</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, I'm assuming the system is closed. I am also assuming op meant rest mass though, which might be where the confusion and controversy is coming from</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not entirely sure you're right here. This a chemical reaction so mass is not being converted to energy. The chemical binding energy of the bonds between the atoms is being converted to energy in the form of heat and light.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The binding energy in a chemical does contribute a small amount to its mass though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The below method was not great. Think about it this:</p>
<p>E2 = (mc2 )2 + (pc)2</p>
<p>Total energy is conserved, so if one term goes up, the other just go down. Releasing light or heat increases the amount of momentum in the system*, so the second term increases. This means the (mc2 )2 term must decreases. But c is a constant, so m must decrease </p>
<p>*the sum of p2 for each individual particular. The sum of the momentum vectors is of course constant if there is no outside force. </p>
<p>~~Exactly. And as we know from relativity, potential energy is equivalent to mass</p>
<p>E^2 = (mc^2 )^2 + (pc) ^2</p>
<p>Since there is no momentum, m=E/c^2</p>
<p>The energy decreasing means the mass decreases     </p>
<p>Edit: had a type, changed m-&gt;c~~</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But heat is kinetic energy of the molecules so turning the potential energy into heat <em>increases</em> the momentum of the molecules. I don't understand why you are saying there is no momentum.</p></div>		</li>
