<p>but we only do these on deployments</p>

<p>What is a deployment, and what are the other reasons you would be sent out?</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's not about reason to be sent out, but about the current status in the vehicle's life-cycle.</p>
<p>Consider a car. A fast one. Let's say formula 1.
Reasonably, this car can be in a number of states:</p>
<p>It could be under maintenance / with the mechanics for some work to be done on it. (Military version: Refitting &amp; Overhaul)</p>
<p>It could be in testing / training with the driver and crew. (Military version: Pre-Deployment / Training Cycle)</p>
<p>It could be on the way to a race. On a flatbed, not driving on the street, of course. (Military Version: Deployment)</p>
<p>Or it could be in a race. (Military Version: Engagement / Operation / etc.)</p>
<p>When can the mechanics relax? Not during maintenance, not during testing, not during a race. But while it's just trucking along, they sure can.</p>
<p>This is, of course, a gross simplification. For naval vessels, to my knowledge, deployment describes the status of moving from one area of operations to another, and the route between those two areas is not the actual target of the operation. It can also describe the entirety of time between leaving the home port and returning to it with the same crew.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Deployment is when we leave our home port to conduct operations outside of the area of our home port.  Minimum is usually 6 months, but some have gone longer and lately 8-9 months is the new normal.  For instance my current ship is stationed in San Diego.  If we deploy, we will go to the Persian Gulf and spend 4 or 5 months operating there, doing counter piracy operations, supporting troops on the ground, etc.  When we leave the Gulf, we may spend a month or 2 patrolling around the South China sea, around Japan, etc.  Then, we finally return home.  If we get a swim call it usually is around the Marianas trench, as a lot of Commanding Officers love to say they have swam in the deepest part of the ocean.  Of the 3 I have been a part of, 2 were at the Marianas trench, and the other was off the coast of Hawaii.</p>
<p>Outside of deployments we get underway 90% of the time for training.  Only thing locally we would do operationally would be to conduct rescues or searches.  I was involved in the recovery operations of an Alaskan Airlines crash off the west coast many years ago for instance.</p></div>		</li>
