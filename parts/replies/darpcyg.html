			<div class="markdown"><p>A simple test to prove this is to open a link from reddit in incognito, and then refresh the front page of reddit on a normal tab. Scroll down, and on the right side, you will find the link listed in the 'Recently Viewed Links' table.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It works, but how?</p>
<p>I always assumed that Inkognito mode ignores all current cookies. And I also seem to not be logged in in the incognito window. How is reddit tracking me then?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is that not just because Reddit tracks your outgoing clicks? If you were to open Reddit in incognito, then click on a link, I don't believe it'd show up as visited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TOR is only one step. You need to never cross-contaminate usernames, logins, etc.  Not even once or your other identities can be tied together forever, and that's even more damning because it looks like you're trying to hide something even if you're just googling embarrassing medical questions.</p>
<p>You also need to not use Windows as it leaks tons of info through browsers and other software.</p>
<p>You also need to mask hardware IDs and browser &quot;fingerprint&quot; (Panopticlick) with a virtual machine.</p>
<p>Now finally you need to protect the hardware information that you can't mask with a VM, which is the IP you're at and perhaps more importantly the MAC address of your wifi card which needs to be spoofed.  Again, you cannot ever cross-contaminate the &quot;clearnet&quot; and TOR/darknet IPs, MACs, etc.</p>
<p>There's an 8 page writeup on just the basics of all of this.  It's complicated and not easy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The entrance and exit of TOR is literally at the NSA's doorstep. To properly stay anonymous you would need to arrange yourself several VPNs (Tunneling through 4-6 at least).</p>
<p>You don't really think that the VPN providers don't track anything right? Or that if you actually pull some shit that the governments would need to through the legal procedures if they wanted to.</p>
<p>It's more or less impossible to completely anonymous without destroying the VPN server, any by that I don't mean clearing the HDD. </p>
<p>Edit: Still got a lawsuit running. Went through two VPNs and one motherfucking root server before downloading from a VPN. It was just a fucking album.</p></div>		</li>
