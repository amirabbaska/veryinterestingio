			<p>Not quite, we define &quot;white light&quot; by the black body curve, essentially the color of light given off by an object when it gets really hot.<br><br>But while the light from a black body at 2700 Kelvin is a very specific spectral power distribution, you can make the same &quot;color&quot; of light by mixing it in different ways. But then you get into the much more complicated issue of color rendering, where depending on its spectral reflectance distribution one object could look different under two lights of the same color temperature.<br><br>This is actually the major advantage of incandescent and halogen bulbs. They're always a consistent spectrum, while different models of LED bulbs can start off with different spectrums, and are also prone to shifting over time (both along the black body curve and off it toward green/magenta).<br><br>tldr: color is complicated.<br><br>Related reading:<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation</a><br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_rendering_index</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Don't tungsten incandescent lamps trend toward lower K toward the end of their life, though? I was always under the impression that tungsten halogen was the only temperature reliable bulb. At least that's what my experience in film taught me.</p>		</li>

			<p>Hm, that's possible. The company I work for actually only has tungsten halogen, so I don't have a lot of experience with simpler filament lamps.<br><br>The wear on incandescent bulbs comes from tungsten evaporating off of the filament and being deposited on cooler surfaces. It's conceivable that the narrowing of the filament would shift the color to lower K, as the overall power it draws will decrease as the filament gets narrower and resistance increases. But I don't have any specific knowledge on that. If they do shift, it's at least a <em>consistent</em> shift, constrained to the black body locus. That's much more than can be said for fluorescent, LED, or metal halide.<br><br>While we're on halogens, has anybody here wondered what the difference is with halogen bulbs and normal incandescents? Instead of letting it be deposited on the outer glass, halogens use a gas (a halogen, hence the name) to grab the evaporated tungsten and form a halide, which is then broken down by high temperatures, depositing the tungsten. The hottest parts of the filament are where it's narrowed the most from evaporation, so the most tungsten gets deposited back there, extending the life of the filament. They're also higher pressure inside (normal incandescents are near vacuum), which slows down the evaporation.<br><br>The halogen cycle doesn't run at lower temperatures, so halogen bulbs are made to operate at a higher temperature than standard incandescents (which would just burn out a lot faster if you ran them hotter). That makes their light a higher color temperature (less orange), and also makes them more efficient (because the hotter black body spectrum puts extra light in the visible range and less in IR).<br><br>I don't want to make LEDs sound too bad, they've certainly gotten much more stable over the last few years, and the energy savings make up for the headaches. But non-incandescent light sources are just so much more complicated. Drivers/ballasts and all that. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well, most white LEDs are phosphor based because RGB based white light has terrible color rendering, due to the nature of the LED emission spectrum.

			<p>its not sited correctly.  CRI is based on a yellow index.  yes they produce a lot of yellow, but there is no way that the coloring index is 100.  Daylight to the human eye has a cri of 100.    The CRI is based on the best light for the human eye.  Unless it's a hortilux bulb or better then its not even close.  But the human eye doesn't pick up all wavelengths equally.  So its a bias comparison.  There is no way you can imply that an HID type of CRI is better than a black body type of CRI.  <a href="http://www.belowthelion.co.za/wp-content/uploads/HID-Light-Spectrum-daylight-spectrum.jpeg" target="_blank">http://www.belowthelion.co.za/wp-content/uploads/HID-Light-Spectrum-daylight-spectrum.jpeg</a></p>		</li>

			<p>Sorry BBR.  I just linked the other options without thinking about the led spectrum.  But the spectral graphs of LEDs will be different depending on what phosphor the manufacturer uses.  Basically they will be like that.  But look for something closer to 2,000k.  Or use both 6700k and 2700-2000k.  That way you get a great spectral coverage.  Later look more into ratios if you want.  The green slec is ok.  I have read several places that green light is able to penetrate deeper.  Also by changing the ratios you will be able to light train/manipulate the plants.  Increasing the 420nm will decrease the stem ellngation caused from using lower k spectrums.  LEDs are fun.</p>		</li>

			<p>My background is in imaging, particularly fine art reproduction, I'm very particular when it comes to color and CRI doesn't tell the whole story (the CRI test uses a defined set of color tiles and so manufacturers often design the SPD to have a good CRI but still might have color rendition issues with colors not in the test.<br><br>Another issue that I'm curious about is the CRI, SPD, and Luminance over the life of the bulb and I don't know how much that has been tested. Because we're dealing with fluorescence, we are going to have shifts over time with use. How much and how long? I don't know.<br><br>I've had LED bulbs in my house for 2 or 3 years now and if I don't look with a critical eye they seem fine. But if I take a more critical look at them, while I never broke out the spectrophotometer on them, but I can see one light is a slight different color than another light (they're all the same brand, model, brightness, and color temp, just purchased at different times as the traditional lights blew out) and I can see a color difference when looking at a new light and an old. Maybe the company's manufacturing tolerances are just bad, maybe they changed the manufacturing methods but still sold it under the same name, or maybe the colors shift over time enough to be noticeable.<br><br>For photography I use strobes and for proofing I use solux bulbs (incandescent). For home I use LEDs.<br><br>I'm not trying to bash LEDs. I feel they are the right direction, but they're not perfect and I feel they're likely to improve their weak points (color, etc) more in the coming years than incandescence are going to improve their weak points (power consumption, heat).<br><br>Also keep in mind some problems may not have been thought of yet. When they first started putting LEDs in stop lights, they though it was great because they wouldn't have to change the lights as much. Then they realized a problem the first snow-fall, the incandescent bulbs they used to use used to produce enough heat to melt the snow, so they then had to send crews around to brush off the lights or install mini heaters. They then also realized that while the LEDs lasted a long time, the circuitry that powered them was not infallible and they still often need to change out the units... I still think LEDs are the right direction but they have a lot of room for improvement (fortunately they are improving).</p>		</li>

			<p>For your application, I understand how important colour rendition accuracy is in lighting. I know you're not trying to bash LEDs, and I agree they need work (mainly in the CRI/SPD department), and will, once these problems are solved, leave others (bulbs especially) in the dust.<br><br>My background (as far as lighting is concerned) is in high power flashlights, with battery capacity, heat dissipation, and weight, all at high premiums. In that situation, I can't afford to be too fussy where colour rendition is concerned. Colour temperature is the only choice I get in terms of chromaticity, and I find that around 6000K is nicest for nighttime, outdoors use (for me, anyway). <br><br>About your house lights, are you familiar with the [ LED 'binning' system ]( <a href="http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img199/1250/ansiwhite.jpg" target="_blank">http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img199/1250/ansiwhite.jpg</a> )? It basically means that the LEDs that go into your lights might say a certain colour temp, but even slightly different batches of LEDs can look noticeably different.<br>So two 3500K, 200lm/W LEDs made months apart could look different, as the manufacturing tolerances mean that two LEDs from the two batches could be, say 3470K and 3520K, or 190lm and 205lm. These slight differences would be easily noticeable to the trained eye.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah I have a feeling it very well could be manufacturing tolerances in terms of my house issue.<br><br>I do have a feeling at some point there would be a shift as the fluorescent compounds fade… how much and how long before it was noticeable is a question that I am mildly curious about (enough to ask but not enough to set up an experiment ;-) ). Regardless, for most home use I feel that would be mostly negligible.<br><br>I like 5000K (6000K is close enough), especially since I calibrate my monitors and such to D50. Though most people feel 6500k is too &quot;blue&quot; for home use (it's killer for flashlights though!).<br><br>Curious though if there are any super bright Red flashlights.

			<p>You can get low powered red flashlights [easily]( <a href="http://www.lightmalls.com/uniquefire-hs-80m2-cree-red-light-long-range-led-flashlight-1-18650" target="_blank">http://www.lightmalls.com/uniquefire-hs-80m2-cree-red-light-long-range-led-flashlight-1-18650</a> ).<br><br>High powered red LEDs are available, but are less efficient, and a lot less common. <br><br>The main reason for the red/night-vision compatibility is to do with how our retinas detect light. The rod cells, which are the basis of our night vision (they are extremely sensitive to luminance, but not chromaticity) are completely unresponsive to red (580-700nm) light. This means that, using a red light, we can use our cone cells to see objects/animals/whatever-else-we're-trying-to-sneak-up-on-at-night without affecting the rods, and so we can go right back to night vision once we turn the red light off.<br><br>There is one sizable issue though: afterimage. Our cones detect colour via the molecular transformation of chemicals called ['opsins']( <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopsin" target="_blank">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photopsin</a> ). These, like any biochemical event, take time to reverse, once light stops being detected (like if you look at a ceiling light. A high powered red flashlight still wouldn't affect rods, but would leave an afterimage on the cones, overlayed on top of the night vision, rendering it useless.<br><br>Rods are also sensitive to certain wavelengths of blue light, and take about 15mins to manufacture enough opsin for 100% night vision sensitivity, which is why even a brief flash of white light destroys night vision for 5-10mins.</p>		</li>

It's the wave of the future son.<br><br>Basics: The led is run through a fast cycle(fractions of a second) and is left on in different increments. Being left on for the 25% of the time will give you 25% brightness where as 90% will give you almost full intensity.<br><br>This is used in almost every product we make today. The design eliminates the need for other components that lower the voltage for the same effect but create unwanted heat/loss of energy.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; a fast cycle(fractions of a second)<br><br>Hopefully thousandths of a second. Switching on and off at a rate of less than every few thousandths of a second can produce a noticeable flicker.</p>		</li>

			<p>Ehhh... You can get away with hundreths of a second. Typically anything above ~120 Hz will be enough that most people don't notice it. Personally I can't notice an LED flickering above ~80Hz.</p>		</li>

			<p>You can get away with ONE hundredth of a second, but if turn the LED off/on every TWO hundredths of a second, you've got a flicker rate of 50 Hz, which is distinctly noticeable.</p>		</li>

			<p>No. Its just photon energy.<br><br>Also, blue leds being brighter is a very very complicated thing:<br><br>1. LED brightness depends on how much power you give them - you can have a very dim blue LED, or an eye-searing red one, if you just use a very low and very high power one, respectively<br><br>2. If you think very bright status LEDs, there are two things to consider:<br><br>- Product inertia. Blue LEDs became an order of magnitude more efficient in a few years. Some companies don't really realize that - if you have a blue status LED driven with 20mA in the year 2005, it was ok bright. Use the same circuit nowadays with modern, high efficiency LEDs and it becomes eye searing<br><br>- Rod vs cone sensitivity: In bright light, our eye is most sensitive in the green region. But in darkness, blue sensitivity is much higher. This means if you design a LED thats nicely visible in a office room illuminiated at 500 lux, you will get something that will light up the whole room as soon as eyes are dark adapted.</p>		</li>

			<p>LED's are not brighter than eachother in different classes as they output whatever measured candella ratings they are rated for. The eye is more sensitive to greens than it is red and blue though, for example (think of I frames in video encoding and colour spaces).<br><br>The reason blue LEDs may appear to have gotten brighter is that their invention came very late in the LED era due to research limitations in the early 90's. As far as I recall, blue LEDs were Indium Gallium Nitride based and growing the substrate required on silicon was a late development (early 2000's?) where previously saphire was used.<br><br>You might also be surprised to know that most white LEDs mix yellow light from a phosphorescent reaction to yellow light and blue, from the same Cerium doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet substrate.<br><br>So TL;DR to answer your question, it may be an interpretation or it may realistically be because of rapidly growing materials science research.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually sapphire is still the dominant substrate for blue and green LEDs. Silicon is only used in a few applications (though it is an attractive idea, it has some serious problems when growing GaN or InGaN on top). See my post in this thread for the detailed explanation of the growth problems...</p>		</li>

			<p>My understanding is that Cree (the world's largest manufacturer of blueLED's) uses SiC substrates, since the lattice mismatch with GaN is significantly smaller sapphire. They own the intellectual property for the technology, which has kept other companies out of the GaN on SiC market, allowing Cree to somewhat monopolize the high quality blue LED market.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is true. When we grow, we tend to use sapphire because its lattice constant and thermal expansion coefficient are close enough to GaN, and buffer layers have been developed to grow good quality films despite the larger lattice mismatch. Sapphire is cheaper than SiC, and for R&amp;D with high throughput it works well. GaN substrates are the best performing, but currently cost on the order of $3000-$10000 for a 2 inch wafer while sapphire is basically free for us...</p>		</li>

			<p>While you are correct that mid-gap traps can potentially hinder high energy emission (by promoting radiative recombination at a lower energy), this was not the factor that hindered the development of blue LEDs. You do need a wide bandgap material, and that turns out to be harder to grow for different reasons (see my answer in this thread for detailed info).</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, LED color is a materials choice problem.<br><br><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29518521" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29518521</a><br><br>From this article, growing the gallium nitride crystals responsible for the blue band-gap is simply more difficult than other materials for other colors.</p>		</li>
