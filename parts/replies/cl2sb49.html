<p>Is this why blue LEDs are generally much brighter than other colors?  I mean, I just need to know that my computer is on, not signal alien civilizations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Blue led technology is much newer than red/green/orange.  I have a textbook on LEDs from 1989 that suggests that blue LEDs will be super expensive forget and white LEDs are impossible.  Pretty amazing how fast that changed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>PWM = <a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/pulse-width-modulation" target="_blank">Pulse Width Modulation</a>. It's the wave of the future son.</p>
<p>Basics: The led is run through a fast cycle(fractions of a second) and is left on in different increments. Being left on for the 25% of the time will give you 25% brightness where as 90% will give you almost full intensity.</p>
<p>This is used in almost every product we make today. The design eliminates the need for other components that lower the voltage for the same effect but create unwanted heat/loss of energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Its just photon energy.</p>
<p>Also, blue leds being brighter is a very very complicated thing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>LED brightness depends on how much power you give them - you can have a very dim blue LED, or an eye-searing red one, if you just use a very low and very high power one, respectively</p>
</li>
<li>If you think very bright status LEDs, there are two things to consider:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Product inertia. Blue LEDs became an order of magnitude more efficient in a few years. Some companies don't really realize that - if you have a blue status LED driven with 20mA in the year 2005, it was ok bright. Use the same circuit nowadays with modern, high efficiency LEDs and it becomes eye searing</p>
</li>
<li>Rod vs cone sensitivity: In bright light, our eye is most sensitive in the green region. But in darkness, blue sensitivity is much higher. This means if you design a LED thats nicely visible in a office room illuminiated at 500 lux, you will get something that will light up the whole room as soon as eyes are dark adapted.</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>LED's are not brighter than eachother in different classes as they output whatever measured candella ratings they are rated for. The eye is more sensitive to greens than it is red and blue though, for example (think of I frames in video encoding and colour spaces).</p>
<p>The reason blue LEDs may appear to have gotten brighter is that their invention came very late in the LED era due to research limitations in the early 90's. As far as I recall, blue LEDs were Indium Gallium Nitride based and growing the substrate required on silicon was a late development (early 2000's?) where previously saphire was used.</p>
<p>You might also be surprised to know that most white LEDs mix yellow light from a phosphorescent reaction to yellow light and blue, from the same Cerium doped Yttrium Aluminium Garnet substrate.</p>
<p>So TL;DR to answer your question, it may be an interpretation or it may realistically be because of rapidly growing materials science research.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually sapphire is still the dominant substrate for blue and green LEDs. Silicon is only used in a few applications (though it is an attractive idea, it has some serious problems when growing GaN or InGaN on top). See my post in this thread for the detailed explanation of the growth problems...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While you are correct that mid-gap traps can potentially hinder high energy emission (by promoting radiative recombination at a lower energy), this was not the factor that hindered the development of blue LEDs. You do need a wide bandgap material, and that turns out to be harder to grow for different reasons (see my answer in this thread for detailed info).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, LED color is a materials choice problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29518521" target="_blank">http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29518521</a></p>
<p>From this article, growing the gallium nitride crystals responsible for the blue band-gap is simply more difficult than other materials for other colors.</p></div>		</li>
