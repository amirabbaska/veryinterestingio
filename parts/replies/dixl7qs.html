<p>Zara  is somewhat unique in the fashion industry in that it owns its entire supply chain. </p>

<p>Just a small correction, it really doesn't. I think it owns a shoe factory but its clothes and from their sister companies are from many small different contractors. </p>
<p>It's a very good client though, read an article recently about a Portuguese company which works for them for 30 years, and they are 80% of their business. And a lot of factories doing things for Zara in Portugal, the other brands they also make are much more expensive. </p>
<p>Zara otoh deals directly with factories, there are examples literally of clothes being designed one day, factory is putting them out in 48 hours and are sent from northern Portugal to Galicia in another 48 hours. </p></div>		</li>
