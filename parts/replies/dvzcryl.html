			<div class="markdown"><p>In the computer analogy, it's more like a file structure. Sure, you have all these words and memories, but they're all categorised. If someone asks you to list them all, it would take a while to index and recall all everything, as they're not stored in one big block. But you can use them in your vocabulary because when you're looking for a specific file/word/memory you can just trace the relevant categories and paths and find it in far fewer operations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong, but is there a connection with words similar to subcortical motor behaviors?  Meaning, I can type 50-60 words per minute without looking at my keyboard, but if you asked me to write out the layout of a keyboard I would not be able to do it.  There's a specific type of word aphasia that occurs with some strokes where someone cannot identify a word or perform a motor action when asked, but can do it automatically if there isn't a thought process to it.  </p>
<p>An example would be with some patients you can ask them to sign their name and they are unable, but if you just give them a standard form they've seen before and ask them to fill it out, they'll sign their name.  (I'm still in school and it's been a hot minute since I took courses on neurology so the terminology isn't on the tip of my brain).  When treating stroke patients, we try to use activities they were previously proficient in instead of just doing the exercise to strength the muscles and regain neurological function.  An example would be some patients will struggle to use a walker, but will suddenly be coordinated enough to push a shopping cart since it's a subcortical motor routine.  </p>
<p>I could be wrong, but those feel connected or similar.  </p></div>		</li>
