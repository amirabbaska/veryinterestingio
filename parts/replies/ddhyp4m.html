			<div class="markdown"><p>crazy how many of these planes plans were made with a slide rule and pencil and paper, vs the technological changes that came later and will into the next century. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly,  we kinda got a limit.  The math is no more difficult or easy today. The difference with cad and fea is that you can make design changes and decisions faster.  Instead of making demonstrators. You solve it in cad.  From a manufacturing standpoint tolerances aren't much tighter. It's just cheaper or more consistent.</p>
<p>The biggest change is aurora autopilot and controls theory. The B2 flight computer was a technology breakthrough in the 70s and 80s. Now a 200$ drone controller is more sophisticated.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what has been divulged it is actually  less stealthy then the two fighters in operation.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The F-22 is about 20 years newer and more expensive than the B-2. It is the epitome of fighter technology and is intensely stealthy. It is also about a hundred times smaller than the B-2 in surface area. So it is predictable for a newer, expensive fighter to be more stealthy than a bomber. When we need to kill the next bin laden, we'll use a F-22 over a B-2. But when we bombed the shit out of Syria a couple months ago we used a B-2. As for the F-35, sure, it might be more stealthy than the B-2 but stealth isn't very important in my opinion in an international workhorse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the B2 being larger actually makes it more stealthy in some respects. In order to reflect radar waves in a particular direction, the plane surfaces need to be bigger than the radar wavelength. So one counter to stealth is to use very long wavelength radar. Smaller planes will be more vulnerable to this.</p></div>		</li>
