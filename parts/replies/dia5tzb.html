			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much that graphene is hard to get, just like diamonds aren't particularly rare. You can get a sample of graphene by taking a piece of tape to some graphite. However just like diamonds, <em>large</em>, <em>pure</em> samples that are needed to work chemically are difficult to make, and the methods we have aren't currently economical. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found an article where they say a Chinese company already unveiled <a href="https://www.graphene-info.com/all-electric-car-graphene-based-battery-be-unveiled-2017-geneva-auto-show" target="_blank">an electric car with graphene-based battery</a>. I hope the trend spreads and we get better batteries.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Calling supercapacitors &quot;batteries&quot; is a bit of a misnomer. For one, batteries are collections of individual cells where capacitors tend to be single structures, but also they store energy in fundamentally different ways. Batteries store energy in the form of chemical potential whereas capacitors store energy as electrical potential.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, this distinction is extremely important, as chemical potentials are  more stable than electrical potentials. This allows for a lot more electrons to be stored. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another important distinction is that batteries supply a relatively constant voltage, but super capacitors supply a voltage that increases as the total stored charge increases</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm glad I read this far. After reading everything I did, I started to wonder why our phones use batteries (read chemical potentials) instead of capacitors (read electrical potentials).</p>
<p>Care to elaborate a bit more on why the battery in the phones isn't just a large capacitor instead of a battery?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Chemical potential and electrical potential are different forms of motion of electrons into positions they don't want to be (and often rearranging or moving molecules in the process).</p>
<p>Batteries typically rearrange chemical bonds on the rest of the molecule or move things macroscopic amounts, while capacitors typically just involve surface charge or polarization (which is still rearranging a molecule I guess, but it doesn't really change in any fundamental way).</p>
<p>Various kinds of supercapacitors cover a grey area between them where there may be some ionic movement or chemical reaction on one or both electrode but the other acts more like a capacitor or similar.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Similarly, they are also working on glass batteries. I can't find a very good explanation of how they work, but it sounds like they act more like capacitors that can regulate how fast they discharge.</p>
