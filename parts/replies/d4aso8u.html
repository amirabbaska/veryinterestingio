			<p>Using your approach it does seem to work for 3 digit and 4 digit numbers as well. I wonder if there is a generic proof for any N where number of digits in N is &gt; 1</p>		</li>

			<p>You can write an integer N = a0<em>10^0 + a1</em>10^1 + a2<em>10^2 + ... + an</em>10^n<br><br>You can write it's reverse N' = an<em>10^0 + a(n-1)</em>10^1 + ... + a0*10^n<br><br>In Z9, the finite ring of 9 integers, 10 is equivalent to 1, so all of those 10^x terms become 1^x = 1 and N = a0 + a1 + ... + an. N' will reduce to the same terms, so N - N' = (a0 + a1 + ... + an) - (an + ... + a1 + a0) = 0<br><br>An integer being equivalent to 0 in Z9 means it is divisible by 9.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>It also works for any base, of course then the result will always be divisible by base-1.</p>		</li>

			<p>While I agree that the result follows, I don't think we need to resort to modular arithmetic, as follows:<br><br>Using your notation of N = sum(a_k <em> 10^k), and N' = sum(a_k</em>10^(n-k)), let's look at the difference N-N'.

Same thing for k &lt; n / 2, but you get a negative number, and if k = n/2 the term is 0.</p>		</li>

			<p>I actually think your proof is less comprehensible than the proof using modular arithmetic, simply because you're doing more notation juggling.</p>		</li>

			<p>His working doesn't work for 3 digit numbers because he used <em>10x + y</em> (53 is 10<em>5 + 3 right?)

			<p>i just want to point out that while the top comment succinctly addresses a good number of facts about modular arithmetic, this is the comment that actually explains <em>why</em> this occurs. <br><br>one has to wonder how many people clicked on the title of the post, read the top comment, said &quot;darn, that's interesting,&quot; then left without really resolving their initial curiousity.</p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, while I have enough interest in math to wonder about the question, I took one look and my brain kinda oozed a couple of tears. I don't understand this one, either. (Art Student) Guess I'll have to ask one of my more math-literate friends.  I learn better if I can ask questions. :)<br><br>Actually, the statement that it works with other bases was more useful to me. As in &quot;It's just one of the characteristics of counting sets.&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>ha but wait no! it's not just like a random fact that happens to be true. it's a byproduct of the fact that we use a base-system of 10.<br><br>think of it this way: after the number 9, you go to 10. that's one number higher, but in terms of adding up the digits, you've actually just sorta reset it to 1, right? <br><br>assume we're only working with two digit numbers so i can try a simplified explanation. call two digit numbers xy. to get to the next multiple of 9, you always have to take one step forward in the y department. OR you have to take one step forward in the x department and 10 steps back in the y department. does that kinda make sense?<br><br>if you could imagine a system where we used a base of 8 (so we counted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10... 15, 16, 17, 20... and so forth), the same would actually be true of the number 7 in this scenario.</p>		</li>
