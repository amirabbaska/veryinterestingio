			<p>Using your approach it does seem to work for 3 digit and 4 digit numbers as well. I wonder if there is a generic proof for any N where number of digits in N is &gt; 1</p>		</li>

			<p>ha but wait no! it's not just like a random fact that happens to be true. it's a byproduct of the fact that we use a base-system of 10.<br><br>think of it this way: after the number 9, you go to 10. that's one number higher, but in terms of adding up the digits, you've actually just sorta reset it to 1, right? <br><br>assume we're only working with two digit numbers so i can try a simplified explanation. call two digit numbers xy. to get to the next multiple of 9, you always have to take one step forward in the y department. OR you have to take one step forward in the x department and 10 steps back in the y department. does that kinda make sense?<br><br>if you could imagine a system where we used a base of 8 (so we counted 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10... 15, 16, 17, 20... and so forth), the same would actually be true of the number 7 in this scenario.</p>		</li>

It was said the the number 9 is the key to unlocking all the potential power that the true king holds. Zantibnar is still waiting for the coming of its true leader.

			<p>Couldn't any natural number N&gt;10 be written as N = 10x + y for x and y also in the natural numbers? Not sure your proof requires the limit of 100 unless it comes into play during the inverse, but it seems like it wouldn't. I mean an inverse is an inverse regardless of the number, so it would only be that the inverse isn't the number backwards if N exceeds a certain number. I guess the only gap in proof would be showing that ~N is indeed N backwards. <br><br>Of course it seems weird to call it an inverse. As a function it's definitely the inverse but it is neither it's additive or multiplicative inverse.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Not sure your proof requires the limit of 100<br><br>It only does because I didn't want to generalize to a larger set of numbers - I just wanted to deal with the two terms.  Others did so elsewhere in this thread</p>		</li>

			<p>I guess I'm just saying that generalizing to the set of natural numbers N&gt;10 introduces no new terms and requires no extra effort. After all, there's no restriction that x &lt; 10 or y &lt; 10 and thus it encompasses all digits. <br><br>Come to think of it, so long as N is a natural number <em>period</em> this proof holds. <br><br>Of course for -10 &lt; N &lt; 10 this will just be trivial with ~N = N and thus N - ~N = 0 = 0(9) <br><br>But for N &lt; -10 it'd be the same concept. <br><br>So in conclusion, your arbitrary restriction of your domain saved you no work and reduced your conclusion parameters significantly. <br><br>Edit: never mind, upon reworking this I realize that in your approach it's important that 0 &lt; x, y &lt; 10 to define ~N as OP did. So a proof extending beyond your range would require a different approach. </p>		</li>

			<p>10x+y is a representation for how the number is put together.  We generalize that way so we can generalize the swapping of the ones places and the tens place.    If you look below at the 41+14 example, you'll see that x is 4 and y is y, so that we can put those values in different places to make the second term.<br><br>In the more general case, however, we can represent any number that way.<br>Let's take the number 135, for example.  Would you agree with me that 135 is equal to:<br><br>&gt; 100 + 30 + 5<br><br>That's equal to:<br><br>&gt; (1 <em> 100) + (3 </em> 10) + (5 <em> 1)  <br><br>...which is also <br><br>&gt; (1 </em> 10^2) + (3 <em> 10^1) + (4 </em> 10^0)<br><br>In any number base, a number can be expressed as the sum of multiples of exponent terms of that number base.  Our normal base is base 10, and any integer in base 10 can be expressed as:<br><br>&gt; a<em><em>0</em></em>(10^0 ) + a<em><em>1</em></em>(10^1 ) + a<em><em>2</em></em>(10^2 ) + .... +a<em><em>n</em></em>(10^n)<br><br>For some operations, it makes more sense to write it as a sum of terms than as just one number.</p>		</li>
