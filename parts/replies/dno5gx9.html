<p>Isn't the reason for this because iron is the most energetically favorable element? Fusing lighter elements up to iron means you gain energy, fusing heavier elements costs energy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Fusing iron or nickle produces no net energy. Because of this the stellar core, which is mostly iron and nickle, begins to cool, and without the pressure of the heat from fusion, it begins to shrink. If the mass of the core is high enough, the force of it's own gravity exceeds the electron degeneracy pressure and the core collapses within a matter of seconds into degenerate matter (like the stuff a neutron star is made of). Within a few more seconds you get a supernova.</p>
<p>&quot;The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements, starting with hydrogen and then helium, progressing up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced. Fusion of iron or nickel produces no net energy output, so no further fusion can take place, leaving the nickel-iron core inert. Due to the lack of energy output creating outward pressure, equilibrium is broken and the core is compressed by the overlying mass of the star.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When the compacted mass of the inert core exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit of about 1.4 Mâ˜‰, electron degeneracy is no longer sufficient to counter the gravitational compression. A cataclysmic implosion of the core takes place within seconds. Without the support of the now-imploded inner core, the outer core collapses inwards under gravity and reaches a velocity of up to 23% of the speed of light and the sudden compression increases the temperature of the inner core to up to 100 billion kelvins. Neutrons and neutrinos are formed via reversed beta-decay, releasing about 10^46 joules (100 foe) in a ten-second burst. Also, the collapse of the inner core is halted by neutron degeneracy, causing the implosion to rebound and bounce outward. The energy of this expanding shock wave is sufficient to disrupt the overlying stellar material and accelerate it to escape velocity, forming a supernova explosion. The shock wave and extremely high temperature and pressure rapidly dissipate but are present for long enough to allow for a brief period during which the production of elements heavier than iron occurs.[2] Depending on initial size of the star, the remnants of the core form a neutron star or a black hole. Because of the underlying mechanism, the resulting nova is also described as a core-collapse supernova.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I've never heard the term &quot;Iron Peak&quot;, I'd be very surprised that it would be based on abundance since the highest abundance atoms are going to be hydrogen and helium by far. Much more likely is that it derives from Iron having the <a href="http://staff.orecity.k12.or.us/les.sitton/Nuclear/313_files/nfg005.gif" target="_blank">highest binding energy per nucleon</a> of any element  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well since both fusion and fission work slowly towards Iron, it's pretty reasonable to think there would be more of it than other elements in proximity to it on the periodic table.  It's not the most abundant, but it's an outlier.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Obviously, H and He overwhelm the rest of the table in terms of abundance. But it's still true that Iron and below have much higher abundance than elements heavier than iron, due to the energy-negative requirements to fuse elements beyond Fe. This requirement means that elements beyond Iron are only created in supernovae. Hence the term &quot;Iron Peak&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fission does occur in stars, it's just negligible as compared to fusion is all.  In effect, it might as well not be there for most purposes, but it certainly happens for all stars with fissionable nuclei swimming around in there.</p></div>		</li>
