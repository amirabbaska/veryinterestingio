The top 5 executives of the company I work for made 26,601,511 in 2015 (up 45% from 2014, imagine any other job position getting a 45% raise in one year), and that's on the low end of executive pay for large brands. Something is fucky with the scaling of how salaries work in North America.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the current cost model where every degree regardless of value and department expenses costs the same is a bit of a farce. The engineering department and business department will have the best resources, buildings, higher costs associated with materials (engineering), - while your English grad getting a degree just requires a professor and labor and the student buys all the resources at exorbitant cost but pays the same as the student using the high end facilities and expensive equipment for a degree that's valuable culturally but offers very little monetary compensation comparatively </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm. I've worked in a library for ten years, and it amazes me how little people know about librarians. While we take information for granted thanks to the internet, librarians have expertise and access to many more resources than what you find with google. Their MO is freedom of information, and they take that job very, very seriously. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just wanted to add to your list. My wife is a librarian at a law firm. She has two primary responsibilities in addition to organizing, ordering, and cataloging their books, newspapers, magazines, etc.  </p>
<p>She also manages their various information systems such as Westlaw (a legal database) including managing the subscriptions, making sure the invoices get paid, showing lawyers and other firm employees how to use it, and managing individual accounts for those people. This is probably how she spends most of her time. </p>
<p>Another thing she is responsible for is legal research. When a lawyer needs information for a case, he sends her a ticket. She will find information on people, companies, organizations, specific laws, results from other relevant cases, etc. The lawyers use this information to determine how to approach a case and build their arguments or for negotiations. </p>
<p>All of these things were learned in classes that she took in her Masters program. She learned how to do research, even on topics you don't have a strong understanding of. She knows how to use the tools, so she can find good information even without needing to understand the law. She also learned cataloging and how to use databases and good search techniques for locating information online and through proprietary databases. </p>
<p>Before she went to school for this, I never even realized librarians needed a Masters degree and was really surprised to learn all of this stuff. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My partner has a similar job and you describe very well the extensive and specific skills librarians have and how they're applied in many more areas than simple public libraries. They're essentially information specialists. I too was surprised to learn all this and I find it fascinating. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Librarian here. Most librarians are not supervisors, that's not why you get the degree. You're correct that library assistants do not require a masters- generally only a high school diploma. Mostly they work in circulation (the checking in and out of books) but in some libraries they may find themselves doing programming and other duties as well. Most people have no idea what the typical librarian does, even patrons don't always have a great idea. </p>
<p>But anyhow, a masters is required to get a job as a professional librarian...so if you want to work in a library and do more than check books in and out you will likely need that degree. There are specialized courses and many colleagues feel it should only be a 4 year major in college but that's a whole other can of worms. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not quite.</p>
<p>I am a Library Tech. I got a 2 year diploma and it included cataloguing, programming (kids, teens, adults), collection management (purchasing, weeding), etc.</p>
<p>Our libraries have about 5-6 levels. Paging staff (shelving, pulling holds, etc), circulation staff (managing some processes, helping customers at the desk), library assistant (both library techs and those with their masters can fall in here. Programming, outreach, some circumstances duties, customer service, readers advisory, cash, etc), assistant managers (can be library techs or masters. Scheduling, staff management, difficult patrons, etc), managers (Masters position), etc.</p>
<p>Where I am the market is pretty flooded, so I've decided not to get my Masters for now since I'd most likely end up getting paid the same but with school debt for at least 5 years. There are far fewer librarian positions, and lots of librarians. So it's smarter for me to stick with what I've got.</p>
<p>Especially since, if I wanted a position with more responsibility, I could move and be management in a rural library with the education and experience I have atm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you tell me more about being a library tech? Was this two year diploma on top of a bachelor's or after high school? How much do you typically make and what are your hours like, what exactly do you do? (Sorry, just super interested.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And thats why the answer really sticks out as a &quot;This Situation doesn't cover all bases&quot; kind of answer. Some librarians will be psudo-supervisors but you're right, ive never heard of a &quot;Librarian's Supervisor&quot; before. It's just an added duty usually to the normal job description of a Head Librarian or other position inside a private or public institution.</p>
<p>And you also bring up a point I didn't mention earlier. Other institutions where you need to be a &quot;professional Librarian&quot; such as private library collections, or even larger non university related organizations like the Library of Congress need people with the proper training to properly manage the library.</p>
<p>And again like I mentioned earlier as well, there are many other tasks as yous aid as well, programming, supervision of other librarians, and archival and rare item handling and restoration services.</p>
<p>Again, 1 size does not fit all with answers like this, and you have to paint it with a broad stroked brush.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely it's complex! To clarify- professional librarian is someone with the degree. A non professional working in a library in circ or material/tech services might sometimes be referred to as a librarian (but isn't actually because, again, no degree) so I was putting professional ahead of the term to denote that difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It depends greatly. Some positions require a Masters because they want someone who was trained by a reputable institution and someone who they can rely on who has certainly had the up to date training they require.</p>
<p>Like in most industries, previous experience does not always make you qualified for newer up to date positions in any field, and someone who's used to just pushing books thorugh a scanner or hitting them with a date punch is not qualified to operate a multi-location municipal library system with a fully integrated IT system with an archival wing at a major branch.</p>
<p>An Example like that needs someone who has been properly educated and trained.</p></div>		</li>
