<ul>
<li>
<p>They tell other studios what genre they plan to release, so others can know which topic is probably taken. &quot;Ah, three romantic comedies already in the summer... let's do something else in 2019&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To very slowly build hype. First announcement three years prior for movie nerds. Then two years and a year ahead the first details, maybe a teaser, six months prior a trailer, then three months before the real hype machine starts to run getting anyone who is not a movie-nerd on board until the real marketing for release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tell existing and possible shareholders what cool money makers they plan on releasing.</p>
</li>
<li>Simply from a practical standpoint movies are in pre-production for a long time before they are shot. All the actual shooting has to get organised for a long time and as such they are already in the official schedule of a studio. And that is usually not a big secret. Also note that the larger projects involve 100s and maybe 1000s of people in dozens of different companies... </li>
</ul>
<p>The announcement to the customer is just the end of  a long, long chain of professional work with the movie. They do not make themselves. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, though it was up against <em>The Force Awakens</em>. The target market for the latter is as big as a movie can possibly have, but in this case, Fox threw out cheapish, low-quality film geared at really young kids, at least some of whom were a bit young for <em>Star Wars</em>. The practice is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterprogramming_(film_distribution\)" target="_blank">counterprogramming</a> and is really popular with horror films and children's films, in particular, since they have fairly reliable built-in audiences.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They were released eight weeks apart, by which point <em>Antz</em> had already grossed over 90% of its domestic box office total. <em>A Bug's Life</em> then went on to gross twice as much over the more lucrative Thanksgiving through New Years holiday period. Even back then, Disney got the better date and DreamWorks had to make do with trying to get as much as they could out of the slow month of October.</p></div>		</li>
