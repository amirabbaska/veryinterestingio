			<div class="markdown"><p>In fact, here in Italy, we consider it a peninsula. We even call it &quot;THE peninsula&quot;.</p>
<p>In the world it's not common to call it &quot;Italian peninsula&quot; because would be useless: there is only a state so you can call it with its name (yeah, I know, there are 2 micro-states but you got the point).</p>
<p>For the Iberian Peninsula it's different, because there are 2 states (Spain and Portugal) so it's useful to have a name for the couple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the argument above was that Spain-Portugal has a thin neck connected to France with a bigger body at the bottom/left. Florida and Italy do not have a thin neck on the top with a thick body at the bottom.  This theory fails because Korean Peninsula is still called a Peninsula even though it's like Italy and Florida. I think it's all arbitrary BS. Someone decided to call some pieces of land peninsula and some other people never called other similar lands peninsula.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aren't Florida and Italy on peninsulas though? It's just that the state/country themselves are not peninsulas because they are political/administrative entities.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The etymology does help bring back the discussion to focusing on important physical characteristics, but I'm not sure &quot;pinching&quot; holds up as <em>the</em> defining characteristic in many cases.</p>
<p>The Italian, Korea and Michigan peninsulas aren't pinched, at least not in the way Iberia is, but they are unusually long, protruding areas that stand out from the rest of landmass.</p>
<p>Alaska is an example that clearly fits the &quot;three sides surrounded by water&quot; rule (is that really a rule?), but it seems to flow so smoothly from Canada that it just looks more like a natural corner of the continent.</p>
<p>After re-reading your comment where you state that relationship to the original landmass is important, I don't know if I agree or disagree based on what I wrote earlier. It seems like the same shaped landmass could be more or less like a peninsula depending on how it's oriented toward the greater landmass, and the shape of the mainland as well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is very accurately, in Swedish the word peninsula would translate to half-island, which is exactly what these types of land usually are</p></div>		</li>
