			<div class="markdown"><p>That's... actually a <em>really</em> good question :)</p>
<p>The smoke released from those and other fires in the US is certainly playing a major role in regional radiative forcing and influencing the weather patterns over North America. These patterns are <em>critical</em> for helping to interact with and steer both Katia and Irwin. I think it's a fascinating question to ask how Irma's forecast track might be affected if you remove those wildfire smoke contributions from the equation.</p>
<p>Perhaps I should sketch out an NSF proposal while I answer comments here...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's the particulates and their influence on clouds systems. The heat impact is probably negligible - it just doesn't affect the atmosphere too much.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question on the fires, although it may not be the proper thread, what is the major cause of all these fires?
I am assuming the large amount of rain the west coast saw last year allowed for much more vegetation growth than previous years. More vegetation=more kindling, coupled with severe weather patterns (I have literally never heard it thunder in LA until last week). Am I correct in this, or are there more prominent factors?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's been an extra dry summer, but a major reason is that humans put out fires. That causes all the undergrowth to build up, so when a fire really gets going, it stays going for a long time. There's conflicting evidence as to whether logging helps or hinders the fires - some say yes, some say no. </p>
<p>Adding onto the fact that there's a wave of super dead trees in the PNW from beetle infestations and east of the Cascades essentially becomes a massive pile of kindling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Sooo... Those kids throwing fireworks not only destroyed a large area of land, but the results of their actions are also screwing with hurricanes on the other side of the country? That's something to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>there are a LOT of fires going on right now. tho the number of large fires in the US has gone down over the past few days, with some new ones popping up and some being either extinguished or at leasted controlled enough to not be &quot;large&quot; fires anymore.  Its not one fire making changes, its all of them.</p>
