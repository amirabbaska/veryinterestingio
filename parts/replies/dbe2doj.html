<p>You should sand &quot;with the grain&quot; for best effects over all.</p>
<p>The grain in wood is laminations of wood fibre and resin. </p>
<p>If you use treated or seasoned wood you CAN go in circular patterns... But if you intend to oil/stain/wax or otherwise coat the wood you will end up with a hideous look.</p>
<p>Also...</p>
<p>No. Just... No. </p>
<p>SAND WITH THE GRAIN! </p>
<p>That lamination thing I mentioned? Sand against the grain and you'll remove the sap faster than the heart. You'll end up with a fingerprint look of ridges and furrows</p>
<p>To quote Bruicie... &quot;Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves.</p>
<p>Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.&quot;</p>
<p>In short... Sand with the grain.</p>
<p>Also.Your comment on OPs question... You made this shit up, right? Google &quot;light polarisation&quot;.</p>
<p>Peace.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So I've done some woodworking, very amateurish stuff, but I was wondering: for the first few lower grit sands does it really matter which direction(s) you sand in? I've just used a circular sand thing to smooth things out a little and then hand sand with a higher grit. Everything turned out fine as far as I could tell.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>TBH, no. It doesn't matter at the start too much. In fact, because most people use a 40ish grit to do &quot;spot work&quot; (removing rusty and dents) you'd be hard pressed to keep a straight line anyway. </p>
<p>Think of it like balancing a broom above your head. You use clumsy, big inputs to start with and work to smaller and smaller ones. Eventually, no-one sees the microscopic input needed to keep things perfect, precise and balanced.</p>
<p>I make weapons. I like to be able to see myself in the metal of blades. [This clever] (<a href="https://imgur.com/pKfajcw" target="_blank">https://imgur.com/pKfajcw</a>) is an example of what you can do given enough time. (Why so shiny? Because you can use it as a mirror to see behind you while still looking to the fore.)</p>
<p>For this example I used five different grit sand papers and a wet-dry paper too. </p>
<p>For the 80 grit I went up down, and 150 grit went side to side. For the 1000 and 5000 I went diagonally then on the 8000 and the wet-dry I went pommel to point.</p>
<p>It's the same for wood (and most life goals). Use corse actions to smooth things out at at the start, but the closer you are too your goal, the finer you need to be.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You are right. I am coming from an autobody background, which was where I learned about circular sanding. I work with wood in my spare time, but on a minor scale (crafts and such) so the same method works for me. Even for staining. But I use finer grits for my finishing as well (beings so small a scale), so negative effects are not pronounced so.</p>
<p>Also... cute Bruce Lee analogy.</p>
<p>I have to go remind myself what you mean by that last bit. I'll get back to you.</p>
<p>Edit: ...k. You're going to have to elaborate. My understanding of light physics is quite limited.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but you should keep your hand steady, and twerk circularly. My dentist said so.</p></div>		</li>
