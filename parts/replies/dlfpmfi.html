<p>How? The fireball itself would be fairly small, maybe a couple hundred meters in diameter, and there isn't any atmosphere for a pressure wave to propagate through. The EMP would be bad, yes, but there wouldn't be a blast wave like you see in science fiction movies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good point. I guess it comes down to where it's detonated. 200-30,000 miles above earth we have satellites and plenty of space debris to propagate a wave. Anything beyond that might be far enough away for something catastrophic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The debris density in orbit is nowhere near high enough to propagate a blast wave. I think you are underestimating just how big and empty space is, even near the earth.</p></div>		</li>
