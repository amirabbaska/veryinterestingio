			<div class="markdown"><p>I find it interesting how this is basically reversed for birds.  Tiny herbivores, mid-size omnivores, large carnivores.  I mean, it makes sense, but it just shows how the same rules generate very different results in a different environment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah but neither of them can fly, that's just more evidence that different environments influence evolutionary trends. Having large carnivores isn't endemic to birds instead it's the flying.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, but flightless birds occupy a totally differint ecological niche, on top of experiencing very differint evolutionary pressures, in terms of biomechanical needs, from all other birds.</p>
<p>They really are not comparable at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I imagine the larger herbivores have a better chance of fighting off predators and then living long enough to reproduce, meaning that over time they would get bigger and bigger since the small ones of that species would be killed before they can reproduce. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, but there's been some research to suggest that civilization has already begun change humans. Archeological and peleontological evidence suggest 2 things:</p>
<p>1) Humans, over the past 10 000 years, might have become slightly less homocidal</p>
<p>2) Over the past 5 000 years, economic theory, the idea of money and resource lending and usury even in its ancient forms have supercharged our behaviours for future planning. Humans may be more capable and amenable to deferring short term gains for long term reward. The theory goes that records we have of transactions from 4-6000 years ago show effective interest rates for goods were at least 300% per annum. You would consider yourself lucky if you could get 15% ROI on a modern stock market</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We still do live by that standard. But it should really be</p>
<p>&quot;Survival of the most well adapted to the environment they are living in&quot;</p>
<p>As it paints a more accurate mental image than fittest which can be misleading. </p>
<p>If you think about illness in society, reproductive success and also our inability to regulate our behaviour to not totally destroy the environment we are living in those rules still apply.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you have the most grandchildren (who have the most grandchildren...) you are the fittest.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! This is what the part about primary/secondary/tertiary consumers refers to. Carnivores would have a much harder time getting that large because the biomass available to them in the form of consumable meat is much less than what an herbivore has at its disposal.</p></div>		</li>
