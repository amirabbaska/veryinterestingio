			<div class="markdown"><p>Some safeguards, but they do get cut sometimes.  That is a picture of a fiberoptic cable that goes from Australia to usa. It has some metal wire surrounding the fibre for protection. It is all of 6 fibers that can handle 42 Tbps.  Some times it is buried, but most times it is just laid on the ocean floor.  Left to right is the progression of layers. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The signal only goes so far, so most undersea network cables will have a powered signal repeater every X distance (I Don't remember the distance)</p>
<p>Its also usually not 1 cable, but even in a single &quot;cable&quot; there will be a dozen or more Fibers which each can carry separate signals, and through the use of different wavelengths (colors), each fiber can carry different connections.</p>
<p>Effectively, its so damn expensive to run these cables, they stuff as many fibers and wavelengths as possible in there to get their money's worth.</p>
