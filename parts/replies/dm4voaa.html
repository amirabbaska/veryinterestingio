			<div class="markdown"><p>I work in early intervention, and one of the things I do with the kiddos is to do a repeated task with them. I'll hide a toy under a cloth, they hesitantly pick it up to find it, and see it. Usually not a huge reaction but I hype it up. Then we do it again. This time they're so excited and quick to pull the cloth and have a great big reaction and we both cheer. Then I'll pretend to cover it for a third time but I secretly hold it instead so it's not under the cloth. The kid will snatched that cloth up so quick, &quot;ah ho ho! This game is so fun and I know what will happen&quot; but wait...it's not there...the big excited smile turns into confusion. They knew for sure that toy should have been under the cloth and they are very unsure now and worried looking. They start to uncertainly look around, and I bring it out where the cloth was saying, &quot;There it is!&quot; And there smile returns because it was right where they thought it was all along.</p></div>		</li>

She thinks it's hilarious, and it kind of is because she loves it so much.</p></div>		</li>

It seems then that the children could just be expecting the pattern of one puppet receiving more to continue. Regardless of who was more dominant. </p></div>		</li>

<p>the Toddler brain thrives on predictability.
Facing a world that can be scary and unpredictable (and having a sort of inborn biological drive to learn about the world through positive and negative feedback) the toddler quickly fixes on anything that has a predictable positive result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I used to babysit a lovely toddler girl whose parents were totally fucked up and progressively over a year her life situation became more and more unpredictable. By the end she was becoming more and more insular and less happy. Fucked up people ruin their children just by being themselves even if there aren't drugs in the house or physical violence. Breaks my heart because she used to take a little toy purse over her arm and pull kleenex and put them into it then carry it around.</p>
<p>I remember right before we stopped taking care of her she used to come to our door bang on it, walk in the door, blow a kiss to her mom or dad, march into the house, pulling me along, pull her shoes off like she was in a hurry, throw her coat off one arm at a time all the while making progress down the hall way, grab her little stool, sit down on it in front of the fridge making her exaggerated &quot;AHHHHH&quot; sound she picked up imitating us, moved a few magnetic letters around dramatically, gestured to have me sit next to her and then the day could begin.</p>
<p>It was so ritualistic. She craved the stable environment so badly. Made me cry when I realized what was happening in her life. Now she's living somewhere that considers nearby Thunder Bay a big city. I can't bring myself to facebook whats come of her.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's the deal. The social workers in my area were involved in her life (the mother). Their idea was to give her money to go home, out of their jurisdiction back into butt fuck nowhereland with her crazy family as 'support'.</p>
<p>I'm not the least bit enthused about dealing with social workers since the stories the girl said about how they were where she came from was even worse and are already on top of this and doing a erm... bang up job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There should also be mention that the same result can be had from negative reactions if it still nets in interaction. As in intentionally doing something an adult/parent may deem bad so long as it results in said person giving them attention. </p>
<p>Toddlers aren't just looking for positives, but exploring overall boundaries and developing cognitive skills based on their perception of others responses.</p>
<p>In the case of a kid playing &quot;fetch,&quot; they're repeating an action to inadvertently learn the constant. If I bring you a toy you'll throw it and give me &quot;x&quot; (attention, affirmation, a smile, whatever they're seeking to confirm). </p>
<p>It may sound strange but a toddler is (basically) no different than a puppy. They must be trained (potty, eating times, play times, bed times and obedience/behaviors) and you repeat until it sticks and reinforce positives with &quot;treats&quot; and negatives with &quot;consequence.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>Which is why my niece just looks at you, smiles and then keeps doing what she wants to do, when you tell her to not do it. She wants to know how far she can go before you grab her and move her away from the thing she might break or hurt herself with.</p>
<p>Then again, she's extremely bullheaded even for a child, so maybe it's just her character coming through.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's my daughter, as well. We've gotten her to stop doing a few things (like trying to knock over the trash), but she's a little boundary pusher. She wants to see how far she can go with a smile on her face. I suppose it's karma since I'm a stubborn bitch. I should apologize to my mother....</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup.  If they can't get positive attention then negative attention is far better than no attention at all.</p>
<p>My cat is the same way as are most adults on the internet.  We all just need our feedback loops and we'll take what we can get.  </p></div>		</li>
