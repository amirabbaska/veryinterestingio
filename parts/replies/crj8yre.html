			<div class="markdown"><p>The method you are referring to is known as 'Brute Force'. It works like this. Say a combination to a lock is 4 digits. The brute force method would call for trying every single possible combination until you get it correct (0001 to 9999). However, say you know that the lock your trying to decode belongs to a very simple minded person that always used their date of birth as a combination. You've narrowed down the choices to just 1 combination and saved time. You wouldn't have a good measure of how much time you've really saved without the context of brute force. It's basically a standard used to answer this question. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When we moved into our new house there was a key safe but we didn't know the code. </p>
<p>1-9 keys. 0001. 0002. 0003. 0004. It would've took forever. </p>
<p>So I used logic. Aha! Each key can only be pressed once, and it <em>doesn't</em> matter in which order. Then the person we got the house from was somewhere in his 50s... I guessed it'd be a birthday. 1951. 1952. 1953. </p>
<p>It took less than 10 tries! I felt like Alan Turing for days. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The 'simple-minded' person attack is also known as the dictionary attack, where the most common passwords in reality are stored in it.  Some dictionaries have billions or even trillions of combinations (for long passwords and such, not 4 digit numbers).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The method that takes years is called brute forcing. The computer runs through every combination until it finds one that works. With the nature of the enigma machine known, so using certain exploits, this process would take thousands of years to simply guess the right answer. The other option is using every exploit known, for each exploit drastically reduces the number of possible combinations. This is an important lesson in explaining how cryptography works as it shows why brute forcing is not a viable means for most cracks.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's dependent on having some amount of known plaintext. Which, admittedly was a fact when dealing with Enigma traffic. If you don't have a segment of known plaintext but do have some knowledge of the plaintext, you can use modern statistical techniques combined with a slight amount of brute force to break Enigma relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Using the enigma-suite software, running on an old first gen Pentium 4, I was able to break a message enciphered with a Heer/Luftwaffe Enigma (three rotor, with a selection of five rotors) in one day. If you used better processors, and parallelized the cracking (one process for each configuration of rotors and reflectors) you'd get it done much faster.</p></div>		</li>
