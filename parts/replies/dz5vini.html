			<div class="markdown"><p>Devils Tower is a good example of climbing equipment progression. From wooden ladders, Pitons to less destructive modern techniques. I highly recommend seeing it if you ever get the chance.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wonderful documentary going through the evolution of climbing. It should be on netflix if they haven't removed it for some silly reason.</p>

<p>based on a true story(sub titled, but excellent acting) shows the end of the golden age of climbing and they use pitons.</p>
<p>(incredible ending, which might make you tear up a bit and yes true.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can see it from the loop trail (and driving into the park) quite easily. It's a great place! Just be respectful--it has a lot of significance to a native american tribe, so please don't go too far off the trail.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer.</p>
<p>For just a little more detail: </p>
<p>Bolts are the most commonly used form of protection for outdoor climbing. Bolts last for decades once they're placed. So, when somebody puts up a line of bolts, it defines a specific route that later climbers follow to get up the cliff. Guidebooks tell you where to find bolted lines and how difficult each one is.</p>
<p>This style of ascent is called &quot;sport climbing&quot;. To do this, the only hardware that climbers need to carry up the wall with them are &quot;quickdraws&quot;. A quickdraw is two carabiners joined by a short nylon sling, and it is used to connect the climber's rope to a preexisting bolt. The quickdraws are retrieved while lowering off the climb or on the way up by a second climber.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Who maintains the bolts?  That is, even if they last for decades, is someone associated with the park tasked with performing routine safety checks?  Or do climbers simply hope that the bolts they're connecting to are secure?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Usually a non profit/volunteer organization takes care of maintenance on public lands. Each area is unique in this way. It’s common for highly trafficked routes to be inspected and replaced more frequently. The bolts are usually initially put up by the first ascentionist. </p>
<p>It’s worth noting that not all climbing areas allow bolts. It’s important to refer to local ethical code before showing up to a cliff with a drill. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>More popular areas have locals or more organized groups that take donations and maintain them. Less popular areas get less maintenance. Climbers should know and be prepared for what they are getting into.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Typically every climber will either carry a few extras to replace any that need it, or as is more common, make a note of them and report it to the local climbing group who will make an expedition to replace the bolts needed.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I don't climb anymore and all my experience was when I was a teenager with the cadet program.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pitons are definitely still used regularly, and are removable and reusable depending on the type and placement.  Old fixed pins are often trustworthy and sometimes important protection for hard moves on free climbs.  Just thought I should add this.</p></div>		</li>
