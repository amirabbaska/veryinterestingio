			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting... I am a sleep talker. Big time. Some nights are worse than others. </p>
<p>My Nana used to correlate my &quot;food intake time&quot; with my sleep talking. She had a hard rule that I was not allowed to be fed after a certain time... Usually about 7pm. Not even a snack like a cookie and milk or an orange.  It was like she thought I was a freaking Gremlin.</p>
<p>My dad has told me that, when I was a kid, upon bed check, he would sometimes catch me talking in my sleep. He said that, sometimes, he would settle into the chair next to my bed and have full on conversations with me. The next morning, I had zero recollection of the conversation, or of what I was even dreaming about.</p>
<p>As for confessions, I don't believe I ever confessed anything while asleep. Then again, I am not really much of a trouble maker, so not much to confess, I suppose.... Unless confessing that I hate my effing job is something? (See below...)</p>
<p>My husband often is awoken to me sleep talking. He sleeps lightly. I can sleep &quot;soundly&quot; in the middle of a rock concert. At my last job, he spent many a nights waking me up at 4am to break me out of a nightmare.... Asking, &quot;WHO the hell are you cussing so angrily at?&quot; And apparently, I am VERY bossy and controlling when I am sleeping. What is <em>that</em> all about?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My one of my exes talked in her sleep. She always said short things, but funny. The one I remember most is when she was like &quot;hehehe... silly pedophiles&quot;. But she says weird things. It's almost always like hearing some short snippet of a conversation. When I woke her up during it she'd usually give a short description of what was going on and go right back to sleep, but never remembered it the next day.</p>
<p>I have my own set of sleeping issues. I suffer from sleep paralysis and sometimes if I'm taking a really intense action in a dream I'll wake up doing it (like throwing a punch or jumping out of the way of a bus). Strangely I'd much rather do that than sleep talk.</p>
<p>If sleep talking and sleep paralysis are both problems with the paralyzing affect, I can tell you what helped with my sleep paralysis. One, don't sleep on your back. I found out that it's common for other people to get it on their back and I was a back sleeper, since switching to my side it has become much better. Also both not letting yourself get too tired nor oversleeping helps. I'm terrible at keeping a schedule so that doesn't work for me, but when I do manage to lock into a schedule for a bit it seems to keep most of the sleep paralysis at bay.</p>
<p>Of course I have a ton of weird sleep things (most of which don't cause me enough problems to do anything about, only the insomnia/hypersomnia really bother me), like I fall into a state that's half dreaming and half a wake if I sleep a lot, especially if I do it in a bright area. So your mileage might definitely vary.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am a sleep talker, sleep walker and sleep eater.</p>
<p>My weirdest ones was waking up my boyfriend to tell him &quot;Mara told me to tell you that the world is ending because the cars are eating themselves&quot;</p>
<p>Waking up, walking into the kitchen, grabbing a plate, and handing it to him while saying &quot;Here, you need this&quot; then going back to sleep.</p>
<p>Waking up at my boyfriend and yelling at him because &quot;He was making the pillow dirty&quot;</p>
<p>Telling my boyfriend that &quot;Lovers (my cat) didn't want me because he didn't want to learn to drive&quot;</p>
<p>And lastly, waking up sitting straight up on the couch with an empty tub of butter in my lap with an empty cheese wrapper inside of it.</p>
<p>There was also an incident of screaming at my ex about something about &quot;THEY'RE TAKING THE POPCORN TO DELEWARE!!!!&quot;  And also screaming at him about some nonexistent ceramic vase.</p>
<p>I have more experiences but those are the best of them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>hehehe... silly pedophiles &gt; I can relate to the snippets of weirdness, LOL! I can tell you that my nightmares were usually related to my work mates.... A handful of them were seriously awful to deal with.</p>

<p>Sleep paralysis -  I never wish to experience this. Ever. I have read too many paranormal type stories. I don't like the idea of not being able to control my body. On you preferring SP.... Are you scared you are going reveal a horrible secret? </p>
<p>I am perfect (<em>snort</em>)... so sleep talking is just a nuisance or plain entertaining. However, If I jumped out of the bedroom window or punched my husband in the face while &quot;out cold&quot;, I would pay for it. I have a giant, climbing rosebush outside the window. My husband startles easily when sleeping so, if I woke him up with a punch to the nose, his reaction might be to wake up and go right into protection mode, LOL. </p>
<p>The half and half sleep/awake thing rings a bell with me. It's definitely a strange feeling.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had a roommate who was a sleeptalker, he didn't say much or anything remarkable most of the times. But once he mentioned a girl's name.</p>
<p>When I questioned him about her the next day, his face went red and asked how the hell did I know her name. After laughing a lot at how dumbfounded he was, I explained to him. He wanted to know if he had said anything else but he had not. I never got to know who she was and why he got so embarassed about that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of a NSFW story of mine that almost ended a relationship. </p>
<p>I know I sleep talk, used to sleep walk, and sometimes thrash around in my sleep. What I found out from here is that I sleep masturbate too. I woke her up in the middle of night, both hands going, working the shaft and the boys (something I never do in a conscious state) she said she was sort of getting into it until I said a friends name. Oh boy, she waited until morning to start yelling at me, thought I was cheating, didn't talk to me for days for something I did in my sleep. It's a good laugh now ¯_(ツ)_/¯</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I remember from my high school psych class, when you're asleep the regions of your brain associated with morality are inactive. Meanwhile the amygdala, which is responsible for aggression and bitchiness is very active. So  that could be why sleeping you cusses people out lol</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of those individuals who can sustain a full conversation in my sleep.  But it's usually about some absolutely random topic.  During a ski trip, I woke up my roommate at 3am telling him &quot;Bro, hurry up, get up, get dressed, we're gonna a be late for the trolley.&quot;. And he asked &quot;What Trolley?&quot; And I just waited a second and apparently slowly replied &quot;Theeeeeeeeeee trolley.&quot;</p>
<p>I have several other incidents in the past.  One I'll never forgot is I woke up while sleep talking, but couldn't prevent myself my stopping.  I wish this was a joke, but I was on a youth trip with my church (I was a youth at the time) and about 300 people had to scatter around and sleep In this church.  Suddenly I just woke up, aware I was awake, but without any control screamed &quot;I WILL EAT YOU.&quot;. Out of pure embarrassment I sank my head in my pillow and pretended to be asleep, but everyone woke up by then.</p>
<p>My greatest curiosity is how come I woke up, was able to know I was awake, but was unable to stop sleep talking, even while awake?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Me and my brother are both very active sleepers, talking and occasionally waking about. My dad loves to retell a story  about how we jabbering away as kids shouting from our bedrooms to each other like furbies talking nonsense.</p>
<p>For me I think it's lightened up a bit as I got older but now my kids are doing it. My poor husband wasn't really around anyone that talked or got up in their sleep before so he had a very steep learning curve to adjust to!</p>
<p>I've always wondered why it happens. I used to think it was stress or change related as it was always noted that I seemed to do it more in new places or situations, but in hindsight it was because I was around new people that told me about it after because it was a hilarious novelty for them (holidays or camping trips or sleep overs) or I'd wake up disorientated in different rooms (new places etc.)</p>
<p>As I've gotten older I've definitely gotten a lot more anxious (to the point where I am medicated now for that) and I think that might have been a reason why it eased off a little, because I had a lot of trouble sleeping and staying asleep because I'd be thinking and dwelling on things. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would love an explanation for that last bit as well! I've always talked or at least mumbled in my sleep since I was a toddler. In recent years though I've been having conversations with my boyfriend in my sleep, wake up mid-convo and am adamant that I'm awake and not sleep talking (because my bf will start laughing at whatever ridiculous thing I'm saying and telling me I'm sleep talking), and then moments later I seem to fully wake up and have no idea what I was just talking about with him. It's the strangest thing. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Couple years ago I dreamt that I was in a group project for uni, and Groupmate A had asked me for advice. She didn't follow it and the lecturer gave her the exact same advice I had given her before. Dreamt she went all bonkers on me and I yelled &quot;I'M NOT GONNA GET INVOLVED WITH YOUR SHIT!1!1!1!!!&quot; </p>
<p>Woke up mid-sentence and my ex at the time went &quot;Wuuuuuh?!?!&quot;</p>
<p>Another time I remember waking up mid-sentence was: &quot;DRUM AND BASS IS NOT TECHNO!&quot; and fell back asleep split second after. My friend sharing the bed took the piss out of me till this day for that. </p>
<p>tldr; would like explanation for waking up in the middle of sleep talking!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See, I imagine if you were conducting my husband's sleep studies years ago, you might have picked up on the fact that normal people <em>don't</em> have full conversations and do chores in their sleep and sometimes wake up while beating the crap out of their wives.</p>
<p>Tear in the spinal dura from T1-T3. When it was finally imaged, it looked like ruptured pantyhose. It took two years and four hospitals and over 20 doctors and two exploratory surgeries to properly diagnose and the tear was probably a lot smaller <em>before</em> the hospital referred him to a chiropractor. (Yeah. &quot;Fuck if I know, get your back tweaked.&quot;) First it was because he was fat. Then he lost the weight and they said it was because he <em>used to be</em> fat. Then they said he was faking it for pills because he said he was in a lot of pain. Also, they said he was malingering because for some reason his headaches and double vision went away when he laid down. Like all of this was his Search for the Ultimate Nap.</p>
<p>To be fair, he almost did get the Ultimate Nap.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh yeah, thanks for asking. He would get into a recurring nightmare where he was defending himself against his dad or fighting with his dad. For a long time I only slept when he was awake or at work. I can take hits (especially if his brain gets the smug satisfaction of punching that asshole, believe me), but hitting me is the last thing he would ever do. He would wake up with me reacting in understandable pain and it would just destroy him. It's a lot rarer now.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of sleep therapies - someone mentioned <em>Sleepwalk With Me</em> and we were already fans of Mike Birbiglia. So we had an idea of how to address the symptoms, and he's got a therapist who works with adult survivors of child abuse. We tweaked meds. This is after surgeries and diagnosis, too - it's one of the lingering effects of his TBI, but the brain has a remarkable ability to heal. If my husband is taken seriously as a patient, he really throws himself into recovery and helping him recover has pretty much been my job as well for a while.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We thought it was wrong, we don't do that bullshit, but we were so desperate to believe it was psychosomatic or <em>anything</em> at that point just so it would stop. As far as the chiropractor knew, doctors (except his GP) were saying it wasn't a &quot;real&quot; problem. My husband's had a couple years of medical school so we can't plead ignorance on that front. We were just hoping for a placebo effect or maybe it's a tweaked nerve or something after all.</p></div>		</li>
