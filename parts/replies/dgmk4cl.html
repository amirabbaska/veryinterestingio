			<div class="markdown"><p>I have ADHD and take Adderall.
If I take it with water on an empty stomach it works as intended.
If I take it after a meal it takes a long time to work.
If I take it with orange juice or Mountain Dew it doesn't work at all.   </p>
<p>TLDR: Stomach contents have a significant impact on the efficacy of Adderall. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, this is my experience with it as well. </p>
<p>This is because the amphetamine molecules are fairly easy to ionize, the more acidic the conditions the more of the amphetamines will be charged with a proton and thus not absorbed into the mucosa. </p>
<p>I actually tried taking it with tums sometimes to increase the effect and it seemed to have a slight effect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That explains why it didn't do much for one all-nighter in college, despite being a godsend the other handful of times I had to: I was drinking an energy drink at the time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Considering it's mostly water and the same consistency among other things, probably. Still depends on the medication, maybe the heat effects if or caffeine could interact with the drug (e.g. stimulants)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coffee is more acidic than tea (pH of 4.5 vs pH of 5 for black tea)</p>
<p>But both of those are variable depending on how long you steep them for and other things. </p>
<p>But dear god, you people are taking adderall with caffeine? That's like super not a great idea. </p>
<p>I've done it, but generally when I'm on the tail end of my dose. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Right, yeah that is a gray area. We know soda pop also doesnt travel through the stomach as fast either, but not as slow as a smoothie. I'm not sure about tea/coffee. Good question! </p></div>		</li>
