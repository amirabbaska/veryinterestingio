<p>The demand curve for diamonds is not nearly as high, but not very many are sold. So you are seeing the amount people are willing to pay for a very small number of diamonds.</p>

<p>People are willing to pay for a relatively common rock because one company bought all of them and told them they should.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's exactly what I wanted to add, there is a huge monopoly. It's not that they produce a very small number of diamonds, but that they sell a small number unrelated to the actual production and use marketing to make people see them as something rare and exclusive.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Diamond are not useless. You might say that about diamonds in jewelry.
Most diamonds are used in industrial applications like cutting, drilling and polishing.
70% of mined diamonds are used for industrial applications.
Most industrial diamonds are synthetically 97%. So jewelry diamonds are only 1% of the diamond market by weight not by value.</p>
<p>Synthetic diamonds can be used in jewelry but with good markting diamond mining companies have created a difference between the two types in consumer minds.</p>
<p>Diamond is also the best know material to use in semiconductor. There are companies that are trying to bring it to market.
A diamond covered cellphone display would alos be hard to scratch.</p></div>		</li>
