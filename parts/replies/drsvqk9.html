<p>Word to the wise, for any outdoorsy people on this thread: buy a satellite phone</p>

<p>Unless you need the ability to talk, get a <a href="https://www.rei.com/product/843146/acr-electronics-resqlink-gps-personal-locator-beacon" target="_blank">rescue beacon.</a> Satellite phones and plans are expensive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Friend of mine was away on fieldwork down one of the most remote highways on the continent. They got a flat tire halfway between the last gas station and the next (a few hundred kilometres). The satellite phone couldn't fix a signal through the <em>clouds</em>, let alone foliage. Turned out to be a useless brick of plastic.</p></div>		</li>

<p>An <a href="http://www.epirb.com/" target="_blank">EPIRB</a> (PLB) is a major event and even if GPS is unable to lock, the satellite will get you to with in 2x2km based on Doppler direction finding.  Expect the cavalry to be coming ASAP, they don't fuck around with this.  </p>
<p>These uplink with a signal about 6dB stronger than a typical cellphone and use a much narrower modulation.  A typical cellphone needs a -110 dBm or better signal to work due to it being a much wider signal (wider bandwidth has more background noise in it), where as the EPIRB can work down to -140 dBm.  Couple this with higher power and you have a really good chance of being found in hours.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How are these monitored and responded to? Does the company that makes them monitor them like a security system company and they have to locate it and notify a local agency, or does the beacon just like send out a distress call on some kind of standard emergency channel that a local emergency response agency can pick up?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And please follow the instructions and register your beacon properly. It's free(at least in the US, and probably most other countries) and will allow them to know who to call if it gets set off so they can find out whats going on that much faster. And if your kids are playing with it so it can get turned off so they can search for real emergencies.</p>
<p>Also most require a battery replacement every 5 years, it's generally in the $120-150 range. Which is still a pretty good deal for 5 years. </p></div>		</li>
