<p>The reason those pets have those features in the first place is because when humans were domesticating animals we subconsciously fed &quot;cute&quot; animals more (since they triggered our brain's cute sensors so we liked them more), letting those animals reproduce more and having those traits dominate over time.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Could be, but also remember that evolution only accounts for what works, and there's easily a &quot;misfire&quot; that happens when we look at other animals. Also, we've been breeding dogs and cats for thousands of years and it's probably no surprise that we subconsciously bred traits that were cute to us. </p></div>		</li>
