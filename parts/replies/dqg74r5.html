			<div class="markdown"><p>Also I just want to say as well. In treatment, the exposure is to the anxiety, without the safety behaviours. So in the moment it's likely not going to feel good and it's not meant to....</p>
<p>Patients should instead engage in alternative behaviours to manage the anxiety such as breathing, being externally focused etc.</p>
<p>Most people have some anxiety in their lives and exposure therapy works in just the same way. So for example someone with a fear of public speaking may worry excessively as a way to deal with the anxiety. But the worrying will only decrease the anxiety for a very brief period of time and ultimately will increase the anxiety in the long term. Instead the person should drop the behaviour of worrying and engage in the alternative behaviours such as breathing, externally focusing etc. to help slightly with the anxiety. But as I said, it's not meant to feel good in the moment, it's future relief from the anxiety. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I’ve used CBT and exposure therapy. It is VERY uncomfortable doing exposure exercises but it is the most effective way to treat anxiety. I noticed a crazy amount of improvement in just a couple weeks. </p>
<p>It takes strength and self discipline. But it works. You can’t avoid or go around anxiety to avoid it. You have to go through it to treat yourself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, psychogenic exoriation (compulsive skin picking) is often a habit disorder of people with bdd. Trichotillomania (hair pulling) is also a behaviour some patients engage in. </p>
<p>When bdd patients start to feel better about their appearance through CBT, these bevahiours tend to stop.</p></div>		</li>
