			<div class="markdown"><p>How much total is grafted skin and where did it come from? I'd been wondering if it would lose water quicker or hold onto it longer because of that &quot;space&quot; issue. There are multiple techniques both mechanically and organically that break up scar tissue if that's a contributing factor. The grafts might be involved? It's semi educated guesswork but the replaced skin would likely have a less seamless integration with the rest of the body politic and may be less able to access the water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was thinking the same thing. The way skin grafts heal is very different from other types of grafts, and they tend to heal imperfectly. Mine healed well, but they still aren't seamless with my natural skin</p></div>		</li>
