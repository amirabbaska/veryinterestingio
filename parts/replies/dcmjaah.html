<p>The universe is currently fairly rarefied (lots of space between stuff), and will become more rarefied over time.  We can extrapolate backward to a denser, hotter time, when there was lots of matter and energy per unit volume.  If we extrapolate back far enough, we arrive at a theoretical moment in time when this density was infinite, and we call this the moment of the Big Bang.  And that's as far back as we can meaningfully extrapolate.</p>
<p>The Big Bang was not an event at a point in space; it was an expansion, or lessening of density, that very rapidly happened everywhere.  And everywhere continues to expand.</p>
<p>There is an edge of the observable Universe that is dictated by what we can see.  This distance is determined by the speed of light.  What the Universe looks like beyond that edge depends on its geometry, but in all likelihood there is a great deal more of it, and it looks very similar to our own backyard.  It may be infinite.  Anything beyond the edge of the observable Universe is inaccessible, even in principle, to observation, but we can say a few likely and meaningful things about it.  For example, it probably does not have an edge in the sense of a place you can reach, then pass through.</p>
<p>If you go very quickly in a straight line forever, you will continue to observe the Universe expanding around you.  Eventually the stars will die out, and the galaxies around you will recede beyond an observational horizon, and you will be left alone in a dark, cold Universe.</p></div>		</li>
