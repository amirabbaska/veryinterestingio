			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a 20ish year old broken collar bone.  For the first time in my life it resurfaced as painful after sleeping through a coldfront night when I didn't turn the heat on.</p>
<p>have you ever been to the doctor or ER when they ask you to rate your pain on a scale of one to 10, I'd say this was an 8 or 9.   Hot shower after somehow getting myself in there when all I could think of was the pain worked for about an hour.</p>
<p>Then it came back from like 0-60.   I took a tylenol, it went away pretty quick but after that wore off about an hour later I took another one and repeated until I was worried about overdosing acetamidiphin in a day.</p>
<p>Switched to icey-hot ointment, that helped as well. </p>
<p>After the next night sleep woke up as if nothing was ever wrong in the first place. </p>
<p>Joys of getting old?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And maybe how old it is. My elbow got broke and fixed when I was 10 and it doesn’t bother me. My wrist and leg got broke in high school and they bother me. They also still have metal in them too. Could be a factor. I recommend taking up binge drinking. That or a bottle of aspirin a week, chew them. Other than that it’s just part of the dying process. </p></div>		</li>
