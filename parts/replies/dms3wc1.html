			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain how objects like microfibers, microbeads that are microns wide can interact with components of cellular mechanisms, which are nanometers wide? How can they even enter cells, which are on the same scale of size? Im having a hard time reconciling in my imagination the scale of these objects with how Im being told they interact. I know a pool noodle cant enter my eye and influence how it works because theyre  the same order of size (could crush my eye, but outright destruction doesnt seem to be the concern here). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For sure! The entire fiber/microbead is not the actor, it's the breakdown products that are at play in this case. Microbeads are dangerous for other reasons when not broken down (fish, amphibians, and reptiles eat them, oh no!). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some evidence for it being a factor, but there is no question that poor diets (with excess calories of the wrong type) and sedentary lives with decreased burst activities, are the major driving forces behind obesity.
