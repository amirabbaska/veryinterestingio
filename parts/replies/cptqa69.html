			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Mankind always thought he was smarter than sloths because while man had invented money, wars, and the digital watch, all the sloth had ever done is climb around on trees, eat, have sex, and shit. Sloths believed they were smarter than man for exactly the same reason.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>I thought I saw a video where sloths are covered in their own excrement because of that long hair. I think that adds up as an advantage for sloths. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can, they just won't unless they have to because it's not really worth all the effort for such a gross meal with little meat.  There is a video posted on this thread a couple times showing a jungle cat going to great lengths to get one though.  So It definitely does happen.</p></div>		</li>
