			<div class="markdown"><p>Haha, my favourite planet has always been Saturn for no reason other than it is beautiful. As for problems in space, we just need to get our arses in gear and develop warp drive. I want to get out there and explore, damnit!! :D</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As an aside, the core-accretion model which makes up the first couple paragraphs of your explanation isn't considered 100% definitive as it has difficulty in explaining non-solar system configurations, though its major issue is that the progression from grains to planetisimals currently doesn't work.</p>
<p>There are various other planetary formation models. The resident planet-formation theoretician and his phd student (my friend) in my department are working on Tidal-downsizing. Here's a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08329" target="_blank">link</a> to my friends first paper.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah, core accretion can easily explain pretty much any solar system configuration aside from super long period supermassive giant planets which are likely caused through the 'other' leading theory on giant planet formation - basically where giant planets are thought to form in the same way that stars do - disc instability.</p>
<p>Nothing is considered to be 100% definitive in planetary formation but the methods I used allowed for the formation of all kinds of planets - small to massive bodies anywhere from short period to long period. The key is understanding the way that planets interact with the gas disc and how they migrate within it. Originally we just knew about Type I and Type II migration - basically Type I makes everything get drag and fall into the star, Type II is where a planet is big enough to carve out a gap in the disc. The extra key is modifying Type I migration to include the temperature and pressure dependant interactions which means simulating the gas disc in detail as well as the solid body disc.</p>
<p>You're right in that some of the early parts where grains grow to planetesimals aren't very well understood, largely as that snapshot is nigh on impossible to observe due largely to the narrow timeframe. I stayed away from that part thought and concentrated on oligarchic growth-&gt;when the gas disc had been evaporated/accreted.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No doubt you're right, it's been awhile since I went to the theory astro-ph (I can only take the discussion of meshes, kernals and all the rest for so long) and what I said was what I remembered from my friends explanation of his work.</p></div>		</li>
