<p>If the size of something is changed by a factor of k, its surface area is squared (k^(2)) and its volume is cubed (k^(3)). </p>

<p>Tangentially related, it's my pet peeve that the BMI formula gets this wrong. The formula of the &quot;body mass index&quot; is:</p>
<p>BMI = m/h^2</p>
<p>As you can see, this doesn't jive with the above. For two persons of equal proportions, one tall and one short, their BMI should be identical. But since mass scales with h^(3), and BMI divides with h^(2), the results are inconsistent.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, the BMI &quot;was devised [...] from 1830 to 1850&quot;. I think this is related to why the formula is simplistic and wrong.</p>
<p>In truth, mass does not quite scale with h^(3), because tissue does not grow proportionally in all directions. However, it does scale faster than h^(2). A good number might be around h^(2.6). But that makes for difficult calculations.</p>
<p>In the eighteen-hundreds, there weren't computers, and h^2 must have been much easier to calculate than h^(2.6). But that is no excuse today to not fix the formula, to remove this flaw.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, so basically what happens is that if you have a 180 cm tall person that weighs 75 kg, he has a BMI of 23.1, smack in the middle of the &quot;healthy&quot; range.</p>
<p>Scaling up by a factor of 1.111... for a 200 cm tall person, mass (proportionally) goes up to 103 kg, so the BMI ends up being 25.75, which is just slightly &quot;overweight&quot;.</p>
<p>So the formula naturally &quot;favours&quot; shorter people, which should not be a surprise considering it was devised in the 19th century when people were a bit shorter in average compared to today.</p>
<p>And the formula fails even harder when looking at some groups of people who are obviously physically quite fit and healthy. Jaromir Jagr, for example, has BMI of 28.6 according to wikipedia's stats (height 189 cm, weight 102 kg)... I suppose that makes him overweight, then.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your statement about BMI favoring shorter people &quot;which is not surprising because people in the 1800's were shorter on average&quot; not factual.  It has nothing to do with the starting high of those who created it.  It is a resultant of the math by using h^2 as a scale factor instead of h^2.x or whatever is a best fit.  If in the 1800's everyone was 7+ feet tall, the BMI index would still favor shorter people. </p></div>		</li>
