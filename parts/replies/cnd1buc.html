<p>If I wanted to try some AI programming, am I best off programming a bot in a game? Any suggestions for games which allow this in the TOS? None of the multiplayer games I play allow bots.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If you're wanting to do something in like a FPS, you might see if there is a way to add bots into Team Fortress.  I know you can program your own Quake 3 bots cause the whole code is open source now.</p>
