If it was moved out of its current orbit closer to the Sun, it could be something like the planet suggested, except for the fact that it will be too small to keep its water vapor over geologic time scales.  You'd need something closer to Earth sized to keep most of it.</p>
<p>So, I imagine that there could be a time period where there could be such a planet, although it does seem like it would be very rare for the right circumstances to make it possible and it would likely pick up at least some rocky or metal content.  But not necessarily enough to make more than a very small core.  You'd still mostly have your water world.  </p></div>		</li>
