			<div class="markdown"><p>Did quick math as I was curious.</p>
<p>Area of North and South America combined: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas" target="_blank">42,549,000 km^2</a></p>
<p>Volume of water in Lake Superior: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Superior" target="_blank">12,000 km^3</a></p>
<p>1 foot = 0.3048 m</p>
<p>Volume of water needed to fill Americas upto 1 foot = 42,549,000 * 0.0003048 = 12,968.94 km^3 ~= 12,000 km^3</p>
<p>Math checks out.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lake Baikal, by comparison, has more than twice the volume of Lake Superior and exceeds the volume of all the Great Lakes combined (even though it has less than half the surface area of Lake Superior).  Lake Baikal blows my mind, and I’m a bit obsessed with it.</p></div>		</li>
