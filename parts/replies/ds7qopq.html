			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>I'm still having trouble tracking down a primary source for the claim that 75% of Americans are dehydrated, though.</p>
<p>The first link has the claim, but doesn't have a reference for it (as far as I could tell). I was also unsure of the nature of that document. Where was it published and was it peer reviewed?</p>
<p>The second and third links were not quite as compelling I thought. </p>
<p>The second link was a single study commissioned by Sodastream. It was just a survey asking if participants children drank 6-8 glasses of water a day (needing 6-8 glasses of water a day is a myth).</p>
<p>The third, again sponsored by a bottled water association, was an unpublished survey. Again just asking participants how much water they drank, and repeating the 6-8 glasses per day myth.</p>
<p>Do you know of a good, independent, peer reviewed source for the claim most people are dehydrated? I'm still wondering whether this claim is a bit exaggerated.</p>
<p>Edit: since I'm asking for sources I guess I should provide some myself. Here is an article on the 8 glasses per day myth:</p>
