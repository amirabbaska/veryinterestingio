			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 24, it's been happening since I was a kid in elementary school. I am a paramedic now. I transport people with these type of complaints multiple times a day. Bottom line when they are discharged is idiopathic angina. Really nothing the hospital will do for such an intermittent problem without any chemical tracers to hunt down. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>angina should start in the chest and radiate out. you shouldn't really have angina as a 24 year old but ok whatever. Personally i've never seen fingernail pain that radiates to the heart but if you say so. </p>
<p>Btw, angina means cardiac type chest pain. Idiopathic angina means central chest pain with no known explanation. Where I work if someone is getting anginal symptoms they will always do an ECG.</p>
<p>Are you really telling me you're a paramedic who gets &quot;idiopathic angina&quot; and you've never even had an ecg done?</p>
<p>&quot;bottom line is when they're discharged with IA&quot;</p>
<p>You are telling me people with central chest pain are always suffering from idiopathic angina?</p>
<p>First off, angina is never really idiopathic. Thats not a satisfying diagnosis at all. Angina is the pain your myocardium feels when its starved of oxygen. I presume you're referring to prinzmetal's variant but that's not idiopathic. </p>
<p>You're telling me you have cardiac pain, you're a paramedic, and you think cardiac pain is no biggie.</p>
<p>I don't want to patronise you. Obviously you know what an MI is. I agree that the fact you've had it since a child suggests that its not likely to kill you right now and is probably prinzmetal's variant. Still, you're getting cardiac type chest pain, why not just do an ecg on yourself? ask for an echo? according to you, something is likely causing your heart muscles to become hypoxic occasionally. Where I come from that warrants investigation. </p>
<p>By the way, if you're really telling me you don't take cardiac pain seriously in your patients, I am very worried. They are not always discharged with idiopathic angina. That is totally ridiculous. A significant proportion of central chest pain is caused by MYOCARDIAL INFARCTIONS. That is a fact, where-ever you are in the world.</p>
<p>IF you have angina they should do a troponin blood test to rule out an MI. It takes no time at all. If its intermittent, you should be asked some questions, is it worse on exercise?  </p></div>		</li>
