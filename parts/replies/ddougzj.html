<p>Only the shit in it. The intestines itself don't smell, they are used to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casing_(sausage\)" target="_blank">sausages</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catgut" target="_blank">violin strings</a>, both of which smell fine.</p>

<p>I can tell you as a fact that it does not smell fine. I've smelled intestines getting prepared on multiple occasions and it literally smells like sewer. I can't believe people eat that crap.</p></div>		</li>
