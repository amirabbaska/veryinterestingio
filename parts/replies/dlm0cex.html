			<div class="markdown"><p>No.  Regular &quot;D&quot;rive.  (Also, this LX model had a &quot;S&quot; on the gearshift but Civics appear to have a separate button for &quot;Sport&quot; mode.)</p>
<p>*edit:  Nah, there really is a separate button for &quot;Sport&quot; mode, in models that are so equiped.  And &quot;Economy&quot; is yet another button.  And then &quot;S&quot; is indeed a separate thing, a position for the gearshift, and it apparently stands for &quot;S&quot;econd.  </p>
<p>Also, it's been confirmed that the fake shifts still occur when the LX gearshift is in &quot;S&quot;.  I don't know if the fake shifts occur in &quot;Sport&quot; mode.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nah the button is for economy mode. There's 3 different drive settings I guess you could call them. Regular drive and economy on cuts some of the performance of the engine and climate control to get better gas mileage. You can turn economy off and on at will, and my car is significantly quicker and puts out more cold air with it off. Sport mode bumps up the rpms of the engine and gives even more performance but uses more gas in the process. Idk about the civics, but my Accord has paddle shifters and kind of simulates individual gears. For the most part it's pretty continuous when accelerating from 0 to 60</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Economy&quot; mode is a separate button.  <a href="http://owners.honda.com/vehicles/information/2017/Civic-Sedan/manuals" target="_blank">http://owners.honda.com/vehicles/information/2017/Civic-Sedan/manuals</a></p>
<p>&quot;Sport&quot; mode is a separate button.  For both buttons, see page 5 in the following document:  <a href="http://techinfo.honda.com/rjanisis/pubs/QS/AH/ATBA1717OG/enu/ATBA1717OG.PDF" target="_blank">http://techinfo.honda.com/rjanisis/pubs/QS/AH/ATBA1717OG/enu/ATBA1717OG.PDF</a></p>
<p>See page 97 regarding the (S) on the shifter.  The &quot;S&quot; there is different from that &quot;Sport&quot; button.</p>
<p>According to the following document, that &quot;S&quot; on the shifter is expressly &quot;S&quot;econd.

			<div class="markdown"><p>same have a 16 Accord sport and paddle shifters set pre determined points in the CVT to go to when downshifting/upshifting. I always leave it in Econ, but still use the paddles in Econ. other day I drove it balls to the walls in S and paddling still could only get it down to 17 mpg </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not vehicles with hybrid synergy drive. My Lexus 400h has none of that simulates jerkiness and accelerates whilst holding the V6 at a constant RPM. Since its transmission is a <strong>planetary</strong> gear set with differentials the energy recovery unit doesn't have any belts or cones. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It accelerated faster because a CVT doesn't let up on the power, where as a conventional transmission does need to let up to shift. That sport mode is snake oil.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In &quot;D&quot; the trans generally does regular CVT things, holds rpm where it wants, dropping or increasing as throttle input changes. </p>
<p>If you use the flappy paddles in &quot;D&quot; is simulates gear changes. Going to &quot;S&quot; but no flappy paddles, the CVT still does normal CVT stuff but more aggressively, holding higher RPM longer, for instance. &quot;S&quot; with flappy paddles will hold &quot;gears&quot; and act like, well, a flappy paddle dual clutch. <em>Except</em> if you're driving sensibly but &quot;S&quot; and flappy paddles, the upshifts are like a traditional manual-the revs drop almost lazily compared to other modes. It's actually really cool how Honda made the Civic CVT much more sporty than the outgoing Accord CVT. As sporty as a CVT can get, anyway. </p>
