			<div class="markdown"><p>This is correct.  And the reason we don't make real helicopters using this design is that they would take a much larger area to land and take off.  A single rotor is compact, albeit hard to control.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another reason is the technology doesn't scale. On a plastic quad copter drone, the engines are simple electric motors and the drones can fly for 30 minutes or so. </p>
<p>To scale that up you'd need 4 helicopter engines burning jet fuel with 4 times the possible failure points, 4 times the maintenance time and costs, and one quarter the fuel economy. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, you can't autorotate a quadcopter. You need variable pitch in order to do that.</p>
<p>You can land a helicopter safely entirely without power (as long as you are starting from high up and moving forward). There's some cool videos out there showing entirely unpowered autorotation landings of very large, heavy helicopters.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but you have four times the power too, you don't need to hoon them at 100% the power of the original to get the same lift.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to this there are however some helicopters with coaxial counter-rotating rotors such as the <a href="http://www.russianhelicopters.aero/upload/im/resize/1c8dd4d0b6d92d25a9e8e5f1cabff092.jpeg" target="_blank">Ka-52</a> for example. This system makes the tail rotor unnecessary and maintains the dimensions of a normal helicopter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's actually a bit more compact than a traditional layout, which is the major selling point. The lack of a tail rotor makes designs like this ideal for operating in confined spaces, such as off the decks of ships.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They want to be able to tilt left-right as well as forward-backwards.  You need at least three rotors for that, but to balance the torque you need an even number of rotors, so four is the minimum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In principle you could do that with two, but you'd have to control blade pitch which would mean MUCH more mechanical complexity. That's what the Chinook helicopter does.</p></div>		</li>
