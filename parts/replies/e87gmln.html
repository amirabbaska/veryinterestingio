			<div class="markdown"><p>I tested mine with a K type thermocouple and it averaged to the temp I was expected (+- 2 degrees). (It would slowly increase from 345-355, then drop down to 340, then back up to 355, etc.) Old school gas oven. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Almost all home ovens cycle on and off, so the temperature will cycle up and down. Better ovens have smaller variations, worse ovens have bigger ones. </p>
<p>Get an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000DJUYR" target="_blank">oven thermometer</a> and you can make sure your oven is doing a good job/adjust the oven as needed to keep baking even.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Get a oven thermometer and see what you are really cooking at, then pull the temp control knob off the oven, and on the back side there is an adjustment...if you have a digital control, look it up in the manual...it will also be adjustable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not very in a lot of cases.  Probably +/- 25 degrees if you're in an apartment with an older oven.  Ovens also work by cycling the heat on and off, too, which causes further variance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth using something like a baking stone/steel can help keep the temp more steady (I think Alton Brown actually recommended bricks at one point).</p>
<p>But yeah the thermostats are just really inaccurate on a lot of them, when I bring something over to cook in my friend's oven I have to adjust recipes.</p></div>		</li>
