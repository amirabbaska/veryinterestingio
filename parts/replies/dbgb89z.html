			<div class="markdown"><p>In addition the interaction/annihilation would release gamma rays of specific energies. The most famous of which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron%E2%80%93positron_annihilation" target="_blank">electron/positron annihilation</a>. Which gives rise to two 511KEV gammas that fly off in opposite directions. If there was an appreciable scale of this happening, we would see 511KEV gammas all over the place.  There would also be gamma spectra for all the other particles annihilating. We do see some of the 511KEV gammas and astronomers are looking into it. It boils down to the <em>rate</em> at which this is happening. If there was equal amounts of matter and antimatter, I suspect we would see a lot higher rate of these events than we do and they would tend to peak in the direction of known colliding galaxies.</p>

<p>The annihilation of positrons leads to another type of cosmic gamma-ray source. The characteristic annihilation gamma-rays at 511 keV have been measured long ago in solar flares, and now throughout the interstellar medium of our Milky Way galaxy. But now a puzzle has appeared, as a surprising predominance of the central bulge region was determined. This requires either new positron sources or transport processes not yet known to us. In this paper we discuss instrumentation and data processing for cosmic gamma-ray spectroscopy, and the astrophysical issues and insights from these measurements. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question. A Leidenfrost-type effect would be less significant in a region as low-density as intergalactic space. Additionally, there are cases where it would almost certainly be overcome by the relative velocities of the gases or plasmas involved--for example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_galactic_nucleus#Relativistic_jets" target="_blank">relativistic jets in AGN</a> or <a href="http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/cosmos/R/ram+pressure+stripping" target="_blank">ram pressure stripping</a> in galaxies falling into galaxy clusters. The fact that we can observe these regions of high-intensity interaction between galaxies and their environment, and don't see a profusion of 511 keV emission indicates that there's not a matter-antimatter interface happening in any of those locations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Liedenfrost effect could happen. But there would still be the initial flashes of 511KEV when the galaxies first impacted. Don't forget, even near speed of light motion, the Liedenfrost effect could take thousands of years to establish an equilibrium. Think of the scale of a galaxy and how long they would interact before sufficient radiation pressure would build up to over come the momentum of the initial collision.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The CMB has a black body spectrum, which means it comprises light of many wavelengths; a continuum spectrum. Electron-positron annihilation produces line emission, which means photons of only a narrow range of wavelengths/energies. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It would have the same problem they are facing with conventional CMB and the big bang. The universe has not been around long enough for thermal equilibrium to establish with radiations traveling at the speed of light. For galaxies after the big bang the time is even shorter. We <em>would</em> see the spectral lines.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)#Motivations" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)#Motivations</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The situation is quite different in the big bang model without inflation, because gravitational expansion does not give the early universe enough time to equilibrate. In a big bang with only the matter and radiation known in the Standard Model, two widely separated regions of the observable universe cannot have equilibrated because they move apart from each other faster than the speed of light and thus have never come into causal contact. In the early Universe, it was not possible to send a light signal between the two regions. Because they have had no interaction, it is difficult to explain why they have the same temperature (are thermally equilibrated).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. From additional probes I've done, it appears that the largest we have observed so far are simply large clouds of anitmatter in parts of the MW. This <a href="http://phys.org/news/2016-06-antimatter-galaxies.html" target="_blank">article</a> does a good job talking about it and pretty much says what you do. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes it did.

<p>Note that those clouds contain both antimatter and matter (probably more matter than antimatter). The matter part is not mentioned explicitly because matter is everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. An extra point: it would be more important that antimatter interact differently with gravity than matter for antimatter galaxies to form like this. Otherwise there is no reason that one should expect matter and antimatter to clump together in different regions of space. I believe there are people looking into how antimatter behaves in a gravitational field, so perhaps soon we will know this too.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are people working on testing this right now, we'll likely have a definitive answer in a year or 2. All expectation is that it falls down just like normal matter, though it hasn't been tested quite yet. If it were to fall up or even fall down at a different rate, we would have to rework much of general relativity, which would be very unexpected.</p>
<p>Edit- it may also be worth noting that photons are their own antiparticle, and they fall down just as general relativity predicts (actually this was the first prediction of GR to be verified by measuring the gravitational lensing of the sun during an eclipse). It would be strange indeed were only some antiparticles to not obey current GR theory</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a harder question to answer. On the face of it I would guess that even in this case it would not be very realistic to expect an abundance of antimatter galaxies. This is a suspicion though rather than something I know through research etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It so (and it repelled both itself and matter), it would be evenly distributed in the inter-galaxy void.</p>
<p>It would have no net gravitational effect on light travelling through it as (being evenly distributed / &quot;flat&quot;) it would not curve space time.</p>
<p>It could conceivably have an effect at the edge of galaxies, partially explaining the unexpected rotational rate at galaxy rims.</p>
<p>Galaxies would necessarily have a region of (near) vacuum between the rim and the antimatter &quot;void&quot; else we would see matter/antimatter X-rays - something that must long since have reached equilibrium.  This would increase the gravitational lensing at galaxy edge.</p>
<p>So antimatter with negative gravitational mass == dark matter?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't annihilation the reason they would appear clumped? Most particles get destroyed and we're only left with one type in a region due to variations in distribution. I know there's other evidence this didn't happen, but it seems at least possible that it could have?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Consider this: if there are variations in the universes distribution of matter and antimatter, how large would we expect them to be? </p>
<p>If the universe was once a soup of particles and antiparticles, then these would have to be approximately uniformly distributed. So how does it come to be that entire galaxy sized regions of matter and antimatter can isolate themselves? Seems a bit too much of an ask!</p>
<p>Not to mention the gravitational effects between galaxies and galaxy clusters we observe, which would indicate that all such objects interact in the same way gravitationally. This wouldn't be so if some of the galaxies we saw were antimatter galaxies. </p>
<p>Also, even if we allow that this could have happened, we should see some matter-antimatter annihilation at the boundaries between such regions. Which we don't see. </p></div>		</li>
