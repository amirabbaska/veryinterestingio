			<div class="markdown"><p>I often forget how much bigger everything is when we start talking about stuff in space. Like, 18k degrees? 25x the mass of earth? 2 million atm? I have no idea what those words mean in <em>any</em> qualitative sense. </p>
<p>Thanks for posting. It was a great read!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah I was relating the atmosphere to my dive experience. .5 amt, not sea level, 2 atm a shallow dive, 5 atm the most any recreational diver will go. I've only ever hit 6 for personal reference. 2 million? completely beyond my depth, all understanding I have is just blown out of the water. </p></div>		</li>
