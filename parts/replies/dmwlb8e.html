			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that the quest is asking is, can't those <em>other</em> radiating elements be arranged in a manner that they feed and speed-up decay.</p>
<p>In other words, reactors harness chain reactions from sub-critical mass. OP's question is, wouldn't those radioactive byproducts also be capable of being put into a sub-critical mass and speed up their decay.</p>
<p>(I feel like this is going to come down to the differences between what particles decay generates.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When uranium splits, it tends to produce products that have medium term half-lives (years to thousands of years). Strength of radiation is inversely related to half life, so this waste tends to be pretty dangerous for an extended period of time. Unfortunately, they are also close to iron in terms of nuclear binding energy, which means that forcing fusion or fission on it would consume rather than produce energy. </p>
<p>Uranium 238 is fairly safe in comparison as it has a 4 billion year half-life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>that's only one decay chain. there are four of them. do you know where well-made images like this about the other three might be found? eg the one from Th-232, or the one from Pu-239.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=uranium+decay+chain&amp;safe=off&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch" target="_blank">google image search for &quot;uranium decay chain&quot;</a>  I looked through it again and there are other diagrams, but not from this series.</p>
<p>I know it's much more complicated than a single chain, but sometimes an over simplified answer is needed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is U238, which is not very radioactive (half life 10^9 years).<br />
More likely you will have U235 hit with a neutron, causing fission and creating 2 other atoms and 2 or 3 neutrons.  Each atom created in U235 fission is radioactive and has a decay chain.  Plus, one of the neutrons could hit U238 and create U239 which is more radioactive.. .. and has it's own decay chain.  </p>
