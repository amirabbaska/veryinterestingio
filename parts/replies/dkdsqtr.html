<p>and because there's no scientific reason to think that it's something else. what's more likely: that thousands of different species all happen to follow patterns (behavioral and neurological) that closely match human emotional responses but humans are the only ones with <em>real</em> emotions, or that humans aren't special?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong but what is being said is that &quot;bored&quot; is a term used to describe humans. A similar behavior is found in other animals. It doesn't claim to say that humans are the only things with &quot;real&quot; emotion or that we aren't special - just that these responses are similar but using a term like &quot;bored&quot; would be an anthropomorphication and not scientific. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;bored&quot; is used to describe a mental state. if animals are able to experience the same mental state, why shouldnt the same term be used for it?</p>
<p>anthropomorphication is when you attribute characteristics that humans have to things that dont have them. drawing a horse with hands would be anthropomorphication because real horses have hooves. but drawing a chimpanzee with hands? that's just a regular chimpanzee. there's nothing unscientific about claiming chimps have hands</p></div>		</li>
