It's really great at showing what happens when a rocket works, but it doesn't address how or why a rocket works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's also just the fact that you learn a lot through KSP that KSP itself doesn't teach you.</p>
<p><em>KSP</em> didn't teach me the rocket equation, it just made me find it and learn it for myself in order to be better at KSP.</p>
<p>It likewise didn't teach me about <em>how</em> rocket engines work, but it did make me realise I was sufficiently interested to go and find out.</p></div>		</li>
