			<div class="markdown"><p>This exactly. A lot of people don't realize that we don't know exactly how or why many psych drugs work or don't work. </p>
<p>Plus as far as long term effects of these drugs, I don't think a real definitive list can be given of long term effects for several reasons. Now, you can look at drug inserts and Google your heart out but the lists you find will be what's been found so far. I truly believe that since how many of these medications work isn't really understood, we don't know exactly what long term effects are truly the result of this medication versus naturally occurring or caused my another factor. In addition, in some areas it's hard to even have much research done on effects in certain populations because of potential harm to the test subjects and whether the information sought in the research is &quot;worth&quot; getting. That is, the rationale can be along the lines of &quot;what's the value/risk of doing further studies to see if SSRI use in pregnancy and breast feeding predisposes newborns to certain disorders or diseases later in life?&quot;. With this example, there are way way way too many varying factors to account for. Also, it would be such a long term study. Third, if it is found that SSRI potentially puts a child at risk for xyz issues as an adult or older child, many women who need psychiatric treatment in the perinatal stages could go untreated. Then, what's worse? A mom with horrible untreated PPD that is at high high high risk of becoming a danger to herself or others or the potential effects of this drug? </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What do you think are some of the long term effects for SSRIs? Also do you believe they are a good source for managing anxiety/depression vs natural means IE exercise and personal development ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking medication of any sort is not something that should be done lightly, and it should be done in an informed way and for that reason I dont want to suggest an SSRI is the answer, or that it isn't. Can they be helpful? Absolutely. Can they potentially hurt you? Sure, in about 1000 different ways but not all so serious. You need to weigh the pros and cons. I for example suffer with Bipolar Depression Type II with Hypomania and the result of me NOT being medicated is WAY worse than the potential issues that COULD arise from my meds.</p>
<p>I should also say that there's a decent variety of meds doing all sorts of different things for all sorts of different conditions. Not all are SSRI. Not all make you gain weight. Not all cause sexual dysfunction, etc.</p>
<p>At the end of the day you need to consider what your long-term health objectives are and the best way to get there. Remember, good Mental Health is just good overall health. </p>
<p>Take care of yourself now before the issues get worse and harder to treat. An SSRI now may be better than hospitalization later...or worse.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents. Best of luck friend.</p>
