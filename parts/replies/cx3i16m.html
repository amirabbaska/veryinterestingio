			<div class="markdown"><p>Possibly a ground loop situation. Try a 3 to 2 prong adapter on the mixer and see if that does it. The idea is that every piece of equipment should only have one path to ground. Of course it's not ideal to use a ground-removal adapter but it's useful to diagnose where the hum is coming from.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I started using a usb to headphone jack plug in, and this took all the noise out of the line.  Plugging directly into my sound card worked almost as well, but my 3-foot ear bud cord was stretched to its limits with the way I have my computer oriented.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's good to remember than disconnecting the grounds creates a danger of electrocution. For example, if you would to use those ground lifting adapters on a guitar amp, it's possible that you can get electrocuted through your guitar strings.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the advice, however, neither device has a ground prong. They both are powered from DC power supplies. Neither of which have ground prongs on the AC plug.</p></div>		</li>

<p>TLDR if the two grounds (computer and audio mixer) are not at the same level you get hum. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent point that has everything to do with that audio mixer being plugged into the wall and your headphones aren't. Basically, what is happening is your laptop's ground and the ground in your house are not at the same voltage because reasons (bad grounding in the laptop because of sloppy board/circuit design) and the potential difference between the audio jack and the properly grounded audio equipment is interpreted as sound signals.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Did that work with other players, too?  Imagine doing that and getting accused of hacking and being able to say, &quot;Nah, man, I can hear your pixels comin' a mile away.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hahaha great motherboard, I remember those days...</p>
<p>But yeah, I get the same thing in my X230i with the charger plugged in. Sacrifices had to be made for packaging purposes, and I always just took it as a biproduct of no dedicated soundcard. </p></div>		</li>
