			<div class="markdown"><p>Well yes, but sitting with what some call good posture for too long is still harmful but maybe to a lesser extent. A good analogy for this is your lawnmower and garden. If you let your lawnmower sit for too long on one spot of grass that grass starts to yellow and die... You've got to keep that lawnmower moving. A good habit to have is to stand up every few minutes and walk around or at least get some form of movement in</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This goes for the eyes too. Looking at something very close like a book or being too close to the tv isn’t bad in itself, but doing it for too long is harmful that’s why it is also recommended to look at something far away every 20-30 minutes for at least 20 seconds to prevent longterm damage.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Straight back with neck tall is not good posture. Best posture is 130-135 degree angle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Any sources on that? I know good posture incorporates all 3 spinal curves. Unfortunately even if it is true that a 130 degree angle is the best posture I won’t be able to incorporate it into my daily life (im a student so I need to look forward most of the time)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So true. For years I worked a desk job in a midwest, driving-only town and had bad shoulder and neck pain. I was basically only walking to my car and back, literally. Then I moved jobs to a big city where I walk about a mile a day to work and the change in how I physically feel was immediate and astounding. Just walking for 15 minutes a day made the world of difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So realistically, in an 8 hour a day office job, it's best for me to switch between slouching and sitting up straight since I'm sitting for long periods?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes! stand up, sit down, squat, bend down to the floor and touch your toes, reach for the ceiling with your hands, whatever you do it's best to be moving as much as you can (realistically)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Its good to change positions however that may be, but its better to get up and move for a sec every 10-20 minutes. Stretch if you need to or feel some tightness somewhere</p></div>		</li>
