			<div class="markdown"><p>For me, some nasal sprays work so much better and more quickly than others. (for instance afrin is like a miracle in this respect) What you said is my guess as to why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair enough. I didn't think before posting. I know my dad is dependent on a nasal spray but couldn't remember the specifics. And I was told not to use one I purchased at an airport, for more than 3 days. What you said makes sense. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Topical Steroid Withdrawal is a serious issue for people who need to use steroids regularly. <a href="https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=topical+corticosteroid+withdrawal&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.de/scholar?q=topical+corticosteroid+withdrawal&hl=en&as_sdt=0&as_vis=1&oi=scholart</a> in general, if it's biologically active the body has one or a multitude of ways to adapt in terms of resistance and tolerance.
Anything that can bind to a receptor (or implant itself into a cell membrane)is capable of inducing cascading mechanisms that reduce either receptor density or transmitter/hormone expression, the two sciences most related to the mechanisms are pharmaco-dynamics and -kinetics.
There are however many more possible ways for regulating than the two mentioned.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've tested it on myself and I can go 4 days straight at using it once per day (at night) and my nostrils are fine. Everyone is different though.</p>
<p>Secondly, a great tip to overcome the dependency if you do find that you went too far is to only use it on one nostril for as long as it takes for the other to overcome it (2 days-ish) and then use the clear nostril to breathe as the other resets itself. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Been there.  I just stopped using the OTC nasal spray cold turkey.  Breathing was a nightmare for the first 3 or 4 days, and I almost gave in many times just to end the misery but then a miracle happened... I could breathe without it again.  Worth it.  Best of luck.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>See my post above. Use it on one nostril until the other overcomes it. Then when you can breathe out of the first again, let the second go through its withdrawal </p></div>		</li>
