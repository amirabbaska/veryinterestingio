			<div class="markdown"><p>NP. This is a good question and I'm glad I could help. This is a topic that is not only fascinating but also pertinent as it's something everyone who owns a pet should be low-key aware of. </p>
<p>Normally I would welcome any questions, but I'm not really qualified to elaborate much further.</p>
<p>I can say, however, that if you, or anyone else who reads this, have another good question in the same vein as this one, I can certainly pass them to my immunology professor and see what he says. </p>
<p>He seriously loves this topic and adores answering questions. </p></div>		</li>
