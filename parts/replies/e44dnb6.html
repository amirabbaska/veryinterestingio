			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the big houses is a big factor that isn't often considered. The 80s-200_s saw a huge housing boom, which led to a massive uptick in what we now call McMansions. Suddenly <a href="http://www.aei.org/publication/new-us-homes-today-are-1000-square-feet-larger-than-in-1973-and-living-space-per-person-has-nearly-doubled/" target="_blank">we're creating more and more 2, 3k square foot monstrosities</a> that are occupied by just a couple people, just because we can. Your average house today is twice as big as it was in the 70's, and while your price per square foot has remained pretty stagnant over the past few decades, a house twice as big is going to cost twice as much.</p>
<p>Edit: Don't take this as me saying there's not a housing crisis, the numbers absolutely show there is. My point isn't that entitled millennials are mad they cant buy big ass houses, my point is that the market is absolutely saturated with overly large houses, and the entry price point housing that millenials now need isn't being built anymore. Not to mention the housing situations in even moderately sized cities is uncontrollable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly!!  That's what I try to explain to my friends all the time that claim that housing isn't &quot;affordable&quot;.  They are 26 looking at 3-4k square foot houses.  A single person or married couple only need 1-2k of space.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That might be true in more affordable markets but a lot of expensive coastal cities have gone completely insane.</p>
<p>I live in NYC and an apartment that would've cost $150k just 10 years ago is now $600k minimum with 20% down required and zero amenities. A townhouse in Brooklyn that was $750k just 5 years ago is now closer to $2 million.</p>
<p>And wages are the same and the apartments are still absolutely tiny. Like 500 sq feet.</p>
<p>There's definitely an affordability crisis in a lot of the bigger cities in America.</p></div>		</li>

<p>2-3K sq ft is hardly a &quot;monstrosity&quot;. McMansions are often 3-4K or even 5K sq ft+.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: It appears I need to clarify. Anywhere outside of the continent of North America, a house that's 2-3k sq ft would be considered massive.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The stagnant wages are real. I'm lucky with my current position, but there is one company in my city that basically takes advantage of recent college grads. Their starting hourly rate hasn't changed in 10 years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue that property price and regulation are at fault. Property alone is hard enough to afford. Then before you can even start building, you need approved blueprints and permits. By the time you are done, you've spent more in on the city budget than you have your own house.</p></div>		</li>
