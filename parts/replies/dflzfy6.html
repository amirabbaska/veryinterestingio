<p>Looks like Diatomaceous Earth works as an insectside because it pulls lipids from the exoskeleton of the insect causing them to dehydrate which kills them due to a water pressure deficiency. </p>
<p>Peach and kiwi fuzz don't kill the insect as much as merely keeps them off the skin of the fruit and prevents them from laying eggs. It's more like the wire branches you see on roofs to keep birds off. </p></div>		</li>
