			<div class="markdown"><p>Someone correct me if I'm wrong here, but I like to think of this like everything in the universe has the same value in the plane of time-space. </p>
<p>For example, let's use the analogy of poker chips. Everything in the universe has 100 poker chips, and it has to spend all 100 poker chips. The only thing you can spend your chips on are: the time category, and the speed category. In the speed category, 0 chips means you are static, and 100 chips means you are traveling at the speed of light, c. In the time category, 0 chips means 0 seconds of time, or no time at all, and 100 chips means infinite time. </p>
<p>Since you have 100 chips to spend, you can give them all to the speed category, meaning that something, such as photons, travel at the speed of light, but to them, no time has passed. In other words, these photons can travel for infinitely long distances, but because they are moving at the speed of light, they don't experience time. Conversely, you can give all the chips to the time category, meaning that you take an infinite amount of time to travel an infinite distance, because technically, your speed is 0, and you are not moving. </p>
<p>In the real world, everything is moving relative to something else, so the way you distribute your chips between time and speed determines your experience to travel a fixed distance. In other words, you can be moving really fast, and time is slow. Or you could be moving really slow, and time goes faster. It depends on how you split your chips. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wowzers!  I like your explanation.  I have felt like we are really lacking in our definition of what space is.
There was a really great NOVA documentary on defining space.  </p>
<p>To say that space is &quot;nothing&quot; and then to assign properties to it, such as distance, seemed to be incompatible.</p>
<p>Once you give it properties, you are now saying that it is something.  Connecting time to space made it really crazy.  But now with your description, I could almost say that each piece of  matter within space creates it's own observation of time, relative to its own frame of reference.  To deep for my brain to comprehend, and now I am rambling.</p>
<p>Good day to you sir!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Really great post!</p>
<p>Does anybody else get anxious, almost like a panic attack, when thinking about this stuff? I love it, but thinking about how gigantic the universe is, how it came about, why it came about, how and why we are in it and all of that jazz it can drive me a bit crazy. Great...now I have to try and go to sleep somehow lol.</p>
<p>Mind blown!</p></div>		</li>
