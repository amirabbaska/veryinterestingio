<p>Since light doesn't really slow down, from where does the spaceship get the momentum energy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The light does lose energy - the wavelength increases/frequency decreases very slightly.It's a very tiny loss, however. Momentum is conserved in the same way - because the momentum of light is also defined using the wavelength/frequency.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Photon momentum is related to frequency rather than speed. Speed can't affect momentum since they don't have mass. And things without mass travel at <em>c</em>. And the only property light has is frequency. And every photon of equal frequency is indistinguishable.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This way is only easier as long as your really unambitious with your flash light.</p>
<p>More ambitious flash light projects, say a fusion torch or a anti-matter annihilator (both create mainly photons) have really nice thrust-to-weight rations and specific impulse...</p></div>		</li>

<p>generate (tiny amounts of) thrust</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but the reason this works is because thrust=acceleration, for all intents and purposes, when opposing forces (drag, friction, etc) approach zero, as in space. </p>
<p>Sure, a millionth of a meter per second of acceleration is minimal, but when it's not counting tired by drag, it's entirely cumulative, and so by the time you've accelerated for months at that rate, you're moving along pretty good. </p></div>		</li>
