			<div class="markdown"><p>You're making assumptions. People like me who are immunosuppressed wear a mask in public to protect myself because if I get sick I will be hospitalized for sure and possibly die. </p>
<p>I feel like I need to write that on my masks because people think the same thing you do and wonder why I'm out in public if I'm sick. Which I'm not...yet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your situation is actually the assumption I usually make when I see someone wearing a mask. In America, it seems we have a problem with wearing masks when we actually are sick.
For example, I have a Mongolian friend who lives in America. His daughter had cold symptoms but no fever. He sent her to school with a mask and promptly received a call from the school nurse. She told him his daughter would need to remove the mask or would have to pick her up from school.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think there's probably two competing thoughts. If your child is sick and contagious they shouldn't be at school. If your child isn't sick, they shouldn't be wearing a mask. </p>
<p>It's a false dichotomy for sure but for whatever reason that's the norm in the US. You should either stay home or act like nothing is wrong with you. </p></div>		</li>
