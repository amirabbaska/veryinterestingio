<p>New competitors will have to either sell their ideas to said conglomerates, or have <strong>deep</strong> pockets to pay the extortion rates to give users proper access to their sites.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AND we'll be paying more for our ISP services because more and more data limits will be imposed since they can freely change their service plans without worrying about the government stepping in and saying that they can't. </p>
<p>Hell even NOW that is slowly happening as my previously unlimited Comcast is now 1TB a month. Even if I don't use half of that TB now, what is going to happen if/when 4k content becomes mainstream and streamable? Will Comcast just suddenly be best pals again and up their data limit without mass public outcry? No, i'll just be urged to get one of their likely &quot;all new higher cap&quot; plans.</p>
<p>Net neutrality dies and crap like that is going to only get accelerated. It has already been brought up here but without Net Neutrality Blockbuster would have squashed Netflix. Can the majority of people here imagine how entertainment life would be like without Netflix? Hell Netflix around probably drove streaming technology and the need for it for things like now tv on the go/demand mobile streaming, things like twitch.tv for game streaming (which in of itself is a platform for esports), etc.</p>
<p>Killing net neutrality kills innovation and technological advances and only helps the established ISPs gain more money. That is it, they get more money and we get NOTHING.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From that point forward, ISPs can slow down traffic, or even possibly stop traffic to certain websites that they aren't sponsored by or affiliated with. On the other hand, ISPs might speed up and give preferred connections to affiliate/sponsor websites.</p>
<p>A good example that's already in effect is T-Mobile's <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offer/binge-on-streaming-video.html" target="_blank">&quot;Binge On&quot;</a> program; it allows eligible T-Mobile subscribers to access certain video streaming services and watch videos/shows/movies without going against their phone's data cap. This is an example of the &quot;speed up/give preferred service&quot; side of things.</p>
<p>An example of the &quot;blocking/slowing access&quot; side of things would be like if Comcast decides to partner with YouTube, but not with Amazon. You're using Comcast, but have an Amazon Video subscription instead of YouTube Red. You start to watch Game of Thrones on Amazon, but it doesn't seem to reach 720p or 1080p; the highest quality you can seem to stream is at 480p. You go to watch Game of Thrones on YouTube, and you seem to be streaming at 1080p, sometimes dropping to 720p because someone else in your house is watching something else at the same time. Comcast would be giving preferred access to YouTube, but not to Amazon. If taken to the extremes of blocking sites, they could just straight up deny access to a website like Twitch, because YouTube Gaming allows livestreaming of games and they're working with YouTube.</p>
