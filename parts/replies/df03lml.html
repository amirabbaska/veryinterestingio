<p>It is pretty strange to have it get cold and all the birds start tweeting like it is dawn.</p></div>		</li>

<p>drop is only about half the difference between day and night temperature. It feel a lot bigger because you loose the direct radiant heating from the sun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So if its 80 degrees and at night goes to 65, thats a difference of 15 degrees and half is 7.5 degrees. Its obviously doesn't last long and I believe the loss of the radiant heat is more noticeable.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's different to shade, it happens over a much longer time than an eclipse and is even more dependent on the weather.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The sun puts out around 1000W per square yard. But much that normal heating will stop in the minutes leading up to totality. So there's a big drop, but it's not an instantaneous thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a partial eclipse in March 2015 that I saw at about 80% totality. It was a warmer than average spring morning, but I remember feeling extremely cold during the eclipse. It's more than just standing in the shadow -- I suppose you get far less diffuse heat in addition to direct heat. </p></div>		</li>
