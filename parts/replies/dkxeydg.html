			<div class="markdown"><p>I was once told by an older gentleman who was teaching me RF that the reason why we sometimes lose radio signal at a stop and then get it back when we pull forward a few feet is due to us stopping out of phase.  Is there validity to this? I only wish I spent more time with him before he left to work for a different company... </p>
<p>If this was true, and we are simply out of phase, can a second antennae be used at the same time, or a larger one to prevent this loss? RF is fascinating. I should do more research. I had forgotten how interesting RF was until I read this. Thank you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What's going on there is called &quot;multipath propagation&quot;. Your radio signal is bouncing off of some things on the way to your car, and it just so happens that you've stopped in an area of destructive interference. Having two antennas to switch between might help, but it would be an expensive solution to a cheap problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This, exactly this.  there's a Kahn Academy video on youtube that explains it pretty good: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjTXS40pqs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTjTXS40pqs</a></p>
<p>at worst case, the 'dead zone' will be ~1/2 of a wavelength long/wide, so at broadcast FM frequencies, its a max of ~1.7 meters long. (that's 5.5 feet)</p></div>		</li>
