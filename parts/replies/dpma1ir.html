			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the word &quot;electricity&quot; came first, and the electron was named after it. It was a Latin word (<em>electrum</em>, a Classical Latin noun, and <em>electricus</em>, a New Latin adjective) from the Greek <em>ἤλεκτρον</em> (<em>elektron</em>), meaning &quot;amber,&quot; since (static) electricity (and electrical attraction) was a curiosity in antiquity that was produced by rubbing amber.</p></div>		</li>
