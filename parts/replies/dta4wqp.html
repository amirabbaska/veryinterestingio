			<div class="markdown"><p>I got stuck in line one time at a CVS behind a middle aged lady who was trying to return greeting cards so that she could buy them again with a coupon. Coupon was expired. It was after 11pm and I had just come off a long shift...I actually yelled at her about it. Not a proud moment for me, even though she deserved it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The funny thing is I think coupons serve the same purpose in a market as haggling: differential pricing. Coupons, however, are <em>usually</em> very time efficient because it is not worth the time to haggle over a few cents when the employees would cost a few cents in that same amount of time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first night in Soeul, the mother of the friend we were staying with took us to the grocery store, she argued over the price of half her cart. She got a quarter here and there on different things. &quot;This pineapple is lopsided.&quot; She probably saved $3-4 by arguing. Definitely not something I'm comfortable with though.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I remember once going for a dozen eggs, only to find the last pack had one broken egg. I ended up buying that 11 eggs for about half price, just because I bothered asking. The store otherwise would have probably had to bin them completely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, most stores toss broken ones and save the remainder, then repackage them in &quot;in store&quot; containers to sell them at a moderate discount. Often you'll get mixed sizes though, so don't pick them up if consistency is important!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try working at a bike shop, Jesus Christ. These people buying little shit DO try and haggle their asses off. Bike shops make shit margins compared to most places you shop, yet for some reason nobody haggles at Target or Walmart. They but shitty clothes at Target that were marked up 90% but want to spend an hour of our time turning our tiny profit into a loss.</p>
<p>It boggles my mind</p></div>		</li>
