			<div class="markdown"><p>You've got it backwards. Its the linear velocity that is constant at large radius, which means the angular velocity is changing. If the galaxy was entirely undergoing solid body rotation it would have a constant angular velocity and linear velocity proportional to radius. What we used to expect was solid body rotation (v proportional to r) and then a keplerian decline (v declining proportional to 1/sqrt(r)). Instead we go from the linear solid body rotation into constant <strong><em>linear</em></strong> velocity at larger radii which indicates there is extra matter further out from the centre which can't account for and differential rotation (a changing angular velocity).</p>
<p>In typical reddit style this is idea totally fucked up in every askreddit thread made about this topic. Not sure if people don't understand the difference between angular and linear velocity or they just don't the concept full stop. Galaxies dont spin like a spinning top.</p>
<p>edit:
Preemptive link for the first armchair expert that tries to say I'm wrong.,

<p>Also gravitational waves aren't what shapes the spiral arms jfc they're so fucking weak they've only recently been measured. How does it make sense to anyone that they would be able to affect the large scale structure of a galaxy...</p></div>		</li>

<p>with the particles closer to the center having a much faster angular velocity than the stars at the outer boundaries.</p>

<p>The inner particles have greater angular speeds regardless. The important point is that it was expected that they would have greater absolute orbital speeds (in km/s), and the disproval of that expectation is what kicked off the search for dark matter.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If the stars at the outer boundaries had the same velocity wouldn't they still take longer to orbit due to the greater distance? How would the galaxy act like a solid disk?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have the same angular velocity, which is measured in radians per second or degrees per second, typically. The stars on the outside have to have a much higher linear velocity to maintain the same angular velocity as the inner stars. </p></div>		</li>
