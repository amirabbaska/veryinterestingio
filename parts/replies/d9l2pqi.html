			<p>So the lungs will very slowly break down the food. But will it eventually be broken down enough to solve the problem? Or will a doctor remove this when treating pneumonia. </p>		</li>

			<p>The lungs and trachea have a certain capacity to clear aspirated materials. The initial cough is the first response.  If food or liquid is still in the lungs, the body will coat it with phlegm which makes it easier to cough out. The lining of the lungs have little hairs called cellia (sp?) that help bring small bits of foreign materials back up to the throat. <br><br>However, with a piece of food, too much liquid, or too much bacteria, that gets down into the lungs, the body's natural defenses will be overwhelmed and infection sets in. <br><br>It's also important to note that there are physical characteristics of some people that seem to make them extremely resistant to developing aspiration pneumonia. I have known people with dysphasia who are constantly aspirating a drop or two of every sip of liquid and don't develop aspiration pneumonia for years. Good oral care is paramount in this, but science doesn't fully understand the other factors yet.</p>		</li>

			<p>A couple years ago a nurse intubated a patient and the feeding tube ended up in the lungs. I'm not a nurse, so not sure what she did wrong for that to happen. I know she started &quot;feeding&quot; the patient, but realized midway something was wrong. They started antibiotics immediately. Patient died a week later. Not sure if because of this or his previous condition. Nurse lost her license either way.</p>		</li>

			<p>From my understanding, it will eventually break down with the body trying to absorb it and use of antibiotics to fight the bacteria. However, more solid things are sometimes removed manually. </p>		</li>

			<p>Check my understanding here. Assuming something has already got into your lungs, the immune system will try to eat it(and all the bacteria on it)?   Maybe at this point a doctor notices you have a fever and extracts the something. If the doctor doesn't extract it, for whatever reason, maybe you drown in the fluid that is a byproduct of the battle between your immune system and the bacteria. <br><br>If you inhaled something like a rock, it wouldn't have much bacteria, but it wouldn't be attackable by your immune system either... in that case, could it just get permanently lodged in your lungs? Obviously if it is high enough in the tree of bronchioles (and can't cough it out), this will kill you.  Can you survive with a permanent loss of lung capacity from a nondigestible object that gets lodged deep in the bronchiole tree?</p>		</li>

			<p>This is purely speculation on my part, but I would think that any foreign entity in the lungs like a rock would result in an inflammatory response. I am not sure how this would look in the lungs. I would guess that you might end up with the generation of a lot of fluid and mucus. <br><br>People can function with reduced lung volume. Speech therapists can also work on breath support for speech and swallow. We will take measurements of their maximum phonation time, vital capacity, etc. Either due to weakness or lung deterioration, people can have shockingly low numbers. These people will be very short of air and generally weaker than healthier people. They will have trouble completing basic tasks because of poor activity tolerance and endurance. <br><br>In general, you won't necessarily &quot;drown in the fluid&quot; either. With antibiotics you can recover from aspiration pneumonia. The issue is correcting the swallowing issue, though, to try to keep it from being a chronic issue. </p>		</li>

			<p>could have done without the dick punch of &quot;still reading, good for you!&quot; near the end though. Like...way to interrupt your own explanation with a little condescension to someone willing to read it.</p>		</li>
