			<div class="markdown"><p>Check my understanding here. Assuming something has already got into your lungs, the immune system will try to eat it(and all the bacteria on it)?   Maybe at this point a doctor notices you have a fever and extracts the something. If the doctor doesn't extract it, for whatever reason, maybe you drown in the fluid that is a byproduct of the battle between your immune system and the bacteria. </p>
<p>If you inhaled something like a rock, it wouldn't have much bacteria, but it wouldn't be attackable by your immune system either... in that case, could it just get permanently lodged in your lungs? Obviously if it is high enough in the tree of bronchioles (and can't cough it out), this will kill you.  Can you survive with a permanent loss of lung capacity from a nondigestible object that gets lodged deep in the bronchiole tree?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is purely speculation on my part, but I would think that any foreign entity in the lungs like a rock would result in an inflammatory response. I am not sure how this would look in the lungs. I would guess that you might end up with the generation of a lot of fluid and mucus. </p>
<p>People can function with reduced lung volume. Speech therapists can also work on breath support for speech and swallow. We will take measurements of their maximum phonation time, vital capacity, etc. Either due to weakness or lung deterioration, people can have shockingly low numbers. These people will be very short of air and generally weaker than healthier people. They will have trouble completing basic tasks because of poor activity tolerance and endurance. </p>
<p>In general, you won't necessarily &quot;drown in the fluid&quot; either. With antibiotics you can recover from aspiration pneumonia. The issue is correcting the swallowing issue, though, to try to keep it from being a chronic issue. </p></div>		</li>
