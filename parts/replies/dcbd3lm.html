			<div class="markdown"><p>My favorite proof of irrationality of a number is the Square Root of 2 (let's call it &quot;SR2&quot;) using the properties of even and odd numbers:</p>
<p>If SR2 is rational, then it equals some A/B where A and B are integers (choose the reduced form, and B nonzero.) A and B are either even or odd. SR2^2 = A^2 /B^2 = 2 retains those same properties: an odd number times an odd number is odd, while an even number times an even number is even.</p>
<p>A and B cannot both be even, or it wouldn't be in reduced form (just divide both numerator and denominator by 2.) A and B cannot both be odd, since an odd number divided by an odd number is also odd. Nor can A be odd and B be even, since even numbers do not divide odd numbers. Therefore A must be even and B must be odd.</p>
<p>Knowing that, we do a little bit of math:</p>
<pre><code>2 = A^2 / B^2
2 * B^2 = A^2 
2 * B^2 = (2k)^2 (where A = 2k, since A is even)
2 * B^2 = 4 * k^2
B^2 = 2 * k^2
B^2 = Even</code></pre>
<p>Arriving at a contradiction: B must be even and B must be odd. So the Square Root of 2 cannot equal A/B (where A and B are reduced.) Therefore the Square Root of 2 is irrational.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That's interesting and a nice looking proof but I don't understand this point. Do you have a link or explanation of what you mean?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think what he/she means (if I were to take a guess), is that an odd number divided by an even number would result in a number with a decimal; e.g. 27/10 = 2.7, 93/6 = 15.5, etc.</p>
<p>This would be because the modulus of the top (numerator) will always be non-zero with an even denominator and an odd numerator.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A^2 / B^2 = 2, and if A is odd and B is even, A^2 is odd and B^2 is even.  Since even can't divide odd and result in an integer then A can't be even if B is odd.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, a number can have more than one correct decimal expansion (0.28=0.2799999999.. for example). If the number &quot;terminates&quot; you can just put any number of zeroes at the end of it without changing the number.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused. Wouldn't this also mean that the number 1 would also be 1.00000000...?</p>
<p>In the post above, it was stated that numbers that don't go on indefinitely are rarer than numbers (such as Pi) that do. But if you include numbers like .2800000... and any other number that &quot;terminates&quot; with endless zeros that would mean that ALL numbers go on indefinitely.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Offered in case readers of this sub-thread might confuse infinitely repeating zeros with &quot;many zeroes&quot;, which is a different thing... </p>
<p>One doesn't add trailing zeroes to a decimal unless those were measured with an instrument with lines down to that <em>n</em>-th decimal place. &quot;Math&quot; presumes that 0.28 represents a single pie cut into 100 discreet equal parts and 28 of them set aside, but &quot;science&quot; presumes that 0.280 represents use of a ruler marked to the <del>thousandths</del> <strong>hundredths</strong> place and an eyeball-rounding of between 0.2795 and 0.2804. Infinite repeats like 0.2800... or 0.2799... indicate a limit of observable measurement requiring infinitely small marks on your ruler, so &quot;zero&quot; within the limits of physics. The number of trailing zeroes is significant, and padding them in an infinite repeat is not meaningful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One small note, 0.280 is presumed to represent the use of a ruler marked to the -hundredths- place, with an estimated digit one step beyond the precision of the instrument with an uncertainty of 1/2 the least count (or in this case +- 0.005)</p></div>		</li>
