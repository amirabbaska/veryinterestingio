			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that you are forgetting that a considerable amount of people actually have a net negative tax rate, which is strait transfer of wealth. IMO everyone should pay something to the government because everyone in some way or another depends on them for very basic services. There has been tax schemes based of a flat income tax of 5%, I believe, and was proposed without the need to cut social programs. </p>
<p>I for one would love to see a two tier tax bracket, a basic 5% for the whole population with maybe a graduated rate of 10% for the super wealthy, say actual income above $2MM/yr. The way the tax laws are written now they favor the super poor and the super wealthy while hitting the small business owners and middle class the hardest. The current tax codes are absolutely strangling the primary employers in the US, small businesses.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The way I think about it is that the net effect of taxes &amp; government has the major effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>We pay for services we all want, this tends to be a very efficient way of doing things, and also allows for the possibility of creating enormous wealth</li>
<li>Unfortunately that also creates a lower boundary where someone could end up not being able to earn enough money to live</li>
<li>So, we also have a sort of universal insurance. If things go bad for you and you find yourself unable to afford the basics to sustain life in the society we've created, then we'll all chip in to make sure you're at least at that minimum</li>
</ul>
<p>We could split that out in to different taxes, a &quot;cost of services&quot; and a &quot;insurance cost and payments&quot;, but in practice it all ends up being a single tax that can either be positive or negative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, I get what you're saying, but the statement 'everyone should pay something' does not stop the existence of a negative tax rate.</p>
<p>For example. Is a homeless person paying at a soup kitchen in your ideal world? Let's make them pay something, a penny. This is still negative tax rate -- the homeless person gets more than a penny out of the system, and that system took money from somewhere else. Wealth distribution. </p>
<p>As long as I can get more money out of government than I put in, I would argue that I have a negative tax rate. I don't think that's a bad thing. I think it is natural (most insurance policies works this way too).</p>
<p>Otherwise, every government service would have to be priced at some sort of zero profit margin for all citizens/consumers. And that's when homeless people can't afford soup kitchens anymore. And the average person goes bankrupt when they need chemo. And corn farmers go out of business from market shocks.</p>
<p>And sure, you can say &quot;well, health insurance and farming subsidies are there for temporary setbacks.&quot; So then you're for voucher systems, and longer timelines, but the issue is still the same. Eventually, the homeless person is less productive than the cost of the government services they depend on to live. Do you let them starve now, or N years from now when their vouchers run out? Otherwise, we are redistributing something in order to keep them alive, and the amount we redistribute is just as important as the tax rate. Talking about one without the other is a meaningless argument. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think you're missing the point entirely. </p>
<p>First off the very simple scenario I described above is based off of income tax, so a homeless/jobless person would not be taxed because they aren't earning anything. </p>
<p>Second, the statement you make about a soup line is just asinine, that is literally the purpose of government social service programs, hence the need for taxes in the first place. What I was talking about was straight re-distribution of wealth, cash, dollars, not social services. And YES, if you get a larger refund from the government than what you paid in over the course of the year you DO have a negative tax rate. You are at a net cash gain at the end of the year while still receiving all of the benefits that your tax dollars are supposed to pay for.</p>
<p>Third, The government is literally the LARGEST not for profit organization in the country. Ideally they do operate at or as near to a net zero sum as possible. This is the reason the government passes budgets, spending limits and so on. </p>
<p>I think you are seriously misunderstanding some very key concepts of how both taxes and government is supposed to work.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Equal tax is a huge tax break for the rich, since any agreed tax would have to be lower than the top rate today.</p>
<p>I kind of like our German system: anything up to 13k Euros incurs no tax (Supreme court ruled that the bare minimum must be tax free), above that you pay a variable tax rate from 20 to 42 percent.</p>
<p>I think it's fair for rich people to pay more taxes than poor people. Poor people and rich people spend a comparable amount of money on necessities (groceries, gas, electricity bills and suchlike), but it's a much bigger percentage of their paycheck for poor people.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think it's fair for rich people to pay more too. Mostly because rich people use more government services, they don't get welfare checks or free trips to emergency room, but if we look at the value that things like the military and police and our legal system protect, the rich get a much better deal.</p>
<p>A huge percentage of US citizens have negative net wealth, if the legal system underlying our property and banking went away, they'd end up <em>richer</em>. While the richest 1% would lose more wealth than half the country. Things like welfare and unemployment and not letting people freeze to death on the streets (too often) or die in the waiting rooms of the hospital (too often) also greatly reduce the chances that the downtrodden masses are going to decide to storm some estates.</p></div>		</li>
