			<div class="markdown"><p>I work for a company that is heavily involved in making animal feed. Many many hours of research have gone into how to make feed the best way so the chicken can absorb the nutrients the best. I'm mainly involved in the feed size/shape and ingredient accuracy, but I have spoken with quite a few nutritionist about the ingredient side. One of the things that I remember is the use of limestone in the feed greatly helps the chicken absorb certain proteins better.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Broiler chickens aren't locked in tiny enclosures. That would be highly inefficient. They are in huge houses and usually have plenty of room. (With huge windows all the way down both sides of the house that are opened or closed depending on weather)  In fact, chickens tend to like to huddle together so there are usually bug empty areas in the houses. </p>
<p>Not only that, but the majority of broiler chickens are raised by small time farmers that might have one or two houses with between 10k and 20k per house per cycle. They then sell the grown chickens to the large conglomerate processors. </p></div>		</li>

<p>This actually gives me an idea.... Create a chicken/plant hybrid, then leave them <em>in</em> the sun in a nutrient-rich water bath. </p>
<p>Grow giant solar chickens for a fraction of the cost! </p></div>		</li>
