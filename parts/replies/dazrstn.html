			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking of your 3rd point, a few weeks ago I saw on reddit that someone in I believe Australia or the Netherlands, had discovered a way to reduce the methane in beef production by I think over 90%. This was allegedly accomplished by adding seaweed to their diet. My question is, do you think it would be easier to convince people to add seaweed to the livestocks diet, or to eat less/no beef?  I feel people, especially in the United States, would be unwilling to give up those sweet T-bones and ribeyes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not all of the problem with cows is due to methane. Cows grow more slowly than chickens do, and their manure produces a lot of nitrous oxide. Furthermore, meat of any kind will always emit more greenhouse gases than vegetarian or vegan fare.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if that seaweed idea withstands further testing, is scalable, and is economically viable. Until that makes it onto the market and is proven, I think the best advice we can give is to not eat beef. Afterwards, the best advice might still be to not eat beef.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One small correction, it is actually cow belching that accounts for most of their methane output. For some reason the pop science circuit reported it as cow farts instead of cow burps because... farts sell? I dunno, but cows and other ruminants burp out a lot of methane due to the enteric fermentation process that occurs in their stomachs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can you explain to me how cows burping out methane is something new and man made?  I know we raise a lot more cattle than what would naturally exist due to the balance of nature, but there isn't really anything new being added to the cycle of life.</p>
<p>I understand very well that burning fossil fuels adds carbon to the carbon cycle since that carbon has been trapped underground for a very long time, and because of that, simply planting more trees would not be enough to offset it.</p>
<p>Wouldn't methane or nitrous oxide simply break down on it's own by oxidizing over time, or is it just that while it's in the atmosphere it's contributing to the greenhouse effect?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You answered the question yourself. Due to human demand for meat and dairy products, a lot more cows are alive today than there would be if we just allowed nature to take its course. The result is that the rate at which greenhouse gases from cattle are released far outpaces the rate at which they can be removed by the carbon cycle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cows as we know them are man made.  They have been selectively bred over the course of 10,000+ years.  They are not something that just naturally occurs in nature.  They are over 1.4 billion cattle on earth and they are here because we created them.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The main reason that cows are so harmful to the environment is that they emit methane and nitrous oxide, and those are far worse than carbon dioxide. If you took 1 pound of grass and burned it, you would release around 1 pound of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. But if you feed that 1 pound of grass to a cow, you will produce a lot of methane and nitrous oxide instead. Over 100 years, 1 pound of methane has a 30x stronger greenhouse heating effect than 1 pound of CO2. Over 100 years, 1 pound of nitrous oxide has a 300x stronger effect than 1 pound of CO2.</p>
<p>Cows also need to be fed. For this, they either need grassland to graze on or they need to be fed grains and other crops. Either way, to feed them, we have to clear forests. Double whammy. Instead of forests taking CO2 out of the atmosphere and converting it into soil carbon, we have the crops and cows taking CO2 and N2 and converting it into the more harmful gases of CH4 and N2O. </p>
<p>As cows grow more slowly than chickens or pigs, they need more food over their lifetime, and they need more food for each pound of meat that they produce. This amplifies the problems above.</p>

<p>Yes, a lot more indeed. There are now 1.4 billion cows on the planet. That population would not exist without human activity. There is about twice as much biomass in cows on Earth than humans. In a sense, cows are more evolutionarily successful than humans are.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While agriculture is a huge source of emissions and I agree with you in that it's excessive, the methane from cows breaks down in the atmosphere. It is a worse greenhouse gas, but it does not last forever like CO2</p></div>		</li>

<p>Cow manure produces a lot of N2O as well. N2O lasts about 10x as long as methane.</p>
<p>The typical method of comparing the impact of different gases (e.g. methane and CO2) is by using the average effect over 100 years. This is where the 30x factor for the global warming potential of 1 gram of methane vs. 1 gram of CO2 comes from. Over a shorter period than 100 years, methane is much worse than 30x. Over a longer period than 100 years, methane is not as bad as 30x. 100 years sounds reasonable to me as an interval for comparison, as it is likely that after 100 years we will have largely moved on from fossil fuels.</p></div>		</li>
