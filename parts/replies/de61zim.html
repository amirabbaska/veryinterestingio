			<div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a movie theater in high school back in the mid-90s (including 1994, considered one of the best years ever in cinema) and we had really simple pricing for both pop and popcorn.  Small, medium, and large popcorn were $4.00, $4.50, and $5.00, respectively.  Small, medium, and large drinks were $3.50, $3.75, and $4, respectively.  This made for the easy 'up sell' - if someone ordered a medium popcorn you'd as if they'd like a large for 'only 50 cents more', and they'd usually take it.</p>
<p>People are very open to lots of up selling.  After a shift one time my manager was going through counts and saw that we sold 50 Milk Duds more than usual for a Saturday afternoon, he thought it was a mis-count.  What had happened is that the concession folks, just for fun, decided to always offer Milk Duds for every order.  They were very surprised how many people said yes to the really overpriced candy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Still work at a movie theater and we still do this. Mind you it's 6.50, 7 and 7.50. Drinks are 4.75, 5.25 and 5.75. </p>
<p>I always offer the medium when they're getting the small. More drink and 90% of them say yes haha.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But I'm still confused --</p>
<p>By this logic (and the top answer), you the company are trying to influence the customer to buy the larger, 50c more expensive food. But wouldn't you the company rather the customer buy the slightly <em>smaller</em> food (the $8.50 popcorn), because you're getting far more profit off of that than the $9.00 popcorn?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While these products are super cheap to produce anyway, another thing to remember is that they are also banking on people NOT wanting the bigger size so they will pay the massively marked up price for the smaller product. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't cost significantly more to produce the larger size than the smaller one.  The vast majority of the cost of a food product like that is the packaging, the advertising, the building, the employee selling it, etc.  Those things are all the same for both products.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A large popcorn costs roughly 25 cents total to produce. They want you to come back to the stand for a refill where you're able to buy something else.</p></div>		</li>
