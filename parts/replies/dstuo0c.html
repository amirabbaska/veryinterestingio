<p>As a side note, you can't put out a magnesium fire with water.</p>

<p>We were taught in the Navy to never spray water directly on an aircraft wheel that is on fire, you &quot;bounce&quot; the stream off of the ground.  This helps fuel the fire a bit so it extinguishes itself quicker.</p>
<p>I went through this training 40 years ago so I may be missing something, but that was the gist of it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I did STCW-95 (Coast Guard Firefighter and Survival school) a 3 years ago...it hasn't changed much. Basically it was &quot;keep the bulkheads cool so the metal doesn't ignite...but also don't sink your ship by flooding it.&quot; You create a wall of mist to approach the fire, then bank a stream off the wall to siphon off heat as steam.</p>
<p>Fire school was fun as hell. Also as warm.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is not the heat that breaks the water apart, it is the Magnesium Ions winning the tugging contest for the O- over the H+ ions in water. That's why Magnesium is an energetic fuel in solid fuel fuel cells also known as &quot;instant emergency batteries&quot; where you just add water. These batteries are also used in electric powered torpedos.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's is a limit per surface area, but moving ions in a solution is still current, even if their source is chemical. More powerful metals are Sodium and Lithium, they litterately explode when thrown in water, but you could make a suitcase sized megawatt battery with these metals.</p></div>		</li>
