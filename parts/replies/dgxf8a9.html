			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There are no nuclear reactions taking place in a neutron star, so they aren't able to sustain their light as long as some stars. However, the reason for their relatively high luminosity is the gravitational collapse that occurs during their birth. This is how pre-main sequence stars light up for the first time.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Iirc, Neutron Stars are so energetic because of their density. They were at one point the size of normal stars, but then collapsed down to the size they are now, with all the energy of that star now occupying that smaller space as well.</p>
<p>They spin crazy fast because angular momentum is preserved before and after the collapse. Since angular momentum is proportional to the speed of the spin times the mass' distance out from the center, if you decrease the radius of the body, you have to increase the speed to maintain that same momentum. </p>
<p>And yes, they do cool off as they emit radiation, but that can take a very long time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They're the densest objects in the universe. Black holes are denser but not really material objects anymore. When they are formed from a giant star collapse, they trap unbelievable amounts of energy as heat (aided by the high density of billions of tons per cubic inch) and the only way they can get rid of that heat is by radiating it outward through their tiny surface area. That means that, at first, the surface temperature is up around a billion degrees and their light is so &quot;blue&quot; it's got a lot of X-rays.</p></div>		</li>
