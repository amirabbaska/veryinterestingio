<p>If you take the Arthasasthra, it actually mentions the composition of the king's council and that it needed to have 2 from each major caste (why would a 'lower caste' person be included in the highest tiers of decision making in one of the most powerful empires this earth has seen?)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be fair, Sweden had a similar thing 1466–1866 for their four estates of the realm (nobility, clergy, bourgeoisie, peasantry). Each estate had the right – and duty – of representation. One nobleman from every House, the arch bishop, the mayor and another burgher of every town, and one peasant from every county.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not <em>trälar. Trälar</em> means slaves, and all slavery was abolished in Sweden proper in 1335, more than a century before the system of estate representation.</p>
<p>Swedish subjects could however still own and trade slaves abroad and in colonies beyond the border – a Swede's business abroad wasn't considered a state matter, so legislating against it wasn't really thought of until the turn of the 19^th century. Not until 1847 was the Swedish state able to purchase and set free all Swede-owned slaves before finally banning it. I don't have exact numbers on me, but I think it was about 5 000 slaves.</p></div>		</li>

That strongly indicates that the caste system became very rigid a very long time before the British showed up.</p>
<p>If the DNA studies are accurate, people were indeed &quot;prevented or banned from changing their groupings&quot;, otherwise there would have been cases where someone changed caste and then married a spouse from their new caste, leading to genetic mixing in their descendants that would have been detectable today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Also, endogamy is a core human behaviour. You must also consider that till early 20th century, the village was the most important unit, and people rarely even left their village. Given this, and the prevalence of Consanguineous marriages (still prevalent today) it is fairly common sense to argue that there will not be genepool diversity. </p>
<p>Endogamy is widely prevalent in the middle east for instance, so do they also have the caste system?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Read up on the &quot;Jatt&quot; clan and their origins. </p>
<p>To give you a starter, they have 13-16% NE European genetic admix whereas the upper-castes of Northern India have only 5-6%. They are descended from (Indo-)Scythians hence the extra NE European admix, they invaded 2000 years ago yet their admixture has very much stayed the same due to their varna status and due to their disobedience, they never adhered to the varna system hence why the caste system in Punjab is unique. </p>
<p>Caste was very much still rigid. It was possible for whole clans to move up the varna system but that would take centuries and immense arse-licking. It was fluid, IIRC, over 2000 years ago though. </p>
<p>Origins written by Kushwant Singh, a very well respected historian in India:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Every Jat Village was a small republic made of people of kindred blood who were as conscious of absolute equality between themselves as they were or their superiority over men of other castes who earned their livelihood as weavers, potters, cobblers and scavengers. The relationship of a Jat village with the State was that of a semi-autonomous Unit paying a fixed sum of money. Few governments tried to assert authority, and those Which did, soon discovered that sending out armed militia against fortified Villages was not very profitable.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The Jats' spirit of freedom and equality refused to submit to Brahmanical Hinduism and in its turn drew the censure of the privileged Brahman of the Gangetic plains ... The upper caste Hindus' denigration of the Jat did not in the least lower the Jat in his own eyes&quot;. The Jat strongly asserts that &quot;Gold does not change its colour for fear of flames&quot;, and &quot;embers are, after all embers even though covered with ash. He (the Jat) assumed some-what 'condescending attitude towards the Brahman, whom he considers little better than a soothsayer or a beggar, or the Kshatriya, who disdained earning an honest living and was proud of being a mercenary. The Jat was born a worker and a warrior.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;He tilled his land with his sword girded round his waist. He fought more battles for the defence of his motherland than the Kshatriya, for unlike Kshatriya the Jat seldom fled from his village when the invaders came. And if the Jat was maltreated or if his Wife was molested by the conqueror on his way to Hindustan, he settled his score by looting the invader's caravans ... His brand of patriotism was at once hostile to foreigners and benign, even Contemptuous towards his own countrymen whose fate depended so much on his courage and fortitude&quot;, (History Of the Sikhs, Vol. 1, pp. l5f). In fact, the Jats have always &quot;sacrificed their day for our to-day and their to-day for our tomorrow.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Brahmins = upper-caste, priestly class who dictated varna (caste) status</p>
<p>Kshatriya = upper-caste, warrior class who adhered to brahmin rules and regulations to earn their varna status</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find your central assertion </p>
<blockquote>
<p>the caste system was NOT stronger in the past</p>
</blockquote>
<p>hard to support from the sources you mentioned. There is plenty of evidence for strong castes in the past. See <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/21x3tv/ive_always_been_taught_that_the_present_hindu/" target="_blank">this discussion on AskHistorians</a> for examples: strong caste system in Nepal (never colonised by British), genetical evidence for very little intermarriage between castes for past 2000 years. Particularly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/21x3tv/ive_always_been_taught_that_the_present_hindu/cghnyr0/" target="_blank">this comment</a> explains that Dirk's &quot;fluidity&quot; in castes means something else than that it was easy to change caste or that it was no big deal. </p>
<p>Also seeing that you mention exactly the same sources as agentdcf doesn't really instill confidence that there is a wide consensus.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Both the comments you link say the exact same thing I am saying.</p>
<p>The post says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The point that gets missed here is that politics--and therefore caste--is a two-way street. Yes, British and European scholars and administrators looked at Indian people, saw caste relationships, and assumed that these relationships were fixed, rigid, and timeless; yes, their administration put into place governance that operated on those assumptions--but, Indians also had to work within these systems, and adapted to them. I don't have his book to hand, but Dirks identified moments in the late nineteenth century when colonial administrators would come up with some policy that gave preferential treatment to particular castes. As soon as they did that, the people affected would begin to assert their caste identity, going to the administrators and saying, essentially, &quot;We're in this caste; you've gotten us miscategorized, we're part of this caste, we always have been, and that other group of people from the other side of the village, they've never been part of this caste. So, you should give us this particular preferential treatment, and not them.&quot; So, it's not as though the British just showed up and declared caste a thing; they showed up, tried to govern according to a radically simplified[1] and Orientalist view of how they thought Indian people lived, and Indian people responded to that governance in ways that maximized their benefits within it. Caste is, therefore, the product of colonialism and Orientalism, but not only of those things. It was a long process, involving actors from all parts of Indian and colonial society. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just to clarify, the British did not invent this system, they took an existing socioeconomical and cultural structure, didn't understand it in the least, interpreted it the way their own system ran (priests, knights, traders and serfs with a bunch of slaves in the end) and applied their own rules to this system. The system then responded and became more rigid in response to this stimuli.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other comment says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Caste is more akin to race than social rank. Fluidity in a caste system means that whole castes themselves move up or down in the heirarchy of social prestige. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there is nothing to back up this claim that entire castes went up and down and not individuals (which is what I say),</p>
<p>I say,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The caste system originally was defined as a guild system - similar to the one in say Europe from the fall of Rome onwards (or traced back to Diocletian's reforms on guilds).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I fail to see the disconnect here. </p></div>		</li>
