			<div class="markdown"><p>That answers my question wonderfully! </p>
<p>Though if I may pose a follow up; do you have any idea how the medical community, immunologists specifically I guess, determine which immunizations have to be broken down into multi-phase immunizations? Or how they determine the vaccines that are safe to give together vs those that need to be on a separate time table to be able to allow the body to dedicate a larger response to it?</p>
<p>I'd imagine at least part of that process was based on trial and error or an excess of safety for more dangerous diseases such as smallpox?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The short answer: lots of pre-clinical R&amp;D, then clinical trials. Lab studies suggest how the immune system will respond guide development of a new vaccine, then in clinical trials they will test the vaccine and determine how many doses are needed and how far apart, as well as if there are safety issues. </p>
<p>Some background on clinical trials to help put you to sleep (sure is helping my insomnia):</p>
<p>Clinical trials typically go through 4 progressive phases, which generally go as follows:</p>
<p>The first is “first in human” testing, just looking to see if humans respond grossly as expected, and to determine thresholds for toxicity/intolerable side effects. This involves a small number of healthy people are given the treatment in a carefully monitored arrangement. Again, not really looking at actual clinical effectiveness - just evidence of the predicted biological response. </p>
<p>Phase II is still relatively small, but now looking for clinical response (does this actually treat/prevent what we want it to), and safety/tolerability, and try to determine what dose(s) give provide the best balance of effectiveness and safety. </p>
<p>Phase III is next if Phase II is successful. Phase III trials are an important part of a drug being fully approved/going to market (but some are marketed during this phase, with the necessary caveats of course). This is when the drug is tested on a large sample of patients across multiple centres to give a bigger, hopefully more statistically accurate picture of how well it works. </p>
<p>Phase IV is post-marketing (follow-up/confirmatory) studies seeing if things hold up in the long term/in the real world, if there are safety risks down the road. Making use of the massively bigger/more accessible pool of data available once people start using whatever is being studied. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of work goes into vaccine design for pathogens. To determine if a vaccine needs multiple immunizations, we look at data from both animals and humans (see /u/goforbee for more clinical trial info). Proteins that do not exhibit high immunogenicity often require multiple immunizations to get the immune system to recognize the protein. We can determine this by vaccinating animals/humans and using an ELISA to test for antibodies to the protein, especially at the different time points in the immunization schedule. Once we know what antibody levels (titers) give protection to infection, we use that to determine the vaccination schedule, dosing, and length of protection. </p>
<p>You are definitely partly correct though. In the beginning before immunoassays, a lot of this knowledge came from trial and error. Thankfully, we have a lot better tools today that allow us to take some of the guess work out.</p>

<p>And more so, thanks for the work you do!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Administering multiple vaccines together in a single shot can increase their efficacy, too. Essentially, the immune system is already recruited against one thing, and is more likely to recruit against the other. This means that smaller amounts of antigens for each can be administered to be effective as compared to if the shots were given separately. In addition to reducing the amount of antigens, combining vaccines into a single shot reduces exposure to inactive ingredients in vaccines, such as preservatives, as well, which may be preferable for a patient.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacy student here--it probably is ok, and obviously you may see a more pronounced local reaction at the site of injection but the key point is just to monitor and treat symptoms as needed.
Personal story is how I had gotten a second degree burn and received a tetanus shot in the hospital, but 4 months later (which by vaccine schedules, would be too soon to receive another dose of tetanus toxoid) I had to receive the Tdap as a requirement before starting pharmacy school. The nurse who gave me the injection said it wasn't a contraindication to receiving Tdap but I just had to watch out for how I was feeling and I could experience a more sore arm. She was right, I had a very sore arm, but that was only temporary and I just managed it with some tylenol. </p></div>		</li>
