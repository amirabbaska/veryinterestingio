He was on the board of directors for the company that I worked for at the time (which is long gone by now as well) and I have preserved (for posterity, or something) the email that went out the day after his death (I apologize in advance for its length):</p>

<p>Subject: The last white hat....</p>
<p>Friends, </p>
<p>I had intended for this to be my &quot;farewell&quot; note to you all, my final
salute to the people who have helped to make Genuity, once a dream, into
a reality. But today I am almost paralyzed with sadness.</p>
<p>Although I was the founder of Genuity, it would not have existed without
the help of a very special person... my friend, Jon Postel.</p>
<p>Jon died yesterday (October 16), in Los Angeles. He was 55.</p>
<p>When Gemuity was created, in 1995, Jon agreed to join me as my second
seat holder on the board of Genuity, and he stayed with Genuity up until
it was acquired by GTE last December. Many of you met him, and spoke
with him when he came to Phoenix for board meetings. He was the voice of
reason when we had noisy discussions, and he mediated when our opinions
differed.</p>
<p>I don't think I need to tell you about Jon's professional
accomplishments. He is everywhere. His work touches all of our lives
every day. And his legacy will outlive all of us. For the last few
months he has been deeply involved in the creation of the new governing
body of the Internet, known as ICANN. Up until then, he <em>was</em> IANA -
the Internet assigned numbers authority. He was the RFC editor (yes,
each and every Internet RFC passed through Jon's hands, and only made it
to the system when Jon was satisfied). And for almost 30 years, the
entire Internet trusted his judgment, and impartiality, and fairness.</p>
<p>Now he's gone.</p>
<p>He was truly the last of the &quot;white hats&quot;. I cannot imagine what will
happen to the Internet now that he's left us. And while I'll miss him
terribly personally, I think the whole world will feel the effect of his
passing. Vint Cerf, one of the founders of the Internet (with Jon), and
a good friend of Jon's, sent the attached note today to some of his
friends. It says it better than I ever could.</p>
<p>So my friends, with these sad words, I say good-bye, and thank you. I
hope you all reach the heights that you dream of, and I know that in
your own way, you'll also leave your mark like Jon has.</p>
<p>Be well.</p>
<p>/rlj</p>
<p>October 17, 1998</p>
<p>I REMEMBER IANA</p>
<p>Vint Cerf</p>
<p>A long time ago, in a network, far far away, a great adventure took
place:</p>
<p>Out of the chaos of new ideas for communication, the experiments, the
tentative designs, and crucible of testing, there emerged a cornucopia
of networks. Beginning with the ARPANET, an endless stream of networks
to become the Internet. Someone
had to keep track of all the protocols, the identifiers, networks and
addresses and ultimately the names of all the things in the networked
universe. And someone had to keep track of all the information that
erupted with volcanic force from the intensity of the debates and
discussions and endless invention that has continued unabated for 30
years. That someone was Jonathan B. Postel, our Internet Assigned
Numbers Authority, friend, engineer, confidant, leader, icon, and now,
first of the giants to depart from our midst.</p>
<p>Jon, our beloved IANA, is gone. Even as I write these words I cannot
quite grasp this stark fact. We had almost lost him once before in 1991.
Surely we knew he was at risk as are we all. But he had been our rock,
the foundation on which our every web search and email was built, always
there to mediate the random dispute, to remind us when our documentation
did not do justice to its subject, to make difficult decisions with
apparent ease, and to consult when careful consideration was needed. We
will survive our loss and we will remember. He has left a monumental
legacy for all Internauts to  contemplate. Steadfast service for
decades, moving when others seemed paralyzed, always finding the right
course in a complex minefield of technical and sometimes political
obstacles.</p>
<p>Jon and I went to the same high school, Van Nuys High, in the San
Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles. But we were in different classes
and I really didn't know him then. Our real meeting came at UCLA when we
became a part of a group of graduate students working for Prof. Leonard
Kleinrock on the ARPANET project. Steve Crocker was another of the Van
Nuys crowd who was part of the team and led the development of the first
host-host protocols for the ARPANET. When Steve invented the idea of the
Request for Comments series, Jon became the instant editor. When we
needed to keep track of all the hosts and protocol identifiers, Jon
volunteered to be the Numbers Czar and later the IANA once the Internet
was in place.</p>
<p>Jon was a founding member of the Internet Architecture Board and served
continuously from its founding to the present. He was the FIRST
individual member of the Internet Society I know, because he and Steve
Wolff raced to see who could fill out the application forms and make
payment first and Jon won. He served as a trustee of the Internet
Society. He was the custodian of the .US domain, a founder of the Los
Nettos Internet service, and, by the way, managed the networking
research division of USC Information Sciences Institute.</p>
<p>Jon loved the outdoors. I know he used to enjoy backpacking in the high
Sierras around Yosemite. Bearded and sandaled, Jon was our resident
hippie-patriarch at UCLA. He was a private person but fully capable of
engaging photon torpedoes and going to battle stations in a good
engineering argument. And he could be stubborn beyond all expectation.
He could have outwaited the Sphinx in a staring contest, I think.</p>
<p>Jon inspired loyalty and steadfast devotion among his friends and his
colleagues. For me, he personified the words &quot;selfless service.&quot; For
nearly 30 years, Jon has served us all, taken little in return, indeed
sometimes receiving abuse when he should have received our deepest
appreciation. It was particularly gratifying at the last Internet
Society meeting in Geneva to see Jon receive the Silver Medal of the
International Telecommunications Union. It is an award generally
reserved for Heads of State but I can think of no one more deserving of
global recognition for his contributions.</p>
<p>While it seems almost impossible to avoid feeling an enormous sense of
loss, as if a yawning gap in our networked universe had opened up and
swallowed our friend, I must tell you that I am comforted as I
contemplate what Jon has wrought. He leaves a legacy of edited documents
that tell our collective Internet story, including not only the
technical but also the poetic and whimsical as well. He completed the
incorporation of a successor to his service as IANA and leaves a lasting
legacy of service to the community in that role. His memory is rich and
vibrant and will not fade from our collective consciousness. &quot;What would
Jon have done?&quot; we will think, as we wrestle in the days ahead with the
problems Jon kept so well tamed for so many years.</p>
<p>There will almost surely be many memorials to Jon's monumental service
to the Internet Community. As current chairman of the Internet Society,
I pledge to establish an award in Jon's name to recognize long-standing
service to the community, the Jonathan B. Postel Service Award, which is
awarded to Jon posthumously as its first recipient.</p>
<p>If Jon were here, I am sure he would urge us not to mourn his passing
but to celebrate his life and his contributions. He would remind us that
there is still much work to be done and that we now have the
responsibility and the opportunity to do our part. I doubt that anyone
could possibly duplicate his record, but it stands as a measure of one
man's astonishing contribution to a community he knew and loved. </p></div>		</li>

<p>At some point GTE was forced to sell off all their Internet assets before they became Verizon.</p>

I've never really given thought to the people that made it all possible until reading the posts above. You're post here really woke me up to it. </p>
<p>So, again, thanks for sharing. I have a lot of reading to do now :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I still remember trying to debug some terminal issues one time (like five years ago) on FreeBSD. Long story short, I ended up digging through the termcap/terminfo files - that is, the configuration files for how the computer talks to different line devices.</p>
<p>There were comments spread throughout, and most of them were signed in the form <code># Changed thing X johns@AMES</code></p>
<p>At first blush, I just figured the number of people actively committing to this file was fairly small and maybe they were all well known enough amongst themselves that they didn't need to provide a full hostname.</p>
<p>As I started digging further and finding more and more users listed, that started to look less and less likely... On a whim, I googled one of the hostnames.</p>
<p>APRAnet. There was a file in active use on my machine that still had traces of people that were on the internet before it was the internet.</p>
<p>There was really no point to this story, I just thought it was kind of neat. For your troubles, have this <a href="http://som.csudh.edu/cis/lpress/history/arpamaps/" target="_blank">listing of ARPAnet maps from 1969 to 1977</a>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What ICANN does is define how registrars can operate, and who has access to what segments of the system, mainly regarding the TLDS such as .com, .uk, and so on.</p>
<p>You can, actually, buy (or attempt to buy) a new TLD, for the low low price of $185,000, with no guarantee of delivery and no refund (that's the application fee just to <em>propose</em> a new TLD). </p>
<p>Anyway, after the TLDs, are the second level domain names, or SLDs or 2LDs, e.g. the &quot;reddit&quot; in &quot;reddit.com&quot;. Those are sold by the registrars, not by ICANN, and that's on purpose.</p>
<p>After 2LDs, all subsequent segments (3LDs, 4LDs, and so on) are entirely up to the 2LD owner.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If I buy &quot;madrawn.com&quot; from a registrar... do I 'own' the 2LD? And can therefore do whatever I want with &quot;one.madrawn.com&quot; to &quot;infinity.madrawn.com&quot;? Or do I have to pay the registrar too if I want to use 3LD?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It used to be that you registered all (US?) domains through internic.net, and they were free, but there were more rules about who could purchase what (.org was supposed to be nonprofits, .edu had to have school credentials and most country specific domains were limited to people of that country - several of which sold the rights and some small countries with &quot;cute&quot; toplevels made a bundle).</p>
<p>Then that also became unsustainable so they started charging a few bucks per year for it. Eventually as the price went up and demand went crazy the powers that be decided they needed to open things up and allow for competition to keep prices down and quality up for the bazillions of websites that were cropping up all over the world, so they created the open registry system we have in place now, where registries sign up to provide the service and coordinate through a central authority. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's how it kinda works with governments registrars, the ones that have domains ending in country codes (.br, etc...) The ones without the country code were for the USA. They provided this service for some time, but then ICANN started to bug them that they needed to sign the new contract they created. The government refused to do so. The UK government also refused, this is why you can buy .uk domains from common registrars.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can't buy directly. Basically they don't want to deal with your shit (customer support). You registrar would deal with your shit and their code interacts with ICANN system. ICANN managers root servers but they only want to deal with registrars and has rules like registrarX can not create domains with country Y cause their country/gov only allows registrar J K and L do that.</p>
<p>tl;dr: ICANN doesn't do support customer so you can't be a customer.</p></div>		</li>
