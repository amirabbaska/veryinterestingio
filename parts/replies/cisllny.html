			<p>ummm Jon Postel was not just &quot;some dude&quot; he probably wrote (and is still credited for) more than half the <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/" target="_blank">RFCs</a> on the internet.  I don't use the word &quot;God&quot; lightly and even I would say he is a one of the Gods of the internet. He was an incredible genius. (just wanted to give more credit than &quot;dude&quot; though he probably would have been fine being called that)</p>		</li>
