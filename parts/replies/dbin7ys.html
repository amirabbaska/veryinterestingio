			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, this thread is growing rapidly, so you probably haven't seen my other replies.  I was born and raised, and still live in, Mississippi, and I work in Alabama, which are two of the poorest states, of course.  When I asked the question, I didn't even think that other states or locales might pay their employees better, and honestly thought it was that way all over.  My mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Poorest states have the cheapest land and housing costs.</p>
<p>When you move to wealthier and denser regions a 33k salary can't really afford you a one bedroom apartment...whereas in rural america you might be able to afford a house and a few acres with that little salary.</p>
<p>It's all really relative.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While I agree it's all relative and that 33k goes a lot further in the south, it most certainly is not enough to afford a house on a few acres.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but that's California.  I'm friends with a chemical engineer in San Francisco (I live in Tennessee), and her rent is 3x more than mine for a studio apartment that's about as small as my bedroom alone, ignoring my bathroom, living room, and kitchen.  </p>
<p>$100K in San Francisco is about $55K in my city, and housing there is literally around 255% more, according to CNN.</p>
<p>So making close to 6 figures in an area like that still equates to a middle class wage everywhere else.  </p></div>		</li>
