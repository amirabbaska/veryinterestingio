			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, most games have to be finished a month or two before the actual release date, so that there's time to produce and ship the physical game discs/cartridges. That's why &quot;day 1&quot; patches are so common, because during those 1-2 months that the game is being manufactured and shipped, the developers are still working on ironing out those bugs and glitches, maybe finishing up some extra content, or what have you, and then those fixes are sent out on release day.</p></div>		</li>

<p>There's another point like this.</p>
<p>You see the bug that was left in at launch. But you <em>don't</em> see that there were two bugs reported, but only time to fix <em>one</em> of them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once found a bug where all the static geometry in my level would shift in the x axis 100 world units when the player jumped on a specific rock. We couldn't figure out what was causing it so we ended up just hiding that rock, and replacing it with a different rock. Fixed. Shipped. </p></div>		</li>
