			<div class="markdown"><p>so is it a good idea or not to take tylenol/advil to lower your fever? I had awful chills, fever and body ache yesterday and finally took advil. Does that lengthen the infection?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Recently, a lot of research has been put into deciding whether or not it's better to counteract the fever or to suffer through it. The jury is still out. Higher body temperatures can kill bacteria and viruses sensitive to temperature change, but at the expense of a lot of metabolic energy, leaving you feeling miserable. If you find that you physically feel better taking antipyretics, then I'd suggest doing so. Your body is capable of fighting an infection via other immune responses. However, children are especially vulnerable to something known as febrile seizures, which are brought on by exceptionally high fevers. This is why pediatricians recommend antipyretics in kids. </p>
<p>Edit: I should clarify that fevers don't necessarily kill the bacteria/viruses. Rather, it prevents replication and makes them more susceptible to immune response. Furthermore, high temperatures in and of themselves don't cause febrile seizures, it's the rapid rise in temp that triggers the seizure. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned a lot of energy is used to increase the core body temp. Do antipyretics work by stopping the warming process of the body or by allowing the body to expell heat faster some how? I.e. Do antipyretics actually stop the body from wasting energy? Also, can antipyretics be used to reduce core temp for someone on the brink of heat stroke/exhaustion? I know there's a difference between the two conditions I guess asking about both. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>FWIW, in the hospital, both when I worked with adults and in now in pediatrics, we don’t administer Tylenol or other antipyretic until the fever reaches 100.4°F or 38°C. </p>

Which means, if the fever reaches dangerously high levels generally above 39°C or if the sympthoms are keeping you from sleeping</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your body lives in such a narrow range of values, it’s insane. </p>
<p>Blood pH? 7.35-7.45</p>
<p>Absolutely mad that the body manages to maintain that. </p>
<p>Generally stuff gets crazy when you get down small enough though. For example, particles under 1 micrometre move like gases, in and out of the alveoli. 1-5 micrometre particles are the most dangerous ones. </p>
<p>Shit, people with cystic fibrosis are fucked because of one singular mutation in the CTFR gene, which codes for a (I think) chloride ion transporter. The kicker is that the transporter is still functional, but the body recognises it as abnormal and prevents its trafficking to the cell surface. </p>
<p>This was just me rambling but the point is that the human body is such a paradox of incredibly fragile and incredibly resilient. It’s insane. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually doesn’t slow down viral multiplication; if anything, in increases it by increasing protein-protein interactions on a molecular level through Brownian motion. However, what heat can do is denature proteins and some viral/bacterial ones are thought to denature at a temperature just slightly lower than mammalian ones (although data behind this is pretty scant, temperature in the fever range has been shown to decrease the effects of bacterial toxins). </p>
<p>What a fever does do is increase your own immune response. Your immune cells move quicker, proliferate faster, and chew up invader cells/viral particles more efficiently. </p>
<p>Regardless, though, you’re right to say it increases the set-point of the thermostat, making your muscles contract (shiver) and also decrease blood flow to your extremities (also makes you feel colder). </p>
<p>How this relates to OP’s bath question comes down to the fact that humans can not tell absolute temperature, only differences in temperature (or more accurately, transfer of energy). So since your body thermostat is set higher, a bath that would normally feel hot may only feel warm.</p></div>		</li>
