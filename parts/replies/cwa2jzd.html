			<div class="markdown"><p>If I'm not mistaken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade" target="_blank">Tardigrades</a> have been exposed to the (near) vacuum of space and survive, which would put the lower limit at around -270C. I'm not sure if this counts though, because they aren't really adapted for living at such temperatures, they're just able to survive them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly I think we don't just need survive but process food, reproduce, and live a whole life in that environment. Which takes us back to the -40C to 120C obserserved or assumed - with a possible extension beyond that.</p>
<p>It has to do with liquid water right? Couldn't we theoretically have a higher temperature where there is higher pressure (so long as there is still liquid water) such as on a planet with much higher gravity?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The concept of Temprature isn't really apliccable in the vacuum of space, as in you wouldn't really freeze there, as vaccum is due to the lack of patricles to give heat to a really good heat isolator.
The so called &quot;Temprature of Space&quot; of 3K, give or take, is the corrensponding Temprature of the Cosmic Microwave background wich is heavily redhifted residual Radiation from billions of years ago. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat related question that no one has ever really been able to answer for me: Is temperature an emergent property of time? In a &quot;timeless space&quot; does temperature mean anything? It just really seems to me that temperature and time are very, very closely linked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In space, there is heat exchange from the light of the nearest stellar object.  That is why planets close to stars are warmer than planets far away.  There are plenty of those kinds of (photon) particles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It should be mentioned that temperature isn't as important as is the rate at which an organism loses heat. As an example, if you had the choice of sitting in a wood chair at -10C or a metal chair at -10C, which would you choose? In space, it is hard to lose heat, because it is a vacuum and there is nothing to convect with. So while it is &quot;cold&quot; in space, tardigrades wouldn't really feel it because it is so hard to lose body heat to nothing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When I was performing my senior thesis (B.S. in Biochemistry) I was working with extremeophiles, particularly radiophiles. One of the things I did on my research was look up other extremophiles to look for similar relationships/mechanisms (I didn't find a whole lot, but I'm only a B.S. and I was new to research and I enjoyed the reading). When I ran across some thermophiles, the only hyperthermophiles I ran across were in around heat vents at deep parts of the sea where the water didn't boil at 100C. What are the deposits in the Mississippi Valley that you are referring to? Could you possibly point me in the direction of some articles about those?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These are a category of Pb-Zn ore deposit mostly hosted in limestones. In a world full of weird things, they are <em>weird</em>...</p>
<p>They form as shale basins dewater through compaction at the edge of the continental shelf behind an orogenic front and oil field brines they release <em>flow uphill</em> hundred of kilometers into the aquifer within the craton. Their sulphide load is usually (but not always) the result of bacterial reduction of evaporitic sulphates. Another weirdness issued from them is that the lead isotope signature of some of the galena in the Missouri district returned apparent ages far into the future (a consequence of those ore forming in an open, as opposed to a closed, system).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also interesting to note for hyperthermophile bacteria have been discovered while drilling boreholes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11607462" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11607462</a> points to bacteria being found at least 5200 meters below the surface, which works out to around 100C, given a 20 degree/km temperature correlation between surface and depth.  Plus or minus like 30%.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/48447-deepest-life-methane-clues.html" target="_blank">http://www.livescience.com/48447-deepest-life-methane-clues.html</a> even suggests that metabolic processes could have happened even deeper underground, near subduction rifts.</p>
<p>These lifeforms are incredibly hard to study in the lab, as, well, petri dish culture environment aren't really setup for breeding bacteria that may require crushing depths and high, extremely stable, temperatures.  DNA denatures when the temperature is over 120C, but it might not when it's under extreme pressure.  I recall reading in a discovery magazine article a decade or so ago that these type of bacteria were also super-slow.  Like, on the order of ten cm travelled every thousand years slow.  Nobody's gonna give you a grant for that much lab time.</p>
<p>So for evidence of life, we look at core samples, and look for traces and lines that bacteria make as they eat their way through the rock.  Stuff like mineral formations that alter a digested path that could only have formed at specific depths.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm on mobile, so I'll definitely give those a look later!</p>
<p>As for the DNA, I know that there are several bacteria that contain proteins known as Nucleoid-Associated Proteins (NAPs) that hold the DNA together, particularly to combat forms of DNA damage such as radiation or desiccation. I wouldn't be surprised if they also had there place there; NAPs seem to be very prevalent in extremophiles, particularly the deinococcus genus.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is because high temperature hydrothermal vents can't occur unless the pressure is sufficient to keep the water as a fluid.</p></div>		</li>
