<p>Sugar Beet is around 20% sugar and extremely easy to grow in almost any place. World production yearly seems to be around 250 million metric tons.
Sugar cane has half to 3/4 that in sugar content, doesn't grow everywhere and requires a lot of work in comparison, still the production almost quadrupled since 1965 (around 190 million metric tons)</p>
<p>so 50 million metric tons from sugar beet and 19 to ~29 million metric tons from sugar cane</p>
<p>sugar beet mollasses is basically unpalatable for humans and most used as livestock feed or to make ethanol so it gets removed to have a palatable product</p>
<p>sugar cane mollasses on the other hand is a food additive and baking/cooking ingredient in it's own right</p>
<p>both are pretty healthy and full of nutrients, few sugar cane mollasses are almost as unpalatable as beet mollasses tho (and they still get sold)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Molasses is a near black, viscous syrup that comes out of raw sugar when you refine it. When the sugar comes from sugar cane, the molasses is really tasty to people, and it’s used as an ingredient in a lot of baked goods and candies.</p>
<p>Molasses is extracted by boiling the raw sugar. As it cools, the sugar crystallizes out and leaves the molasses behind as a by product.</p></div>		</li>
