			<div class="markdown"><p>But the fact remains that there is still too few combinations of the available DNA to realistically sustain the population, right? </p>
<p>Even after 10 generations, you're still only dealing with various combinations of the DNA of the original 2 refugees/colonists/survivors, and any flaws in their DNA will almost certainly be fully exposed within just a couple generations. Genetic issues resulting from inbreeding and genetic drift would be rampant, to the point that the population wouldn't be viable long term. </p>
<p>Scientists project that the minimum population size for human beings to continue in a situation as OP described would be as low as 30-50, but as high as several thousand. The lower end necessitating everyone having sex with everyone, the higher end being free to be monogamous. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nope,  the observable fact is that heavy inbreeding often <em>doesn't</em> obliterate populations all by itself.  It reduces fertility and increases susceptibility to disease, but if conditions are otherwise favorable that wouldn't necessarily result in population failure by itself.</p>
<p>Examples of this are numerous. All the golden hamsters you see in captivity are descended from the offspring of a single female that was collected in the 30's.  Many mice strains used in labs are similarly inbred.  Most terrestrial animals living on oceanic islands are descended from similarly small starter populations that happened to be swept there (sometimes a single pregnant female).  Of course, what all these situations have in common is that the ecological conditions are very favorable...you don't have to worry about disease very much when in captivity or when 1000 miles over water from the nearest sick individual.  You don't have to worry about food much when you get it delivered in pellet form or when you are the first on an empty island where no competitors live.  You don't have to worry about predators in either case.  Sure, maybe half your offspring die of being inbred, but 75% <em>aren't</em> dying of starvation or predation, so you can still come out ahead.</p></div>		</li>
