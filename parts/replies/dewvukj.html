<p>according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_University" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> it's a think tank and not an actual proper university as you might think of. No actual degrees are taught there and I doubt you'll find any papers citing work attributed to that institute</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi all- from SXSW.  Exponential Medicine started in 2011 as 'FutureMed'... given how many folks were interested in healthcare from different clinical and technology worlds... but most conferences and meetings are very silo'd by medical speciality or technology... so bringing them all together to look at convergence and solving challenges in health and medicine seemd to strike a chord....</p></div>		</li>
