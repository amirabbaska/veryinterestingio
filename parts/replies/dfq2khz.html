			<div class="markdown"><p>I want to build my credit profile so that I can be eligible for a mortgage/home loan.. I've been debating for a while whether or not to get it cause I mean I can always wait to buy something but yeah. That home loan isn't gonna just get approved by itself! Haha. </p>
<p>Thanks for the tip! </p></div>		</li>
