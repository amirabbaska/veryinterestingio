			<div class="markdown"><p>I know algae produces the most O2 but what about locking up CO2? As algae makes its way through the food chance how is that co2 eventually locked up, versus trees where it's locked up in the ground forever.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is mostly correct, but only takes into consideration the amount of energy STORED in glucose, and doesn’t account for the O2 that the tree reuses for its own cellular respiration. I tried to do a quick internet search to find what proportion of a trees glucose is reused for cellular respiration, but was unsuccessful. I would imagine that the vast majority of a tree’s glucose is stored as cellulose, but it still offsets the amount of O2 provided by the tree. </p></div>		</li>
