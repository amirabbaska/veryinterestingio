			<div class="markdown"><p>There are several research projects afoot that deal with reclaiming phosphorus (and nitrogen, while we're at it) from human urine. In the longer term, this is almost certainly the solution.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that if we suddenly had zero phosphorus, it would probably cut our worldwide agricultural yield by as much as 90%. That's how important fertilizer is to worldwide agriculture.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Waterways near agricultural and urban areas are often heavily polluted by phosphorus and other nutrients due to run-off and leaching. If phosphorus ever became scarce in a real sense, conservation and improved practices would be the first step, followed by possible recovery.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True, but as the original commenter noted above, it isn't a problem of phosphorus as an element, but phosphates as a compound.  Elemental resources can't really run out in a closed system, but feasibly recycling the resources is the real issue here. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The phosphorus is not destroyed, it is simply either tied up in biological matter as its used in every cell of every living thing in small amounts, or most of it is washed downstream into the ocean.</p>
<p>It is theoretically possible to try to extract phosphorus from ocean water, but going to be way more expensive to develop the technology and infrastructure than it is to mine it.</p>
<p>But the economics of it mean we will never run out, it just may get more expensive while we figure out alternative sources.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Doubtful, at least not in the same sense. Rubber is a carbon-based polymer found in trees, and when that ran low we just started making similar carbon-based polymers out of oil. Phosphorus is an element in its own right, so there's no substitute. Much like our rubber replacement was still made of carbon, any fertilizer substitute will still need phosphorus in it. If we got really desperate, I suppose we could start producing phosphorus via nuclear means, but more likely we'll have to find a new source of ore or recycle more phosphorus from things like wastewater and trash.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no phosphorus shortage, this is a misconception between &quot;resources&quot; and &quot;proven resources&quot;. If you are a mining corporation, you need to prove that you can continue to operate. This is the resources you are exploiting, theses resources are a specific gisement, a specific formation you are mining. You then need to secure other sources, aka proven resources to transition to when the current source is depleted. You plan like that in the future up to 40 years... then what's the point? You stop looking.
Phosphorus is in this categorie. We can (and do) extract phosphorus from apatite from instance and apatite is very abundant.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatite</a><br />
This is true for most resources, we are always only 40 years to running out... of current proven reserve. Then we will find new sources.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes what you said. It's disappointing to see the comments above at the top of this thread although it us hardly surprising since this idea is so widespread within academia. I'd considered it as gospel until I read <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/22/energy_economics_coal/" target="_blank">this article</a> a few years back. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You got me thinking, let's say we did know the total amount of phosphorous or any other element on earth. What constitutes an alarming rate for running out? 40 years? 100 years? 500 years?</p>
<p>Let's say you're an optimist and believe the human race is going to be around a while. Would depleting our phosphorous reserves in 2000 years be an alarming rate? Are we just that confident that in the future we'll be great at alchemy or space mining? </p>
<p>It seems shortsighted to me that we're going so balls out with our nonrenewable resources when don't know how much of this stuff we have left, how much of a role it will play in future technology, whether we will be able to move beyond it or reproduce it in the future, and how critical it will be to our future survival.</p>
<p>I hear we have plenty of oil left, for how long though? What if we need it to escape the planet in the year 7,490? What if there is a setback or we don't discover a better means of escaping our atmosphere when some asteroid is barreling down on us and its all because people in the year 2018 thought 1000 years worth was plenty.</p></div>		</li>
