<p>tl;dr: sometimes kids wet the bed for a multiple of diagnosable reasons. e.g severe stress, infections, small bladder</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you. Finally an answer that isn't asking me if I still pee myself. I have another question if you don't mind; sometimes I dream about going to the toilet to pee and I do it, but I haven't wet my pants in real life when I wake up. Is the muscle control so strong that it can prevent the body from doing somethingâ€‹ that the mind truly believes it is doing? Sorry if this is out of your area of expertise.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not really about muscle control. It's more related to a person's ability to detect that the bladder is full. People will have varying sensitivity to bladder fullness. In many cases while people are dreaming, the brain simply can't detect that the bladder is overfull. I wouldn't worry about this too much. It happens to a lot of people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And eventually, you learned to wake up early enough to actually make it to the bathroom? That's what it took for me. I can barely have a dream go NEAR a bathroom without jolting awake expecting to need to pee. Occasionally I'll be able to tell that this bathroom doesn't mean that, and get on with my dream. I have had more than a few false alarms though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Part of sleep is that the brain/body instigates a paralysis-like system which prevents muscles under conscious control from being acivated. As far as can be told this mechanism is in place to prevent you acting out your dreams and disfunctions of system are in part what leads to sleepwalking.</p>
<p>Likely you don't wet yourself during your dreams because this paralysis is working as intended.</p></div>		</li>
