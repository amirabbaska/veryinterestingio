			<div class="markdown"><p>True. Take this into consideration also OP. My explanation is along the lines of if it actually is happening, and what Billy says is true is actually true. I take a lot of my explanation comes from different cases. Cases where people have said they've never come across that language. Cases not involving DID where similar things have happened ( brain damage leading to changes in language etc.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your description reminded me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain" target="_blank">split-brain</a> patients. As a last resort treatment for some types of epilepsy, the tissue that connects the two halves of your brain—the corpus callosum—is severed. This separates the brain into two distinct hemispheres, and experimentation and observation has caused some to wonder if split brain patients may be two minds in one body.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know a lot about split-brain research, but given that the brain is pretty good at making up for deficits via mechanism like neuroplasticity, I don't think the original research could be considered anything more than anecdotal. It comes from an era where people believed the brain couldn't possibly fix or correct problems, which is pretty much the opposite of where things stand today.</p></div>		</li>
