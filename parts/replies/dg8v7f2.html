			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a great answer. I have HFA as well, and I'm glad there's a name for when my senses get overloaded, particularly in work, to the point that I get little to no work done. It doesn't help that the office I work in isn't the best for me, both audibly and visibly. Sometimes I'll fidget, but other times my mind will go into this protective state where it tries to blank everything out and I just mindlessly procrastinate.</p></div>		</li>

You could always put a sign up next to you asking to email you or tap your desk to get your attention. It might help and should be considered a reasonable accommodation for you.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that's pretty well explained. I personally agree with what you've said, especially the meditation bit. Never thought of it that way but it completely makes sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks! It was actually a fairly recent realization, my boyfriend was trying to teach me meditation techniques to help with my anxiety levels. When he explained how it effects him it clicked and I was like, &quot;Oh! I can already do that! <em>wiggles fingers</em>&quot;</p></div>		</li>
