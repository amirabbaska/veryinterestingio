			<div class="markdown"><p>Another huge factor in this is the availability. If it’s inexpensive enough a lot of people will buy it. If a lot of people have it it’s gets seen often and loses its special factor. Same kind of way a new corvette look incredible yet a 10 year old one looks old and out dated. Our taste for the exotic depends a lot on how often we see them. </p></div>		</li>

<p>2) Supercars are kinda big<br />
2a. Supercars are generally somewhat long with a wide wheelbase</p>

<p>Not really. They do tend to be a little wide (for better handling and to accommodate significantly wider tires) but they are generally shorter than &quot;normal cars&quot; in both height and length. </p>
<p>Just as one example, a 2017 Toyota Camry is 190.9&quot; (L) x 71.7&quot; (W) x 57.9&quot; (H). In comparison, a 2017 Ferrari 458 Italia is 178.2&quot; (L) x 76.3&quot; (W) x 47.4&quot; (H). By total volume, the Ferrari is only about 80% the size of the Camry. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, I can say that my Nissan 300ZX TT (what I would consider a poor man's supercar in 1994) looks really small next to my Honda Civic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fair point on the length. They're still big compared to a typical non-supercar 2-seater. I'd definitely put the Z32 in the non-supercar category though. Which is not to say it isn't an awesome car, just that it's too practical.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good explanations in here, but it doesn't really address why they can't just make the average car <em>look</em> a little cooler/sleek/stylish.</p>
<p>The design and shape of the plastic/fiber glass on the outside is mostly arbitrary (apart from aerodynamics) and doesn't really have a lot to do with all of the engineering/mechanical problems you mentioned, so long as they are scaled properly and can be fitted to the chassis. </p>
<p>It just seems like they purposefully design the bumpers/panels/mirrors etc to look as mundane as possible.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Couple things:  </p>
<ol>
<li>Aggressive styling can be polarizing (see: Honda Civic Si 2018)  </li>
<li>Most car companies reserve more aggressive styling for their more expensive cars as a way to distinguish them (see: Honda Civic Si 2018)  </li>
<li>If you just change the parts that are easy to tweak: bumpers, grille, fenders, front quarter panels, side skirts, you're either going to have to act with restraint in order to match it to the other lines of the car that <em>are</em> determined by practicality (the shape of the cabin, the shape of the engine compartment, the shape of the trunk/hatch, the shape/location of the wheel wells). If you show restraint you end up with the ~2010 Corolla S (<a href="https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/toyota/corolla/2009/oem/2009_toyota_corolla_sedan_s_fq_oem_2_500.jpg" target="_blank">https://media.ed.edmunds-media.com/toyota/corolla/2009/oem/2009_toyota_corolla_sedan_s_fq_oem_2_500.jpg</a>). It's easily recognizable as a barely tarted up Corolla. If you don't show restraint you end up with my favorite example from above. :)  </li>
<li>No matter what, it's going to have <em>some</em> effect on either aerodynamics, cost, weight, sturdiness or repairability</li>
