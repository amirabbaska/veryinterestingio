<p>CH4 + 2O2 --&gt; CO2 + 2H2O </p>
<p>As you can see, you need 2 moles of oxygen for 1 mole of methane. </p>
<p>Methane is 16g/mol;
Oxygen is 32g/mol;</p>
<p>Assuming everything burns up correctly, you need 64g of oxygen for every 16g of methane, which is 4 times more.</p>
<p>TL;DR you need at least 4 times more oxygen (in mass) as there is methane.</p></div>		</li>
