			<div class="markdown"><p>Remember how in history class, or maybe even on our own time, we read or learned about people revolting against stuff like this? M ainly when it was monarchs and nobles hoarding all the wealth?</p>
<p>Well monarchs and nobles have been replaced by corporate executives and financiers. Time to start a new revolution, fire up Occupy Wall Street again. It's not that it didn't have enough direction or it needed a leader,  but rather people are led to believe that the system is OK because they too can be rich one day like the elite, they were preoccupied with the excellent quality of entertainment we have these days, or they were concerned if they stopped working and went on strike they would lose their homes, be unable to afford food, lose their jobs etc.</p>
<p>If the majority of people went on a lengthy strike and the majority of people were behind on rent, do you think the majority of people would actually end up getting evicted? Think of the mess that would be... with the majority of the population tossed out on the street. That would only drive revolution further.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We as a people have been conditioned against Unions in the US.</p>
<p>&quot;But Union workers are LAZY and Unions are GREEDY!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're a relic of a different time and different circumstances. Companies can't get away with those types of abuses now.&quot;</p>
<p>I could fill pages with the kind of vitriol that most people are conditioned to feel against unions. Hell, I held some of those views when I was younger. We have a very unhealthy view of work in the United States and anti-union sentiment runs deep, which is a massive coup for those running massive corporations. Unions have their problems but without them the average worker has no leverage or power. &quot;Work somewhere else&quot; doesn't fix a systemic issue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just any union will do. Unionism is a tactic. The thing people should notice is that most of these billionaires are not really doing productive work that is deserving of billions in profit. The productive work is being done by everyone else. You all go to work everyday and that's what creates the wealth. You all refusing to work cuts them off. It's why strikes are a thing. Taxes aren't enough, politicians aren't your friends, and most unions today have no teeth. We need revolutionary unionism as a tactic. To all interested in this, look up the industrial workers of the world which seeks to build a union for all working people. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the whole change towards ending globalisation is a sign of people revolting but they appear to be looking inward and often targeting the wrong people. Look at politicians, they all are saying they will fix the issues... But they won't they don't have the power, truth is you need a majority in most countries and that's difficult to do the UK can't make much change with out the 3 main parties dismantling everything that goes through to be symbolic and not legislative... </p>
<p>I'm so tired of the nonsense, if you start a world wide people's revolution count me in :D, do we get t-shirts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Except that Oxfam bases this on net wealth, so includes debt:</p>
<p>&quot;if you use Oxfam’s methodology, my niece, with 50 cents in pocket money, has more wealth than the bottom 40% of the world’s population combined. As do I, and as do you, most likely, assuming your net worth is positive. You don’t need to find eight super-wealthy billionaires to arrive at a shocking wealth statistic; you can take just about anybody.&quot; And anybody with student debt is also poorer than his niece... its quite flawed.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>How is that flawed?  That's how debt works, it's a negative value.  For example, if you own a house and include it in you value but not the debt of the mortgage that's way more flawed of a valuation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was talking about CEO compensation the other day.  In some cases, the CEO is some super talented person that is the reason the company is successful.  A Steve Jobs/Bill Gates/Elon Musk type that built the company and cultivated the growth.  Those guys deserve an outrageous salary because the business worth is based on them.</p>
<p>In other cases, lets take a major corporation like MacDonald's.  The CEO adds value, but the difference between him and the next is marginal.  A guy that is bad means they lose some market share temporarily, then the next guy comes in and gets them back up to speed.  That guy deserves a good salary, but there is no justification for 50 million a year, or what some of these guys make.</p>
<p>Just an anecdote to think about when you consider CEO salaries.  Not all CEO's are part of adding that amount of value to a business.  They just happen to be part of this business class in American society, and buddies helping each other out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, ceo pay was relatively reasonable (compared to now). Where we saw it skyrocket is when politicians decided that C level executive compensation must be publicly reported, unlike pay for all other employees. Once CEOs could see what their peers were making, they used that as leverage to increase their salary and started the revolving door of CEOs. A good solution would be making public what each employee makes or not having to disclose what CEOs make</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What makes me sick isn't that the CEO's are making that much, or the companies are making record profits.  It's the fact that they're making that much, but at the same time paying employees an unlivable wage, and having the taxpayers pay for their employees' welfare.</p>
<p>I'm making $20k a year as a college student, and my taxes go to welfare for Walmart employees, while the company is raking in record profits and CEO's paid an absurd amount.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before someone tries to refute this I'll tell them they have to refute the &quot;having the taxpayers pay for their employees' welfare&quot; part as well. Otherwise, it doesn't really mean anything. It's outrageous that we are subsidizing an entity making 10,000,000x what we do. And I'm serious on that 10 million times more part, look at Wal-Mart's yearly revenue.</p></div>		</li>
