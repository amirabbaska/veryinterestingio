<p>Isn't that literally what stimulating output means?</p></div>		</li>

Could you please elaborate a little bit more about the difference between the two types of medication?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, to continue on with the analogy, you could say that option A keeps the flow of the river (ideally) at its optimum, whereas option B can introduce too much erosion (ie downregulation of dopamine receptors) into the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Edit: to be specific, there's a lot more to the mechanism of action for amphetamine and methylphenidate, but the analogy I used should stand on the basic principle that they're used in ADHD for.</p>
<p>By elaborate on the difference, do you mean their mechanism of action? What I've summed up here is that amphetamine is a dopamine/norepinephrine releasing agent versus methylphenidate, primarily a dopamine reuptake inhibitor.</p>
<p>Methylphenidate tends to be much more benign and is more commonly prescribed nowadays for many good reasons, but there's still some great uses for amphetamine. ADHD comes in all forms, and one known one is where there is something blocking the &quot;flow&quot; of the river. In this case, methylphenidate can't help rebalance as well as amphetamine can - with both dopamine release, agonism, and transporter(different than reuptake) activation, it can add to the flow, fix the block, or both.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does the analogy hold true if a person were to try to dam the river <em>and</em> find other sources to increase flow?  I.e. are methylphenidate and amphetamine compatible bedfellows?</p>
<p>If I'm not pushing the analogy too far, it could be that a lower dose of both could be a better approach than a high doee of one or the other.</p></div>		</li>
