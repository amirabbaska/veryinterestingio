			<div class="markdown"><p>That statement isn't entirely true. Like /u/Drtyblk7 said, bi-planes can fly at lower speeds where a monoplane wont have enough lift. Stunts are typically low speed/low lift situations so having a second set of wings helps to maintain flight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly...</p>
<p>The primary advantage of a biplane for aerobatics is that it has a shorter wingspan for a given amount of wing area.  This leads to a much lower moment of inertia about the roll axis (because I ~= m * r ^ 2, where m is mass and r is the radius from the center of rotation).  </p>
<p>By having a much lower moment of inertia, the ailerons are not required to generate as much force to begin and end a roll.  This reduces the control forces (since small airplanes don't generally have hydraulic boosted controls)[1], which both reduces pilot fatigue and effectively makes the plane more maneuverable.  </p>
<p>A second advantage for aerobatic airplanes is that the wing structure can be much stronger for a given amount of weight ( = more gee's, which is important for an aerobatic airplane).  This is because you can arrange things so that the bending moment of the wing is translated into tension and compression of the various components.  The disadvantage is that this creates a lot of drag (but aerobatic airplanes don't care about going fast, and they need powerful engines anyway).</p>
<p>Older planes (not just pre-WWII, but pre-depression) tended to be biplanes because monocoque construction hadn't been invented yet: Fabric wing surfaces can't act as a structural member the same way a metal skin can.</p>
<p>[1] Yes, yes, you're very clever and your mother is very proud of you.  You <em>can</em> achieve much the same effect with servo tabs on well-balanced control surfaces, but that introduces other trade-offs which are not preferred for aerobatic aircraft.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would also add that they are actually in a very small minority in aerobatics these days as well mostly just Pitts Special remains. Stunt monoplanes from Extra (like in Red Bull Air Racing), and Slick are far more common. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To expand on this: a biplane lets you have the same wing area with a shorter wing span.</p>
<p>Shorter wing span means that the moment-of-inertia about the roll Axis is shorter.  It also means less leverage at the wingtips for air-resistance when rolling.  These combined mean that you can get much higher roll rates for the same or lower control forces required.</p>
<p>The trade-off is that short wings have more drag than long wings for the same wing area or lift generated, so a biplane with the same lift as a monoplane has significantly greater drag.  For airshows this is fine, because drag availed with the square of speed, and you need to fly slow in an airshow to wow the audience.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In some ways due to the original reason they were used: They are more stable at low speeds due to their increased lift. Slower speeds allows the pilot more time to engage in maneuvers which look pleasing.</p>
<p>Also the novelty factor: You are more likely to remember that biplane due to how uncommon it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's one of the few niche roles I mentioned in which biplanes are still useful. Stunt planes often perform at very low speeds where monoplanes would be unable to produce enough lift or maneuverability. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don’t know why everyone gets so hung up on the low speed of biplanes. A monoplane can have the same stall speed as a biplane. It’s just a function of wing area and lift coefficient. And there is no reason why a monoplane couldn’t have the same wing area as a biplane nowadays. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact, a biplane with the same wing area has a higher stall speed. The two wings interfere with eachother, resulting in a reduced amount of lift. So, for the same wing area, a biplane has to fly faster for the same amount of lift.</p>
<p>The reason why stunt planes sometimes use biplanes is because of their lower moment of inertia and because it has a higher structural stiffness.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don’t biplanes have significantly better low-speed maneuverability than monoplanes? I mean, the infamous fokker triplane had excellent maneuverability at low speeds compared to some contemporary biplanes. Plus, with a biplane, you have shorter takeoffs. I don’t think any monoplane could take off from those WWI-era “carriers.”</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That was true back in the day, but with modern materials and designs the drawbacks such as extra drag and weight are not made up for by the small amount of extra lift. </p>
<p>These days there are bush planes that can take off and land in way less than 100 feet, completely unassisted. Modern aerobatic planes can also take off in incredibly short spaces, because the power to weight ratio is so much higher than it was in earlier plane designs.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You can achieve this with a monoplane as well. Check out the Feisler Storch from WW2. It was a monoplane with excellent short take off and landing performance. It was designed to be a liason aircraft for soldiers in the field. You could fly people in and out of the front lines on poorly prepared or non existent runways. It was a monoplane because you needed good visibility to land in fields where ruts abs debris was common. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Short takeoff or landings are more a result of the shape of the airfoil, and available power for takeoff.  A fatter airfoil will generally create more lift, but the downside is that it produces more drag as a result, and so for the same power, its maximum airspeed will be lower than a wing with a thinner, less lift-aggressive airfoil.</p></div>		</li>
