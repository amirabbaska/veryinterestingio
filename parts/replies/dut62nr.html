			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard that cold hands and feet are because of poor circulation, but I've never had &quot;poor circulation&quot; satisfactorily explained to me. I've assumed it meant either that you have less blood than normal (but that seems problematic) or that your heart doesn't pump blood as effectively (seems even more problematic).</p>
<p>In other words, I too would like this answered. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean “always” as in always when touget stressed, or always as in always? If it’s always always, you probably have some degree of poor circulation. Do you drink enough water?</p></div>		</li>
