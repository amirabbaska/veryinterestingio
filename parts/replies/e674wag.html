			<div class="markdown"><p>you might be able to make it boil more quietly if you agitate the water while it boils so the heating is more even.</p>
<p>...If you're going to try this i would recommend stirring with a wooden spoon rather than waving the kettle around by the handle.</p>
<p>I don't think you could make the kettle silent, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't it still have to go through the same step in the process? </p>
<p>Maybe if you heated the water REALLY quickly, somehow?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I never thought about it like that, but I believe you can. The smaller bubbles form at the heat source when the heat source is above the boiling temperature. If the heat source is slightly below the boiling point bubbles won't form. If you heat water at the lower temperature slowly, then raise the temperature of the heat source you could form bubbles that can make it to the surface before they cool enough to collapse. It would be a cool experiment to try. </p>
<p>The smaller bubbles form because we typically want to boil water as fast as possible so our heat source is much higher than the boiling point of water causing the water to boil at the bottom and collapse as it rises through the cooler water. They also promote promote convection and mixing which also speeds up the boiling process.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also something related, it is possible to superheat water so that the temperature is above the boiling point but it isn't bubbling. This has something to do with the molecules still being stable and there not being any nucleation sites to promote bubble formation. In this state, a small disturbance can cause the water to start boiling spontaneously. </p></div>		</li>
