			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm sorry but I believe you have been misled. I work in a psych hospital (am actually at work now), and signing a release IN NO WAY guarantees release in 24-48 hours. Once you have been admitted there is a mandatory 72 hour hold to make sure you are not a danger to yourself and others. </p>
<p>What we do have are requests for releases. They typically have a five day period (excluding weekends and holidays), and at that point if the psychiatrist deems you unfit for discharge you go to court. </p>
<p>I would not recommend allowing it to go that far, however. If the psychiatrist decides that they will not discharge, rescind the request for release immediately. Almost never does the patient win over the psychiatrist in court, and the courts have sentenced people up to three months that I've seen.</p>
<p>Good luck and let me know if you have any more questions! </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't see where the answer in question suggests that release is guaranteed. Still, I think I need the doctor's approval more than she does at this point. I'm far too partial (and psychologically illiterate for that matter) to think that my and our friends' support will be enough right now, the risk is just too great. She really wants to leave as soon as possible, has participated in I think every group but one since she was admitted, and is honestly looking and sounding alot better than she was. She's still very weepy and sad, but the &quot;husk&quot; vibe she was giving off Saturday is gone. Assuming things stay positive, do you think that she's on track to get home ASAP? They've started her on a new medication as well, I assume that a negative reaction could prolong the stay.   </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Things like this are why I'm terrified to seek psychiatric treatment. I can be having a bad night and think I need help but I can't risk being locked up and unable to leave and lose my job or risk being confined for what seems like a punitive reason. There's definitely been times I needed to go somewhere and get away and I ended up harming myself or someone else because I couldn't safely seek treatment and know I'd be released in a timely manner or when the incident passed and I felt betterâ€”usually by doing hardcore drugs.
It's the thought that I'd rather risk killing myself than be confined against my will </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to underscore his/her point about how <strong><em>nobody EVER wins at court</em></strong>. And when she loses, they'll probably put her away for six months. At least that's how it is in Massachusetts. </p></div>		</li>

<p>If she went to the ER and said she has thoughts of hurting herself or others but DID NOT act on them but was still admitted to the psych unit she has to request a form of release. This takes 24-48 hrs from when it is submitted, signed by the patient and a Nurse Practitioner or Doctor. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, no. You don't have to ACT on them. The thoughts alone get you your 72 hour stay. </p></div>		</li>
