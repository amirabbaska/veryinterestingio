<p>As a sex addict, do you derive any actual satisfaction from the physical act, or is it more about the psychological fulfillment of the healthy relationship?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is different, but for me I used it as crutch to distract myself from my life. I have schizophrenia so anytime I was really struggling I'd try to escape reality by watching porn. It would get my mind off of it a little bit. In reality it made everything worse and made my anxiety skyrocket. Now that I'm getting better I feel much better and more &quot;sane&quot; (also I'm on meds but they only help so much)</p></div>		</li>

<p>I think this is a big part of it. </p>
<p>Sex is an integral part of romantic relationships. That's just how we are as a species. It's very difficult to have a sexless relationship that is still satisfying and fulfilling for both partners. Not impossible, but very difficult, since reproduction is essentially the &quot;Prime Directive&quot; of our entire race lol. Going against such a fundamental and base instinct is not healthy.</p>
<p>Conversely, cutting out social drinking really is not that big of a deal. You might have to find some new friends if your friend group comprises exclusively of people you have nothing in common with except the desire to get fucked up, but your ability to have a meaningful and fulfilling life will not be impacted in the slightest by cutting alcohol out of your life. The same cannot be said about cutting sex out of your life.</p></div>		</li>

<p>For me, I derive satisfaction from both, though it is much more fulfilling to have both at the same time, i.e. in the context of a healthy relationship. But that hasn't always been easy in the past, since differences in sex drives/sexual interests have been difficult. </p>
<p>Part of the &quot;satisfaction&quot; (or rather compulsion) surrounding my sexual behavior was also the thrill that came with pursuing other sexual partners. Even just via online contact that I new might not be returned (e.g. sending an email/message). Or even if that did manifest in physical contact, I would often feel bad afterwards and be disgusted with myself. But then I'd be quick to go right back to pursuing things again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a very simple and accurate way to describe sexual addiction, yes. If a person ceases to halt the underlying sexual behavior despite it impacting their life negatively, it's one sign of addiction. Some examples: watching porn/masturbating instead of going to class/work or being late because of it, partaking in sexual behavior at work or other risky situations. Cheating on your partner despite loving them. Consistently putting yourself in risky sexual situations (unsafe sex). Coping with depression or other hardships by seeking out sex. Pursuing someone you don't find very attractive just to get sexual release, feeling ashamed and disgusted by them after that release, but still pursuing sex with them again. Spending significant amounts of time pursuing sex (online sex sites or other online means can be a huge time sink). Being unable to view people in a non-sexual manner. Knowing that your sexual behavior is wrong and that it's hurting you and others in your life, wanting it to stop, but still feeling compelled to continue that behavior and helpless to stop it. Things like that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was just wondering about that. I know I'm hypersexual but that isn't the same thing as being a sexaddict (I think?). Is there a sexaddict version of r/stopdrinking?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Essentially it's an addiction that needs to be cured when it gets in the way of living your life to a degree that includes missing appointments, missing work, or pursuing the addition in favor of pursuing goals you consider more important. </p>
<p>If you're able to work and live, and just have a fair part of your life be the pursuit of sexual experience, that's probably a decision that's fine to make. Perhaps the difference is that one can make the decision to center parts of their life around sex, but if it's not a conscious decision it's more likely to be a harmful addiction.</p>
<p>(Note, that certain things are also more troublesome as addictions than others due to harmful effects they have on the body and mind. Alcohol destroys your liver and messes with mental function. Food addiction results in unhealthy weight game. For sex, potential unhealthy patterns are large amounts of unprotected sex with non-vetted people (High change of STDs) and thinking about sex to the point where it's impossible to have an interaction with someone without thinking about them in a sexual light (also a problem with porn addiction)).</p>
<p>Soooo TLDR: The line between an addiction and a passion is complicated, but lies mainly in how much harm something is causing you and the extent to which it is forfeiting your control over your life.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is actually yes. It's called /r/nofap. I haven't used it myself sso I am not sure if it's only for guys or whatever but I have a friend who found help there.
Being hypersexual is not the same as being addicted so no need to worry. Like many others have pointed out the addiction part shows it's face when you start to mess up your life because of your need to have sex or because you do insane things and can't stop dispite consequences.
However another part of it that many comments seems to leave out is that it is an addiction when you stop functioning without it. Obviously it's human nature to want sex, but if your constant thought is sexual and how you can seduce someone, if you tend to drown your feelings in sex or compulsive masturbation or if you cross lines and lurk at people, go to swinger clubs and prostitutes on a regular basis even if you are married etc etc then it's getting to the point where it's unhealthy and get's in the way of your life. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I will copy and paste what I wrote as an answer to someone asking the same question: When it becomes a way to survive. When you are in pain and sexual behaviour is the way you hang on to life and get by cause reality is just too painful so you need something to get you through the day. When it starts destroying your life ad nothing else seems to matter. Your partner don't matter, your friends and family don't matter cause you just need to get that fix. When it starts interfering with work or school but you just can't stop. That's when it qualifies as addiction. I knew because I was struggling with depression and anxiety for years and that is what kept me going but I didn't really acknowledge it until I realized that I had literally messed up my entire life and I hit rock bottom. Good thing is that after that there is only one way and that's up :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Watch the movie &quot;Thanks for sharing&quot;. It shows a relapse. Basically it's when you start getting your old behaviour back or if you start to have compulsive sexual behaviour, cheating, prostitution etc that messes up your life.
Most of the sex addicts I know have made a list of things that is considered their &quot;bottom line&quot; cause sex addicting is complex and different from person to person so it's very individual what is considered a relapse.</p></div>		</li>
