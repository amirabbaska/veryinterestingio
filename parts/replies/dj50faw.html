			<div class="markdown"><p>Neither this nor the other answers given really answer the question. You essentially said &quot;because when you work out the ventricle gets bigger and the heart works better&quot;. But the question was, howwww does it happen? What is it about stressing your heart that makes it more effective at pumping?</p>
<p>Other muscles tear down and rebuild bigger and stronger. But it seems to me you essentially answered the question in a similar way to someone asking &quot;why do your muscles get stronger when you lift&quot; and you saying &quot;well you lift and then your muscles get bigger and big muscles mean lifting more&quot;, but you leave out the fact that the tearing down and rebuilding stronger is what truly causes it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Followup question, is the hypertrophy of the left ventricle reversible? As in, will an athlete that stops exercising eventually return to a normal heart rate?</p></div>		</li>
