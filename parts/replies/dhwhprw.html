			<div class="markdown"><p>State Trooper. This doesn't work if you have a common name, or multiple last names, or were married, or misspelled your name on your license. And most people who don't have their license on them don't have it because they don't have one. Anytime someone says they don't have their license on them, I take their keys immediately.</p>
<p>Carry your license.</p></div>		</li>
