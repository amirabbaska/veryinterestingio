			<div class="markdown"><p>I've flown backwards in a sailplane before.</p>
<p>No landing attempt, stayed at around 3000ft, but the wind was faster than my airspeed, so when i looked down i could see that my groundspeed was negative</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This situation, while interesting, is totally separate. If you hold your hand out of the window of an airplane (as many of us do in the summer while we fly unpressurized single engines) you will always feel wind during normal flight. The relative wind must be present to generate lift. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is entirely true. </p>
<p>However, the OP asks about feeling breeze. And if the airplane is flying at 50 knots indicated airspeed, and the pilot sticks his hand out the window, he will feel a breeze of 50 knots, regardless of whether there is a headwind, tailwind, or crosswind, and regardless of the intensity of that wind. As you correctly concluded, only the groundspeed will be impacted by the wind.</p></div>		</li>

It's a weird experience when everything is just calm, no wind, very little sound and the earth is moving below. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed. I went to the Albuquerque balloon fest and rode a hot air balloon.  It was very cold that morning with a steady wind, so I dressed extra warm. We get airborne and there is no wind being felt. Definitely overdressed for the ride. Get back on the ground, boom, cold breeze again.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ok so the word in this poem is actually gyre not gybe but your comment reminded me of it and so here you go </p>
<p>`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
<p>&quot;Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!&quot;</p>
<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he sought --
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.</p>
<p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!</p>
<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
He went galumphing back.</p>
<p>&quot;And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?
Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
He chortled in his joy.</p></div>		</li>
