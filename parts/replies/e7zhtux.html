			<div class="markdown"><p>Would this still happen if other senses were being stimulated regularly? A good thing to think of to understand what I mean is, since blind people can't see, some senses get ramped up, like hearing. So if we were in a pitch black room, or a place where no light could reach our eyes, would our brains still strain for visual input, or would it focus on other senses, like a song playing in the room.</p></div>		</li>
