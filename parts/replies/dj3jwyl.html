			<div class="markdown"><p>I would add that normally heat does not want to move from a cold place like an air-conditioned room to a hot place like the outside on a summer day.  The conveyor belt is special indeed, it uses some clever tricks with changing pressures and by boiling a special gas and then turning it back to liquid.  These tricks let it move the heat against the way it wants to go, like rolling a ball uphill.  This is why it takes more electricity to run an A/C than a fan, it has to push that heat &quot;uphill&quot; to the hotter place.  </p>
<p>For the tricks to work the special gas has to be the right kind to become liquid or gas at the right times, and there has to be enough of it to make the right pressures.  The special gas doesn't get used up but sometimes it can leak out or get dirty.  </p>
<p>If there is not enough special gas because a little leaked out, then the pressures will be wrong and your A/C will become a block of ice instead of just a little cold.  You'd think ice would make it even colder inside but the air can't go through it so the A/C stops working and it gets hot in the room until the ice melts.  It will work again after it thaws but it will also freeze again unless you put more special gas inside.</p></div>		</li>
