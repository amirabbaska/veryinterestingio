			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they &quot;hit it&quot; every year, but it's the value of the bonus that changes. As /u/bulksalty showed, a CEO might get a bonus every year, but it can easily be $20mil one year and $10mil next year, that's effectively a 50% pay cut for that year due to poor performance. Also important to note that for many of them, a considerable portion of it is company stock and options, something that will do very well if the CEO does very well, and can become worthless if the CEO does poorly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For every public company the bonus plans are publicly available for the top employees. Look up a company's 'definitive proxy filing' and you can see how all the bonuses are calculated <em>ahead</em> of when they actually earn it. The math isn't a mystery and it's not a huge scam - you can do the numbers yourself. </p></div>		</li>
