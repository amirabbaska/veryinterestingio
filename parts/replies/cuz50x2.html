			<div class="markdown"><p>Not really. Undertones (f/2, f/3, f/4, etc) can all occur in the resonance cavity that is your inner ear. Though they are 30+ dB below the input, a 140 dB signal at 40 kHz will be audible as a 10 kHz resonance at about, oh, 80 dB if I had to guess.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question. I don't think trauma isn't solely via the frequency-tuned hair cells. Otherwise, we would see more cases where a loud noise only destroyed hearing in a certain frequency range but left other ranges perfectly fine. Excitotoxicity plays a role in damaging hair cells, but so does the physical force of the sound itself.  </p>
<p>It looks like some experiment compared a guinea pig with excitotoxicity-preventing medication against a control. The experimental guinea pig suffered half of the hearing loss.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>with this type of sound exposure, 50% of immediate hearing loss must be caused by synaptic damage (excitotoxicity).   </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other half would be due to physical force.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Metabolic stress, induced by high levels of acoustic activation, is the leading hypothesis for the cause of hearing loss. Loud noise does indeed damage only the frequency ranges it activates. </p>
<p>Hearing loss, in general, is predominant in the higher frequency ranges. The leading hypothesis on this specificity is the metabolic load on the cochlear - higher frequency hair cells are the most metabolically active in the cochlea. Their high metabolic needs mean that with aging, they die off first. However, this appears to be also significantly related to the load they receive. In a weird twist, the acoustic exposure in your early years seems to lead to hearing loss at later ages. </p>
<p>For those really interested, go dig into Liberman's work from the Mass Eye and Ear. He is a leading authority on this stuff<br />

<p>After all that, to get back to the op's question - to a first approximation, NO. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I found <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2923251/" target="_blank">this review</a> that discusses infrasound, so not exactly what you're asking, but still interesting. Their main conclusions are (I'm quoting here):</p>
<ol>
<li>Hearing perception, mediated by the inner hair cells of the cochlea, is remarkably insensitive to infrasound.</li>
<li>Other sensory cells or structures in the inner ear, such as the outer hair cells, are more sensitive to infrasound than the inner hair cells and can be stimulated by low frequency sounds at levels below those that are heard. The concept that an infrasonic sound that cannot be heard can have no influence on inner ear physiology is incorrect.</li>
<li>Under some clinical conditions, such as Meniereâ€™s disease, superior canal dehiscence, or even asymptomatic cases of endolymphatic hydrops, individuals may be hypersensitive to infrasound.</li>
<li>A-weighting wind turbine sounds underestimates the likely influence of the sound on the ear. A greater effort should be made to document the infrasound component of wind turbine
sounds under different conditions. </li>
<li>Based on our understanding of how low frequency sound is processed in the ear, and on reports indicating that wind turbine noise causes greater annoyance than other sounds of similar level and affects the quality of life in sensitive individuals, there is an urgent need for more research directly
addressing the physiologic consequences of long-term, low level infrasound exposures on humans.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the hair cells they discuss are the transducers you mentioned. Also, the hypersensitivity they mention in #3 is thought to be a result of fluid buildup in the cochlea, which occludes a hole in the apex of the cochlea called the helicotrema. This hole couples together two of the chambers in the cochlea, so by occluding it, the authors speculate that is causes larger pressure gradients that can stimulate hair cells.</p></div>		</li>
