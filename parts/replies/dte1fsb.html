			<div class="markdown"><p>As an interesting side fact: professional golfers always assume that whatever speed the wind is traveling by them will be accelerated the higher their ball travels, and adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>So if they feel there's a somewhat consistent light wind heading Southeast, they'll aim accordingly to the ball being blown a bit more to the Southeast if they're counting on making a lofty shot.</p>
<p>Since wind is invisible, not doing so is understandably a rookie mistake.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This may be referring to the boundary layer condition where the moving fluid (the wind in this case) is in contact with a surface (the ground). It's essentially saying that the thin layer of fluid in contact with the surface is going to be moving at the same velocity of that surface. In the case of the relatively non-moving ground, this velocity is zero and the fluid speed increases in a gradient as you move away from the surface.</p></div>		</li>

<p>In practice, this just means that the wind is much slower 1ft from the ground than it is 10ft from the ground. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_wind_profile" target="_blank">This gradient continues upward for at least the lower atmosphere.</a></p></div>		</li>

<p>Isn't it still true in practice? That's why fan blades get dusty even if they're always moving or something.</p></div>		</li>
