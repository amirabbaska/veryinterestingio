			<div class="markdown"><p>Not the guy you're asking but I have a thyroid issue, don't get enough sun, wake up a lot in the middle of the night (pain from clenching my teeth and other symptoms of TMJ), <em>and</em> I have depression. Very hard mornings for me. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, dude I'm with you on the TMJ. I went to a massage therapist who gave me really simple stretches to do before bed and it helps so much. I wish I had a window in my office for more daylight. I didn't think of that until just now that maybe that's an issue for me. Sounds like a lot is working against you. My boyfriend pops out of bed and willingly gets up at 5:30 on weekends. I don't know how he does it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Start taking vitamin d for sunlight and ask a dentist for a mouth guard. Clenching will wear down your teeth and give you problems. The guards can be pretty comfortable. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Probably nothing unusual. Thanks for the reply though! :)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've been in the same boat for a while, and it fucked with my sleep schedule a lot. Stress is one of those things that can produce so many unannounced physical ailments. When I was a debt collector, I had what looked like a veiny blister on my face under my eye. After I quit that job, it went away. Super weird. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's paradoxical, but going to work actually helps me a bit. Not that I am not tired, but I have a higher chance of achieving some sort of functionality, because I am forced into it. The weekends are the worst.</p></div>		</li>
