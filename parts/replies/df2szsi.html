			<div class="markdown"><p>Electrons inside the atoms have set orbits they can exist in at certain distances from the nucleus. They like to sit comfortably at the lowest orbit but if they gain the right amount of energy (from the heat from the oxidation of the wood) they have to jump up to one of the higher orbits. Eventually they will fall back to the lower orbit. When this happens they release the extra energy as a photon of light. The hotter the fire, the higher the orbit the electron climbs to, the further the eventual fall, the higher energy photon released, the higher frequency light. That's (part of the reason) why fire is different colors. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When someone mentions an excited electron what they are talking about can be interpreted as the distance the electron is from the nuecleus of an atom. Say there are three concentric circles about the nucleus an electron can travel. When the electron is in an &quot;excited&quot; state it will move to the next outter concentric ring. Electron are like teenagers, they don't like to have energy, they want to be lazy. So they want to go to the rested state but to do this, they need to get rid of that energy. Electrons do so in the form of photons. So as the electron &quot;falls&quot; back to it original ring or ground state! Different materials and atoms make different colors and is a good way to determine the composition of a material. What give a flame its upward shape as it does this is is heat carrying the atoms physically upwards as the electron resort to their ground state atomically.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, fall down doesn't literally mean going downwards. It means that in each atom the electrons are going from higher energy orbitals to lower energy orbitals. The energy difference is released in the form of light, also called photons. These go everywhere, as light usually does. The thing that rises is just the hot gas that glows because of the process I just described.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think excited electrons explanation doesn't apply to incandescent(light from heat) light sources. Incandescent light sources produce a continous spectrum according to the blackbody curve. If it was caused by electrons dropping orbitals then it would come in discrete spectrums, but it is continuous.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Incandescents in scientific terms are any light sources that are produced from heat. In incandescent lights electricity heats a tungsten filament and the filament glows from the heat. In a fire the reaction between fuel and oxygen causes gasses to produce light from their heat. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 attempt: In this discussion, there are two kinds of light. Let's call them &quot;incandescent&quot; and &quot;single-wavelength&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Single-wavelength&quot; light is emitted by individual atoms/molecules when one of their electrons becomes 'excited'. That is, it gets a burst of energy, causing it to move &quot;further away&quot; from the atom/molecule center. This happens, for instance, when the atom/molecule participates in a chemical reaction. An excited electron is in an unstable state and will always &quot;fall back down&quot; after a while, emitting light in the process.
Now, because of quantum mechanics, electrons can only exist at fixed &quot;distances&quot; (energy levels) from the center. So &quot;single-wavelength&quot; light emitted by an atom/molecule can only have fixed values. The exact values depend on the exact atom/molecule, which all have unique &quot;wavelength signatures&quot;.</p>
<p>On the other hand, &quot;incandescent&quot; light is emitted by solid bodies (that is, a large number of atoms/molecules arranged in a periodic structure). In solid bodies, electrons also have energy levels, but they don't just depend on the atom type: they also depend on how the atoms are arranged. When you heat up a solid body, the atoms begin vibrating, which means that the energy levels are fluctuating a lot. So, excited electrons will not always &quot;fall down&quot; the exact amount every time, and the light they emit can have <em>any</em> wavelength. (Not all wavelengths are equally likely. There is a 'peak' wavelength region for light emitted by an incandescent body, and it only depends on the temperature, not the body's material. This is what is referred to as the &quot;black-body curve&quot;.)</p>
<p>So what kind of light is firelight? Well, it's a bit of both...
The blue firelight you see when burning methane gas from a stove is mostly single-wavelength because the gas is made of individual atoms which oxidize more or less completely when ignited, producing little or no soot.
On the other hand, wood fires produce large amounts of soot, which is a solid body and emits incandescent light when it heats up. At those temperatures, this light has its 'peak' wavelength in the orange part of the spectrum, which is why wood fires appear orange.</p></div>		</li>
