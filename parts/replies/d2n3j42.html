			<div class="markdown"><p>I can personally attest to this happening.  I IVed drugs for years (clean now for years) and I, as well as other users I've talked to, have said this.  It seemed to get stronger the higher or lower the pH. Good heroin, most of the time leaning stronger alkaline you could taste, and if you broke down crack with an acid such as vinegar, you could absolutely taste the vinegar.  But it wasn't the exact taste. The best way I'd describe it is a ghost of the taste. Like 5% of the strength of if you tasted the water you were injecting. Not always pH related though. If you inject suboxone, which is flavored with a gross fake orange flavor, you get a slight orange taste in the back of your mouth the first few times you inject it.</p>
<p>I'd be happy to answer any questions on this ridiculous thing I've just admitted to.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a student of pharmacy I would be able to confirm your theory.  As the poster said above if you IV inject it would circulate to your bloodstream and then to your lips and and lungs where you would exhale and taste it.  Also your body's pH at the time also affects drugs, depending on the drug the lower or higher pH would increase certain drugs affect which is why when you inject it at a certain pH you would be able to taste it.</p>
<p>Also seeing your comment below it.  When you sublingual a drug the reason why it is stronger is because you skip 1st pass metabolism which is essentially your stomach breaking down the drug.  If you are interested in a talk about drugs please PM me I am very intrigued in your experiences.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've IV'd plenty of drugs, and have a hard time I would be exhaling something like amphetamine or cathinones for no more than two seconds tops.  The tastes of methylone is god fucking awful, and pushing down the plunger about 4 seconds later I'd get this taste in my mouth so strong that I would frequently gag or nearly vomit - sometimes actually vomiting, but then the tastes is gone and I'm high as fuck.  </p>
<p>And considering I taste it not on my tongue, or my throat, but it feels like it's <em>inside</em> my tongue I just have trouble subscribing to that idea.  It would seem more likely, in my mind, that the blood actively traveling to your head is so great in concentration of the drug in question that when it perfuses some of the tissues the rapid change is capable of being tasted.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>First pass metabolism comes from the liver, not the stomach. The sublingual circulation doesn't go to the portal vein first, unlike oral medications so it skips getting metabolized by the liver the first time around your circulation. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again, this is wrong. It doesn't explain why some people -- who can taste salt in their mouth -- cannot taste the saline injection, while others can.</p>
<p>Please people. Jesus. Student of whatever doesn't mean shit when you're not even taking the most basic data about the phenomenon you are meant to explain into account.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't get high. If you're addicted to heroin (or any other opiate) you won't get high from IVing suboxone. It just takes away the withdrawal sickness. Until you get addicted to the suboxone. That's another can of worms. </p>
<p>But the main reason is you can use less of it. If you got it on the street and didn't know when you could get it next or didn't have a lot of money, you save it. IV is (theoretically) 100% absorption of the drug. Sublingual's (how you're supposed to take it) bioavailability is only 30%. So you're saving literally 3 times as much.</p>
<p>If it would take me 3mg to feel better, I could IV 1 with the same results. Rate of absorption for buprenophine is, as far as I know, the same if you IV or put it under your tongue because of the time it takes to cross the blood brain barrier (I'm probably wrong about that, but I can't remember right now). So the only benefit is financial/saving the drug.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons, here's one: for some people, that becomes their preferred method of intake. At that point, you're generally more addicted to the action than the drug, though. Same thing can happen with smokers. Habituation is a crazy thing.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>IV drug use <em>does</em> seem to be the most common occurrence of this. But yeah, you're injecting harsh drugs directly into your blood stream. That gets to your mouth pretty fast and affects your taste buds. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Before a PET scan, during the contrast injection, the nurse warns that it will make your groin and sphincter feel like it became very warm and wet.  Your theory coupled with my observations makes sense.  I once tried some .357 Magnum hot sauce, and afterwards my butthole experienced the same spicy sensation.  That day I learned hitchhiker can taste.</p>
