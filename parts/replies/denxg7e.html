			<div class="markdown"><p>It is a great question and I love the add on. I'm a mountain and Arctic scientist. I live in the mountains of Colorado at almost 7,000 feet elevation. Canadians have some of the best stories to tell about the cold. I've never been in a place that compares, mostly because I'm in the Arctic, on the tops of mountains and for Homeward Bound in Antarctica during summer. As we crossed the Drake Passage by ship, we heard an announcement from our expedition leader, Greg Mortimer, that we should take a look outside. We were in the convergence zone, fog surrounded us as warm air meets cold air and cold ocean. On the other side of this zone, the air was cooler, noticeably. Not uncomfortably cold though as most days while we were there the temperatures were around freezing. Cold enough to snow and sleet some days. Cold enough that after 3 hours on shore, a cup of hot tea was essential. But sunny and warm enough other days to be in a tank top on the ship's deck. Coldest I got was the day Anne talked me into a polar plunge in an ice-filled sea. That was the moment I thought, maybe I now have a polar tale to tell that would match the amazing tales told by Canadians.</p></div>		</li>

I thought you guys were gonna say your eyelashes were frozen shut and you couldn't be outside for more than 25 minutes but your answer really enlighten me. Thanks for taking the time to answer and congrats on your voyage!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>She did say they went during the summer when I imagine it's cold but not <em>that</em> cold.  The picture I have in my head of Antarctica during the winter is something like Day After Tomorrow where going outside = death unless you're in a massive parka.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add on this.
It gets pretty cold where I live too (Canad'eh!). Is the &quot;dry vs humid&quot; cold weather a thing you can notice?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a Homeward Bounder coming from MN, I was more then prepared, it was actually warmer in Antarctica when we were there than it was in Minneapolis! The high temperature hovered around freezing every day. But, we were there in the Antarctic summer, and on the peninsula were we were often sheltered. Further south and the interior get much colder,  and the winters see very extreme temperatures. To answer the dry v humid question, it was definitely dry! Antarctica is technically one of the driest places on earth, and classified as a desert.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Indeed... it can get up to almost +20°C (67.6°F) in the Antarctic region during summer! <a href="https://eos.org/features/evaluating-highest-temperature-extremes-in-the-antarctic" target="_blank">https://eos.org/features/evaluating-highest-temperature-extremes-in-the-antarctic</a></p></div>		</li>
