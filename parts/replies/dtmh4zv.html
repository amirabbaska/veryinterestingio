			<div class="markdown"><p>There is almost always a compromise.  It's pretty tough to have great science fiction with perfectly legitimate science (although it can be done).  My philosophy is that the story should come first - but if you can get the science right then that's better.</p>
<p>Of course there are plenty of examples where there is crazy wrong science that doesn't influence the plot.  My favorite bad example is the electric-magnetic explanation at the end of Amazing Spider-Man 2 - <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/10/bad-physics-amazing-spider-man-2/" target="_blank">here is my blog post on that</a></p>
