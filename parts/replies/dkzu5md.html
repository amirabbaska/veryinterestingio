			<div class="markdown"><p>From I personnel experience  (this is purely anecdotal of course) I'd say yes. I'm never hung-over when drinking in the evening and going to bed afterwards. I do get a hangover though when drinking early in the morning and staying awake while sobering up. It's seems I normally sleep through my headaches and all that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Two things-- I've gotten seizures since puberty. Never the day after a bender. I do stay hydrated more than most so perhaps that helps. Second, who is this wondered you're explaining this to, apology or not? There are adults on Reddit who can't say or spell homeostasis, much less process the concept. Less Dr. Strangelove, more Dr. Bunson Honeydew next time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because they didn't drink enough to reach their hangover threshold.  </p>
<p>Everyone has one <em>somewhere</em> on the spectrum and where it lies is determined by how much you consume, what your level of tolerance is, and the myriad other biological factors including weight, diet, genetics, pain threshold, stress levels, mental health, etc...</p></div>		</li>
