			<div class="markdown"><p>About chernobyl; That was an old and bad design of soviet and the explosion happened inside the core. The amount of concrete you need to get through before you are anywere near the core wouldn't certainly happen in one airstrike, not with one missile atleast. But if you pounded it with enough bombs fast enough, then yeah, chernobyl is an accurate end product of such thing happening.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Chernobyl was an explosion in the reactor due to the incompetence of the engineers controlling it.  I think people should know that.</p></div>		</li>
