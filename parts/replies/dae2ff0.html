			<div class="markdown"><p>So there are alloys and ceramics with higher melting points than tungsten? Which has the absolute higher melting point? I thought it was carbon with tungsten second.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tungsten has the highest melting point of any metal. Ceramics generally have very high melting temperatures that very greatly depending on the chemical composition of the ceramic compound.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Among pure elementals you're correct.</p>
<p>But among compounds (multiple elements bonded) there are a number of substances with a higher melting point.</p>
<p>Compounds do not nessecary have the same physical or chemical properties as their individual constituate elements.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Carbon's melting point is 3550 C, tungsten's is 3422 C. An alloy with a higher melting point off the top of my head is hafnium carbide which melts at 3900 C, though I'm sure there's others with higher.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Whoops. Accidentally making tungsten carbide would be a Bob Ross happy little accident. At least it's a useful material. </p></div>		</li>
