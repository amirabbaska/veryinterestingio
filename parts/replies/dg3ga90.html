The small black circle at the top is the laser, which is just used to point the device in the right direction. The big black circle below that covers the infra-red sensor, which measures the temperature. You can test this by taping over the laser - it will still work.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The laser on these small Infrared guns is misleading to novice consumers. People think it will measure the temp of that tiny dot 30 to 50 feet away. Really the Infrared &quot;field of Vision&quot; (FOV) spreads out like a cone from the IR sensor. At 10 feet the FOV is approximately 6 feet in diameter. The better the gun, the smaller the FOV is. </p>
<p>One problem with not understanding FOV is there may indeed be a very hot single point you are trying to measure 30 feet away but it's heat is averaged by the rest of the area being measured.  The one very small hot spot will not (can not) be read accurately. </p>
<p>There are a handful of other considerations in accurately measuring temperatures. Most importantly is emisivity followed closely by reflectivity.  As a good rule of thumb is, if bright light like a laser can reflect off of whatever surface you are looking at then so can the very heat from yourself or other hot things around you also reflect off of that surface. Along with heat, colder temperatures can reflect as well. So if you shoot at tin foil inside an oven you are very likely to get a reading of 120 degrees F which is the heat of the oven reflecting off of you as you look with your gun into the oven. It gets tricky. </p>
<p>We have a good model at my work where instead of a laser dot it shoots a ring of dots so you can visibly see the FOV.  For the cheap Infrared temp guns that are showing up in hardware stores they should just have an LED flashlight instead. It would be just as accurate and more helpful. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The laser is a pointing device, if you turned it off it would still be able to measure temperature.</p>
<p>The actual temperature measurement is something like a camera. Have you ever seen an infrared or &quot;FLIR&quot; video that shows the temperature of objects? An IR thermometer works similarly, except it only has one pixel and it provides the output in degrees instead of graphically as a color or intensity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It works really well and I'm glad I bought it. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they are one of those tools which is more useful than you would think. For instance I use mine on the exhaust header pipes of engines to see if one of the cylinders is running cool, indicating a problem.</p></div>		</li>
