			<div class="markdown"><p>I'll start off by conceding that this analogy may be accurate in a way that I'm not seeing. But doesn't salt dissociate into Na+ and Cl-? On a certain level I accept that this is &quot;still salt&quot; as in your analogy, but I don't have the chemistry knowledge to understand <em>why</em>.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>NaCl is an ionic compound. When the Na+ and Cl- ions are pretty far apart then they lose crystalline structure, which is what water does, keep the ions further apart. So with m&amp;ms and skittles, your m&amp;ms (if they represent salt) are just split in half. So you still have skittles and m&amp;ms (broken though). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>^(same thing really. if you want to be more picky about that analogy, maybe say a bag of peanuts in a bowl of m&amp;ms. stir it a bit and the peanuts break into two halves. but honestly analogies aren't perfect.)</p></div>		</li>
