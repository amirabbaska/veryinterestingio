			<div class="markdown"><p>I had to scroll down way too far to find this answer, but it's the right one. Universal motors have high torque, high speed and small size... at the cost of noise. Induction motors are quiet, but lower speed and bigger size. Refrigerators and ceiling fans use induction motors because they need to be quiet and don't need much power. Blenders use universal because they need speed and torque and you can deal with the noise. </p>
<p>Table saw vs circular saw. Same blade, cutting the same size wood. Table saw is quiet because it can afford to house a 20lb induction motor and speed it up with a belt. Circular saw screams like a banshee because it needs a universal motor to pack the same speed and power into a handheld device.</p></div>		</li>
