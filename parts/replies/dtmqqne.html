I'm not sure what's public knowledge, but there are some pretty extreme measures being thrown out there for probes hoping to reach the underice oceans of Europa. Future missions to Mars that hope to probe ice reserves will also need more stringent treatments than what was used on Curiosity (or will likely be used on 2020). </p>
<p>As a note, microbe cleanliness isn't as big of a deal for earth orbiting missions. We already know there's bacteria here, so the bigger worry are contaminants like dust, skin oils, etc. For that reason, NASA's spacecraft assembly facilities are variable cleanliness, because it costs way more money to run a cleanroom for a Mars mission vs a telescope. </p></div>		</li>
