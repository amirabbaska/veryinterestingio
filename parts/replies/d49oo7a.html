			<div class="markdown"><p>Of course, further to this, most people would surprised how much mail doesn't go through the destination countries postal service. I work for a company here in the UK that offers DSA (Downstream Access) to businesses, and when we send mail abroad (clients include some leading charities and publication companies in the world) we very rarely use the destination's postal service. Mailing to Italy? That'll probably go with Austrian post. Going to India/China? Chances are it's going with Spring (PostNL). USA? Asendia (Swiss+French).</p>
<p>Because of the nature of Universal service obligations, national postal services often cannot compete with their foreign brothers, particularly with the spiders web that terminal dues and postal agreements form.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Just 'cos it's going to Country X, doesn't mean their postal service gets a look-in.</p>

<p>Registered as in &quot;signed for at the destination&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Ah, I'm surprised. I didn't know that our (Austrian) postal service does international delivery. In Italy I only spotted German (DHL) or US organizations (like a small DHL boat in Venice), but never Austrian &quot;Post.at&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of complicated, but Ã–sterreichische Post actually has FANTASTIC rates for most of southern Europe, but they are relatively new to the game (6-8 months, as I recall). But in reality it's not strictly the same Post.at you use, but rather a sub-division which often runs through a franchise. An example would be how La Poste and Swiss post have very rudimentary international services as I described them, but through another company they have formed Asendia which is essentially a separate company, but is also wholly owned by the two postal unions and operates through their infrastructure.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Banks would exchange checks with each other via a very similar system. They would just kind of generally accept each others checks, but keep track of the totals in and out, and if a bank was out of balance, they would ask for a remittance to make up the difference. That way every single check cashing didn't require an actual money transfer between the banks.</p></div>		</li>
