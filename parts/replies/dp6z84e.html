			<div class="markdown"><p>In Europe there are a few nation that have a sustainable fertility rate of ~2, they are France, Uk, Belgium, The Netherlands, and the Nordic Countriea. The rest of Europe has very low birthrates. Ironicaly the countries with the lowest birthrates have the least amount of immigration, so they will be overburdened by pensioncost just like Japan. </p>
<p>Only countries in Europe with a proportionate amount of immigration to counteract low birthrates are Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.</p></div>		</li>
