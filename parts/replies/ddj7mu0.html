<p>Wrong. The great depression started because Hoover wouldn't allow wages to fall in coordination with market demand. He demanded that businesses keep employing people at artificially high rates, which caused many of the biggest companies to get fucked. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, as a follow-up question. If the gov is the only entity able/willing to do this, shouldn't they have some say or oversight to prevent banks from getting into shady stuff like they did? Isn't that a matter of national security?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do. The problem is, a lot of people were benefiting from it, politicians and regular people alike, so nobody was exactly lining up to stop it.<br />
Others, while not benefiting directly, believe in deregulation to promote the free market. They didn't intend for something like this to happen, but their actions still contributed to it.</p>
<p>All of this is assuming we're talking about the Housing Bubble.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They should, and arguably they already do have control but they choose not to exercise it. This is the main premise behind the &quot;too big to fail&quot; argument you likely heard about and the talk of breaking up the big banks. </p>
<p>When you have a bank that has savings accounts and CDs and mortgages and car loans and it fails, then other banks will buy up the assets (loans) and the people with savings accounts will get their money back supplemented by the FDIC if needed. It's not a great situation, but it's not going to crash the economy. Now say you have a large financial institution. It has savings accounts and mortgages, but also investment products like bonds and securities, and even insurance policies (not just your car insurance, also financial insurance to allow large entities to manage their risk). Now imagine it's a major financial player all across the country and even internationally. What happens when they go bust?</p>
<p>The answer is the financial crisis. Everyone is owed money by this bank or owes it money (often both). They have a lot of assets (like securities) that used to be worth a lot but are not worthless. These assets likely have been sold to other people (pension funds, for example) and so their money is now gone. They may also have insurance policies that are supposed to pay out right when this bank is going under (so the people who bought them don't get paid). Suddenly everyone is scrambling to get their money out of this mess and pick up the pieces and so the cost of borrowing shoots through the roof (if other banks even have spare money to lend) which means that you can't get a loan as easily and your job can't get a loan as easily, which it may need to cover costs while profits go up and down. Now your company has to lay you off and your lack of income means that you can't buy stuff from other companies, making their bottom line worse and causing them to lay people off. Multiply that by thousands of companies and millions of people and you have the economy in 2009. </p>
<p>The argument is if you separate those banking functions and keep each bank from getting too big, then you'll only have the first scenario from time to time and not the second. But that's a lot more complicated than &quot;regulation is killing small businesses&quot; and &quot;free market is bae&quot; so it doesn't get the same groundswell of support.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They do have an enormous amount of say.  In the US, banks can only operate with the express permission of the government and there are several federal financial regulation agencies (whose entire purpose is overseeing financial firms) including the FDIC, Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Housing Finance Agency, Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Department of the Treasury (after the crisis the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau was created).  </p>
<p>The issue becomes, the financial regulation is exceedingly complex and the government has trouble competing with banks for talent so its the banks can usually stay a step ahead of the regulators because of the talent gap (a great example of this was AIG's Financial Products unit that wasn't in the US, but guaranteed almost all the risk of a decline in the housing market), regulatory capture (effective regulators can get more lucrative jobs with the banks and one of the only places to get talented, experienced employees is recruiting from banks), and government pushes to shift financial firms into more risky products in the guise of financial services for all.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Adding to that, I'd point out more specifically more modern examples of what happens with countries that didn't effectively recapitalize.  Deutsche Bank is basically a zombie in a country with anemic investment, Monte Paschi di Sienna is a threat to the stability of a government that can barely handle its own debt.  Recapitalization can help by making banks acknowledge and deal with nonperforming loans and investments.  And that's not even talking about decades of Japanese stagnation.</p>
