			<div class="markdown"><p>Because we don't know that much about DNA. We can use DNA from extinct animals and their related species as a reference but largely, the impacts of changing DNA is unknown, and mostly detrimental. To build an entirely new species from scratch is impossible with current knowledge.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although some genomes have been mapped, we currently don’t know the function of every element of the genome and how the patterns of cytosine, guanine, adenine, and thymine affects the end result.  Hopefully, in the future, we will possess a much better understanding of this concept, enabling us to create unique DNA sequences with less risk.</p></div>		</li>
