			<div class="markdown"><p>My little brother gleeked on me once, during a road trip, for entertainment value I suppose. I opened my mouth and did it right back... on accident. He looked astonished, and exclaimed, “You know how to gleek??” Confidently, I said, “Of course I do!” and that was the end of the First Gleek War. But be sure of one thing: from that moment, whenever I had a chance, I practiced and self taught the technique until I had perfect control over it. I’ll be damned if I was going to let on that it was an accident that first time. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good show ol' chap!  I had a similar experience, but it was an older kid a few grades ahead of me on the school bus.  Thankfully he didn't geeze on me or fists would have flown.  Probably his, and my face would have been all too accommodating.<br />
But from that point, I had to learn how to do it.  And so I tried, but it usually ended with some homework project getting wet after yawning.  That's probably how most kids discover their spidey talent.  &quot;You mean, I can potentially shoot saliva great distances from under my tongue?  Cool!&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>So, perhaps depending on your progression, you're having cravings?<br />
If they are strong enough they can produce a psychosomatic or autonomic response in that salivary glands<br />
start producing &quot;extra&quot; saliva.  Many people's mouths water at the thought of particularly appealing<br />
culinary delicacies.<br />
Don't fight it, embrace your new super power.<br />
I dub you squirtl.  Patron pokemon of the pickles and icecream cravings! </p>

<p>It stands for glandular leaking! G'leeking and it's a fun and gleeful activity, well, until you do it on someone and they hit you.</p></div>		</li>
