			<div class="markdown"><p>Daddy Long Legs are the dominant ones!? What!? Those things looks so measly and weak. Wolf spiders are fucking terrifying! I find this very hard to believe, but Iâ€™ll take your word on it.</p>
<p>Edit: after googling, are you referring to opiliones/huntsman Daddy Long Legs or pholcidae/cellar spider Daddy Long Legs? (I was not aware there were two creatures called Daddy Long Legs, and only one of them is actually a spider, until now.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Viruses look very weak and tiny and insignificant but they can kill you.  The daddy long leg has the highest and most potent poison in the spider kingdom.  So they say.  Although they can't bite humans they can bite other spiders.  This is what makes them dangerous to other larger spiders.  They are slim because they have an ability to sneak in and assassinate other spiders.</p></div>		</li>

<p><a href="http://www.thinkoholic.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/120820-025152.jpg" target="_blank">Harvestman &quot;spiders&quot;</a> are not true spiders and do not have venom glands <em>at all</em>. Obviously it's difficult to have &quot;the most potent venom in the spider kingdom&quot; when 1) they aren't spiders, and 2) <em>they don't have venom</em>. They are perfectly capable of biting humans. Harvestmen do not eat other spiders, they eat mostly decaying matter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pestworld.org/media/561843/cellar-spider-_c4e4272.jpg?preset=pestFeature360" target="_blank">Cellar spiders</a> are actually spiders. However, they are also perfectly capable of biting a human, although they almost never do. Their venom is not any more potent than any other average spider - which is to say, it isn't very potent, and certainly not dangerous to humans. Mythbusters tested this by having one of them stick their arm into a container full of them and getting bit (it stung a bit; nothing else happened) Many species are known to hunt and eat other spiders.</p></div>		</li>
