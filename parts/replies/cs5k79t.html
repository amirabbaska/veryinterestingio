			<p>&gt; because the functionality will be rolled into the built-in Music app<br><br>And that is unnecessary. You can't even run older versions of iTunes any longer. Apple is really trying to push their music platforms. With shitty software. At this rate, it won't be long before someone decides to split Apple in a computer and a service company, after which it will die a slow and painful death.</p>		</li>

			<p>Why would you want to run an old version of iTunes? Incidentally it's really not in Apple's interest to split - their success comes from the high levels of integration that they can achieve by controlling both the hardware and software aspects of their products. I wouldn't expect to see a HP-style split in the slightest.</p>		</li>

When Apple's stock prices go down, and it seems they must at one point, this is an easy target.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Just because it works? Why should I have to update a simple music player when I update the OS (a 320MB music player, BTW)?<br><br>Security updates, for one. I would expect that you would want to do the same for any application that speaks out to the Internet, given that it is your personal data that is at risk if you choose to willingly stay on a vulnerable version of any software.<br><br>Support from Apple if something doesn't work right, for another. Device compatibility with new iPhones/iPads and software compatibility with iOS goes without saying.</p>		</li>

			<p>Globally doesn't matter when it comes to monopoly suits though. You don't need a global monopoly to become a target of a monopoly suit in the US, just a monopoly in the US market.</p>		</li>
