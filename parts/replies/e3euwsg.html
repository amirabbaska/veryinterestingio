<p>If you look at the screws used in some public restrooms, you'll see a version of this as well. They'll usually be non-symmetrical screwheads that allow them to be screwed in with a regular flathead, but not screwed out. This is intended to reduce vandalism.</p>

<p>Either these or tamper proof Torx.  I've put together my fair share of toilet partitions.  Give me the tamper proof Torx over those damn tamper proof flatheads..</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Security  torx is the better method imo, a lot of these anti tamper screws really seem to just mean one way use with a flat head.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Now, the ovoid security screws were good because they looked circular, not like a screw driver would fit at all.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I install street lights, and some of the columns come with a security Allen (normal Allen with a pin sticking out the middle)
I have a key from the manufacturer so not a problem for me, however when someone else who doesn’t have a key and needs access to the column, you guessed it, they just use a flathead screwdriver to open it up! This method in turn bends the pin out of centre and then the manufacturers key don’t fit anymore. So when the next technician comes along, he either has to bend the pin back to the middle to use the key, or snap it off completely so he can use a door key. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those really don't serve the same purpose. Security torx just require a specialty bit which are easy to find. Tamper proof flatheads essentially can't be removed without cutting a new slot. </p>
<p>Both will cut down on &quot;incidental&quot; vandalism, but only one makes it far more difficult for someone who is determined. </p></div>		</li>

If you turn it clockwise to tighten, a flathead driver fits fine against the sharp edges, but if you turn the other way, the slopes push the screwdriver up so it slides off.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of the back of old Nintendo gaming cartridges. You would need some specialty triangle head screwdriver to open the cartridge. I imagine this helps prevent tampering with a finished product and prevents hacking and potentially ruining the game. Unfortunately now you have to get one in order to replace the on-board battery if you want to save your progress on an old copy of Pokemon.</p></div>		</li>
