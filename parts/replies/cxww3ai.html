			<div class="markdown"><p>South Park had an episode where Mickey Mouse was the corporate head of some Justin Bieber type boy singer (or, the boy himself, can't remember); making little girl's &quot;Gineys&quot; tingle, and saying quote, &quot;Because Christians are fucking retarded! haha&quot;.</p>
<p>I didn't hear anything about Disney Corp. retaliating.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Under the law, Disney would lose a case like that. In practice, they probably would have sued someone for making that cartoon anyway because it would be expensive for the cartoonist to defend themselves and they would most likely go bankrupt in the ordeal, despite Disney having a losing case.</p>
<p>The reason they didn't retaliate on SP is because CC has plenty of money to defend themselves and thus Disney would just be wasting money and not destroying the cartoonists.</p></div>		</li>
