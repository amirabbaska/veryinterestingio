<p>Just going to tag OP in this, so hopefully he can get more information. /u/ascatraz.</p>
<p>Are you sure about this? I've actually read the exact opposite. Over the course of the 12^th and 13^th centuries the European population exploded, perhaps reaching 65 million by the early 14^th century. The available arable land was all occupied, and as the population increased swamps were drained, forests felled, etc. However, this was unsustainable, and since technology hadn't increased yet (agricultural revolution was 400 years away), the only solution to this overpopulation was a reduction in population.</p>
<p>Famines became more common over the course of the 14^th century, and ultimately the Black Death struck in 1347, killing as much as 2/3 of Europeans in a few years. For the survivors, land was plentiful, and there were many labour shortages. This caused huge societal upheaval, and the European population did not recover until the 16^th century. While this slow recovery was partly due to war, famine, and disease, some historians also postulate it was because the Europeans changed how they reproduced, in order to prevent another catastrophe.  As George Huppert writes in <em>After the Black Death</em>, &quot;One cannot escape the suspicion that Europeans learned to live within the constraints imposed by inflexible harvests.&quot;</p>
<p>Marriage was delayed, and couples had fewer children. Once again, Huppert writes, &quot;Each generation's goal was to replace itself without adding to the number of mouths to feed. This goal was achieved by delaying marriage until there was room on the farm for a new couple and their eventual children. The death of a parent activated the son's or daughter's marriage.&quot; The result was that late medieval and early modern European peasant families represented modern nuclear families, with children getting married after their parents died, and having only 2-3 children. The concept of peasant families as 6-7 people crammed into a small cottage may be incorrect.</p>
<p>I'll let Huppert summarize the major change caused by the Black Death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Delayed marriage may have been the most important element within the social system created by European peasants after the fourteenth century... By delaying marriage, European peasants set a course that separated them from the rest of the world's inhabitants. As early as 1377, in a very large sample from England, the trend is visible. Of all the girls over the age of 14 - and therefore presumably capable of conceiving - only 67 percent were married and bearing children. That proportion would be down to 55 percent in the seventeenth century. Outside of Western Europe, so far as such calculations can be made, the proportion of nubile girls who actually married and conceived would be close to 90%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><del>While 67% of 14 year-old girls seems high</del>, keep in mind life expectancy was shorter (not 30 but still in the 50-60 range), and there were no readily available forms of contraception. Early modern and medieval societies were more sexually liberal than you might think. Nevertheless, by the 14^th century European peasants were getting married later than they had been before, and later than peasants outside Western Europe.</p>

<p>Your quote actually says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Of all the girls over the age of 14</strong> - and therefore presumably capable of conceiving - only 67 percent were married and bearing children.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote is talking about all women of childbearing age (which is generally defined as 15-45).  So it isn't saying 67% of 14 year olds were married, it is saying only 67% of women of childbearing age were married and bearing children.  </p>
<p>Right above that quote, the author explains that couples didn't have enough to support a family, they didn't marry and didn't have kids.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Very good points, I could be mistaken in the general upward/downward trends in regards to the results of the Black Death. Well sourced as well, better than I can do. I'm going off memory of my time in college and I don't have my texts handy(if at all, its been a while and I'm not sure if I even still have them).</p>
<p>I'd probably have to concede that particular point as I don't have the luxury of access to Journal databases anymore to provide proper counter sources and the books I usually keep are noticeably silent on love and marriage. Perhaps a personal failing. ;)</p>
<p>If anything I hope it piques the OPs interest beyond taking the word of people on the internet.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>He is wrong. Many people didn't marry AT ALL, EVER before the Black Death because they had no land to inherit--those who wanted to marry had to wait for some relative to conveniently die.  After the Black Death, peasants married younger because they could afford it. </p>
<p>It took from the low point in the 600 to 900s to the 1300s for the population to reach the pre Black Death level. It wasn't an explosion but a gradual increase. Also, in areas like Italy and Spain, the population in the 1300s was lower than during the Roman Empire. England reached a new peak population, along with France and Germany, but population was still down in many regions. </p>
<p>That writer appears to be making guesses off Malthusian theory rather than actual data. His comments are also flat out racial fantasies--seriously, he wants to claim that 90% of Asian and African women were breeders and this is why Western Europeans pulled ahead????  No. Just no.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A) Pretty bold talking down the sourced info with no sourcing.
B) I think the source supplied the &quot;90% of Asian and African women were married before 14&quot; and you supplied &quot;breeders&quot; and &quot;this is why western Europeans pulled ahead.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any sources for that? Again, if I'm wrong about something then please show me the source, I'll gladly change my opinion.</p>
<p>Also, I think you're making some leaps there by assuming the author is racist. He never said that peasants marrying later was &quot;the reason Europe pulled ahead.&quot; He simply stated that by the 14th century, European peasants were doing something <em>different</em> from other peasants around the world. Pointing out differences without making value judgements between Europeans and other peoples isn't racist. &quot;Breeders&quot; is another word you've inserted in there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Although anecdotal, from doing family history this is basically what I have seen. I guess I have only been able to trace a few lines back to 1400s, but mostly everyone was married, the first time, around 17. Which is younger than today, but not as young as I had thought. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Age of consent (as defined by Gratian around the 12th century) was 12 (girl) and 14 (boy). New Hampshire still use similar values but most places have upped it to 16.</p>
