<p>At least 10 people now understand the theory in detail, says Fesenko, and the IUT papers have almost passed peer review so should be officially published in a journal in the next year or so. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's impressive to me that it takes experts years to be able to understand this work well enough to peer review it. Cutting edge indeed.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The professor pretty much invented his own mathematics, and said people should  approach it as if they were students, relearning everything from scratch. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That isn't true, he's participated in several conferences and talks about the theory, and corresponded with other mathematicians about it.</p>
<p>However, he is definitely on the eccentric side and won't travel, so anyone who wants to meet with him must at least come to Japan, and probably to Kyoto where he lives.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a master's degree in mathematics and the papers on IUT are <em>impossible</em> for me to understand. Literally impossible. It's like a dog trying to understand vector calculus. Even if I devoted every day of my life to understanding it, I couldn't do it. All I can say is that the sentences are grammatically correct. Content-wise it might as well just be one of those fake math papers randomly generated by computer. Here's a sample sentence from the first &quot;introductory&quot; pages of the first paper:</p>
<p><em>Roughly speaking, a Frobenioid [typically denoted “F”] may be thought of as a category-theoretic abstraction of the notion of a category of line bundles or monoids of divisors over a base category [typically denoted “D”] of topological localizations [i.e., in the spirit of a “topos”] such as a Galois category.</em></p>
<p>Um, I recognize most of the words here but the way they are strung together is nearly meaningless to me. And this seems like one of the <em>simpler</em> looking statements in the articles. Perhaps with a few weeks I could learn enough to make sense of this statement but almost all the other sentences are as opaque or even more-so and would require similar effort..... and this goes on for the better part of 1000 pages!</p>
<p>The author (and the 10'ish people who claim to understand IUT) live in a different intellectual universe than I do and I am (humbly and factually stated) an extremely smart individual.</p>
<p>EDIT: I see people focusing on the particular sentence I mostly randomly picked in 5 seconds. If you haven't already, please glance at the <a href="http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/Inter-universal%20Teichmuller%20Theory%20I.pdf" target="_blank">actual first paper</a> to better understand my comment. If anybody gets like three pages into the introduction without thinking &quot;I have no idea what this is about&quot;, then you amaze me.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From a non-math person, that sounds fascinating. It's interesting that math, a field I generally view as pretty stagnant, can have such revolutionary &quot;discoveries/inventions&quot; like that. Are there any ideas on what impacts this could have outside of the field?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I went on a campus tour of Columbia University with my daughter a few years ago.  They had buildings named after John Jay, Horace Mann, Robert Kraft and various other alumni of note.  We then came to a corner of the campus where we saw Philosphy Hall and Mathematics Hall.  Our tour guide explained that none of the people who majored in either of those subjects ever made enough money to get a building named after them.</p></div>		</li>
