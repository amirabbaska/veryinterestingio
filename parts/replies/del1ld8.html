			<div class="markdown"><p>I like your response and the Edits even more. I know there are many that will not agree or will not accept or look into this especially the past. We need to make sure  people know this is not a stable government, they were a monarchy for over 300 years (older than the USA) then all of a sudden was overthrown by Lenin through his revolutionary mind- I am pretty sure he was a very special human even people in his time thought he was, some even saying he was like Jesus.
Then we have the fall of the soviet union, now we have Putin. This  is a powerful non-stable super power. Putin traded in his people for money, what makes people think he will treat the rest of the world better?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Bully puts in nicely to say the least. Additionally, these sanctions targeted Putin and other top Russian officials. Being friendly with Russia right now is indistinguishable from being friendly with Putin. To think Putin would be a real ally to us is naive at best. </p></div>		</li>
