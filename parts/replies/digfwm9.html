			<div class="markdown"><p>I can &quot;vibrate&quot; my eyes left and right super fast. My vision becomes blurry and others say it looks super weird. I tried to record it but the camera did not pick it up, so i guess its faster than the camera. I noticed i can use it to see fast moving things, like the rims of a moving car, instead of a blurry wheel i get multiple clear snapshots. </p></div>		</li>
