			<div class="markdown"><p>You can also feel jerk in your car by keeping constant pressure on the brake as you come to a stop versus easing up on the brake as you stop.</p>
<p>When you keep constant pressure on the brake your rate of deceleration abruptly goes to 0 once you reach a stop so there is a lot of jerk, where if you ease off the brake your rate of change will be a lot smaller once you stop so it will be more gentle. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A handful of times in my life I've managed to ease off in just the right way that there's actually no jerk. (Or, probably, that the jerk is below the threshold where I can notice it.) It's always been magical. But a little unsettling because the little jerk at the end is usually how I decided that I am fully stopped. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once fell on a passenger train because the driver was doing exactly what you said, making me think the train had already stopped, when really he was still travelling at a very small constant speed. Then he stopped suddenly. I think the driver was... <em>puts sunglasses on</em>... a real jerk. (yeeeeeaaaaaaah)</p></div>		</li>
