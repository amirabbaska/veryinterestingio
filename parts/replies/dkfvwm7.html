			<div class="markdown"><p>If you think of the lip as a curve (if you look closely enough it is), then pouring quickly can cause side of the lip that's towards the inside of the container to become wet without the outside becoming wet.</p>
<p>If you pour slower, then gravity will not be able to overcome the surface tension completely and you'll get water coating the whole curve. This will allow water to more easily follow the curve and once it's past the curve, the easiest way down is along the outside of the container you're in (assuming it's not touching anything else).</p></div>		</li>
