			<div class="markdown"><p>The emphasis that we as owners (and vets) can place on quality of life is precisely why it will be so informative to study aging in dogs.  Simply extending lifespan is not the goal of most human aging researchers, or for most people for themselves.  But extending the part of our available lifespans that are lived healthfully and well is a research target we can all share.
For daily life decisions about quality of life vs healthfulness, making decisions for our dogs can be similar to making them for ourselves - I may <em>want</em> another cookie, but I know that it is more healthful to eat them sparingly.  Similarly for dogs, there are few <em>all or none</em> answers to health questions.
A focus on quality of life in our research is an important goal of the Dog Aging Project.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I would say that there is definitely a way to give your dog treats in such a way as to not pose a significant health risk. A little bit every now and then should not be a problem; however, when it starts affecting the dog's caloric intake to the point of leading to weight problems and obesity, there is a problem. Being overweight has significant implications for a dog's well-being that are definitely not offset by feeding treats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We use rapamycin in a fairly low dose that we don't expect to cause significant side effects. Keep in mind that we want to use it on privately owned dogs that are considered family members by many of the participants in our study, which means that our tolerance for side effects is really low. During our 10-week pilot study, we did not see evidence of significant clinical side effects in the dogs who received rapamycin.</p>
<p>Giving higher doses like they use in human medicine is known to cause side effects, but those doses are much higher than what we will be using.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Is cheese bad for dogs? Myself, I'm a great cheese-eater of our time, and my dog gets a little corner if I've some to spare. She absolutely loves it, and isn't above reminding me that I've got cheese in the cupboard and that maybe I should get it out. </p>
<p>I try to ensure she has a healthy diet, she's not allowed anything with sugar for example, except in small quantities on very special occasions. Didn't realise cheese was bad for her. . ? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog gets Easy Cheese (spray cheese in a can) twice a day so she'll take her pills.  She's a small dog so she'd just crunch through the &quot;pill hiding treats,&quot; taste the pills and then refuse to touch them.  With the Easy Cheese it's gelatinous so she just swallows without chewing.  </p>
<p>My vet is the one who recommended this method and she said they pill all of their dogs with Easy Cheese.  We moved and our next vet recommended the same thing.  I asked him about any nutritional concerns and he said there aren't any, just to make sure to limit other treats so she doesn't gain weight.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not &quot;good&quot; for them, but my understanding is that it's not bad in the same way that onions, garlic, grapes, etc. are objectively harmful. As with any treat, it should be given in moderation and you should monitor your dog for any adverse reactions (especially diarrhea, since lactose intolerance isn't uncommon in dogs).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I know this is askreddit so I should refrain from speculation, but my educated guess is that s/he referring to the fact that a lot of cats and many dogs become lactose intolerant once they're past the puppy/kitty stage. Even though the process of making cheese gets rid of lactose, not all cheeses are the same, and some have more than others. Basically giving cheese to your dog/cat might upset their stomachs and give them diarrhea. </p>
