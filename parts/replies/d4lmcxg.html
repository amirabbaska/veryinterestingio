			<div class="markdown"><p>Idk if this data exists, but I guess what I'm asking is, &quot;how far on average is each black hole from the next closest blackhole, and what is the standard deviation on this distance?&quot; I'm imagining a perfectly distributed 3-D grid in space right now, which is freaky (and I'm sure wrong.) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well NASA says that dark matter makes up 27% of the universe, normal matter makes up about 5% (atoms made up of protons, neutrons and electrons formed into atoms) and the rest is dark energy at 68% of the known universe. So if primordial black holes are the sole constituents of dark matter, there would have to be quite a few of these black holes around the universe however the amount of mass contained in a primordial black hole could be equivalent to many many stars. Even so, there would have to be quite a few of these black holes to constitute 27% of the known universe considering only about 5% of the universe consists of what is observable to us through our various optical devices.</p>
<p>Since dark matter makes up about 5 times what &quot;normal matter&quot; constitutes. If dark matter is comprised entirely of black holes there would have to be 5 times the mass in black holes as their are in all the stars combined. If a black hole has the same mass as an average star, there would have to be 5 black holes to every star. So the distance between them would be 20% the average distance between stars. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the predicted mass of these primordial black holes, the gravity waves produced by their merging and the math that can't account  for extra detected mass is the dark matter? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Dark matter is any mass we have seen the gravitational effect of but have not been able to define. </p>
<p>These black holes are one possible explanation for the missing mass because they are hard to detect directly and have mass. </p>
<p>There could be multiple explanations for the missing matter though, neutrinos are a front runner. Last year they were discovered to have mass which means they interact gravitationally and they are a real pain to detect. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The problem with neutrinos is that they move around at such high speeds.  For the gravitational effects we've observed, there would have to be a lot of dark matter concentrated in galaxies rather than flying around everywhere.</p></div>		</li>
