			<div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR:
It maybe could be done, in theory. However we think the process will be incredibly complex in practice, and currently we have no way to infuse the toxic stuff that we use to keep frozen water from ripping apart our cells to all the different cell types at the different rates they need without being instantly toxic to our cells, freeze everything all at once, then thaw everything viably and then flush out all that toxic stuff we use to keep cells from being ripped apart by expanding water molecules before it kills our cells.</p>
<p>It does seem to make all the sci-fi movies that use &quot;hybernation sickness&quot; or similar tropes seem a bit more believable though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It can definitely be done in theory! It's a &quot;current knowledge and technology limits us&quot; issue. We are getting better though! Some organs can now be successfully cryopreserved, but the logistics are just very complicated. If we could get all of that orchestrated, we'd be good to go. </p>
<p>And yes, the &quot;sleeping&quot; approach tends to be more believable from this point of view. We'll see what kinds of long-term viable storage come from space agencies' research, as they're more than likely going to need some form of extended storage to get humans to far away planets. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing that that will be the first use, right? Cryopreserving transplantable organs? People on waiting lists could come in (more) at their convenience rather than &quot;get the fuck up and go, we got you a kidney&quot; or whatever.</p></div>		</li>
