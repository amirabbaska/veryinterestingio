			<p>Wow, great text (maybe not very eli5, but neither was the question). <br><br>As a follow up question: do you believe freezing and thawing will ever be a viable option to store complex tissues, or is it fundamentally broken and we should aim for other approaches? If so, what would be the most promising in your opinion? </p>		</li>

			<p>Thank you! I probably could've done better with the ELI5 part, i get carried away sometimes haha. <br><br>But to answer your question: Freezing and thawing will be a viable way to store some complex tissues (mostly organs in the near future), but will probably fall by the wayside and be replaced by better tech. As you noted, it is fundamentally very difficult. With more research, time, tech, and money, I'm sure we can make it work! It is just not entirely feasible at this current juncture. <br><br>From my research perspective, I'd have to say that the 3D printing of organs and complex tissues with de-differentiated stem cells is going to be the future of biological preservation/creation. Currently they try to keep someone else's liver alive for a transplant into you, but that will change. They will instead take a sample of your own tissue, de-differentiate it to stem cells (so that the cells &quot;don't know what they want to be&quot;, they are completely programmable and can be &quot;convinced and persuaded&quot; to become any type of cell in the body), then used those stem cells to seed a 3D-printed collagen model of the organ. Once on the 3D organ model, the stem cells will be &quot;persuaded&quot; to become the desired cell type (in this case, they'll be told to become all of the different cell types found in the liver). This is still a ways off tech-wise, as it is very difficult to get a complex tissue to differentiate into the necessary cell types in the necessary places, but I think it's more feasible than freezing a complex tissue and trying to revive it. </p>		</li>

			<p>As somone who is an expert in scifi technology let me explain how this works. First you sedate the cryopatient and use <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAaZVz9pDs&amp;amp;t=10m8s" target="_blank">hydrogen sulfide to lower their metabolic rate and their demand for oxygen</a> while lowering their temperature to one 1C. <br><br>The next step is performing major surgery. We start with a flexible diamond polycrystalline tube running into the mouth and out the anus. We use diamond polycrystalline because it has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_properties_of_diamond#Thermal_conductivity" target="_blank">largest thermal conductivity</a>. The high thermal conductivity is important for removing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ0N_1xQN2Y" target="_blank">body heat</a> as fast as possible. Remember the human body is a lot like a doughnut, mostly fat with a hole running through the middle. Then drill into the bone along the body placing diamond polycrystalline heat sinks at even intervals along the spine and major bones in the extremities. The last step is inserting polycrystalline diamond needles into the major organs to ensure they do not cool too slowly. <br><br>Finally we are ready for freezing. The patient should be at a consistent temperature 1C above freezing. We want to flash freeze them as fast as possible since flash freezing prevents large ice crystals from growing and puncturing the cellular membrane. As you can see from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_law_of_cooling" target="_blank">Newton's law of cooling</a> we want our delta(t) from above freezing to below freezing to be as fast as possible since the point of freezing is the area where most of the damage is done. Liquid helium has a temperature of -269C which allows us to move from 1C to below 0C as fast as possible. If you are in a space ship you might wonder where can I get liquid helium? A common space pirate hack is to use the liquid oxygen/hydrogen rocket fuel to freeze the crew for long duration flights.<br><br>To unfreeze the patient you bring them up to just below freezing and wait long enough for them to reach -1C throughout the entire body. The diamond polycrystalline was a heat sink but now it acts as a heat source to raise them above freezing. Remember to set the max heater temperature to their body temperature otherwise you will damage cells. Once they are unfrozen raise their temperature while removing the polycrystalline implants. Then they should begin to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVAaZVz9pDs&amp;amp;t=11m33s" target="_blank">animate on their own as they reach normal body temperature</a>. Let me know if you have any other questions.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well done.  Scary how much incorrect nonsense is upvoted.<br><br>Do you use a straight 1C/min freeze rate and ignore the heat spike of crystallization or do you stabilize temperature at that point and then continue at 1C/min?</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes it is quite sad to see so much incorrect and incomplete information being upvoted. I suppose I posted a little bit too late in the thread.<br><br>I just a straight 1C/min freeze rate, ignoring the heat spike. I've actually been asked that by many chemists haha. For the purposes of cell freezing, that spike is more or less irrelevant. We do use isopropyl alcohol chiller containers (Google &quot;Mr. Frosty Freezing Container&quot;) that help control the freezing rate, so they do absorb some of that crystallization spike, but the remainder of the increase is fairly negligible to cell viability once the average cell death is taken into account.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yup, too bad you posted late.<br><br>I've used Mr. Frosty, but usually use control rate freezers so we can program in whatever we like.  I do agree that the impact is minimal, but I recently saw data for at least one cell line that showed significant difference in viability after thaw (control rate freezer at 1C/min vs program that compensated for spike).  The theory being that the rate of freeze just after the peak of the spike is greater than 1C/min.<br><br>Probably won't matter for most cases, but if you really need to squeeze some viability out of a certain line or are having issues it might be useful.</p>		</li>

			<p>Really eh? Do you happen to remember what cell line that was with?<br><br>Ill have to do some lit searching about that. I wonder if that would have a big effect on primary cell lines.</p>		</li>

			<p>The data isn't published, but it was CHO cells.  Also, after the heat spike drops and the crystals are formed you can actually increase the rate beyond 1C/min and have an overall shorter freeze time.</p>		</li>

			<p>TL;DR:<br>It maybe could be done, in theory. However we think the process will be incredibly complex in practice, and currently we have no way to infuse the toxic stuff that we use to keep frozen water from ripping apart our cells to all the different cell types at the different rates they need without being instantly toxic to our cells, freeze everything all at once, then thaw everything viably and then flush out all that toxic stuff we use to keep cells from being ripped apart by expanding water molecules before it kills our cells.<br><br>It does seem to make all the sci-fi movies that use &quot;hybernation sickness&quot; or similar tropes seem a bit more believable though.</p>		</li>

			<p>It can definitely be done in theory! It's a &quot;current knowledge and technology limits us&quot; issue. We are getting better though! Some organs can now be successfully cryopreserved, but the logistics are just very complicated. If we could get all of that orchestrated, we'd be good to go. <br><br>And yes, the &quot;sleeping&quot; approach tends to be more believable from this point of view. We'll see what kinds of long-term viable storage come from space agencies' research, as they're more than likely going to need some form of extended storage to get humans to far away planets. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, you are more or less correct. The freezing process needs to be precisely controlled, so if that wasnt done right then the thawing will be unsuccessful no matter how hard you try.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm guessing that that will be the first use, right? Cryopreserving transplantable organs? People on waiting lists could come in (more) at their convenience rather than &quot;get the fuck up and go, we got you a kidney&quot; or whatever.<br></p>		</li>
