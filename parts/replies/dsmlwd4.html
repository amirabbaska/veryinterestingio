<p>Usually milk fermented things like youghurts, but everything works.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same as light grey/yellow; I'd be surprised if you can make it chalk colored without doing a medical test (I have), but you can see quite an effect.</p>
<p>Undigested fat, so be it from butter or from nuts will make your stool very pale.  Your body produces less bile if you eat less fat (there is also a limit if you go too high, but it's ~80%+ of calories), so if you then overload your diet with fat, you'll see it.  Fat and fiber also makes your feces float.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eating less fat is also what can lead to gallstones, because the little bile that is produced is stored for too long, and not used. </p>
<p>EDIT: addendum: and if your gallbladder is blocked by a stone, your feces will float and change color, too. </p></div>		</li>
