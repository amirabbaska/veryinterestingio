			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an odd one. When I was a kid in the UK in the 1960s and 70s, the game was widely called &quot;soccer&quot; here too. That word has fallen massively out of favour here very recently, and I've no idea why.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/33sc3p/til_that_the_word_soccer_was_first_used_in/cqo2pc6" target="_blank">this post</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was called soccer by the upper class and football by the working class.</p>
<p>Before I get into this, you've got to realise that most of British history is dominated by class struggle. The upper class used to have a habit of putting 'er' at the end of assocation sports (so association football was soccer, rugby union was rugger etc). Soccer was looked down on by the upper class, seeing it as a peasant sport and was generally used as a pejorative. The working classes, which football was actually popular with, used the word 'football' for loads of sports, and eventually it stuck with the football in Europe we know today.</p>
<p>'Soccer' is therefore an uncomfortable word for British football fans since 99% of us are working class and we 'own' this sport. That being said, we're fine with Americans saying soccer, even if we think most American football fans are plastic glory-hunting wankers who only support the big clubs (since they're the only ones who actually get television coverage in the US).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i think it's because on the whole americans are generally perceived as flippant about soccer. the rest of the world is absolutely mad about the game, yet they call it football, while we in america have the nerve to call a game where they hardly use feet against the ball &quot;football&quot;.  </p>
<p>now, the funny thing about that is that soccer is actually immensely popular here in the US. I don't think I know anyone my age (30) or in that general age group that didn't play it growing up, and most of us played in organized recreational and travel leagues up until high school. however, despite its popularity we don't have a professional league that is widely followed, while europe has a number of them. when a kid here plays basketball and is serious about it, his dream isn't to play in the German league, it's to play in the NBA. when a kid here plays soccer seriously, his dream isn't to play in the MLS (usually), it's to play in the Premiership, or La Liga, etc. what this ends up meaning is that we don't have a traditional outlet to watch soccer matches. sports bars here play basketball, football, baseball, nascar, and to a lesser extent (to my dismay) hockey. people who want to actively watch soccer are forced to seek out the bars/pubs that want to appeal to that crowd, and they're not hard to find if you're looking. This, I think, is one of the things that gives us an air of flippancy toward the sport, which may or may not exist. </p>
<p>Now, you combine all this together with the insane popularity of american football, the increasing popularity of soccer in the US since the late 70s, the vastly increasing ease of communication throughout the world through the 90s into the 2000s. Brits are gonna hate on the word soccer, because let's face it, you're all a bunch of limey hipsters who liked soccer before it was cool</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;football&quot; actually predates &quot;soccer&quot; int he UK, but it referred to sports that were played on foot (working class) as opposed to horses (upper class). Soccer I think came in a bit later, to differentiate soccer from other forms of sports included in the name 'football'.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Soccer's official name is Assocition football. We shortened it to As<strong>soc</strong>iation, and in the same way that 'Five pound/dollar' is shortened into 'Fiver' (this happened with some other words, but most are not commonly used today), we shortened that to <strong>Socc</strong>er.</p>
<p>Everyone else just said Football.</p></div>		</li>
