			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone who witnessed the exchange with the unnamed redditor, it should be noted that he not only completely rejected this explanation, but also the idea that the early solar system had angular momentum...</p>
<p>Edit: /u/happyfluffybunnies' response to this comment isn't showing up, but he's basically asking for evidence about that last claim. It was compiled in the list made by /u/ngc6514:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*6. Orbiting planets do not have angular momentum from their orbital motion (<a href="http://archive.is/AFU99" target="_blank">source</a>)  </p>
<ol>
<li>Angular momentum has nothing to do with orbits (<a href="http://archive.is/JjKwc" target="_blank">source</a>)*</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That depends on the nature of the creation of those moons. Moons made in a manner similar to planet accretion may be more inclined to be on that equatorial plane than, say, a late-stage massive impact like we suspect our own moon underwent.</p></div>		</li>
