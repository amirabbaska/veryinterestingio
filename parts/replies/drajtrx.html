			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, in the back end each router tells all of the other routers that it's connected to how close it is to various destinations.  </p>
<p>Russia had a router or routers that said &quot;Hey all you other routers nearby, I'm very, very close to Apple.  I'm so close I'm definitely closer than all the other routers you're talking to.  If you want to send a message to Apple, send it to me because I'm going to be the fastest way.&quot;</p>
<p>The other routers can't verify this - the system is built on blind trust.  There is incentive not to lie about how close you are, because if you start accepting the messages you'll have to actually do something with them.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I get it. But A how fast they they noticed that the Russians were deviating traffic and B what did the Russian do to the deviated traffic? They made a copy of all the data? Catfished people into revealing sensitive information? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably noticed very, very quickly, because there are people who sit around and watch this all day (eg: this site <a href="https://bgpmon.net/blog/" target="_blank">https://bgpmon.net/blog/</a>)  </p>
<p>As for what Russia had to gain from it - probably not a whole lot.  If the traffic was encrypted with HTTPS, it should have been protected from interception.   <em>However</em> because they did specifically target some high-profile destinations, it does look like they were trying to gather specific traffic, and they wouldn't do that for no reason.</p>
<p>To avoid this, routers can be configured NOT to blindly trust updates from their neighbours.  The internet is kind of like the highway systems - there are small neighbourhood roads (small ISPs), there are larger highways that are used to travel longer distances (&quot;Tier 2&quot; ISPs), and there are interstates and large highways that cross borders (&quot;Tier 1&quot; ISPs).  If a small ISP tries to tell the router of a Tier 2 or Tier 1 provider that they are the fastest way to get to Apple, naturally that message will be ignored.  If Google Maps told you that the fastest way to get from England to Belgium is via some unmaintained mountain pass in Brazil, you probably wouldn't believe that either.</p>
<p>If a Tier 1 ISP's router tells another Tier 1 ISP that it is now the fastest way to get to Apple, it almost HAS to be believed.  This is because congestion, maintenance, outages, etc. happen all the time.  The infrastructure needs to dynamically and immediately figure out what the <em>new</em> fastest way to get packets to their destination is.</p></div>		</li>
