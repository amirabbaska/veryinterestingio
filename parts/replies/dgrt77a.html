<p>As you said, the system would achieve thermodynamic equilibrium. And thermodynamic equilibrium between two black bodies is defined by the fact that both bodies are radiating away as much power as they are absorbing. Thus P<em><em>1</em></em>=P<em><em>2</em></em> and the identity above follows. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes, so?  Emission is proportional to the surface area, absorption is proportional to the surface area.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Why?  Even in my hall of mirrors where no light escapes it can be absorbed back by the emitter.  In fact it's either absorbed by the other body or re-absorbed by the emitter, only options.  The probability of one versus the other is proportional to the ratio of the surface areas of the two.  If the sun is bigger it is also more likely to catch its own emitted ray upon reflection.  It makes no sense no matter how many lenses you have to say that the light that leaves here MUST be deposited here.</p>
<p>This is also the issue of focusing on lenses and such.  You miss the forest for the trees.  You have two thermodynamics bodies which are free to exchange heat through EM radiation.  That's really all it is.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This statement still seems to beg a proof that you can't simply align some mirrors in a way that <em>all</em> the light emanating from one surface reaches the other. I believe this can be proven in the case of optics, analogous to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etendue#Conservation_of_etendue" target="_blank">conservation of etendue/radiance</a> -- it essentially follows from reversibility/reciprocity of optical systems. Since basic radiance may not increase, it follows that the incoming energy flux into the smaller sphere 2 must satisfy P&lt;=A2 sigma.T1^4 , so you readily get that T2&lt;=T1.</p>
<p>Note too that non-linear systems violate this. You can use solar panels to store optical energy and later concentrate it to arbitrarily high temperatures; while the 2nd law as a while is still valid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Again people are going crazy with the optics.  Optics doesn't trump thermodynamics, it's the other way around.  If you think you have an optical set-up that violates thermodynamics then you don't understand your optical set-up.  By way of example, this:</p>

<p>Is just a very high effort, round-about way to just say &quot;an optical cavity held at a fixed temperature&quot; and the end result is the resolution of the ultraviolet catastrophe of the early 1900s.  The light emitted through the hole in the &quot;oven&quot; is just... Planck's law.</p>
<p>But throw all your lenses and mirrors out and let me give you an example where IT IS clearly possible.  A sphere of temperature Th inside a shell of temperature Tc.  100% of the light from the sphere is now absorbed by Tc, and.... you're still just driving the two to equilibrium.</p></div>		</li>

<p>No it's not. It would violate conservation of basic radiance, the radiant flux cannot increase as you decrease the radius of your spherical coordinate system towards the smaller sphere. For the 2nd law of thermodynamics to work, 100% of the light going from one sphere to another <em>must be impossible</em> if they don't have exactly the same area, some of the light the large sphere emits must be reabsorbed by itself (which is clearly true, more and more is absorbed by itself as the inside sphere gets smaller). You're treating it as a little more trivial than is due I think.</p></div>		</li>
