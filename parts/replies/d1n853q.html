			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to have to download &quot;file unlockers&quot; on my windows box when unknown processes would take control of files indefinitely. It was like sorcery- you couldn't find out what the process was, and sometimes they would work, sometimes not.</p>
<p>I've never had to deal with that kind of thing since moving to OSX, but part of that is likely the lesser amount of modding/tweaking I've done to the system and OSX's sandboxing. If anything, though, my Mac's processes are more mysterious to me than Windows'.</p></div>		</li>
