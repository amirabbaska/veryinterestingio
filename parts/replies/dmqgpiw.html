			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, people usually aren't informed enough about terms involving Philosophy of Science. I think the difference between an &quot;construct&quot; and an &quot;object&quot; as described in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_(philosophy)" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> is of some help. We can't put gravity in a cup (like silverfish) but we can certainly perform empirical, measurable, repeatable and valid experiments on the &quot;construct&quot; of gravity.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Would it have been better if OP had distinguished between &quot;theoretical&quot; and &quot;empirical&quot;? E.g. Would it be more appropriate to say that we have &quot;empirical&quot; evidence for their existence and their effects, etc, but other things are purely &quot;theoretical&quot;?</p>
<p>Or is that still not quite right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The major problem with the word &quot;theory&quot; is that scientist use it differently than the majority of people. Hence why people making the distinction by adding &quot;scientific&quot; before it.</p>
<p>In your everyday use theory is mostly used when someone has a hunch or speculation that is supported by some facts or evidence.</p>
<p>And quite honestly i wish scientist would just come with a new word, so that people can't say stuff like &quot;Theory of Evolution is...&quot; like you mentioned &quot;... just a theory&quot; anymore.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A new word, as in a word that is not commonly used? It may fall prey to the same euphemistic misuse as theory. It might be good to steal a common word, instead. It doesn't make it impossible for the meaning to change, but it might help.</p>
<p>For example... &quot;Scientific explanation&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;The scientific explanation of evolution&quot; &quot;Explanatory physics&quot;</p>
<p>But honestly, I don't think it's a big problem. Scientists understand it. And all jargon is going to be unintelligible to the layperson.</p>
<p>It is the person who relates the information to the layperson whose responsibility it is to ensure that they understand it. So, if we made up a new word that meant the same as theory, let's say, &quot;lilon&quot;, then when a newspaper mentioned the &quot;lilon of evolution&quot;, they'd have to say what &quot;lilon&quot; meant. They have the same responsibility when mentioning the &quot;theory of evolution&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Yes they do and if everyone would be aware of the distinction there wouldn't be a problem, BUT because it is used so differently its easily and has been over and over again exploited to lie to the general public.</p>
<p>The continued use is not constructive as it is too easy to exploit and for example in the case of climate change is literally contributing to harm humanity as a whole.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>I can't really say, but if there doesn't exist a word that fits, then making a new one seems appropriate... its not like people aren't making up new words all the time.</p></div>		</li>
