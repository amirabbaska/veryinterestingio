			<div class="markdown"><p>Hi! The work is still basic research as this point, but we hope that by understanding how these extra copies of p53 work in elephants we may some day be able to mimic that in human cancer cells. </p>
<p>It is hard to say if CRISPR will bed used to treat cancer, one of the major limitations with that approach would be targeting the effects specifically to the cancer cells. After all one wouldn't want to edit normal cells accidentally turning them cancerous or killing them!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes p53 is one of the well understood gene mutation leading to cancer. It is mutated in The majority of cancer cells. It is basically a checkpoint before the cell divides that checks and make sure that the cell's DNA hasn't been mutated too much. If the DNA is too mutated p53 sends signals for the sell to self destruct (apoptosis). If p53 if defective then the cell will continue dividing despite DNA mutations. </p>
<p>Basically p53 is a regulator of the cell cycle</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>p53 also is involved in initiating DNA repair as well as apoptosis, so its mutation is often an early event in a cancer (once p53 is mutated it becomes much, much easier for the cell to acquire mutations to other genes since it can't repair itself, and it can't go into apoptosis to stop itself from becoming cancerous either!) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fellow medical student here.</p>
<p>I've taken several tests that ask about p53. At your level, you also need to know that p53 (after irreparable DNA damage is ascertained) recruits BAX to knock out bcl2; this destabilizes mitochondrial membranes in the cell which allows cytochrome c to leak into the cell. Cytochrome c then induces apoptosis and kills the cell before the cell replicates. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>P53 is probably the most important gene and the most extensively studied gene with respect to cancer. Yet it has not been used as a therapeutic target successfully till now and probably won't be for a long time if ever. In fact almost all the successful cancer therapies came from targeting genes that were not in the top ten most studied cancer genes list or something.</p>
<p>CRISPR is a great tool in the laboratory, but it's application in clinic is ways off. It's basically gene therapy and the can of worms that opens is well known. Gene therapy will happen eventually and become mainstream but it's anybodys guess when that will be. Even then CRISPR mediated gene therapy might not be the one to use simply because the proteins the system comprises of are eukaryotic in origin so can be easily immunogenic (Though that might not necessarily matter).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Can you ELI25 why? Is the actual technique of gene insertion hard, or...? Seems like a pretty basic premise: just insert several extra copies of p53 genes and an organism should be at vastly lower risk for cancer, right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>Traditional gene therapy had the potential to cause cancers by inserting whatever you want to insert in the middle of an important gene. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delivery of gene therapy is very difficult. We generally use viruses and your body is very good at clearing viruses especially ones that are not designed to break the immune system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For effective gene therapy you need to deliver and incorporate your gene in a large fraction of the target tissue cells you need to affect. We are nowhere close to that and AFAIK don't even have a plan of how to do that.</p>
</li>
<li>Gene therapy is permanent. If it has a side effect, you're stuck with that for life. If the side effect is death, you really can't stop it after starting the therapy. And we are extremely unprepared to predict side effects of changing even obviously wrong genes (in people with genetic disorders) leave alone meddling with p53 (arguably the most important gene in your genome) just so you can reduce incidence of cancer.</li>
