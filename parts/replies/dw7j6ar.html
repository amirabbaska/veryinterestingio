			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we are talking about average density so inside a Nebula you would not notice any gases (much like being on Earth which is way more dense on average).</p>
<p>However, accretion disks can be way more dense.  The formula for one model is here:

<p>In Black Holes they can form magnetic fields and plasma jets.  In fact, that is how we know Black Holes exist as nothing comes out of the hole (but signals come out of the surrounding disk).</p>
<p>EDIT: Here is a paper on a Black Hole (Cygnus X-1), which has a very hot accretion disk that has electron temperatures over 1 billion K and ion temps 3x-300x that.  </p>
<p>The disk itself is 500 times the radius of Cygnus X1 (which is about 300km) so it's accretion disk is about 1,500 Km:</p>

<p>Our own Galactic Black Hole Sagittarius A*, has a Gas Cloud about 3x the mass of Earth orbiting it although I cannot find the size of the cloud, it is very dense.  While a cloud like this may form a planet at some point, it is being disrupted by the Black Hole's gravity.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Wouldn't tidal forces limit the size of any solid masses forming? </p></div>		</li>

<p>isn't the main telltale sign of black holes their mass? (either the absurd mass of the big ones and/or the &quot;steep gradient&quot; near the smaller ones?)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>it is not particular big and the particle density is much lower compared to normal nebula. It doesn't look much like a nebula such as orion nebula. It is only a cloud with respect to the surrounding medium. The LIC is situated inside the local bubble, which is a region of lower density in the interstellar medium. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Because they would need something (aka gravity) to hold them together or they become diffuse gas clouds. If gravity is holding them together, then they're the atmosphere of a much larger object (moon, planet, etc...).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To chip in tentatively, I believe the process of diffusion means that even if such a cloud ever existed, it would naturally just spread itself thin over time as it 'diffused' outwards. It's very interesting to learn nebulae are less dense than most vacuums made on Earth, but the scale of time is so huge</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I remember as a kid reading a kidâ€™s astronomy book learning that Saturn is less dense than water, and so it would float.  That image stuck with me because I thought it was kind of cool.</p>
<p>Then I remember growing up and realizing that the physics of putting Saturn in interaction with a sufficiently large mass of water to observe something akin to floating would exhibit properties completely unlike anything I had imagined as a child and would quite certainly destroy Saturn entirely, and most likely also radically alter the solar system so as to end all life on Earth.</p>
<p>Then I was sad. :(.</p></div>		</li>
