<p>If, just a moment after the Big Bang, the universe was infinite, then why was all the matter/energy packed into a space small enough that it would be so dense and hot?</p>
<p>Within a table in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe</a> we can read &quot;At the end of this epoch, the spherical volume of space which will become the observable universe is about 300 light-years in radius&quot; and I'm having trouble reconciling this &quot;300 light years&quot; with &quot;infinite universe&quot;.</p></div>		</li>

<p>become the <strong>OBSERVABLE</strong> universe</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The size of the universe is the size of the universe.  The size of the OBSERVABLE universe is the set of all points in space whose light could have reached US ON PLANET EARTH since the beginning of the universe.  The observable universe has a finite-size because the universe has a finite-age and light only travels so fast and thus there's a circle beyond which no light emitted from there would have reached us on Earth yet since the beginning.  That doesn't mean those points don't EXIST (i.e. that they're not in the universe), just that their light won't have hit our telescopes yet.</p>
<p>Don't confuse those two (universe and observable universe), they're different things.  With that in mind, reparse the sentence you quoted and hopefully it makes more sense to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>then why was all the matter/energy packed into a space small enough that it would be so dense and hot?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because a density is the amount of stuff PER amount of space.  Let's just ignore dark energy.  So in an infinite universe I can still have an infinite amount of energy and infinite amount of space but a finite amount of energy PER unit space (i.e. density).  If the amount of space increases without any increase in the amount of energy then as time evolves the DENSITY of energy decreases, even if the total amount of energy is still infinite. </p>
<p>Does that make sense?  It's important to understand that infinities can be compared and infinities can be larger than one another and their ratios can be finite numbers.  For each unit of volume I can have, say, 6 Joules of energy.  If the rule for distance scales such that all points have now double in their distance then the length of that same box has now become two units across (or 2x2x2 = 8 times the volume) and the new unit volume only has 6/8 = 0.75 Joules of energy.  Energy density has decreased even if the total amount of space and energy is infinite. </p></div>		</li>

<p>also is there any model where space is quantized?  In other words where it is not an infinite continuum?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thank you very much for this, I think I have a better understanding now. But I still have a question:</p>
<p>Ok, so at the end of that whatever epoch, today's <strong>observable</strong> universe was 300 ly in radius and very dense. The entire universe was already infinite and equally dense, but light travelling from there is just too far away and will never reach us.</p>
<p>Rewording: a tiny fraction of time after the BB, the universe (observable and beyond) was already infinite and really packed with matter/energy. Is this right?</p></div>		</li>

<p>There was no boundary, nothing exploded.  The Big Bang was named by a detractor of the theory and is a very poor name, &quot;the homogeneous and isotropic and very orderly expansion of space with fixed energy (ignoring dark energy)&quot; is perhaps a better, if less pithy, name. </p>

<p>I think it is important to separate Big Bang Cosmology (BBC) from fundamental questions of existence.  We live in a universe with a Cosmic Background Radiation.  We live in a universe where everything observed in the cosmos is moving away from everything else in the cosmos according to Hubble's law. We live in a universe that is mostly hydrogen and to a lesser extent helium and the abundance of those two have a certain ratio.   And so on.</p>
<p>It's a less sexy way of thinking and talking about such things but it's the real reason we have this idea.  If you assume the universe has a &quot;rule for distance&quot; called the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker (FLRW) metric, which has &quot;fitting coefficients&quot; of a time dependent scale factor and a cosmological constant you recover pretty much everything we observe in the universe going back at least to the time it was opaque (the Recombination Epoch that produces the CMB).  And it tells us not just qualitative things, like, &quot;there should be a CMB&quot;, it tells us the exact distribution it should have in the EM spectrum:</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Cmbr.svg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cd/Cmbr.svg</a></p>
<p>And it's spot on (the red points are data from the COBE satellite experiment).  It tells us what the H/He ratio should be and it's spot on.  It tells us why things are receding according to Hubble's Law and it's spot on.</p>
<p>So, I think it's important to understand that &quot;big questions&quot; aside, BBC is a mathematical model with an extraordinary bounty of quantitatively accurate predicts matching observations and experiments.  All meaning it holds in pop culture aside, that's WHAT it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I have a question then. I'm not very smart, and a complete layman.</p>
<p>Old TVs, the ones with the Black and White static on start up. We are told that is BGCR(Background Cosmic Radiation) we are literally seeing. When you start up the TV it starts as a Tiny dot, then expands.</p>
<p>Is it possible, that are we a tunnel of light? It seems to me, that OLD TVs and the start of the Universe are kinda similar. </p>
<p>If you look down a tunnel, it very small at the end given the length of the Tunnel. And as you get closer to one end, what you see, it expands. Which is why, when we look out there, it looks like there are Galaxies on top of each other, when they are BILLIONS and BILLIONS of miles apart.</p>
<p>Meaning, with the better Telescopes, with ends are getting closer and closer together. Which would look like the Universe is expanding. I heard, if we can see anything farther than what we currently can, and there are complete Galaxies. Then our Model is thrown out the window, because there shouldn't be anything older than 15 billion years.</p>
<p>Sorry, I feel like I haven't explained it well. It's the best I can do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A glib answer would be that this is an invalid question, since time itself was created at the big bang, but this is arguably not very helpful.</p>
<p>A (perhaps) more helpful answer, although (perhaps) not very satisfying, would be &quot;we don't know&quot;. Current theories are known to work until some tiny fraction of a second <em>after</em> the Big Bang. The actual Big Bang itself, let alone what came before, is not understood. There are theories about this, but nothing firm or well established.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is also an important semantic issue.  Before and After are words we use to describe how things are ordered IN time.  It may not make sense to use those words to talk about time itself.  Perhaps something similar can be said for inside and outside.</p></div>		</li>
