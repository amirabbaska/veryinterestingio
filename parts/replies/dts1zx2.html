			<div class="markdown"><p>That’s so sad, the first bit about the hemorrhaged ear drums! I’ve also heard that the frequency at which whales communicate has increased due to human interference such as with sonar or with the sound of engines. I wonder how much those effects have caused or been correlated to whales beaching?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, this is a bit out of my training, thus it's going to be a bit hand wavy which is why I didn't mention it in the original comment... </p>
<p>If memory serves, the way whales / dolphins (<em>Cetacea</em>) vocalize is rather different than human vocalization. They have cavities in their heads where the clicks for echolocation, and the longer calls originate. Consequently, they are at rather specific frequencies the animals have limited control over. That's not to say they're always at one specific frequency and thus there's no chance engines or sonar could cause them to use a different frequency. It just means it's unlikely... and, it would make more sense for them to use lower frequency, not higher. Since non-military activity in the oceans would have to be a higher frequencies (the newer low frequency sonar being the exception). So, the higher frequencies would be messy, the lower frequencies should still be free of human influence.</p>
<p>Getting back to the beaching thing, and the part I didn't mention originally because it's hand wavy and I didn't want to dig up a paper: Because lower frequency echolocation is very useful for long range use, I would expect these species that live mostly in the 1000+ meter depth range to have evolved larger cavities and thus use lower frequency clicks and calls. Whereas species (like dolphins) that are closer to the shore, would need to use higher frequency clicks and calls to echolocate. So, because these deep ocean dwellers are (probably) ineffective at creating and interpreting higher frequency clicks, that's why they're the ones that get beached. The lower frequency clicks just aren't going out with enough fidelity for them to tell the difference between something sandy, and something shallow--for instance.</p>
<p>edit: forgot to tie these two thoughts back together. If humans are lowering the frequency at which these animals communicate and echolocate, and if my handy wavy explanation about the frequency associated with different species is vaguely accurate... we could be making them even worse at something they're already bad at. That's a decent bit of conjecture and something I'd imagine would be very hard to show. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I gathered this from a video, I don’t know he sources, yet they were stating that boat engines and such were sending low frequency sounds through the ocean causing whales to increase the frequency they were communicating with. There’s audio from like 50 years ago and today and there’s a definite difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/CrpkZkwTvu0" target="_blank">Here’s</a> a video link for those interested. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That first part is why you hear about submarines sneaking up to and “killing” vessels in war games, and why those “kills” worry nobody in the Navy that got beat. I can’t speak for sure about other navies, but the USN only uses passive sonar during those games and anytime we’re not in a war state. They’re protecting ocean life, because our active sonar causes all sorts of hell at whatever it’s aimed at (hemorrhaged ear drums, beachings, all sorts of fauna getting disturbed, etc.)</p></div>		</li>
