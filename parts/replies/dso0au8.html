			<div class="markdown"><p>I agree with everything except the concept of language. Autobiographical memory doesn't appear to be fundamentally encoded linguistically, which makes sense, since we know animals without language have varying degrees of autobiographical memory. IIRC, they seem to be predominantly sensory, since subjects in fMRI who are asked to recall specific events have high activation in sensory cortices (esp visual, auditory-- although auditory could be the linguistic function you describe).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What autobiographical memory do they have that we know of? I am unaware of this and am curious to learn if there's truly explicit autobiographical memory in animals that are incapable of abstraction (concepts, symbols, and language). </p></div>		</li>

<p>The second is language development.  Autobiographical memory is often descriptive, eg. &quot;I went to the store &quot;.  Encoding this memory may rely on language skills that have not yet developed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Following this logic, then theoretically would humans prior to the development of language have significantly different ability to form memories?</p></div>		</li>
