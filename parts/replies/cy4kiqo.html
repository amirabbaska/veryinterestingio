			<p>In the original series of Cosmos: A Personal Voyage with Carl Sagan, he describes a futuristic model of an interstellar spaceship that would have a huge electro-magnetic disc. The disc would act as a giant space vacuum cleaner, sucking up stray particles and directing them into the ship where they would be harvested as fuel. </p>		</li>
