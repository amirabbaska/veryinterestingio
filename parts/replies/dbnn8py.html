<p>If not you get a picture captcha.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I'm glad they do this. I don't mind the street sign images or the numbered address images, but when it's randomized letter and number combinations all curvy and wonky, I get the CAPTCHAs wrong more often than I get them right. Sometimes I'll do 5 or 6 before I get it correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also google have stated that they have bots that can solve those wonky capchas better than humans so that is probably a major factor in why they are used a lot less these days.</p></div>		</li>

<p>That fucking picture captcha is broken half the time. It'll ask you to click on all the images with a van in the or some other nonsense. You do it and it still rejects your choices.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But you don't know which answer is correct because neither of them have used any reliable sources for their claims.</p>
<p>Both are literally uncited walls of text with anecdotal evidence and &quot;I heards&quot;.</p>
<p>They could easily both be incorrect.</p></div>		</li>

<p>If google doesn't know enough about you, they will by the way simply show the original reCAPTCHA</p>

<p>So, why do they need to bother with the checkbox at all? Assuming you pass those other tests/behaviors, why not just let you do whatever the CAPTCHA box was preventing you from doing? There must be <em>something</em> to clicking the actual box, no? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They are comparing to making the Captcha invisible or just say &quot;Pass&quot; without needing to click the checkbox for computers Google deems to not be robots. My understanding is that Google is testing this already, but not widely used.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>One of the questions people aren't asking is that: why doesn't it just not track anything and show the tough CAPTCHA all the time? That's because users are known to <em>bounce</em> at obstacles, and even corporate companies are prepared to allow some fraud in, to prevent user churn and abandonment.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>100%. I have never experienced just a box, I've always then had to verify other stuff which is usually not obvious 'all the squares that contain a shopfront' type shit. I will only bother with a captcha if I really want/need to, most of the time I just nope straight out.</p></div>		</li>
