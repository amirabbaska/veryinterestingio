			<p>Well, if one's life is judged solely by how much money one makes and how &quot;marketable&quot; one's skills are, then, sure, college might be considered a waste of money. <br><br>However, literature, music, and other arts existed long before buccaneer capitalism and will still be around long after Marx's revolution has ground the US into dust. Folks who have actually taken the time to become educated in these matters can see that, regardless of whether their major was &quot;made up&quot; or &quot;no one hires for [it].&quot;</p>		</li>

			<p>the topic is a discussion of why this group of people is poor. The amount of money they make and the skills they have to market is 100% relevant.</p>		</li>

			<p>ten is a lot. I'll just list some...<br><br><br>1) real estate<br><br>2) effective communication<br><br>3) investments<br><br>4) insurance<br><br>5) basic business management<br><br>6) technical saavy (networks / computers)<br><br><br>Being of expert knowledge on any of those things will not only allow you to look out better for your own needs but will also allow you to charge the majority of people on the earth, who have no clue about those things, for helping them.<br><br><br>If you're asking me to prove they have no marketable skills, I refer you to the topic. The proof is all over, in the employment numbers and personal wealth numbers. <br><br><br><em>You must be able to do something that someone else needs done</em> either because they can't do it or because they would rather pay for it. If all you can do is stuff 90% of other people can do, you don;t have a very marketable skillset. <br></p>		</li>
