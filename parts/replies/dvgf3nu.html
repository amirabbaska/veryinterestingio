<p>Also, believing Jupiter was dominantly metallic hydrogen well predates those experiments, they're (widely questioned) confirmation of metallic hydrogen, but not the source of the theory in any sense. Quoting Isaac Silvera's own website: &quot;Wigner and Huntington predicted, over 70 years ago, that under high pressure solid molecular hydrogen would become an atomic metal.&quot;</p></div>		</li>

<p>The majority of the hydrogen in Jupiter is supposed to be solid metallic hydrogen</p>

<p>Do you have a reference for the solid part? That does not agree with most equations of state I've ever read, which suggest that at Jovian interior temperature it should be <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bOYkr8x.jpg" target="_blank"><em>liquid</em> metallic hydrogen</a>.</p></div>		</li>
