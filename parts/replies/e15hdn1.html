			<div class="markdown"><p>Problem is that this is not only language-dependent, but also speaker-dependent. Some English speaking people don't use &quot;uhm&quot; at all, but filler words such as &quot;like&quot;, &quot;well&quot; or even repetitions of what they just said. Thus, I don't think a reliable, comprehensive list can be found.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>not only this, but gender dependent (at least in English).  In a seminar on voice feminization for transgender clients (for speech language pathologists) they covered this topic a bit.  Generally, when people think of voice feminization (clients included) people focus on raising the pitch of the voice.  But studies have shown that voices with a lower pitch, but more feminine traits are perceived as more female than high voices with masculine traits.  So people who specialize in voice feminization are starting to be trained in this area... and one aspect of this is that men tend to use more 'vocal thought' sounds, like &quot;ah&quot; or &quot;um...&quot;... they tend to fill those empty spaces with sound, whereas women tend not to.  (of course, this is a tendency, not a 100% across the board thing, and even when it does apply, men who do this don't do it all the time and women who don't do this occasionally will, but it is a trend between genders).</p>
<p>I never noticed this until it was brought up and now I'm hyper aware of it, which can be somewhat annoying.  But I will say, it might partially explain something that women (myself included) complain about all the time -- the fact that men interrupt us all the time.  Because we tend to not fill those empty spaces with sound, they might just not realize we are thinking, because for them, when they are thinking they make it known by making noise.  So like, I'm explaining myself, and I pause to gather my thoughts, and the guy I'm talking to is like &quot;uh... she stopped talking and now she's just standing there... let me end this awkward silence&quot;, and then he starts talking and now I'm annoyed because as far as I'm concerned, I was literally mid-thought.</p>
<p>Who knows, I could be wrong, but it's an interesting possibility.  </p></div>		</li>

<p>I'm from Poland and one of my buddies who knew rather basic English would type out &quot;yyy&quot; on chat (in games etc.) to signal he was thinking about the answer since it was a natural filler to him, it seemed pretty funny to me and probably most English-speaking people when reading it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Your buddy was at the basic level, so I suppose he can be forgiven; I'm also Polish, and when I studied English in college, we had a professor who apparently never got the memo that English for &quot;aha&quot; is actually &quot;oh&quot; (as in, when you remember about something you were going to add to what you were saying - like, he'd talk about an issue connected with descriptive grammar and go like &quot;aha, and one more thing...&quot; every now and then). He had extensive knowledge, wrote books, and was generally respected - and obviously fluent in English - so it was kinda fascinating to me that he just seemed to not register that he was using a wrong expression. It's like &quot;aha!&quot;, which is something we just say reflexively and maybe without even registering <em>that</em> we say it, is so deeply rooted in our brains that it might be hard to convince them to replace it with equivalents in foreign languages. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems very strange since the reason that you might say ummmm is because you are thinking about what to say next.  </p>
<p>They must always be thinking one word ahead of what they are speaking </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point. I could be characterizing it wrong - they might be stopping on the last word they had planned rather than the first word of the next thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I mean don't we normally have several words already queued up in our head when we're communicating? I hear it sometimes in english with people doing public speaking with &quot;the the the...&quot; or even drawing out words with &quot;iiiiiiff yooouuu think about it...&quot; Native English speakers also tend to be grammar Nazis, which kind of inhibits certain conversational quirks. I feel like a lot of places you won't be harped on as much for a mistake in grammar as long as the meaning is conveyed.</p></div>		</li>
