			<div class="markdown"><p>And has some evidence to suggest it <em>does</em> have therapeutic uses, as does MDMA. It's not harmless by any means, but the classification system is an absolute shambles if both are treated as the most dangerous drugs money can buy..</p>
<p>It's just as stupid here in the UK. Cannabis is class B, so it's considered as bad as amphetamines and synthetic cannabinoids, and worse than benzodiazepines. MDMA, LSD, and Psilocybin are all class A, making them as bad as crack, methamphetamine, and heroin. There's no logic or reason there.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It makes a lot more sense if you stop looking at it as a measure of how dangerous the drug is and start looking at it as the end result of politics</p>
<p>Labeling marijuana, MDMA, and LSD as the worst of the worst allowed law enforcement to make easier busts; marijuana is even still considered an easy arrest because of the pungent smell. Thankfully, we're moving away from the politics bans and moving toward more accurate bans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I spoke with a one time heroin user who had been on Oxy for about 2 months for a severe tricompartmental knee fracture. He said they were not even remotely comparable, and the reason he only tried heroin once is b/c he knew he would get addicted.</p></div>		</li>
