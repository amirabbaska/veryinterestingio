			<div class="markdown"><p>Mind blown. So depending on the spectrum, water can be not transparent. It's like aquatic creatures developed &quot;x-ray&quot; vision (but it's just visible light spectrum vision). </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand from what the science poster said, the only real way for our ancient fish ancestors to have developed vision at all was to develop eyes that see in the visible spectrum. </p>
<p>If the water is blocking other wavelengths, there would be nothing else to &quot;see&quot; in the water with organs designed to detect other wavelengths.  </p>
<p>It's like if life developed in pudding, and pudding blocks all noises except high pitched ones.  If we wanted to hear, we'd need ears that detect high pitched noises.  </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or to put it differently, you would have been exceptionally good at being able to see the presence of water... But it wouldn't have been useful, since that's all you would ever see.</p>
<p>To recycle an ancient post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If water (or whatever medium) was transparent in different wavelengths, then the organisms that evolved in it would have developed photosynthesis to use <strong>those</strong> wavelengths, and later on when if evolved eyes, those eyes would <strong>also</strong> be sensitive to the most &quot;useful&quot; wavelengths.</p>
<p>&quot;Gorp, do you ever think how convenient it is that we can see straight through liquid ammonia, the most common liquid on the whole moon? It just wows me.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So basically, evolution-wise, in the early stages of growth in the water, seeing in the 'visible' wavelength offered an evolutionary benefit, whereas having the ability to see the other wavelengths offered none, so it was less likely to be naturally selected. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depending on the <em>part</em> of the spectrum, yes. Other commenters have posted some nice graphs that relate frequency to the absorption coefficient of water. The coefficient gets small in the terahertz region for various reasons. This is the reason that RF communications actually don't work effectively underwater, because they are typically in the megahertz or gigahertz regions and those parts of the spectrum are attenuated greatly by the water</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Don't feel bad, that is pretty mind blowing - and it's not just that water <em>can</em> be non-transparent, but to me the mind blowing thing is that it almost always is, <em>except</em> in the visible range. Crazy. But it makes total sense as far as evolution because the first animals were aquatic. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus that water is one of few if not the only molecule which solid form (ice) is less dense than the liquid form (AFAIK water is most dense at 4°C). Water while common to us indeed physical and chemical is a pretty strange substance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Great answer.</p>
<p>So, if we allow that water is a prerequisite for life, it stands that there’s a very good chance that any alien we meet would see in the same wavelengths that we do.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Most likely, unless they developed on land first, in which case it would be less necessary for survival that water be transparent. It sure would help of course, assuming there was edible ocean life, but you can imagine land-evolved creatures utilizing another part of the spectrum for vision, and water just being an opaque liquid. Interesting to think about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Based on our current understanding, the natural evolution of life must begin in water.  This is because the atmosphere allowed us to transition onto land was created initially by life evolving in water first.  There are other conditions as well, like how the proto elements of the first cellular life had to suspended in a liquid cohesively enough for the elements to interact with each other to spontaneously form self replicating cells.  Wouldn't work too well in a gaseous environment.</p>
<p>Not saying it's not possible.  But current models for our understanding are limited to life originating in water.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only for life like ours. Water is great for life sure; it allows for complex chemistry and is easy to come by, H and O being pretty common cosmically. But there's a difference between &quot;water makes life more likely&quot; and &quot;water is a prerequisite for life&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, I don't believe it works that way. You can't really change water. Everything has a bandgap and allows certain frequencies of light through it. This is why you can see through glass and not wood. You can stop water from being transparent by just putting a lot of water. You can't see to the bottom of the ocean because the light gets absorbed or reflected along the way. You can also just add some dirt. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>An interesting thought is that we have a heat sensing organ (in a sense) ourselves: the skin. You can sense the presence of a close warm body without seeing it or locate the sun even when blind. You can also notice something is hot without needing to burn yourself or find out where to seek shelter from heat/cold. It's a nice showerthought about stuff the human body can do.</p></div>		</li>
