<p>Solitary for a month!</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ISS was cake at one of my schools. The &quot;supervisor&quot; let us have screaming contests just to mess around and he always played &quot;Because I Got High&quot;. He would sleep quite often and we'd just chill. Then we'd go out the the field for a little bit and walk, or mess around on the exercise bars.</p>
<p>I actually think this was a better thing, because he was a very chill and relatable dude. Students escaping a stressful situation in class were better off in the little ISS closet than stewing at home, lol.</p>
<p>It was only solitary if you were the only student sent. But that's probably rare for most places.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily solitary. If there are multiple students on in school suspension, they will likely all be in the same room with (theoretically) no talking.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfotunately I think /u/Nytelock1 hits the nail on the head here in a deeper way.</p>
<p>A child is required by law to attend primary and secondary education.  This is for their own benefit and the state uses this time to educate them (so far so good).  However, within this context of forced attendance, misbehavior is punished with incarceration for periods of 1-10 days.</p>
<p>Imagine if you were required to attend a government office once a week and if you mouthed off, or misbehaved (in a non-criminal manner) you could be jailed for 1-10 days.  It is absurd.</p>
<p>Of course the problem is the same one the actual criminal justice system faces: we don't actually know how to fix behavior on a systemic level.  So we just put them in a box and wait it out and see if that fixes things.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I had an incident when I was in High School when someone bullying me finally pushed me to my breaking point.</p>
<p>I decked the kid.  Laid him on his ass.  Did it in front of a teacher.</p>
<p>To this day I view it as the right thing to do (it is a longer story then what I am telling, the justification is in things I am leaving out).  When I sat down in front of the Principal I didn't hold back.  I told him exactly what I did and why I did it.</p>
<p>The bully got a much harsher punishment then I did. But the principal said he felt required to give me an out of school suspension as a 'cooling off period.'.</p>
<p>I look back and I think that was the appropriate call from the principal as well.</p>
<p>My bully?  Never troubled me again.  I didn't have a lot of problems with bullies after that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't be surprised if there was also parent pushback from out of school suspension. A parent would have to arrange daycare or take time off from work.</p>
<p>Plus even if the kid enjoys the vacation from school, and doesn't mind the stigma or separation from the peers, it separates the problem kid from the rest. This makes it easier for the school and teachers to maintain order and teach.</p></div>		</li>
