			<div class="markdown"><p>There was a post a day or two ago here where someone got a fake $20 from the bank ATM.  It was a movie production note and even said &quot;for motion picture use only on it.&quot;</p>
<p>I haven't received any fake money from US banks, but I have several times overseas.  Less so now that many countries are using polymer notes instead of paper.</p></div>		</li>

<p>&quot;MOTION PICTURE USE ONLY&quot;  &quot;This note is not legal, it is to be used for motion pictures&quot;</p>
<p>I'm not sure, but I think the signature says &quot;Benjamin A. Jefferson, Treasurer&quot;.  Lawl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, happens a lot.  If you are a known business customer most banks would probably take the loss and give you a new bill.  But a lot also have the &quot;once you walk out the door it's your problem&quot; policy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may get passed around a bit in the general public but once it gets to a bank it's not going back out. Most tellers can spot it and if they don't it'll get noticed at the federal reserve where the money is sent to </p>
<p>One thing that sucks is whatever person was holding the bill last is out that money. The bank won't give you credit for it which is unfortunate but understandable</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It happens.  Counterfeits can be really really good and very hard to detect by touch or a quick glance, and not everything is necessarily counted in a money counter at a bank before going back out to someone else.  Customers of banks receive counterfeits more often than you'd think.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once received a $5 note that had a strange color and feel to it with a slightly different design (in Australia) so i showed it to the manager and he thought it was strange too, even though it was only $5 because of policy or maybe law we had to inform the police.<br />
A couple cops came out and checked it and said it was legit, it was just really old variation.  </p>
<p>So based on that i would say they they take it fairly seriously that they would send someone to check it even if its $5.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason for that is that counterfeit notes circulate in bulk. No one makes only a handful of bills, and people who make the bills don't slowly disperse them. So when a 'single' counterfeit note appears, it generally means that someone just poured a lot of them into the local economy. In order to prevent the spread and catch the producers, authorities find single bills and try to trace the pattern.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Back before NZ changed the coin sizes in 2006, it was the same over here. You'd routinely see Australian 5c, 10c, and 20c coins. Being the exact same size and shape was the culprit, I imagine...</p></div>		</li>
