			<div class="markdown"><p>In actuality surface tension is a large factor in the way oceans behave but it’s contrary to how you might think. Surface tension is partially responsible for the bulges in water we call tides, gravity from the the sun and moon pulls on the water, because water is a polar molecule it has a weak attraction to other molecules of water, not only along its surface but in all directions that other molecules of water surround it. These bulges and depressions I’m the surface of the oceans are constantly migrating with the moon and suns path across the sky.
To further complicate a permanent depression in the surface of the water from forming the curvature of the earth is pulling everything into a sphere and ocean currents caused by uneven heating and cooling is constantly churning the ocean.</p></div>		</li>
