			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow, nice video. If he can hold the &quot;around the world&quot; trick for 1.5 hours straight (one full ISS orbit) it will be the first time that a Yoyo would go completely around the world while doing &quot;around the world.&quot; Probably.﻿</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Though if we had focused on yo yo technology and not space technology so as to do the &quot;around the world&quot; trick for 1.5 hours, we wouldn't have the space technology to fly around the world while doing it. It's quite the conundrum.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You would be shocked at how far yoyos have come. Not 1.5 hours but still longer than most people would think. I have hit 4 minutes and I am a beginner with a yoyo that isn't even close to the top. They have some crazy tricks now that would not have been possible 10 years ago do to yoyo advances.  If anyone is interested in where yoyos are now then head on over to /r/throwers </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That would obviously not be the same thing. The ISS orbits the center of the earth, that would be walking around the axis of the earth. The phrase 'around the world' is quite subjective, but clearly your idea violates the spirit of the record. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Do they actually get <em>pulled</em> into your upper body, or is it just the result of there being no gravity which usually pulls the fluids <em>away</em> from those areas?</p></div>		</li>
