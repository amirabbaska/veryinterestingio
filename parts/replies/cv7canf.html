			<div class="markdown"><p>That makes sense if memories are stored as an associative neural network, so that certain sensory and thought patterns retrieve whatever items are most closely associated with that pattern (the same way we use artificial neural networks for image classification, OCR, or speech recognition). If so, it would make sense that when learning a new language, initially adults would learn a new word by associating it with the equivalent word in their own language, but eventually, as they start using that word and link it conceptually with its associated representation, the word becomes more and more linked to the concept it represents, so now the concept can retrieve both languages' words. I'm guessing since kids don't necessarily have the word-concept link as tightly coupled, it's easier for them to associate more things with the same concept. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm curious, I spoke L1 as my main language until I was eighteen, L2 somewhat fluently, but not nearly to the same level. Then I moved countries. I only spoke my L1 maybe once a month, and I feel my L3 is my strongest by far. I speak, write, but not always pronounce to a native speaker level. L1 has suffered, a lot. I can't recall words very fast, and have to think what the word is in L3 first. Forget about L2, since I've not used it at all since immigrating, it may as well be a foreign language I only learned a few semesters.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence around showing that storing words regresses? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a pretty common phenomenon, called L1 attrition. If you assume a connectionist model where words are activated when they (or words related to them) are used, and you're using words in your L1 a lot less, you're gonna have more difficulty acting those words in the future. And if you couple that with the idea that when you're using one language the other(s) is inhibited, which basically functions as negative activation (very loosely speaking), you've got a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; situation - but not completely, it's unlikely that a language spoken for so long would completely disappear.</p>
<p>Edit: I'll see if I can find some specific sources for you on language attrition.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Quick Google search led me to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=7i8ZLfGKcjcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=language+attrition&amp;ots=vX2QB45AAp&amp;sig=iU5XDHgas70i0VTat5GcRn7nkhY#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">this book</a> which is pretty old but probably a good starting place.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've also heard all memory is physically distributed around the brain with multiple copies for redundancy.  So even at the physical level (as opposed to the network level) it is difficult to think of anything as related.</p></div>		</li>
