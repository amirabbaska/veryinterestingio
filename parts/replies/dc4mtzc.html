That site has it listed as a yes for it's behavior being able to be conditioned without natural parents and a yes for sufficient habitat. I thought that elephants relied on the matriarch knowing where to lead the herd but it sounds like they are opening up a new habitat area that doesn't have any elephants currently.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here is an old comment of mine that addresses common skepticism I see from people on this issue of de-extinction. I come off a little aggressive, but that wasn't my intention, it's just misdirected passion.</p>
<p>I think what it will boil down to is a few generations of mammoths living in a reserve in a semi-captive situation where they can learn under guidance from humans until they develop a distinct modern culture and can branch out on their own.</p>
<p>I was reacting to quotes in an article, if this looks confusing at all.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Even the most carefully assembled genetic profile isn’t sufficient to recover what extinction has obliterated. A genome is part of a species, not the species itself. Mammut americanum was an interacting population of creatures, the young ones learning what it was to be a mastodon from their mothers as they grew up to tear tree limbs and chaw through bark. Any recreated species would enter a world that has moved beyond it, lacking its original ecological niche and social structure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This argument tries to couple what is essentially culture with genes.  No they won't be the same, no they won't have knowledgeable parents to teach them the ways of their world, and no it doesn't matter.  The argument itself says that the world is different now, so they would need to learn new behaviors anyway.</p>
<p>Also the idea that, while there were about 14 known species of mammoths and mastodons, because this would not be an identical genetic copy of one specie that it's somehow not valuable.  <strong>EDIT- because likely CRISPR like technology will morph a modern elephants genome to an approximation of a mammoth's</strong> Elephants are incredibly successful creatures, and roamed nearly the entire planet until very recently.  The whole point is that whichever (of many constantly changing) forms they took they were very large impactors on environment, from grazing, clearing land or snow, fertilization (manure), seed dispersal, ect. All those niches would still be fulfillable by an approximation of one example of an entire order called Proboscidea.  </p>
<p>To me it's like saying you can't clone an ancient Mayan human because nobody would be able to teach it the ways of ancient Mayans culture and religion.  Well the world those religions applied to is very different and maybe no longer relevant to the modern Mayan anyway.  This argument would suggest these clones aren't ancient Mayan because they don't act like the ancients did.  But that's no different than a small group becoming isolated and developing distinct cultural norms and beliefs and customs.  Animal and human populations are stranded and isolated and lost all the time, and still grow, learn, breed, change, and survive.</p>
<p>No a cloned mammoth won't &quot;know&quot; how to be a mammoth, but with the effort put into cloning to begin with we should be willing to put in the effort to teach a very intelligent animal how to live in whatever environment applies now.</p>
<p>I'll also address another argument I hear a lot, that because of the loss of the micro-biome of the mammoth these will never be able to survive.  I won't pretend to understand such complicated and new science as the micro-biome but there are a lot potential solutions.  Firstly the micro-biome is seeded in most animals by mother's milk and occasionally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagia#Other_animals" target="_blank">coprophagia</a>, elephants already do this to be able to digest the local flora.  There are lots of instances of dogs and pigs being used to suckle completely different species, while I'm sure it's not ideal, the fact that they can survive on a different mammals milk at all and still be able to digest their normal food suggest it could be possible for modern elephants to suckle a mammoth without it dying.  Then there's scat, for a mammoth to digest tough (thinking tundra/taiga environment) plants and wood that modern elephants don't eat we could also try seeding a mammoths digestive track with bacteria from modern species that eat this.  Moose, bison, caribou, muskox, and elk combined eat almost anything that could be found in the environment, including wood.</p>
<p>I'm fine with the debate about weather or not it would be a good idea to resurrect them, and I'm clearly in the &quot;do-it&quot; group, but the idea that we are just going to make a useless, deformed elephant is not one I can accept.  It will be trial and error, and a lot of animals would make mistakes and probably die, but that’s exactly how Proboscidea spread across the world in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a worthy goal to de-extinction, but it is not to bring to life a single charismatic creature. Rather, it is to restart ecological interactions and cascades that have been damaged or gone dormant. The purpose of a reconstituted mastodon, then, would be not to revive a species but to kickstart a cascade that would increase the ecosystem’s overall diversity and health.</p>
<p>If we’re going to change the Earth, we might as well do so with care and intent. If it takes one human-tweaked species to create a better habitat for a dozen others, so be it. I don’t balk at the thought of an elephant genetically modified to act like a mastodon, scarfing down Osage oranges and honey locust pods to once again disperse their seeds across the landscape. But any revived species would be the beginning of something new, rather than the restoration of the old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want a revived mammoth species, but I'm not too concerned that it's identical, and I imagine at some point it would be looked at as it's own species, or a sub-species instead of an exact Mammuthus primigenius (or whatever species).  Similar to how most bison populations today have some domestic cow DNA from cross breeding, but I have no problem thinking of them as just bison instead of a hybrid.</p>
<p>Does it really have to be the exact same as a long dead mammoth? What was a mammoth in the first place?  They lived for millions of years, had many subspecies and relatives they appear to have interbred with, and they ranged from the west coast of Europe to eastern North America.  How genetically similar was a Spanish mammoth 5 million years ago to a Canadian mammoth from 13,000 years ago? Probably a great deal different, so why would it be disingenuous if a resurrected mammoth wasn’t genetically identical to one we find frozen in the tundra, but part asian elephant?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I guess I didn't really answer you question /u/fortylightbulbs:</p>
<p>As far as the current resurrection projects go a mammoth would likely be introduced to <a href="http://www.pleistocenepark.ru" target="_blank">Pleistocene Park</a> in northeast Russia. It's a private park owned by scientist Sergey Zimov that is trying to recreate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_steppe" target="_blank">Mammoth Steppe</a> ecosystem which was essentially a vast icy grassland that went from Spain to eastern Canada that was basically sculpted by the mammoths. At the time the animal biomass and plant productivity of the mammoth steppe were similar to today's African savannah.  </p>
<p>Pleistocene Park believes that recreating the Mammoth Steppe ecosystem could prevent the tundra's thawing and releasing massive amounts of methane into the atmosphere.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>According to research by Sergey Zimov there is about 750 gigatons of carbon in the atmosphere and about 1600 gigatons frozen in the permafrost.  Melting will be very bad for us all.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough though Zimov also has a hypothesis  on how to stop the permafrost from melting, and he's been researching and testing it himself since the 1980s or 1990s at a place he calls <a href="http://www.pleistocenepark.ru/en/" target="_blank">Pleistocene Park</a>.</p>
<p>The gist of it is that an insulating layer of snow through the winters prevent the permafrost from freezing solid enough to stay frozen all summer.  By reintroducing Serengeti-levels of grazers and browsers to these areas with very little large animal activity right now, they will root around and trample snow looking for food all winter and mess up the insulating blanket of snow that covers everything; allowing the permafrost to freeze more deeply.  By reintroducing massive amounts of large herbivores to the tundra you can convert the taiga and tundra back in to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_steppe" target="_blank">mammoth steppe</a> ecosystem that existed for millions of years, until about 10,000 years ago.  The steppe was biologically the most productive ecosystem on earth, and was absolutely massive, the permafrost now is more or less on top of hundreds of meters of compost from millions of years of grazers.  That is the carbon we want to prevent from releasing. </p>
<p>So without funding he's been stocking land in Siberia with bison, horses, muskox, elk, reindeer, moose, ect and restoring a grassland there.  Initial studies show that the temp of permafrost at a half-meter deep in winter was about -7C outside the park and -23C inside the park.</p>
<p>He wants to keep adding more animals and more land, he wants to add camels, asses, saiga; predators like wolves, tigers; and if it ever happens resurrected mammoths or other ice age animals.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/wO0wyICAAqg" target="_blank">Here is a good video explaining it all with more interesting information.</a></p>
<p>There are lots of papers he has written, <a href="http://www.pleistocenepark.ru/en/materials/" target="_blank">some of which are available on the website with a lot more detail</a>.  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene_Park" target="_blank">The wikipedia also breaks down the science simply.</a></p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does a mammoth really need to know how to be a mammoth? Wouldn't knowing how to be a hairy elephant be good enough? Really all we are interested in is a mammoth that looks like a mammoth considering that we know a mammoth's characteristics are similar to an elephant's. Same goes for the Mayans, we would not be cloning them to gather information from their history because all newborns start with a clean slate. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it (I don't have a source for this, but it is something I've read in the recent past), one of the bigger hesitancies I've heard related to deextinction of animals (e.g., thr mammoth) is that we've come to understand more profoundly in recent years the importance of the microbiome to multicellular organisms. </p>
<p>Non-human microbes of various types make up around 4 lbs. of the average person's body mass and yet in that mass are microbe cells that outnumber the number of our human cells many times over. And we've barely scratched the surface of understanding all the symbiotic relationships we carry or the impact of imbalances of those cultures. </p>
<p>Additionally, we know these microbiomes vary from species to species. So while an African elephant may well be capable of acting as surrogate to a mammoth embryo, there's no guarantee that it would survive bring brought to term much less as an independent organism as we know nether about the microbiomes of that species and how similar or different it was from that of an elephant.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is some progress with artificial wombs. There are a team of researchers in Australia &amp; Japan working on them for humans, I went to one of their talks. The focus wasn't for an entire artificial pregnancy but more as a place to put the baby when the pregnancy isn't viable anymore. Like if the mother has problems that would normally result in an aborted pregnancy or an extremely premature birth.</p>
<p>They obviously can't test it on humans so they are working on sheep. They managed to keep the fetus alive 27 hours (with some problems). It might not seem like much but it's a pretty big deal and just the first steps. If they can get it to about 5-10 weeks they could make a huge difference in the outcomes for babies. This is one of the papers they published: <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140701" target="_blank">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0140701</a></p></div>		</li>
