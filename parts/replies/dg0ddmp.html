			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah. And if you include facial and body hair it can be in patches too. (I have blond, red, and brown hair in my head hair, mustache and goatee is all red, and my cheek hair is all brown.)</p>
<p>Actually, our head and facial hair lines are also indicative of the way there are &quot;zones&quot; on the skin that in other species could have expressions of different colors. But as /u/accaris says, not only did humans not need that kind of camouflaging pattern variation, you'd need to go a few common ancestors back before you found one that did.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks similar, but piebaldism starts way early in embryonic development with issues related to neural crest cell migration (when an organism is pretty much just a tube of barely-differentiated cells)--- the melanocytes just never get to work making pigment in the white patches. Vitiligo involves formerly &quot;normal&quot; cells ceasing to produce pigment, and people can develop vitiligo as late as midlife. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to that, it might be  an issue of co-dominance vs a dominant and recessive relationship? Only one allele may be expressed in human hair color, the dominant one. While both light hair and dark hair alleles may be equally dominant, and therefore, both get expressed in dogs. Resulting in multicolor patches. </p></div>		</li>
