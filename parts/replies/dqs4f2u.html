<p>But yeah, you have to eat it (or, more commonly, have it shoveled down your throat via a nasogastric tube) to get the effect. And it's not, like, a fun process.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speaking from personal experience, when doctors use charcoal to suck up toxins, you aren't in a good place. I had an incident, let's leave it at that, where EMTs forced liquid charcoal down my throat. It works when you can keep it down, but if you can't, the ambulance looks like a goth exorcism. Also I'm in a much better place 10 years later. DM me if you're in a dark place and need to talk. I'm here for you. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Here's a list of ingested poisons that activated charcoal is NOT effective for (per UpToDate):</p>
<p>Arsenic, Lead, Mercury, Iron, Zinc, Cadmium, Lithium, Sodium, Calcium, Potassium, Magnesium, Fluoride, Iodide, Boric acid, Acids &amp; Alkalis, Alkanes, Alkenes, Alkyl halides, Aromatic hydrocarbons, Acetone, Ethanol, Ethylene glycol, Isopropanol, Methanol, Essential oils.</p>
<p>So... heavy metals and alcohol are explicitly things it is not useful for absorbing.</p>
<p>As for things that can be treated with it - some medications &amp; biological poisons MAY be removed from the stomach with activated charcoal, but the evidence for its use is not great. Activated charcoal also has no utility if the ingested poison has already absorbed into the body; the point is to block absorption of a poison, not to draw a poison out from tissues it already soaked into. I would be very suspicious about the utility of activated charcoal in cosmetic products for all of the reasons above.</p></div>		</li>

Also personal care products, especially women’s shampoos and lotions, have some new random fruit or plant extract in them in every commercial I see.

I'm an EMT and we give activated charcoal for all kinds of poisoning emergencies, just not those involving an alkali or acid ingestion. We find this out by calling poison control and then make a decision. It should be the same case in the ER.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not a doctor...but almost certainly not. It won't adsorb the alcohol that made you drunk in the first place and by the next day there isn't any alcohol left in your stomach for it to adsorb anyway. Eating some activated charcoal would just leave you vomiting up a black mess. The only things I know that help are drinking water when you drink alcohol (so you don't get too dehydrated in the first place), aspirin and rest. </p></div>		</li>
