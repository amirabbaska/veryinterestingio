			<div class="markdown"><p>They used base 12 because its much easier to divide into whole numbers compared to base 10.  This is probably why weve maintained a base 12 system for circles because its extremely easy to divide it up, more so than base 10.</p></div>		</li>

I understood the video and it might come in handy next time.</p>
<p>What confused me was the term knuckles. As far as I knew we only have 1 per finger. I had no idea the others were also called knuckles. In Spanish the sections would be &quot;falanges&quot;</p></div>		</li>
