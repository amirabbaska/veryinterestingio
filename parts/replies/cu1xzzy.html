<p>This was fun but also extremely challenging; mainly because of the many, many different ways Daylight Savings Time is implemented in different countries and time zones. And this was in pre-Wikipedia days, so even finding accurate information about that wasn't nearly as easy as it is today.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Plus the fact that there's already plenty of libraries and probably even a few APIs for that. Your own code probably isn't going to be better than those. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Days and years don't really have anything to do with each other. If we don't add a whole day at once, our clocks go out of sync with what we call days. You'd have essentially the exact same problem like we already have with the calendar shifting from year to year, but with the hours on your clock shifting through the days.</p>
<p>If you want to add 3 days every 400 years using leap seconds every year, you need to add roughly 10 minutes every year, 1-2 seconds every day (86'400 * 3 / 400 = 648 s/y). So after a few years, when your clock says it's 12:00, the sun isn't at it's highest point in the sky anymore, but already past, like it is today at 13:00. A few more years, and 12:00 will be around sunrise, and decades later, 12:00 will be when the sun sets, until after 133 years, you're back at 12:00 beeing when the sun is at the highest point in the sky, <del>and you've added one day</del>.</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, I should say you now <strong><em>avoided</em></strong> adding the <em>days</em> to the calendar, but instead you've added enough <em>seconds</em> to the days. So instead of your calender beeing broken, you've broken time. This is because days and years don't really have anything to do with each other. Earths rotation and it's orbit around the sun are completly detached from one another. Whatever you do, syncing them will be messy, but adding days is by far the easiest way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Leap years are a correction because Earth's rotation about its axis (a day) does not occur an exact integer number of times within one Earth revolution around the Sun. That's been explained elsewhere very well.</p>
<p>Leap seconds are a bit different. Those come about because of our highly accurate atomic clocks, and the not quite so consistent Earth's rotation. See, earthquakes and other large scale events can actually cause the solar day to not be exactly the same amount each day. We take the solar day to be noon to noon because noon is easy enough to measure. If we didn't correct our highly precise atomic clocks, which form the basis for our cell phone clocks and other similar centralized systems, they would begin to read noon when the sun was not at its highest point in the sky. We'd get time of day drift, similar to how we'd get seasonal drift without leap year. But this is much less predictable than leap year. Leap seconds are random, based on events we can't predict that affect the Earth's rotation. We just wait until errors add up to a certain point then declare a leap second.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Since the recent explosion in Tianjin, China, registered in the Richter scale, does that mean it [could have] affected the length of the solar day by a measurable amount? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good argument. It's partially to do with orders of magnitude as well, right?</p>
<p>On that line of reasoning as well, does special relatively play a role in adjusting our time, or is surface proper time used for everything and space stuff (eg satellites) adjusted to our time?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If they were in some way predictable, they would be. </p>
<p>However, whether or not we have a leap second depends on how fast the Earth spins, and how fast the Earth spins depends on tidal friction, earthquakes, mudslides, movement of the tectonic plates weather patterns, meteorite strikes, even &quot;tiny&quot; things like shipping coal, oil and other cargo around the surface of the planet.  Each of these things speeds up or slows down the Earth's rotation, and over several months or years, these random influences can add up to the Earth's rotation being out of phase with atomic clocks.  </p>
<p>The  International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service keeps track of this and adds or subtracts a second occasionally in order to keep the clocks in sync.</p></div>		</li>
