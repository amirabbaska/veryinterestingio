			<div class="markdown"><p>They are supported by taxes. The purpose of transit is to make the city work, not to make money directly. </p>
<p>For example, It’s better for the city to enable more people to get into, out of, and around the city without driving even if it costs money. The economy benefits from better access to labor, the streets are less congested and worn down, and property values go up because of better connection to the city shopping, industry, etc. </p>
<p>From a sim-city point of view, transit allows your city to grow larger and more dense, while increase taxes overall, even though it costs some money.</p>
<p>Gotta spend money to make... cities. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Just thinking through my fingers here but is there a reason trains aren't done the same?</p>
<p>We could build a common gauge of rail, then let x number of trains from different operators run on the same routes, perhaps with some passing lanes built in to mitigate conflict, and then have competition enter the scene. Has this been tried and failed?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is pretty much exactly the pre-1950s transit system in the US, which was dominated by trains.</p>
<p>The problem is the rise of transit systems with clear advantages: the automobile (maximum flexibility) and jets (maximum speed), meaning the US rail system imploded in the 1950s and 1960s. Amtrak was put together as the government keeping a handful of key routes alive, but the vast majority of passenger train routes simply couldn't keep the ridership.</p>
<p>Train networks still work in Europe and Japan,  since congestion means cars are awkward and the small scales of inter-city distance means trains are comparable in time to airline security, boarding, and the physical flight. The same combination holds in the Northeast (hence Acela doing well), but most of the US is big and (relatively) sparsely populated, which is poison for rail travel.</p>
<p>I love train travel, but the economics just aren't workable for much of the US.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Tell me about it. In Phoenix the city was completely built on transportation in cars. I live 17 miles from my job and it takes me 18-20 minutes in my car to get to the office. Public transportation or bike (per google maps) would take me 1hr30m. </p></div>		</li>
