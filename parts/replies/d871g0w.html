<p>Our voices may sound different to us, due to the sound traveling from the vocal cord to your ear drums via mostly vibration through your head. </p>

<p>Oh that is interesting. I didn't know that this was actually true that we hear our own voice differently and now there is a scientific explanation. TIL</p>
<p>I guess this would also explain why we think recordings of our own voice sounds different.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are a lot of different factors that make up the character of a sound. Tone, timbre, and dynamics are the fundamentals but these are often discussed in different nuanced ways and sometimes interchangeably. Tone does not vary from inner to perceived voice, period (assuming no crazy things like Doppler effect). Timbre and dynamics can change considerably from recording to recording, through the &quot;inner&quot; perceived voice, etc. </p></div>		</li>
