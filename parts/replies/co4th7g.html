			<div class="markdown"><p>Taking the number of photoreceptor cells as the number of &quot;pixels&quot; might be a bit  misleading. Already in the retina the information is processed by many converging (and cross-talking) cells and networks. Thus nowhere in the nervous system there is a representation of an &quot;image&quot; that would be composed of as many data points as there are photoreceptor cells. But if you were to somehow dissect all the photoreceptor cells, measure their individual outputs and map them to an image, I guess you would get a 100+ million pixel image, although I'm not familiar enough with the matter to know if that would happen (or if the image would make any sense).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You could say the same for digital images. Whether it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Discrete_cosine_transform" target="_blank">DCT transformations</a> in JPEG images, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayer_filter" target="_blank">bayer filters</a> in CCDs, the measure of “pixels” is often a bit misleading.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you move your eyes and sweep those pixels I believe it is called &quot;Sub-pixel image localization&quot; which is a type of superresolution. It's a method of getting an image of higher resolution from a device of a lower resolution.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Rods and cones are only half the story, the optic nerve is the other half that needs to be taken into consideration. From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_nerve" target="_blank">wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The optic nerve is composed of retinal ganglion cell axons and glial cells. Each human optic nerve contains between 770,000 and 1.7 million nerve fibers,[1] which are axons of the retinal ganglion cells of one retina. In the fovea, which has high acuity, these ganglion cells connect to as few as 5 photoreceptor cells; in other areas of retina, they connect to many thousand photoreceptors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that the total amount of cone cell data streaming to the brain at any moment in time for each eye is perhaps 0.6 - 1.5 million color values. (The rods are going to be the ones that are bunched into thousands of links)</p></div>		</li>
