			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s extremely annoying. However you can fight back! </p>
<p>Report the ad (as prohibited or misleading content) or hide it. When that happens enough the ad creator sees a decrease in relevance score which makes the ad more expensive to run and will eventually drive delivery to a crawl.</p>
<p>Bonus: high negative feedback flags the ad for human review. When an ad reviewer sees the manipulation they will pull the ad for policy.</p>
<p>EDIT
if it’s not an ad hide the content, filter out the content creator’s content from your feed or report it. </p>
<p>Just click the three little dots in the upper right hand corner of the post. You can often choose to hide the content, hide all from content creator, give feedback on the post (my personal favorite) and then choose to report the post after you’ve given feedback. My favorite choice  is SPAM.</p>
<p>Facebook’s algorithm doesn’t like to serve content —organic or paid— that annoys users of Facebook. Content that habitually gets hidden or reported will, over time, see reach crater. The content creator will then be encouraged to not post annoying content (or find another channel)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be honest, I'm not for sure, but it wouldn't shock me if it's a watermark for whatever program they are using to turn the image into a video. I'm assuming if they didn't want that watermark, they'd have to pay full price for a software license.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. They have to have something moving in the video or they are in violation of Facebooks TOS so they added it on top of a still image on purpose.
Much more likely is that the moving triangle overlay is a free option provided by the video editing software used by many publishers.</p></div>		</li>
