			<div class="markdown"><p>Just weighing in to confirm that this is the correct answer. Any answer on this thread that doesn't mention subitizing has missed the mark. (Edit: previous comment was buried at the bottom of the thread at the time I wrote that. It's, uh, no longer buried)</p>
<p>What's interesting is that many animal species also can subitize up to 4, and, rarely, 5. Not just primates but also horses, rodents, many birds, etc. This has led to a theory that subitizing up to 4 - near-instantaneous recognition of quantities of 1, 2, 3, or 4 objects - may be an evolutionarily ancient feature encoded into the vertebrate visual system. </p>
<p>I just linked to a great review on the animal literature in another AskScience thread a few days ago; I will link it here as soon as I'm off my phone.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. This is a great point. I didn't want to get into the animal literature since I thought my answer might already be too broad. But along those lines, there is an interesting parallel that <a href="http://alvarezlab.com/George/pdfs/Alvarez_Franconeri_JOV_2007.pdf" target="_blank">George Alvarez has uncovered in object tracking, namely that we can visually track up to four objects in parallel, as long as we get only two in each visual field (e.g. two on the left, two on the right)</a>. This is very consistent with your statement about it being evolutionarily ancient.</p>
<p>It's weird really how often that number four pops up in cognition, in subitizing, in visual tracking, <a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/journals/cd/19_1_inpress/Cowan_final.pdf?q=the-recall-of-information-from-working-memory" target="_blank">in the capacity of working memory</a>, etc., suggesting it may be something like an ancient psychological body plan (similar to how all mammals have 5 fingers, or some sort of variant of that, or there is evidence that they used to at least if they have evolved hoofs or something else).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This jives more with what I know I'm doing.  I can recognize five things without counting, without noting that it's a group of 3 and a group of 2 and then adding them, if the group of five looks like this:  <a href="http://www.math-only-math.com/images/five-apples.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.math-only-math.com/images/five-apples.jpg</a></p>
<p>A row of three and a row of two below it, and I know instantly that it is five without counting or adding.  It just LOOKS like five.</p>
<p>However, a single row of them (like this: <a href="http://www.chilimath.com/basicmath/counting/images1/counting%20objects.gif" target="_blank">http://www.chilimath.com/basicmath/counting/images1/counting%20objects.gif</a>) or a jumble (like this: <a href="http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/cinco-ma%C3%A7%C3%A3s-11605366.jpg" target="_blank">http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/x/cinco-ma%C3%A7%C3%A3s-11605366.jpg</a>) requires more thought.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is where the operational definition of subtilizing starts to fall apart. Some researchers use response time as the determiner if someone is subtilizing or counting, which appears to be the case of the paper you cited. It would be better for research purposes if subtilizing was instead defined by some specific cognitive process. Which I would predict does not occur for more than 4 items. 5 or more items being enumerated quickly would be a memory process, e.g., recognizing a pattern. Subitizing is not a memory process, it's at least to a large degree perceptual.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. This is often something cultural relativists like to point to when saying cultures are infinitely variable, but this claim doesn't hold up when you understand the psychology and the history. The fact that counting has been independently invented many times shows that all people are capable of counting, and the historical circumstances for where counting systems have arisen show that the reason there is cultural variation here is due to the varying needs of different groups of people. That is, the underlying psychology is universal, but the cultural manifestations vary in very predictable ways.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>The human mind has two systems for representing numbers: a subitizing system for numbers up to four[1] , and an approximate ratio estimation system for larger numbers. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Careful not to use &quot;number&quot; and &quot;numerosity&quot; interchangeably. What you wrote is true, but for numerosities and not for number symbols.</p>
<p>It's also the case that &quot;large&quot; numbers -- that is numbers outside the subitizing range, are <em>enumerated</em> via counting, not using the approximate number system (ANS). More generally, subitizing and counting are used for enumerating the size/cardinality of a set, whereas the ANS is used to compare which of two (largish) sets is greater or lesser.</p>
<p>Finally, in studies that measure the subitizing range of individuals, 4 might the the modal estimate but there is interesting variance. In fact, there is evidence that the size of one's subitizing range predicts their math achievement more generally:</p>

<p>Also, thanks for clarifying the terminology for anyone who's more technical in the area. </p></div>		</li>
