			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly. Higher pressure means you can have louder sounds. So in the ocean for example you can have much louder sounds then 192dB. Where this is evident is in rocketry where the higher pressure in the pressure chamber of a rocket can create much louder noise. When this sound gets out into the ambient air the sound crackles as if it were recorded on a bad microphone. However it is not the microphone which can not support the sound levels but the air itself. As the rocket ascends the sound of the crackles changes as the maximum volume gets lower and lower. And as you know when you reach the vacuum of space the loudest sound possible is close to silence.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That seems.... Incomplete. Air pressure can easily go over 2 atmospheres when the sound/vibration is created by something moving or creating (via chemical reaction for example, such as a rocket engine) sufficient quantity of &quot;air&quot; (more correctly gas(es), no one said the sound would be safe to breath). IIRC, a Saturn V launch was measured at 204DB, but on looking it up I'm seeing one figure citing 220DB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In that situation, yes, the sound could be louder, but that seems covered by the &quot;at sea level&quot; disclaimer. </p>
<p>The moment the sound leaves the area with higher pressure or chemicals, the sound would be capped at 194 decibels again. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So does that mean that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa" target="_blank">1883 eruption of Krakatoa</a>, which &quot;is estimated to have reached 310 dB&quot;, could only have reached 310dB through media other than the atmosphere? Perhaps, it was 310dB through the dense magma in Earth's crust that could sustain higher pressure oscillations, but was definitely only 194dB through the air?</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Sound dissipates with distance no matter how loud the origin sound is so that statement seems sort of.... pointless? The better question is how do higher pressure peaks impact actual sound dissipation from what you would expect from the inverse square law, if they effect it at all. </p></div>		</li>
