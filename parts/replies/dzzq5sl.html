			<div class="markdown"><p>I think this is the core of the issue. If the matter/antimatter imbalance were a statistical fluke, it's much more probably we'd see a universe with matter regions and antimatter regions, or perhaps even a universe with just our own galaxy in a void. We don't see that, instead we see a universe that's mostly matter everywhere.</p>
<p>It's still <em>possible</em> the matter/antimatter imbalance is a fluke, but it's so unlikely that physicists will look for a better theory to explain it.</p>
<p>PS: As for how such statistical flukes could occur, it would be caused by the distribution of matter and antimatter when they are being created and annihilated, such that a little more matter moves into some region of space.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's always a bit scary to me that in 100 billion years, thanks to the accelerating expansion, that'll be pretty much the case; just our galaxy (merged with Andromeda by that point) and a few dwarf galaxies orbiting it with everything else so far away and redshifted so much that it'll be observationally indistinguishable from being surrounded by an empty infinite void, and if you travelled out into that void, you'd never reach another galaxy, and past a certain point you'd never be able to return to our galaxy, you'd just be adrift in infinite darkness, the only object in your own personal observable universe.  </p>
<p>Imagine being a civilisation that arises on a planet orbiting a star that's been ejected from it's galaxy in the far distant future; by the time life evolves and your civilisation develops telescopes, the only thing in the entire universe that you can see is one single galaxy, billions of light years away, utterly impossible to ever reach, and one lonely star lost in the void.  There are as many stars in the space between galaxies as there are in galaxies themselves due to the frequency with which objects get thrown out by gravitational interactions, so it's a likely scenario.</p></div>		</li>

Which scientific breakthroughs might a future civilization miss out on if their observable universe is truly just one galaxy?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In astrophysics you have to make assumptions of the universe in order for things to work, called the Cosmological Principle. They say that the universe is homogeneous (matter is spread uniformly on a large scale, with galaxy clusters and superclusters occuring all around the universe) and isotropic (the universe is the same in all directions, there's no edge, center, or preferential area of the universe). These together tell us that we have to assume that what we see is what there must be in the large scale, otherwise scientific methods just couldn't be used (since for all we know, we could a statistically improbable part of the universe otherwise).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are these actually good assumptions to make? How do we know that matter density gradients don't exist? Couldn't they be so gradual that they aren't observable across the scale of the observable universe? If the universe outside what we can observe is many orders of magnitude bigger than what we can observe, it doesn't seem like too much of a stretch to think a non-homogenous universe might appear homogenous when looking at a small sample, kind of like how a curved surface can seem flat if you look at a small area and don't have perfect tools.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's a reason why this assumption is made, though.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Additionally, it doesn't have to be an assumption. Even if we allow that as a solution; i.e that the extent of our observable universe is completely asymmetric in favour of matter and that outside of it there are regions with anti-matter, that's still something we would need to explain and understand.</p>
<p>What could cause an asymmetry on the scale of our observable universe is just as interesting a problem.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that is a bad answer. You hear the same thing when it comes to the dark matter issue, this idea that whether or not we NEED something to be true should be the deciding factor in determining its truth, and that a lack of actual evidence shouldn't matter.</p>
<p>Do you have a better defense than &quot;its true because it makes my model work&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want that to be the case you now have to come up with a mechanism which would generate matter anti-matter asymmetry in at least observable universe sized bubbles. To me this seems somewhat contrived and I'd rather look for a mechanism that generates the universe we observe, rather than one we don't.</p></div>		</li>
