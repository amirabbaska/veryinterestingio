			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting. In my mind I see it as words have no real meaning outside the ones we give (they are just sounds after all) so that in repetition of words without any inherent meaning we’re able to see the true nature of our words as empty</p>

For anyone interested, Terence McKenna gives an excellent bit about language in this video</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Last night my 9yo was reading over my shoulder as I read the ELI5 thread on innie and outie belly buttons. He immediately complained that it said &quot;explain like I'm 5&quot;, and he didn't understand it, and he was 9. I laughed.</p></div>		</li>
