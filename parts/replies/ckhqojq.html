			<div class="markdown"><p>No. Three kinds of tolerance are generally recognized: pharmacokinetic (metabolic tolerance, factors affecting the distribution and elimination of the drug through and from the body's tissues), pharmacodynamic (cellular changes, e.g. changes in receptor densities &amp; sensitivities, compensation of other NT, NM systems, etc. ) and behavioral tolerance (e.g. conditioned compensatory responses &amp; other effects related to Pavlovian and operant conditioning). The 3 tolerance are acquired at different rates and abate at different rates (and to different extents). Withdrawal side-effects are not equally caused by all 3 tolerances. For example, simply not drinking coffee for 21 days will affect pharmacodynamic tolerance to a great extent but behavioral tolerance to little or no extent. In contrast, switching from regular to decaf would still impact pharmacodynamic tolerance, but would also have an effect on behavioral tolerance due to extinction of at least some of the conditioned stimuli acquired while drinking caffeinated coffee. Reacquisition of tolerance tends to be more rapid than first tolerance at least in part because of a well known finding in the extinction literature called rapid reacquisition. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I understood this from a more human perspective after I heard an alcoholic say that he thought of his addiction like a moss growing on a rock.  Drinking was like watering the moss; the moss grows, slowly but surely, if kept watered.  If the watering stops , the moss will dry up and turn brown, but it is still there, and as soon as it is watered again (i.e., as soon he starts drinking again), it turns brown to green overnight, and the addiction is at nearly the same level he left it.  </p>
<p>He felt as if he never left his addition behind; it was still crusted and brown on his brain, waiting to revive given the slightest chance, even though he had not had a drink in many years.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I imagine there is a large body of research on this topic as it pertains to chemical abuse and dependency? As someone who has stopped drinking and heard a lot of advice from counselors, it's interesting to think about how this gels with conventional wisdom on alcohol abuse.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In terms of pharmacodynamic changes such as receptor numbers and sensitivity, these changes typically occur more over a period of weeks. For example, if you start an anti-depressant, the onset of effect will typically be within the first 6 weeks. Whether this can be generalized to other drugs (such as caffeine) that act on different receptors, I don't believe has been studied, but theoretically the same concept may apply.</p></div>		</li>
