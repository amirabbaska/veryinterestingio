			<div class="markdown"><p>This is more relevant than ever because it's how Chinese and Indian (primarily) designer drug companies develop many of their drugs to evade the DEA.  They usually either find an obscure compound investigated and abandoned in the 60s-80s and use that (Clonazolam for instance if I recall or U4770), take a compound that is prescription in the former USSR but never investigated in the west (like, say, emoxypine or tianeptine, both antidepressants not scheduled in the US).</p>
<p>Or most often they take.a drug of abuse and they run it through a library reaction-- sub a halogen for a methyl (flourofentanyl, flouro-phenidate), sub one halogen for another (iodo-fentanyl, chloro-phencyclidine derivatives), sub one group for another (ethyl- and isopropyl- phenidate), and so on).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, that's what I was getting at. It's not the be-all and end-all of drug development (by far) but I thought it would be relatively easy to understand. I don't actually know how you take a completely new drug (maybe tamoxifen would be a good example?) and begin testing. I can only imagine the shitfight that would be. </p>
<p>I wish I could be trying out these new compounds (on other people) - but I need to finish my chemistry degree, first...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Or you could move to India... But I can't officially recommend that.</p>
<p>As to novel compounds there aren't a ton in use right now or in trials.  Genetic treatment is the next big wave-- monoclonal antibodies, CRISPR, and so on.  </p>
<p>For a good example of a current use not in the designer drug market of library reactions you can look at the setron family of anti-emetics.</p>
<p>Ondansetron was a revolution in treatment, especially chemotherapy prophylaxis for nausea, especially because it replaced The atypical antipsychotics used for anti-emetics prior.  And those had massive, potentially permenent side effects and were too dangerous to use in pregnancy because of tetratoxicity.</p>
<p>They have fairly recently developed a huge family of drugs looking for faster onset, longer duration and so on using ondansetron as a pilot compound.</p></div>		</li>
