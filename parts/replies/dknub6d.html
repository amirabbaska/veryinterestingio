			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to add on to your answer a little bit, although my answer only takes into account a single chain store. I'm not a professional as you are but I do work at HEB, Texas' largest grocery store behind Walmart and a pretty good example of a brilliant business plan. Just a disclaimer, I respect the company as a whole for it's success and sheer presence. I did before I started working here and still do after. Just cause I work here doesn't mean I'm brainwashed into loving it but I after working for a year here I still manage to respect the company as a whole despite some shortcomings that I think need massive improvements very quickly.</p>
<p>Anyway. We've got just about every single dry or frozen food item in one of three store brand categories, Hill Country Fair, HEB own brand, and Central Market by HEB - where HCF&lt;HEB&lt;Central Market in general terms of cost and quality. Some items you can't find national brand equivalents and you especially find what would normally be a specialty item sitting on a shelf under the Central Market or HEB brand. </p>
<p>HEB accomplished this by building their own competing factories here in Texas. We've got a massive bread factory for just about every corn/wheat food item, Ice Cream/dairy factory for products from 1.5 gallon artificially flavored vanilla to 1 pint specialty small batch Whiskey Honey icecream, and a smattering of multi-purpose factories for everything else. We use Texas native farms and ranches to source our own brand food items and get direct from the source for produce, meat, and honey. We've also got an absolutely massive warehouse/distribution center in San Antonio and a couple smaller ones throughout the state as well. We still have plenty of national brands like Kellogs, Kraft, Nabisco, Blue Bell, Nestle, etc. However we can compete directly from manufacturing to distribution to advertisements to how prominent the product is on the shelves in a way that many stores cannot. That's the most important part of it. Some items are still in one of the categories that OP mentioned - one factory making several brands, especially canned products and I suspect a good amount of Central Market specialty items. However for the most part we control every aspect of a product and have a clear advantage because of that in both profit margins and presence. </p>
<p>I don't think every store can do the same as HEB; Mr. Butt definitely had a vision for this company. He purchased land all over Texas many years ago and just builds to the companies needs on existing property. For instance the company is trying to expand to Dallas. They already have the land purchased, and have had it for years, and it's just sitting there waiting for the permits to build whatever they need. I believe the same goes for the factories and distro centers, once we needed them they where just built on existing land. Mind you I'm not a high level employee by any means but I've got to sit through meetings that go over the history and operations of the company while racking up OT so I try to pay attention. </p>
<p>I hope it helps people understand a little bit. I'm pretty sure HEB is unique in the aspect of &quot;let's just build our own everything and compete directly&quot; rather than sharing space throughout the process of manufacturing to the shelf though, but it is a brilliant idea for marketing store brand products over national brand. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HEB is a diamond in the rough. Everyone at my company idolizes you. The only downside is that it's a hard model to scale. The larger you become, the harder it is to maintain that quality and standardization nationally. Your post was very informative for me, thank you!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's a really great company to work for. Store to store varies, for instance my store treats it's night stockers like myself as bad as Walmart does. We're regularly top in sales and our regular trucks that get us out on time are other stores 10-12 hour shifts so I can sort of see why my manager is so tough. I know two people that wanted to transfer to another store while keeping their position that ended up going in on a promotion because we just have much more responsibilities than the average store. Our slowest part timers can run the department at the store down the street. Not only that but I'm making more here than I would in an office with my Associates degree backing me up. </p>
<p>The company as a whole is pretty great and I really admire it's business strategy and just how successful it is. I do agree though, if we leave Texas it's gonna go way down in quality very quickly. It works because it's relatively small. We do have some stuff in Mexico but I can't speak for those across the border. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>HEB has amazing store brands to the point where we recommend some of them to friends over national brands. Combo fucking Loco is just stupid good frosting on the cake when they're trying to entice me to but the store brands I already prefer for a even lower price. </p>
<p>I don't gush over things often, but Texas has it made with HEB. Please, let us be selfish and stay Texas only. Get any bigger and I feel it'll all be wrecked.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Agreed, 100 percent. I could never live anywhere without an HEB. Think about how much of your life is spent at the grocery store -- and they just don't get better than HEB.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm; got back from HEB about an hour ago.  I spent about $50 on non-produce groceries, and maybe 3 items weren't HEB brand.  </p>
<p>Whenever I have out of state visitors, I obtain informed consent before taking them to HEB Plus (or the original Whole Foods) - it's a sight to see, but you will never again walk into your native grocery store without a little heaviness in your heart.</p></div>		</li>

<p>The best example of SMUs are TVs. Walmart and Best Buy are shown an entirely different lineup of TVs by Samsung. Both retailers might have an item with identical features except for the number of HDMI inputs. This allows them to promote and discount their items independently without having a price war.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fun fact, also allows both to offer &quot;price match guarantees&quot; while never actually having to do it - SKU's are different, model numbers are slightly different, and as you said - one small feature will be different.</p>
<p>Not an exact match. No price match for you. Source: Did a stint at Best Buy before finding a real job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, many brands like Samsung will have a UMRP or MAP pricing policy that (some would say illegally) tells retailers the minimum that they can charge for an item. By making an SMU, national brands with these policies will typically let the retailer ignore them for that one item.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: Hijacking my own post just to say this. The next time you have a bad experience at a big box store, please remember that some of the people at corporate are Redditors just like you, with student loans, a mortgage, and two golden retrievers at home, who are just trying to do their best and get by. Nothing makes me happier than knowing I made a customer happy with a cool item that I found and brought to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This edit is perhaps the most important thing that humanity seems to miss out on. They want to trash everyone and forget that everyone else is a person just like them. They have feelings, struggles, and issues just like them. </p>
<p>There is a lack of compassion and a desire to separate themselves to create some form of &quot;Other&quot; that they can blame for today's problems. It appears mentally and emotionally lazy.</p>
<p>Thanks for the writeup. That Samsung thing was an issue for me once as it's impossible to price match something that ONLY BestBuy can possibly have in a minor model number revision of a product. </p></div>		</li>
