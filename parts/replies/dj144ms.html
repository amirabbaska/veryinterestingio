			<div class="markdown"><p>Nazis never reversed the swastika. It is a myth.  Rather they used both the left and right facing Swastika as was appropriate according to symmetry.

<p>Further, the Nazi use of the Swastika only changed the meaning in the Western mind. In India, it is considered an ancient auspicious symbol and you will see it everywhere.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all non-Japanese East Asians (Koreans, Chinese, Vietnamese, even Filippino to some extent) hate the Rising Sun for the same reason Swastika is hated. It is a symbol of atrocity, massacre, and colonialism.</p>
<p>Swastika is also a very old symbol, and it is still a major feature of many Buddhist temples in the east. Saying the Rising Sun is okay because of its roots is an extremely crappy argument.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Context is important.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The context of the Japanese use of the Rising Sun is that they view the colonial period with nostalgia, and the &quot;roots&quot; of the symbol becomes a meaningless argument as much as Swastika's origin not being important in the context of Nazism. This is the problem the OP is pointing out with his question.</p>
<p>Asians do not have any issue with Macedonians flaunting it in their national flag either, so it is not like they are hating it with no regard to context.</p></div>		</li>
