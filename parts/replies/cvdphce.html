			<div class="markdown"><p>I have a question, I am fully supportive of abortion, but many republican friends I have say that before Roe vs Wade, abortion wasn't in the constitution, and the supreme court can only rule on constitutional issues, therefore they didn't have the right to put it in there.  Can someone give me a good explanation that would make sense to all these pro life people telling me these things?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They have the right to interpret the law, but the legislature has the right to make new laws that overturn their decision and the executive can choose to not enforce it. The court is not by design or in practice the most powerful branch of government. </p>
<p>An example: They repeatedly stressed the right to own slaves, however the executive and legislature disagreed, and he we are</p>
<p>I side with them on some and against them on others, but you can hardly argue they had ever had the final say. </p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>The constitution puts limits on what rights the government can restrict. The legislature can restrict or remove rights as they will, as long as this doesn't overstep the limits imposed by the constitution.</p>
<p>Your statement isn't incorrect, it's just a bit overly broad. You don't have the right to take your neighbors stuff, and there are laws that specify that. Those laws are perfectly constitutional.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The justification of &quot;regulating commerce&quot; is bullshit, of course. If I grew pot in my backyard, and nobody used it but me, exactly what does that have to do with interstate commerce? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so my question on all these things usually comes back to the commerce clause part. My (limited) understanding of the precedent here is that any commerce is considered interstate commerce (like, my lemonade stand is in my state but because you might not be able to get lemonade as cheaply in your state so you come to my state to buy my lemonade which has in impact on the lemonade economy in your state, hence interstate commerce, hence Feds can pass laws about lemonade stands thanks to their powers to regulate interstate commerce) AND that non commercial activity (like if I grow this plant for myself and smoke it, no you can't have any) is considered commerce because by growing my own pot I'm not buying it from a drug dealer and thus commerce is effected so the Feds can regulate it.  So if I'm understanding this correctly, the commerce clause basically opens the door for any federal law, which seems ridiculous since it is so clearly contrary to the plainly stated parts of the constitution which seek to limit federal power by enumerating the only things they can legislate in the first place.  Anyone know if my understanding accurate?</p></div>		</li>
