			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thought.  I've read explanations that our ability to easily store fat confers an evolutionary advantage, but I've never seen anyone claim that adipokines are good in any way.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It increases the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) slightly, resulting in burning more calories even while just resting. (I may be misremembering the inflammation as the cause of this. But it is definitly a fact that increased fat mass results in increased BMR)</p>
<p>Thus it helps you get fit again. Problem is people who are overweight tend to already eat too much so that small change isn’t enough.</p></div>		</li>

The first section of this article shows some of the other mechanisms influenced by adipokines. Some even have antiinflammatory properties and work in tandem with other adipokines or other molecules to balance things like inflammation and metabolism</p>
<p>Edit: a good example would be the imbalance of resistin and adiponectin in obese asthma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It’s called <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/takotsubo-cardiomyopathy-broken-heart-syndrome" target="_blank">Takotsubo’s Cardiomyopathy</a>, aka apical ballooning syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy. It’s not well understood why it happens, but the physical shape of your heart as it beats changes. The condition is characterized by a certain, temporary “wall motion abnormality” of the left ventricle/apex, in the absence of a heart attack. The lack of contraction in the apex of the heart causes it to balloon, like squeezing one end of a water balloon but not the other. The result looks like an <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/p9tj3" target="_blank">octopus trap</a> from Japan, where the condition was first characterized, hence the name. </p></div>		</li>

behind why it suddenly causes such dramatic cardiomyopathies. Their theories are either catacholamine release ( hormone ) or sympathetic hyperstimulation ( neurological) </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lol, gave me a little chuckle. That picture obviously isn't completely accurate, but the right ventricle (which pumps blood to the lungs) is much smaller, under lower pressure, and ends up making a crescent shape around the left ventricle. Kind of like if you make a fist with one hand, and wrap the other hand around it. </p></div>		</li>
