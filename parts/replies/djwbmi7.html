<p>The presence of the Gulf Stream is due to the ithsmus of Panama existing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wait, what, that's utterly fascinating I read up and <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=4073" target="_blank">https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=4073</a> indeed says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scientists believe the formation of the Isthmus of Panama is one of the most important geologic events to happen on Earth in the last 60 million years. Even though it is only a tiny sliver of land, relative to the sizes of continents, the Isthmus of Panama had an enormous impact on Earth's climate and its environment. By shutting down the flow of water between the two oceans, the land bridge re-routed currents in both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Atlantic currents were forced northward, and eventually settled into a new current pattern that we call the Gulf Stream today. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ever more fascinating is this <a href="https://www.smithsonianjourneys.org/blog/how-the-isthmus-of-panama-changed-the-world-180950949/" target="_blank">https://www.smithsonianjourneys.org/blog/how-the-isthmus-of-panama-changed-the-world-180950949/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many scientists think that the closure of the Isthmus of Panama strengthened the warm Gulf Stream Current. This current took warm waters high into northern latitudes providing moisture to the atmosphere so that snow formed to build the glaciers of the ice age. At the same time a strong current also flowed south along the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean and affected the climate of north Africa causing it to become drier so that savannahs and open grasslands developed which provided the habitats that previously arboreal (tree living) primates then colonized. In the process one group became more socially organized, had their front limbs freed up for tool making, caring for young, and for other tasks, and in the process started to walk upright.</p>

<p>In 1882(!) <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_20/March_1882/The_Gulf_Stream_and_the_Panama_Canal" target="_blank">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_20/March_1882/The_Gulf_Stream_and_the_Panama_Canal</a> writing about the Panama Canal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The great work of the famous French engineer will have as much effect upon the Gulf Stream and the climate of North western Europe as the emptying of a teapotful of boiling water into the Arctic Ocean would have in raising the annual temperature in Greenland.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For completeness: as far as I understand, the way the Panama Canal works: the Chagres River is dammed which creates two lakes. There are gates on the Gatun Lake which let it fill up the locks to lift the ships. It's not like they dug an actual full on waterway from one ocean to the other. That's what Lesseps wanted but Stevens changed the plan. I have NFI what would've happened if Lesseps managed to do it despite what the Popular Science says.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Are there any studies on biogeographic changes in marine life after the formation of the isthmus?  I've read all about terrestrial biotic exchanges, but I've been curious for a while about the formation of a marine barrier near the equator.  It would seem to me that this combined with the closing of the Tethys seaway separated what had been a more or less continuous ring of water in the tropics in 3 or 4 isolated biogeographic areas.  Many species would not have been able to travel the distances around the barriers, like fish, or else would have been prevented by climatic pressures, like turtles.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the anoxic ocean, just read this really good article about silt/sediment avalanches underwater and the life that thrives around those. How does this factor in? Did those not happen back then due to different terrain?</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>These would probably be happening at that time too. There is lots of silt/sediment in the shallow seas that now make up the western US (The Grand Canyon is the best record for this).</p>
<p>In these shallows seas it is possible they may be shallow enough for O2 to permeate down to the sediments from simple surface mixing. But in the deep ocean all the sediments a likely anoxic, meaning different kinds of bacterial communities would thrive there. In highly reduced environments (when all the Sulphate in seawater is consumed and transformed to hydrogen sulfide) methanogenesis can occur, converting CO2 to methane. This is what leads to methane hydrate formation in highly productive regions like the Gulf of Alaska and Gulf of Mexico in modern ocean basins. It is possible these could be more prevalent in an anoxic ocean.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well the article mentions microorganisms in the silt who appear to help transport oxygen to the deeper levels. Apparently it's very hard to study still though, due to the depths.</p></div>		</li>
