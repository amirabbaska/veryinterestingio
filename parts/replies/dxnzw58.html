			<div class="markdown"><p>That's because they're stuck with a lose lose situation if they press forward: they go nuclear, and everyone becomes afraid, or they go renewables and deal with periods where their economies get shut down because they can't maintain load.</p>
<p>The status quo exists because change takes time if you're not looking to destroy everything in the process. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The non-renewable baseload necessity is essentially a myth. Multiple organisations have demonstrated a 100% renewable energy mix is viable. The leading scientific organisation in Australia the CSIRO compiled a report showing this and in the US the NREL has shown viability of a 90% renewable energy mix. Renewables can be spatially distributed enough and mixed between enough sources with biogas, hydro and geothermal combined that 100% renewable energy is possible. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The viability and practicality of 90-100% renewable energy mixes are dependant on location and demand. Australia has some of the highest insolation levels on the planet, and a relatively small population. They are probably the place where a solar based generation system would work best (though you'd still need large amounts of short term storage).</p>
<p>The UK, for example, has a lot of wind, but it has long periods of low wind. If that happens in winter, temperatures can drop, days are short so solar is pretty ineffective, we have no appreciable hydro or geothermal, and limited supplies of biogas (which would be more efficiently used for heating).</p>
<p>I have seen some studies that also make flawed or risky assumptions, such as a big drop in domestic consumption or a massive improvement in battery tech. While this doesn't mean they are wrong, it does mean the circumstances which they envision are not guaranteed.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The renewables being distributed is key here. The issue is that the US and Australia are big; the country gets light for longer (multiple time zones). When it’s still on one side, it’s windy on the other.</p>
<p>They’re also close to the equator (more sunshine in the day, more consistent length days).</p>
<p>Europe as a whole is also big, but that requires it’s very interconnected electricity network. The U.K., while partially connected is very small, very far north, and has poor weather.</p>
<p>Geothermal isn’t currently suitable here. Bio gas still produces the emissions which we want to avoid. Hydro power is possible in the U.K. but we haven’t got any big ones, and no plans for big ones as far as I know.</p>
<p>Wind is good here, but often the entire U.K. has no wind, meaning it can’t be used constantly. Solar is inefficient because of cloud cover and short days in winter (when we need the electricity).</p></div>		</li>

<p>Nobody has ever claimed anything about such thing. </p>
<p>Having <em>any kind</em> of baseload is just fine. And yes, there are studies showing &quot;it is possible&quot; to do away altogether with non-renewable even for that.. But they also showed the skyrocketed need and cost of redundancy is nuts. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear is clean, safe, and efficient. It just got hit with a lot of anti-nuclear propaganda.</p>
<p>It's main selling points are that unlike virtually all other clean energy sources, it is also <em>extremely efficient</em> and <em>extremely reliable</em>. I think only Hydro and Geothermal can really compete in those areas, and they aren't in close competition.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Has your government instituted even a modest carbon price that covers the whole economy? I doubt it. That takes only as long as lawmakers need to write up a bill and pass it. Are you suggesting that creating an economic incentive like a carbon price would shut down the economy/electrical grid?</p>
<p>In my province of British Columbia, Canada, we are debating building BOTH a pipeline expansion for high carbon oil from the oil sands as well as creating subsidies for the export of liquefied natural gas.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The crazy thing is that a carbon tax would raise lots of revenue and change the least efficient behavior without much of an economic impact (jobs etc). </p>
<p>Example: The Netherlands has $8/gal gas but life goes on  without much disruption. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not hugely relevant to the point itself, but just to point out that 'prescribe' is what climate scientists would do here. To 'proscribe' is to forbid- so essentially the opposite, which is pretty confusing.</p></div>		</li>
