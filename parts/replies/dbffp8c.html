What he does sounds pretty interesting, but I just finished up an advanced dynamics course and I don't think it would be too much fun from the math side of things.  Having to deal with many rotating objects with different velocities and things moving relative, the math is just awful, but some people are good at it and like it.  But it probably isn't the most fun to the average person!  And I imagine his job involves a lot of math!</p></div>		</li>

<p>You pretty much just summed up all of engineering. Results = awesome for everyone. Getting there = only fun for engineers.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You know what they don't teach you in undergrad? In industry, everything is done iterative / finite elements with heavy doses of numerical analysis. From undergrad, the only thing I recall that really showed this was the finite element analysis / CAD class. Fluids, dynamics, etc all didn't show this. So in comparison, it's the difference between calculating the stress in a complex beam with equations, versus calculating the stress in a beam with a finite element package (i.e. simpler equations).  </p>
<p>No one solves 8-body orbital dynamics analytical equations. Instead, you set delta_time really small, and solve 8 iterations of a basic 2-body problem on each set of 2. Then check them against each other. And record / track errors and repeat until they are small enough that you don't care anymore.  </p>
<p>Think Newton's method and other similar algorithms.  </p>
<p>Unless you get into research or super advanced stuff. Then they revert to analytical equations more often to understand the relationships for more concept building.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Instantaneous windows are on the order of seconds. I think I remember it being something like 1-2 seconds, but any more information than that would fall into Proprietary Information that I can't share.</p>
<p>Basically, the time you launch determines not just where the Earth is in space (as well as where the other planets are), but where your launch pad is sitting due to the spin of the Earth. That is why there is a new window every day, because you are spinning and moving. That spin tells you how much velocity you have towards your target and in which direction. Your launch vehicle and your space vehicle have to combine to correct any deviations from optimal direction and speed in order to hit the target. It's like tying a weight to a string and spinning that string in a circle around your hand. When you let go of the string determines which direction and how fast it flies. For very difficult trajectories with very tight margins on the launch vehicle and very little excess propellant on the spacecraft, you just can't correct for errors and need to launch at a very specific time each day to hit your target.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not OP, but I did my BS in Aerospace Engineering, instantaneous isn't really clearly defined but it's used in the order of seconds or fractions of a second.  Since OP mentioned Atlas V, <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2015/11/18/atlas-5-flights-to-station-enjoy-longer-launch-windows/" target="_blank">this article</a> compared the launch window for an atlas V versus alternatives, specifically &quot;The SpaceX Falcon 9, Russian Soyuz, European Ariane 5 and Japanese H-2B rockets all have instantaneous launch windows for space station missions, giving them a split second each day to fly or else scrub&quot;.  I have believe I have heard the term used for windows of up to 10-15 seconds, but I can't really find a source atm.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fascinating. Do satellites and known space debris factor in as well? I hear it's so crowded now. Or is there plenty of space in the gaps to plan a trajectory through?</p>
<p>Edit. For reference, this:</p>
<p>Satellites - <a href="https://youtu.be/ydbbd-4oEds" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ydbbd-4oEds</a></p>
<p>Debris - <a href="https://youtu.be/JmVt92d5bd4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/JmVt92d5bd4</a></p>
<p>I'm sure there is systems that track all this for you in your trajectory planning, but good lord that's a lot of variables!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, Mission Designers do not plan for orbital debris in their trajectories. Space is so much bigger than you can imagine. They do, however, plan for possible intersections with known non-debris like the space station and GPS constellations. </p>
<p>There is so much space between the debris that you don't really need to plan for it. However, I believe NASA does track a ton of debris in case you have a very critical mission that is flying through a particularly crowded area.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wow. That's a lot of satellites to keep track of. Note that it might be incomplete because the NRO has tried to disguise some of its satellites as <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/10369933/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/public-database-sheds-light-spy-satellites/#.WFmPax8tq1E" target="_blank">space debris</a>. Although, to be fair, a lot of information about even classified satellite launches seems to be publicly available (e.g. <a href="https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/02/ula-delta-iv-nrol-45-launch/" target="_blank">NROL-45</a> which was launched in February). It just seems that trying to hide the existence of satellites from public space agencies is risky when there are so many in orbit already.</p></div>		</li>
