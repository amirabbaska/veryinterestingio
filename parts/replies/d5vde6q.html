			<div class="markdown"><p>Furthermore, many of the natural Uranium minerals that one might find on the ground lie somewhere between &quot;lime green&quot; and &quot;tennis ball yellow&quot; in terms of color, and those with fluorescence also tends to glow a vivid green or yellow under UV light.</p>
<p>A few common Uranium minerals, for reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autunite" target="_blank">Autunite</a>; <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wCe32" target="_blank">Torbernite</a> (shoutout to /u/Dromaeosauridae for making the awesome album), and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xEmso" target="_blank">one in my collection</a> with a not-so-great fluorescence picture; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rockhounds/comments/4o7gt1/uranophane_from_grants_nm/" target="_blank">Uranophane</a> (from my own collection), see also <a href="http://www.mindat.org/min-4107.html" target="_blank">here</a>; <a href="http://www.mindat.org/gm/4420" target="_blank">Zippeite</a>... the list goes on. Uraninite, also called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uraninite" target="_blank">Pitchblende</a>, is one of the major exceptions.</p>
<p>If you're rockhounding in Uranium country, you immediately get suspicious of anything with that yellow or green color to it (but I've been <a href="http://www.mindat.org/min-4200.html" target="_blank">let down before</a>). /r/history would be a good place to ask around, but I imagine that pop culture during the <a href="http://national-radiation-instrument-catalog.com/new_page_14.htm" target="_blank">Uranium Rush</a> of the 1950's probably took that and ran with it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And if I may add, local Geology University and its permanent exhibitions are good place to take a peek at samples. If lucky, some &quot;old house' professor will give an impromptu tour thru.</p>
<p>Otherwise nature museums almost all have mineral &amp; rock exhibitions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That reminds me of a terrible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goi%C3%A2nia_accident" target="_blank">radioactive accident that happened in Brazil in the 80s'</a> when a decommissioned radiotherapy machine ended up in a regular scrapyard. The owner of the scrapyard disassembled the core containing radioactive caesium chloride (a salt of cesium-137) and was captivated by the blue glow of the substance. He then proceeded to distribute the amazing glowing dust among family and friends as a novelty. Then people started getting sick.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Trinity nuclear test at Alamogordo fused sand into lumps of glass called Trinitite, and people collected and sold them for jewelry for years before they were found to contain some nasty stuff.</p>
<p>And young women in a New Jersey watch factory painted a radium salt on luminous dials in the early 20th, licking their brushes to dress the point...died like flies.</p></div>		</li>
