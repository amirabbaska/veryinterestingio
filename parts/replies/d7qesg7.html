<p>Not true. Both C++ and Objective C have been derived from C as extensions. Objective C remains a pure extension of C whereas C++ has introduced some <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/31505447/417501" target="_blank">incompatibilities</a>. The only unrelated language is C# which has no relationship to C at all.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, my only professional experience is in C# (I'm a youngin), I've read C code before and I couldn't imagine program flow being anything like C#.</p></div>		</li>

<p>You're completely right about C++ having introduced incompatibilities. Many practical ones, such as operator overloading, mean that you (and the compiler) have to understand non-trivial C and C++ programs very differently. In that sense, C and C++ don't have enough in common to even call them similar. Try dual-tagging a StackOverflow with C and C++; people will have a shit fit.</p>
<p>Objective C has no standard, so you can't prove its semantics to be a pure extension of C. Also, you wouldn't write an Objective C program the same way as you'd write a C program, would you?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>All valid C programs are valid Objective C programs, but the other reverse isn't true, so clearly Objective C is a superset of C. What makes you say Objective C has no standard? Apple definitely publish the language specification and there are compilers not written by Apple why support that standard (ie gcc).</p></div>		</li>

<li>C is the good ol' base </li>
