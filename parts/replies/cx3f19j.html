			<div class="markdown"><p>That was my main reason for asking this question. I saw a picture on Facebook bashing Obama for accepting 10k refugees but &quot;ignoring&quot; veterans. </p>
<p>I mean, if you look at it that way, then yeah, fuck Obama. However, I figured there's more to it than that so I wanted to get the Reddit community to help me understand this complex issue. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Michelle Obama gave a speech yesterday where she pointed out one of the major issues in solving veteran homelessness: educating landlords so they are willing to rent to vets. It's not just a public policy issue, there's a lot of private ownership issues that also need to be addressed. There's no one silver bullet. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I didn't hear this speech. However, as a Veteran, I have never had an issue with a landlord not renting to me, as long as I have the money.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw this too. Is there any validity to it? <a href="http://www.snopes.com/refugees-new-orleans/" target="_blank">Snopes</a> looks like it had something relevent but I cant find good source. The photo I saw was of some guy's FB post. Also, wont it take years to screen people. It's not like we're opening a gate and letting everyone run through.</p></div>		</li>
