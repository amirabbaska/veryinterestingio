			<div class="markdown"><p>My dog is billingual too! I adopted her from a shelter, and my mother figured out her previous home must have been a spanish speaking household, since she responds to &quot;comida&quot; as well as &quot;food&quot;. Its actually pretty cute because my mom will just start giving her commands in spanish and she gets all excited</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My GSD was bilingual in german and english (home trained) and later also trained in hand signals, so I didn't have to yell a command across the room if he was being rowdy. A specific whistle to get his attention, then a hand signal. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My friend adopted a deaf/partially blind Great Dane. He gets a little confused when she has visitors, but with limited vision in his right eye, he can see and obey hand signals like &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;lie down.&quot; It's crazy how smart dogs can be even with limited senses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, I'm not sure I'd ever be able to own another breed. He made me think and challenged me into coming up with increasingly creative ways of play and work and commands. </p>
<p>He also made me really watch what I was teaching him to do. Like, I wiggled my shoe at him once and he latched on and I laughed.</p>
<p>None of my shoes were safe from that day on till I learned how to re-direct him and &quot;retrain&quot; him. </p>
<p>It was like having a toddler who would happily pick up all your bad habits and selectively learn the good ones. Depending on his mood and how you presented that training session.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The thing that has always cracked me up about dogs is that they will make location associations with training. If you only teach your dog to &quot;heal&quot; in the living room, they will only heal in the living room. But extend that training to the drive way and the back yard, now it's an &quot;everywhere&quot; command. </p>
<p>I knew a woman that tried to teach their dogs to crap only in one place, and would reinforce that with treats. The problem was, that was the only time they got treats. So the dogs crapped when they saw the treats, not when they where in that &quot;spot&quot;. So they would crap in the house, the car, etc. </p>
<p>So don't teach your dog to &quot;speak&quot; in the house, just outside.</p>
<p>(not a pro dog trainer, just owned, and trained, 7 dogs as house pets.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've had and been around more than my fair share of dogs, and I've never heard anything like that before. I'd be really surprised if that wasn't just a very strange fluke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, who knows. I'm not a pro dog trainer, so it may be casual observation gone wrong.</p>
<p>Makes a funny story though. </p></div>		</li>
