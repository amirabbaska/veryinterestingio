<p>If you had a flawless surface, could you theoretically boil water with no bubbles?  Just a bunch of steam coming off?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's easily achieved by taking a clean glass of water and putting it in the microwave. I highly discourage it though, because once the first bubble forms... so do the rest. It basically explodes/flash boils, sending very hot water everywhere. Loads of people have gotten bad burns while heating tea in the microwave.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yep, or if you boil it, forget it and leave it in the microwave then heat it again it won't boil... until you drop in a packet of sugar or stick a stirring device in it which causes it to erupt potentially all over your hand.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I need to boil water in the microwave, I always throw a toothpick in the water during heating to create a rough surface for the nucealation to form. I also then tap the side of the container with knife before picking it up.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and no.</p>
<p>What happens is that the water becomes hotter than the boiling point. Steam comes off the surface, but not at a rate fast enough to keep the liquid at the boiling point, so the water becomes superheated. When/if it eventually becomes agitated, it boils violently and instantly (probably better described as an explosion). Realistically, the only thing smooth enough to have zero nucleation sites is new glassware.  If that happens, you would get the superheated water explosion, propelling pyrex shrapnel, and usually you were doing it with something more dangerous than water.</p>
<p>If you're going to boil something in new glassware, you put some pebbles in or scratch up the bottom.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think that would only happen if you somehow heated it from the top. The water vapor that forms on the bottom of the pot (because that's where the heat is) would be a bubble and nucleation site itself.</p></div>		</li>
