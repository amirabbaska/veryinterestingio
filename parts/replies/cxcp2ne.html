			<div class="markdown"><p>Well &quot;at current usage levels&quot; won't really stay forever. </p>
<p>An interesting thought process is to ask &quot;what could be possible in a normal home, if not for normal power limitations&quot;</p>
<p>As our technology grows and we are able to generate and transport more/cleaner power, the technology used in the home could change as well.</p>
<p>It's still a LOT of power, and we won't run out in many lifetimes if we perfect it. That number could be cut by a factor of 10 or 100 as time passes.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's the thing.. it's impossible to tell exactly what will happen.  Maybe we'll make all our electronics so efficient that everything could be run off a car battery.  Maybe after that, people will figure out something (like getting out of Earth's gravity) that sucks up a LOT of energy, and all of the sudden our 10,000M year supply of deuterium gets used up in 100 years and everyone is arguing about space-climate change.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's sort of funny, people have talked about this problem since power plants started improving. Basically the more energy we can generate the more demand for energy goes up</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Many things also get more efficient.  We currently use around the same amount of energy per household as we did in the 1970s, though we have a lot more powered devices (how many home computers were there in the 1970s compared to now?).  If we ever invent tech like a star trek replicator or transporter, then sure it'll go up by many orders of magnitude, but if we're just heating/cooling food, our buildings, and entertaining ourselves with computer and TV like devices, we'll probably use less power per person as we go forward.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that it's a battle between tech that uses more power, and making existing tech more efficient.</p>
<p>As our power generation grows, we get access to new tech that would previously be out of reach.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Hmm, what? Apart from everything suddenly becoming a lot cheaper I can't really think of much which I really want if only electricity was free. Things like CPU speed don't seem bound by energy costs. In fact with electronics the trend seems to have reversed with low power efficient devices the goal.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Low power CPUs are the goal because low power = low heat. As we pack more and more transistors into smaller spaces, we need them to create less heat so it can be dissipated before it damages the circuitry.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends what happens in the future in terms of developing technology and how population changes. The real limited to doing pretty much anything,  ignoring engineering challenges, is having the energy to do it. Efficient fusion power would offer a huge leap in the kind of energy we'd have out hands to play with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It is my understanding that Lithium is going to be difficult to find wherever we look because while its incredibly abundant throughout the universe, its density in any one place is low because it is generated via cosmogenic nucleosynthesis, and other forms of cosmic ray spallation. </p>
<p>Cosmic ray spallation takes place in the interstellar medium, the upper atmosphere, and in the very top layer of earth, so Lithium is all over the place. But, it is also not concentrated. It seems that no matter where we find it, extraction will not be simple.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Good point about D-D fusion. You're right, though-- that is a lot harder.</p>
<p>Another thing I'd like to point out is that tritium isn't exactly a safe gas, as it's a beta-emitter. So, proper storage and accidental releases are concerns.</p></div>		</li>
