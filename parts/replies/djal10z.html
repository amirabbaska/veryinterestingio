			<div class="markdown"><p>Yup. NFPA 921 Guide for Fire and Explosion investigation details four methods a fire investigator may use to determine the origin, not the cause, of a fire. </p>
<ol>
<li>Fire patterns - the observable or measurable shapes or patterns left by fire effects. </li>
<li>Fire dynamics - the behavior of fire in terms of fuel, ventilation, compartment size etc. </li>
<li>Witness statements</li>
<li>Arc mapping - the locating and mapping of electrical faults on circuits that were energized at the time of the fire. </li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, you need to find the origin before you can find the cause. Typically if you can identify the origin to an accurate degree, the cause will be identifiable to specialists of that potential cause (e.g. Electrical or mechanical engineers). </p></div>		</li>
