			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not known, although all the other fundamental forces, that is, the electromagnetic force, and the weak and strong nuclear forces, are propagated by particles and so are quantised, and thus it is theorised that gravity has some &quot;graviton&quot; to discretise gravitational fields and propagate gravitational fields.</p>
<p>Under classical mechanics however, that is, the mechanics of Newton and Co., gravitational attraction is not quantised, and instead behaves as a field propagating from the centre of mass, along radial directions, almost like a sphere being blown up. Then, as the sphere gets larger the balloon skin, representing the &quot;amount&quot; of field present at that point, gets thinner according to an inverse square law F=Gm1m2/r^2.</p></div>		</li>

<p>This is a great analogy for the inverse square law. I'm going to take this, thank you...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So if its particles and quantitized then there are points where it has zero effect inthe universe. Assume I go far enough, then there will be a volume which is almost  never crossed by a gravitron thus its not effected by the originators gravity.    </p>
<p>Also a related question: Do gravitrons just travel in a straight line forever? Or can they change course/be absorbed or slowed down?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>With a quantized force, are classical mechanics still applicable to describe an average force?</p>
<p>That is, with equilibrium equations in chemistry, and very few atoms, the equation describes the average state of the atoms- ie, 1.5 water molecules on average, even though you can only have discrete quantities of water molecules,  the number describes the average state over time. Does it work similarly in this case? Like, does the rate of particle propagation fall, or does  it simply stop sending particles at all?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There is no minimum quantum of &quot;force&quot; at all, for any of the fundamental interactions. The charges are quantized, but the actual force felt depends on other factors, too, like distance, which (as far as we know) is continuous.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Could you expand on this? I would assume that if you accept that the universe is finite, its center could be defined as the center of mass of all the mass in the universe, no? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>True - but if the universe is infinite the question obviously has no answer. I'm thus interested in what the answer would be (if any) if the universe is finite. The parent commenter stated with certainty that there was no center of the universe, which would seem to imply that regardless of whether or not the universe is infinite, the question has no answer - so I was asking why it has no answer even if we assume a finite universe.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You first start with the assumption that the universe is finite, which is a big assumption. For all we know the universe is infinite in size, no matter where you are there is still more universe in all directions..</p>
<p>Second even if we somehow figure that the universe is finite in size.. That doesn't mean there is a center you could reach. The universe exists in four dimensions moving in the universe could be like an ant moving on the surface of a cube. You could reach all faces and the face area itself is finite, but you cannot reach the center because it's doable only in a dimension that you are not free to travel along.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well, if the universe is infinite the question is moot to begin with. I'm only interested in how the question would be answered if it  <em>could</em>  have an answer. Hence the finite-ness assumption.</p>
<p>Given that assumption, could one not describe a geometric center of mass for the universe? Not taking time into account, just space? Or is that a meaningless question when working with cosmological scales?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that there are plenty of models that don't have space's creation tied up with the big bang. The concept of colliding branes to create expanding sets of matter is an appealing one because it removes the &quot;special&quot; nature of a universal center that you get from having a single point of egress of all matter's creation.</p></div>		</li>
