			<div class="markdown"><p>I don't know much about this subject but human evolution is fascinating and I would love to know more. The timelines confuse me and I keep seeing comments mentioning that humans interbred with Neanderthals as H. Sapien left Africa. Didn't Neanderthals also emerge from Africa? Did they leave first or did they emerge from somewhere else? Also, you mentioned that humans from 100,000 years ago would have looked familiar to us. Was there as much diversity regarding skin, hair, and eye color at that time? Sorry for all the questions but this thread Is making me curious. </p>
<p>Edit: I apologize for poor grammar, I'm on mobile.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they did. There have been several Out of Africa migrations, the predecessor of Neanderthal just beat the predecessor of sapien to the European continent.</p>
<p>Most of the other changes you mention, skin color, eye color, even hair color and thickness would have been minimal or non-existent. The genes were carried, but most likely everyone was brown, hairy, and all looked roughly the same.</p></div>		</li>

<blockquote>
<p>The first humans with proto-Neanderthal[44] traits are believed to have existed in Eurasia as early as 350,000â€“600,000 years ago[45] with the first &quot;true Neanderthals&quot; appearing between 200,000 and 250,000 years ago.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our well-known, but often misunderstood, fossil kin lived in Eurasia 200,000 to 30,000 years ago, in the Pleistocene Epoch.</p>

<p>Like humans, Neanderthals originated in Africa but migrated to Eurasia long before humans did. Neanderthals lived across Eurasia, as far north and west as the Britain, through part of the Middle East, to Uzbekistan. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the reply! If you don't mind elaborating a little, I would like to know at what point (approx) did such physical diversity begin and how/why? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly (I may be off so someone please correct me if I am), all [hominid] life is originally from Africa, but there were constant waves of peoples leaving Africa. I believe Neanderthals descended from people that left Africa about 500,000 to a million years ago (sorry I'm not quite sure about this timeline), and Neanderthals died out about ~40,000 years ago.
Modern day humans have been around ~195,000 years, and when those &quot;modern day&quot; humans left Africa in a diaspora, they moved into Europe and found the descendants of those who had left long before, who had evolved to become the Neanderthals.
So in that time of 190,000 years-40,000 years ago (until the Neanderthals died out) we interbred with them.
It's also interesting to note that many, if not most African people do not share any DNA with Neanderthals while people of at least distant European descent almost all share at least some DNA with Neanderthals, as they lived in Europe. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah me too. I'd really love to see a really informative documentary (or documentary series) about our beginnings. Starting from 3 million years ago to now. </p>
<p>And for goodness sakes, can we have one that only uses scientific fact, with some speculation so those people who argue that creationism doesn't co-exist with evolution can throw in the towel.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Another closely related question is &quot;if I could travel back in time, kidnap a baby, travel back to present time, and raise the baby in modern society, how far back could I go before we could spot a difference between the kidnapped person and the rest of us&quot;? 100 000 years? 200 000?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The first question that needs to be answered before your question can be answered is age. Human babies look a lot like chimpanzee babies, and if you're going down the hominid line, lots of human babies look alike pretty far down the line. When they get older, as the baby develops into a toddler and especially into adolescence, they change dramatically.</p>
<p>For a full life cycle, I'd say you could go back 100000 to 150000 years without a noticeable difference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I once read a really good series of fantasy books about a set of magical twins of prophesy. Out of nowhere, in the final book, it's revealed that they weren't actually twins and that the male twin had actually been a time-abducted Neanderthal baby. No mention of any odd resonance of speech or uncommon appearance in the entire ~6 book series. Everything but that massive plot hole was great.</p></div>		</li>
