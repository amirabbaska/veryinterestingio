			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the emphasis; the phonemes themselves are slightly different. It's been a long time since I studied linguistics, but I remember that the same sounds are actually <em>formed</em> slightly differently depending on what sounds come immediately before. </p>
<p>It's like &quot;Ayb-ee ayb-ee&quot; v &quot;Bee-ay bee-ay.&quot; So if you splice it you get &quot;Ayb-ee ayb-ee&quot; v &quot;ee-ayb ee-ayb,&quot; or &quot;Bee-ay bee-ay&quot; v &quot;ay-bee ay-bee.&quot; </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>English has a tendency to put the stress on the first syllable of any word (or if the word is too long, the third syllable to last one), e.g.  CHO-co-late, TEN-den-cy, ef-FI-ca-cy.
This pattern becomes even more apparent when compared to other languages. French has a tendency to stress the last syllable, e.g. cho-co-LAT, ten-DENCE, ef-fi-ca-ci-TÃ‰. Spanish has a tendency to stress the second to last one, e.g. cho-co-LA-te, ten-DEN-cia, e-fi-CA-cia.</p>
<p>Since you are saying AB in English you're probably saying EI-bee, EI-bee. If you were saying it in French you'd be saying ah-BEH, ah-BEH</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Interesting thing I heard about this... As /u/floatingribhit mentioned we're used to &quot;going down&quot; in a  sentence and so it sounds like Ay-bee or conversely, Bee-yay.</p>
<p>If you said A-B over and over like a question (with inflection going &quot;UP&quot; at the end of the sentence), then you get the opposite. &quot;a-B?&quot; You could then splice the audio to start with B in the sequence and it would sound like you were saying a B-A sequence. </p>
<p>Does that make sense? Probably not. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense to me, and I think you're probably right. I bet it wouldn't match up 100%, but it would be easy to fool someone who was trying to guess the sequence.</p></div>		</li>
