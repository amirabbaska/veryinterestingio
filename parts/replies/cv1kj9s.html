			<div class="markdown"><p>And one more repost before I start annoying people with this.  This is how it clicked for me:</p>
<p>Does it help if you think of the gyroscope as discrete points instead of one thing? Think of 1000 balls in a ring formation moving in a circle around a point. They're attached to that point with a string, which is attached to the end of a perpendicular bar, which they can move around the outside of for some magical reason without it getting in the way.</p>
<p>Turn the angle of that bar and what happens? The balls will keep going in the direction they were already going. The circle they were traveling in doesn't change it's angle to stay perpendicular to the bar because of the momentum the balls already have.</p>
<p>Now make that bar and the strings rigid (so that they have to stay at a 90 degree angle). The balls spinning around the bar are going to resist moving the bar, because they want to keep going the direction they're already going.</p>
<p>Now change the balls into a solid ring, and you have a gyroscope.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The spinning mass resists the <strong>angle</strong> of the bar moving at all.  In order for the angle of the bar to change, the angle of the plane created by the spinning mass would have to change, and the spinning mass has momentum in every direction in that plane, so changing the angle of that plane would be hard.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Like he said, the spinning resists the movement of the bar, well falling to the ground would be a movement of the bar so that's why the spinning prevents that.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I appreciate the visual and it helps a bit, but there's still a part that isn't intuitive to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now make that bar and the strings rigid (so that they have to stay at a 90 degree angle). The balls spinning around the bar are going to resist moving the bar, because they want to keep going the direction they're already going.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I understand if the balls are spinning clockwise, they would resist movement in a counterclockwise direction. But why would they resist perpendicular movement (moreso than the normal resistance when they're at rest) if they aren't traveling in that direction?</p>
<p>I understand that if a bowling ball is stationary, it will take X amount of force to move it. Now if that bowling ball is moving East at a certain speed, it will take more than X amount of force to move it West, since you have to overcome the extra inertia it has. What I don't understand is why it would take more than X amount of force to move it North or South, since it doesn't seem to currently have any motion in those directions.</p>
<p>This seems like the real heart of the issue, and while your example helps, it makes it sound like it's intuitive when I'm not sure it is.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>why would they resist perpendicular movement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things just don't like to change speed <em>or direction.</em></p>
<p>It's why a bowling ball hitting the bumper at even a shallow angle is so violent.  It's resisting changing it's direction.</p>
<p>It's also the same reason something on a string going in a circle pulls so hard.  Things don't like to change direction.</p>
<p>The bigger the mass, the more it's going to resist.  When you have a really dense metal in a gyroscope, it's resistance for changing motion is strong because of all that mass that's already going in one direction (that direction being tangential to the circle).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>it sorta glosses over this like it's intuitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not a scientist, and didn't get very far in science classes.  I'm explaining from my own intuition, so that's probably why.</p></div>		</li>

<p>But sometimes <em>why</em> questions don't have a satisfactory answer.  Richard Feynman was once asked during an interview about why magnet work, and he goes off on a 5-minute tangent about why <em>why</em> questions are problematic.

<p>I'm used to no why questions when it comes to leptops and particle spin and all that. But this one is a macro effect that should be somewhat explicable by Newtonian? motion one would hope. </p></div>		</li>

<p>All rotational effects are contained in Newton's Laws in principle... but actually explaining gyroscopic motion <em>quantitatively</em> in terms of linear concepts is almost impossible. It's not that you <em>can't</em> do it. It's that once your done you'll just have pages and pages of stuff and not really have learned anything. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Anyway, I probably shouldn't have used the word &quot;problematic&quot;.  But his point (and my point) is that sometimes the only acceptable answer for a layperson is &quot;because that's the way it works&quot;.  A more fundamental understanding would take years of study.</p>
<p>And sometimes then the answer is still &quot;because that's the way it works&quot;.  For instance, why is inertial mass equal to gravitational mass?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I can give it a shot.</p>
<p>It has to do with conservation of momentum.</p>
<p>Take a wheel. We can rotate it in three different directions: (1) around the axle, (2) flip it end over end sideways, or (3) turn it sideways as you do when steering a car. So let's say we spin the wheel around its axis first. There's no friction, so it keeps spinning with a constant momentum. What do you think would happen if you tried to give it a strong push suddenly so that it flips end over end to the side? <a href="http://imgur.com/a/eCdrR" target="_blank">I made a little album as a visual aid...</a> I think this album shows what most people intuitively expect will happen. They think the wheel will just spin in both directions independently from one another. But follow along until the end of the album. At that point it's pretty clear that something fishy has happened, and the reason is that our intuition is wrong. </p>
<p>If you understand conservation of momentum and Newton's Laws then you will understand that, unless we apply a force to the wheel, its momentum should not change. In the last image of the album you can see that the wheel's momentum has changed completely around. It was spinning forward and now it is spinning backwards. If we continue to let the wheel flip another 180 degrees (back to its original orientation) it will be spinning <em>forward</em> again. Then backwards, then forwards, then backwards... We applied two initial forces to the wheel and have not touched it since then. So how can the momentum keep changing directions? The answer is... it can't. Our expectation was wrong, and fixing it isn't easy.</p>
<p>Instead of a wheel, let's <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/338098214e377d160cd49140005ba37f44e9f11b/687474703a2f2f7777772e7765686561727473776966742e636f6d2f77702d636f6e74656e742f75706c6f6164732f323031342f31302f636f6f7264696e617465732e706e67" target="_blank">imagine a ball like this one</a>, and let's do the same experiment. Start spinning the ball around the red x-axis. Then add some spin around the blue z-axis. What happens? The vectors add together, and now the ball will be spinning somewhere between the two. If the magnitudes of those forces were equal, it will be spinning at a 45 degree angle. The exact direction would depend on if you spun it clockwise or or counterclockwise. In any case, with this thought experiment our intuition is doing a better job hopefully. </p>
<p>Now... your intuition might not be as bad as we thought. Have you ever seen a wheel rolling along and given it a push? If it was spinning pretty fast, it probably didn't just fall right over, did it? It probably just wobbled a bit? What happened is that the wheel had a lot of angular momentum. When you added a bit more momentum in a different direction those two add up. It's doing the same thing as the ball. Weird thing about wheels is that they naturally have a lot of mass around the rim. Momentum is mass times velocity. Even if a wheel isn't spinning super fast, all of that mass means it will have more momentum than meets the eye when it's spinning in the direction it was made to spin. You have to give it more momentum than you might expect if you want the wheel to roll off (very awkwardly) at a 45 degree angle. Of course, that's certainly possible. Push the wheel hard enough and it WILL fall right over and friction will kill the momentum pretty fast.</p>
<p>So... gyroscopes. Same thing is happening. It can't just fall right over because that would violate conservation of momentum. There's a bit more involved as you look at what causes the procession. And unlike our previous examples, gravity is constantly working on the gyroscope rather than giving it a one-time momentum change. What it comes down to is the fact that the gryoscope starts with a LOT of angular momentum in one direction. And it takes a while before gravity increases the angular momentum so much in another direction that you can tell.</p></div>		</li>
