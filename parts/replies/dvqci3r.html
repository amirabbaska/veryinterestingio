<blockquote>
<p>Bailey found Scott’s telomeres on the ends of chromosomes in his white blood cells increased in length while in space. This could be linked to increased exercise and reduced caloric intake during the mission. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that a thing?  You can increase your telomere length by eating less and exercising?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It looks as though they think his cells may have been forced into a &quot;repair state&quot; (as opposed to the more common &quot;replace state&quot;)  due to the cellular stresses he experienced while in space. Calorie restriction is currently being studied as a means of extending human lifespan on earth, and one mechanism for why calorie restriction works could be the extension of telomeres by way of increased DNA repair activity in cells from stress.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To an extent, yes. This is called Epigenetics.</p>
<p>In short, regions of your DNA can be suppressed via a variety of reversible modifications including cytosine methylation, and modification of histones via acetylation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, etc. This is commonly done transiently as a way to fine tune what your body is doing. For instance, when you're at a caloric deficit, your cells will alter expression to decrease caloric expenditure and store fat, then reverse that alteration once you have enough to eat.</p>
<p>There's evidence that these modifications can be passed on to offspring. We've observed this phenomenon in a number of single and multicellular organisms, and there have been studies suggesting that a similar effect is present in humans. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So, if those modifications can be potentially passed on to offspring, when that situation occurs, does that particular modification become the &quot;normal&quot; gene expression in the offspring (given that their environment doesn't cause the gene expression to change again)?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Makes sense that evolution could then be somewhat directed by an organism’s experiences/tribulations instead of relying solely on 100% random mutations as many people seem to believe. I’m no expert (at all) but it just seems like a more reliable system for successful adaptation than purely blind chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I've read about some recent experimental finding where scientists were surprised to find that <em>some</em> of the epigenetic changes actually ended up being inherited. I think they were rat studies, and rat mothers subjected to certain stresses not only developed some epigenetic adaptations but ended up passing them on to their offspring - so the rat babies were prepared from birth to handle those adverse conditions better.</p>
<p>But as far as I understood, this stuff is just starting to be explored. It rattled the previous understanding where inheritance was solely about changes to DNA structure. How much of inheritance is epigenetics is a question that probably requires much more research.</p></div>		</li>
