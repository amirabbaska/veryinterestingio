			<div class="markdown"><p>I used to be a wildland firefighter and often sources of the fire were found the same way. I'd see the ropped off initial source by fire inspectors and it would be ash gray because the fire completely burned, and every where else further on was black, not completely burned. Then from there they might find a cigarette butt, firework remnants, lightning burns, campfire ring, or in some cases i believe chemical testing would be done to find accelerants, etc.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>you say that the origin of the fire is recognizable because it usually burns completely to ash, and then contradict that by saying you can later find cigarette butts. Shouldn't cigarette butts burn?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wood turning to ash doesn't mean it burned hotter.  It means that it burned completely.  When wood &quot;burns&quot; in a low oxygen environment, it doesn't actually burn so much as it releases gasses, oils, and water vapor, which leaves behind charcoal.  Charcoal, however, will burn hotter than wood, because it's pure fuel.  A wood fire loses energy to evaporating water.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Cigarette butts are a bit fire resistant anyway as a safety feature, once you've used up all the tar and nicotine they should go out (unless they've already started a fire!); also the filter is a polymer these days, rather than treated paper or whatever they used to use.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>My first fire in the department I volunteer for was a lightning strike. I couldnt tell for the life of me what started it. The investigators showed up, walked to the collapsed chimney, said &quot;yup, lightning strike&quot; and basically left. I asked them how the hell they ID'd it so fast and they basically said that one big indicator would be the damm lightning storm that just passed and that the sand in the mortar and bricks of the chimney had turned to glass from the intensity of the lightning. So simple, but it blew my mind.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>one option in the correct soil is lightning glass or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulgurite" target="_blank">fulgerite</a>. The lighting carries on down through the soil fusing the silica into glass it forms in branching lightning patterns in the ground</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I responded to a couple lightning strikes. There first one I responded to was near our station. When we arrived a tree was stuck, a long stripe of bark had been blown off and some of it was on fire still about 30 feet away.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately no. The only crazy stories I have is the lightning fire we responded to. The bark was on fire and had been blown off about 30 feet away and the tree was still smoking, not on fire but smoking. Seeing this for the first time was crazy, it's like something out of a movie, firey debris everywhere.</p>
<p>So we quickly jump out of our rigs and get to work to put out the burning bark chunks and got back in our rigs because lightning was still going on. We began to drive back towards civilization but just as we pulled away not even 200 yards from the site, lightning struck right where we were standing. The boom was intense as we were still right there. We all just lifted our heads up and looked at each other silently knowing we just walked away and someone could have gotten killed just there.</p>
<p>I guess the other crazy story is seeing a fire so big it started its own storm system all on it's own. Flames reaching over 200 feet tall, seeing a whole forest burning as far as I could see, creating thunder and lightning from the intense updrafts it created, what I imagine the end of the world being like, it's hard to put into words.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fire investigation has come a long way in the last 26 years. Fire investigation used to be considered an &quot;art&quot; ... it is now science based, using the scientific method to form and test hypotheses of how fires start. It is extremely unfortunate and sad that criminal proceedings have been based on investigation methods that were nothing more than wives' tales. It is fortunate, however, that the fire investigation community has developed into the science/fact based investigation community that it is today.</p>
<p>Edit: I need to add some info here about the legitimacy of the fire investigation field - Being that fire investigation is based on the scientific method, I have to conclude that fire investigation is not in fact a junk science. I do agree with the many people, however, that there are plenty of junk fire investigators who base their decisions on junk science (hypotheses that are not tested properly, experiments that are not done properly, wives tales and lore). But this is not to say that all fire investigators are wizards with a magic water stick pointing their way to the origin of a fire. </p>
<p>There are a large number of fire investigators who are dedicated to true fire investigation and the scientific method, and to furthering the field with experimentation. I think that saying all fire investigation is junk and illegitimate is doing those men and women a disservice. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Fire investigation techniques received a major update in the early 1990's with the publication of NFPA 921, with best practices taking a while to become the new standard.</p>
<p>My understanding is that modern investigator is very unlikely to have issued as certain an opinion on that case, and that properly conducted fire investigations can be a useful tool (but fires do not always leave sufficient evidence about what started them).</p>
<p>There is also a whole class of features besides burn patterns to look at - electrically started fires usually have telltale signs within their wiring, glass tends to deform and break in certain directions, and then things like witness testimony can be useful.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The origin of fires usually has the least amount of heat.  Fires need the following four things: fuel, heat, oxygen and a self sustaining chemical chain reaction.  Think about it,  the fire consumes the fuel in the origin with least amount of heat.  Usually the least amount of heat possible to sustain fire.  But once fuel in consumed it cannot re-burn. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'd also like to add that when I was watching live BBC News coverage of the fire at the time of the incident, a woman who called in did mention that a neighbour had told here that 'a man came running to me telling me that his fridge had exploded, and that he should get out of the building as quickly as possible' (this is a vague transcript of what I heard); so I assume they use these first hand accounts to reinforce their findings.</p></div>		</li>
