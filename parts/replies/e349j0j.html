			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh, I really thought it was something to do with the camera or something about moisture in the air or something like that. But now that you mentioned the rockets, you can clearly see the smoke pillars originating from the ground in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13XFk5XKCWk" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't find the post or comment here on Reddit where I read that color thing, but if I recall correctly he said something along the lines that it was all of the colours of a rainbow sort of jumping around the mushroom cloud. Unfortunately it isn't caught on tape, so it must be something to do with the radiation interacting with eyes like you said.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I saw a documentary of an expedition to find out how far into the Chernobyl reactor the fuel rods melted so that they could determine if there was any risk of it reaching the water table (and thus cause another explosion). They took cameras and took pictures of this molten mass of slag called the Elephants foot. </p>
<p>The footage itself was distorted and damaged by the radiation so it all looked effed up with streaks and specks of colors. I dont think anyone from the expidition lived very long after. Its disturbing...</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>i've always wondered if that would happen at the earths surface.</p>
<p>i would see these flashes in my eye on occasion.  more often it would be when i was very dark adapted out with my telescope.  being very conscious of light.  i would see it, but i know that its not 'out there', and there is absolutely no other human light.  </p>
<p>in the last few years i've gotten more into trying to note some of these weird inner eye flashes and it seems like a few have happened after sunspots.  </p>
<p>on another note, i think its an incredible evolutionary point to the degree humans can detect photons.  i read somewhere that up to single visible light photons can be detected by the human eye.  that's an incredibly small bit of energy.</p></div>		</li>

For those who dont now these white streamers on the right side from the xplosion are markers to visualize how shock wave is traveling and affecting them..ï»¿</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I have heard operators in nuclear powerplants have expierenced impossible colors and the feeling of pinpricks on the face when exposed to radiation(on mobile, ill try to find sources later). The film taken in towns surrounding chernobyl has white spots from radiation hitting the film. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Correct. Just a row of simple solid-fuel rockets, pointed straight up, and fired an instant before the nuke goes off. Sequence photographs of the smoke trails provide a virtual graph of the propagation of the blast wave.  </p>
<p>Of course, a few people have attributed them to aliens...;-)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not just the initial blast wave, but the pressure following the initial explosion. You can see how the bottom of the lines have moved towards the explosion. The top section has all moved away. This is mainly due to the intense heat which forms the mushroom cloud. This, coupled with a higher pressure area around the blast and a low pressure area where the blast initiated, makes sort of a vortex where the heat and smoke form a relatively small plume up to the larger mushroom cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: clarified pressure anomalies.</p></div>		</li>
