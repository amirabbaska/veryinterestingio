			<div class="markdown"><p>This interests me since one of my 3 golden retrievers seems to be nearsighted. At 2 yrs old he has trouble catching things even at a short distance and he doesn't recognize me at 30 ft unless I say something. He also spooks easily if I approach with a something in my hand like a broom or a trashcan. And of course, he's never been mistreated or has any reason to be skittish. I just tend to think he needs glasses sometimes. Should we have his eyes checked or is this not uncommon?  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Wouldn't hurt having him checked out! You can go to www.acvo.org and find a veterinary ophthalmologist near you.  If he doesn't have any other issues (redness, squinting, etc) they can do what is called an ECR exam (used to be called a CERF). It is usually cheaper and is done for breeding dogs or litters of puppies, service dogs, etc. They check for inherited conditions, cataracts, and do a fundic exam (check retina). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Will do, thanks. </p>
<p>We've got a good vet ophthalmologist near us we found when one of last dogs developed cataracts and for the price, it was disappointing to find out we really couldn't do much for him except keep the gate closed. </p>
<p>I strongly suspect the 2 yr old's issue is inherited but it'll be good to know for sure.</p>
<p>Thanks again! </p></div>		</li>

<p>Other than just for your own knowledge, what would you do with that information?</p>
<p>Do they make doggy glasses?</p></div>		</li>

<p>My only concern would be his comfort. Since dogs don't express pain very well I would want to know if it was bothering him. We've had 8 of this breed over the years and they develop problems as they age like any other critter (even me!). We've coped with blindness, hip displasia, cancer, seizures and broken bones. Don't get me started on puppy mills.</p>
<p>We also go through vacuum cleaners like candy, these guys all  leak hair like it's a job.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>We used to have an outside cat named Scarface. She was a good cat for a near feral cat, very cute. Scarface got her name by sleeping in a truck motor in the winter, and when the motor started...</p>
<p>Well, it wasn't bad as far as those sorts of injuries go. Her head wasn't split open, but it left a gnarly scar on her face, and I'm not sure how she didn't loose an eye.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Have a cat who's right eye is fine but his left eye is either blood shot or covered in something brown- looks really irritated and we don't know what is wrong. We took him to the vet and the vet said take him to a ophthalmologist and that's as far as we've gotten.</p>
<p>The problem is, unfortunately, we can't afford a really expensive procedure and we really don't want to hear bad news. Do you think, if the cat isn't showing any signs of it bothering him, we can let it go a bit longer? He doesn't seem to have vision problems; when he is outside he can still hunt and find his way around without a problem. </p></div>		</li>
