			<div class="markdown"><p>Trump is a good example. According to Trump it is $10 billion due to his &quot;brand value&quot;.  Actual Assets less Liabilities are a lot less. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This got me looking up what the most valuable brands are and jeez, the top 20 brands in the world combined are worth well over a trillion dollars. And thats just the value of their brand! Doesn't surprise me to see that 'Trump' is worth $10b, probably more now that he's the President. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>yes but one needs to be aboe to monetize the brand. From what I have read / disclosures all his branding deals combined brought in very little profit. Bankruptcy hurts your brand. I always wondered what he was doing with Trump steaks and appearing on late night infomercials. If I were worth $10 billion I wouldn't be hawking steaks but he seems to enjoy the spotlight. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Isn't his assets minus liabilities like $6-7 billion? (According to his FEC disclosures if I remember correctly.)</p>
<p>Also, his brand is probably worth more now. Check eBay and his ties are selling for more than when they were first released. Even Ivanka's brand has been selling like hot cakes. And this is despite the constant negative press, the made in China hysteria, etc. Even his Trump brand water is selling at crazy prices.</p>
<p>God, remember when people started making a big deal about Trump not even making water, steaks, wine, etc anymore? And that essentially gave him reason to do a half hour informercial (press conference) showing it all off. </p>
<p>Trump will have lifelong supporters, no matter what happens in the next 4-8 years. They'll eat up anything with a Trump logo. He's the new Reagan. He'll be mystified for decades by republicans. Even if he got impeached, his supporters will think it is a plot against him/America. </p>
<p>His brand may not be as strong in places like New York. But Trunp, more than ever, now has unparalleled recognition amongst conservatives, and he'll be able to bank off of that for years to come.</p>
<p>And if he manages to make it through his entire presidency, it's not unlikely that his brand will continue to get stronger, even in liberal markets, because there's a 99% chance the next president (or one after) is even crazier than Trump, and everyone will remember all the zany things Trump did like we do with Bush. </p>
<p>That's right, in the next 16 years, liberals will likely be clamouring for the days of Trump.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>On top of that not all contracts must be publicly disclosed.</p>
<p>I can be worth trillions tell bill gates ill sign a contract and give him billions of my wealth and a nice allowance of his own. but in all reality the vast majority of his assets belong to me.</p></div>		</li>
