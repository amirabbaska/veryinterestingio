			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the nerves are <em>able</em> to process pressure, it's that they <em>accidentally</em> process pressure. Normally light of a certain wavelength activates the receptors for that wavelength and they send signals around to the back of the brain to be processed in the occipital lobe. Pressure in the eye fluid just happens to do the same thing, pressing on the cell membranes of the receptors and causing them to release neurotransmitters and send signals that should only happen when they receive the correct light wavelengths.</p>
<p>The same thing happens when wires and receivers experience interference. For example, if you run a power cable parallel to an audio cable or cross them too many times, the electric field generated around the power cable will interfere with the signal flowing through the audio cable. The audio cable will continue to carry whatever signal it was carrying, it will just have random nonsensical bits thrown in that get interpreted by a speaker and played as static or breaks interspersed throughout the sounds the cable is supposed to be carrying. Your eyes do the same thing: they're sending the signals they're supposed to be carrying (&quot;nothing&quot;/black if your eyes are closed), but they're also carrying random signals from interference introduced by the pressure from the eye fluid. Your occipital lobe just interprets whatever it receives as images, although unlike a speaker your brain can ignore or tune out interference and nonsense because you know what is causing the interference.</p>
<p>Also, just semantics, but I wouldn't say nerves process light as an image, rather they process light as a signal. Your brain is the one that processes all those signals as an image, regardless of what those signals are. Your occipital lobe could be getting its info from your ears for all it cares, it's still going to get whatever image it can out of it.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's a nice analogy but your scientific explanation is wrong. Photoreceptors transmit visual information via a number of interneurons. Pressure doesn't affect photoreceptors at all, but it affects one of these interneurons. The interneurons themselves are not photosensitive.</p></div>		</li>
