			<div class="markdown"><p>It can be. In small single cell devices like cell phones the chip is often on the phone PCB. This allows a less expensive battery. Since the battery isn't often replaced, you still get good data. However if you replace with an aftermarket cell that has a different discharge curve than the original you may have inaccurate data until the chip learns the new cell (if it is able to).  </p>
<p>For devices that need a multi-cell battery like a laptop or handheld radio the chip is always in the battery pack itself and performs other duties like a push-button LED gauge on the battery, cell balancing for series cells, and safety functions.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Those TI battery monitor chips are magical. From the factory, they’re accurate to a few %, based on the programmed curve. If you run a few charge/discharge cycles, they calibrate to the individual cell, and they get crazy accurate - better than 1 part in 1000, for the chips I worked with. </p></div>		</li>
