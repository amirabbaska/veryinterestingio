			<div class="markdown"><p>For radio, yes. For household AC current the effect is a lot more minor (I forget the actual numbers.)</p>
<p>Edit: stranded cabling is more flexible, so makes running around corners easier.</p>
<p>Edit 2: for radio frequencies. For actual radio tx/rx the skin effect is something to be aware of, but typically not such a problem. (E.g. coax often has a single strand of core.)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>For radio, actually no. The best wire to use is copperweld which is solid steel core wire which is plated with copper. It's harder to control impedance in stranded cable and copperweld has much higher power capacity vs cost.  For very high power applications they use air core coax built from hollow copper pipe. Stranded is total crap. It's essentially never used except for very short flexible jumpers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ordinary stranded wire is a little better than solid in terms of skin effect. The strands are all in continuous contact. There is a special wire called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litz_wire" target="_blank">Litz wire </a> which is made to minimize skin effect. It uses individually insulated strands and special weaving. It is effective up to 2 MHz. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Haven't seen the right answer for this so I'll chime in. Power conductors are stranded for flexibility. It would be effectively impossible to bend say a 1750 kcmil conductor, which has a diameter a bit over an inch, if it were solid copper/aluminum. The skin effect still takes most of the current density to the outside. The only way this is avoided is by using an entirely separate conductor. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The resistance due to skin effect of stranded is reduced as each individual strand creates it's own skin effect as opposed to one singular skin effect with less surface area. Stranded is used a) because of flexibility and b) can be ordered in different conductor shapes (square vs round strand) for doddering ampacitirs. Obviously at different price points and manufacturers. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If Captain Barnacles is at the surface with the GUP A and Dashi decides to take her bloody time to warn him of a lightning-heavy thunderstorm (I know what I just said, super redundant, but I hate just &quot;thunderstorm&quot;) <em>as it hits</em> he should be submerging in his Gup (as he's told lightning strikes tends to be surface-heavy before a strike fries his gup leading to hijinks) as fast as he can instead on trying to outrun it as it dissipates (exponentially? Is Cube-squared applicable?) along the surface in all directions (in a rough 'plane' along the top) rather than penetrate into the volume. I'd <strong>assume</strong> the current is always trying to take advantage of horizontal, planar, travel which gives the depth a bit of dissipation/almost 'grounding' effect. </p>
<p>Without going into the nitty gritty of why  quite yet, as it's fairly speculative understanding atm, a little googling (NOAA's .gov site, and a solid looking <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deepseanews/2008/03/17/does-lightning-kill-marine-ani/" target="_blank">science blog</a>) tells me this is simply a consequence of water being a good conductor. </p>
<p>In more detail that the science blog give (with links to the wiki's of various concepts) the concept of Gaussian surface (or G.S.) and a Faraday Cage are big factors. Without relying too much on the link and not knowing much about G.S. my intuition says that with simply the concept of the Faraday cage, which in the simplest of explanations, guides the current around the highly conductive mesh leaving you, or just about anything else in relative great safety. This is why you can have people in the mesh suits messing with massive, weaker lightning-scale bolts from (but <em>still lightning</em>, or close to it) massive Tesla Coils do the same thing. Rather than shock the user/content of the cage it travels around and gets grounded, but rather than grounding in the ocean it just tuckers itself out searching for better conductor to travel through. </p>
<p>This is based around the (rather vague, in some ways, but fairly succinct) concept of &quot;path of least resistance&quot;. It just searches for something easier than the surface to travel through until it tapers off. </p>
<p>So even though the ocean is effectively one solid, consistent, conductor, the ideal surface conditions makes for a Faraday cage-effect on the water's surface which keeps the current looking for a better opportunity/path to travel. </p>
<p>I don't know the details of G.S. but I'm stoked to learn. I also read several times that it actually seems to &quot;prefer&quot; striking land. I'm not sure if that's due to peaks in the terrain that cause a &quot;nucleation site&quot; (using the term very closely as it's not a crystal/phase change like the freezing of crystal) for a leader current up from the surface before the actual strike. </p>
<p>I'm definitely out of my element, but I understand some of the principles involved and really just wanted to make a very relevant Octonauts reference, but some preliminary independent research for the post to contribute to the conversation/explanation. </p>
<p>I'll be looking into details to my little collection of questions (why land is preferred over ocean for a strike and if it has to do with leading/leader/teacher trails, the rate of current dissipation with depth (I assume salinity or spiciness of the water is also a remotely relevant variable. Do strikes in the Dead Sea penetrate more or less, why, and if it's more <em>conducive</em> to lightning strikes than your average ocean conditions; what about fresh water?) of the current, what Gaussian Surface really is and how it applies etc.) </p>
<p>I also need to re-reasearch how Faraday cages can block wireless signals between inside and outside of the cage... Feela like it had to do the actual interruption of EMG(?) waves. The lengths of the waves was a factor too, iirc. Which I <em>think</em> is rather similar to the modern protection installed in household microwaves to prevent, or severely dampen, microwaves at their respective wavelength(?). </p>
<p>I wouldn't be surprise if this is rife with inaccuracies, half-facts, and my speculation being stupidly unfounded. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I really couldn't say. </p>
<p>I do know it depends on what direction your body is pointing. As the current dissipates in the resistive seawater, it creates a voltage drop. The lines of equal voltage are circular and are called equipotential lines. If you were floating horizontally on the surface pointing towards (or away from) the strike location, the voltage between your head and feet would be at its highest. That would cause the most current to flow through you. OTOH, if you were laying tangential to the lines, you would experience less voltage and therefore less current. </p>
<p>I had to go through training in case I was in a truck which came in contact with a high voltage power line. If you have to exit the truck because of fire, you're supposed jump off (never touching the ground and truck simultaneously) and shuffle (or hop) away. That way you are not in contact with different equipotential lines. </p></div>		</li>
