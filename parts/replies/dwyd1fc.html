			<div class="markdown"><p>You might wonder, why use two different methods (backscatter and secondary electrons). Secondary electrons only come out of the very top layer of your sample so it give details about the surface of the sample up to about the wavelength of the electron beam (between .1 and .01 nm). Backscatter electrons are much more dependent on the type of material you are using so it can give information on what type of element you are looking at.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So the only thing that is the same in a TEM and an SEM is that they both use an electron beam. An SEM looks at the electrons that 'bounce back' off the sample, in TEM you look at the electrons that are able to travel though the sample. I don't do much TEM work, so I don't know all the physics of the electrons that travel though the sample. However, the electrons of the TEM are afftected by intereactions they have while they travel though the sample, and reflect the elements of the sample (as opposed to the topography and to a lesser extent the elements of the sample found with an SEM)</p>
<p>Because the electrons of a TEM have to travel though the sample you can only take images of very thin things. A lot of work goes into taking slices of your sample so you can have something to use in a TEM. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is not really correct. </p>
<p>Secondary electrons give a lot of information about the elements of your surface. In fact, they are the ones who are usually used to determine what kind of substances your surface consists of. In many vacuum microscope setups, using Auger spectroscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is often the preferred method of verifying whether your surface is clean or has a lot of contaminants. The energy of the secondary electrons is (mostly) independent on the energy of the primary electrons: their energy is very substance specific, even so that for instance silicon oxide will have a shifted peak when compared to a pure silicon sample.</p>
<p>Also, back-scattered electrons only give information on the type of atoms you are looking at if you look at the inelastically backscattered electrons. The elastically scattered electrons are used for different purposes (like determining crystal structure through LEED).</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In typical SEM, Auger electrons are a small fraction of the secondary electrons (many of which come from deeper in the sample), and unless your vacuum is really good (as in your STM), you're not going to get a great deal of information out of them.  What she wrote is broadly correct.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When they first interpreted the signal collected afterwards did they predict how each element/surface would change the signal? Or was it more just placing elements in one at a time and collecting large amounts of data to compare against later?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Image contrast is actually very tricky to interpret. In fact in regular TEM, its almost impossible to uniquely interpret contrast. There are ways, however, to make this somewhat possible. In one imaging mode (called STEM-HAADF), we only look at electrons that have been deflected quite strongly by the atoms they interact with. In this case, the strength of our collected signal is proportional to Z (the atomic number of the atom), and one can make some conclusions about elemental composition. </p>
<p>A more straight forward way of doing this is using the X rays emitted by atoms as fast moving electrons swish past them. However, each of these methods have their limitations.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>When you design a detector, you look at all of the possible interactions for each and every material present in the detector. You typically only want to detect a certain kind of interaction, and all of the other ones become noise.</p>
<p>Design is usually done by theoretical modeling, prototyping, and comparing results with simulations. You use a well defined (in this case electron) source to characterise the detector.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to say how they first did it, because development came in steps. Both development of detectors but also development of our understanding of physics. It’s not like someone first built a detector, then collected all possible elements and scanned them one by one.</p>
<p>Edit:
I think this also might be a good point to mention that instruments like TEMs are quite complex and are built on a multitude of discoveries. You would typically need an electron source, an accelerator, something to characterise your beam (apertures etc), a sample environment, a detector, and a readout system. When the first TEM or SEM or  XEDS or whatever was built, people already had a good idea about what elements looked like.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This is a really great question. As far as I know people really haven't done that, because there are MUCH better ways to collect the information about what the elemental composition of a sample is like EDS/WDS. I think those (EDS/WDS) were found by taking samples of known materials (like salt) and measuring their signals, then comparing them to other samples. </p>
<p>For my group we take whatever it is you want to take a picture of, and then if you want to know what it's made of, switch to a different type of detector and do that. I don't know a lot about how those detectors work. But I think it is a great example of science going 'look we can do this thing' and then turning around and saying 'wft did i just see'. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, both the secondary electron and back scatter detectors are &quot;simple&quot; detectors that give nothing more than a count of how many electrons hit them in a given amount of time. It's not like a digital camera and you take a photo that happens to have been illuminated with electrons.</p>
<p>To get an image, the tightly focused beem rasters across the specimen surface like a CRT tv screen, and the detector counts the amount of electrons when the beem was focused over a specific spot. This makes an image when you translate the amount of electrons over a location to pixel intensity in an image.</p></div>		</li>
