<p>They tried artificial insemination but it's very difficult because rhinos have complex labyrinthine vaginal canals.</p>

<p>Huh, I was curious because I'd heard that pigs have spiral-shaped vaginal canals and there are a number of other species with similar difficulties, wasn't sure how this could be more difficult than that.</p>
<p>All I was able to find was that apparently it's been done <a href="http://zoonooz.sandiegozoo.org/2017/07/24/artificial-insemination-attempted-on-southern-white-rhino-at-san-diego-zoo-safari-park/" target="_blank">several times</a>, there's even a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/av/science-environment-14851977/how-to-artificially-inseminate-a-rhino" target="_blank">BBC article with a video</a>. </p>
<p>Edit: There's even this <a href="www.rhinoresourcecenter.com/pdf_files/125/1257945606.pdf" target="_blank">experimental paper</a> on the topic, but the only detail it provides is really that a catheter is maneuvered into the uterus. </p>
<p>Could I get a little more detail on how they're &quot;labyrinthine&quot; or difficult?</p></div>		</li>
