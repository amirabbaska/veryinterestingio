Gadolinium is toxic, but it's formulated in a chelated, water soluble form that's designed to stay bound to the carrier molecule long enough to exit the body via the kidneys. However it can cross the blood brain barrier, so not all of it will be able to exit the body.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a free ion, gadolinium is reported often to be highly toxic, but MRI contrast agents are chelated compounds and are considered safe enough to be used in most persons. The toxicity of free gadolinium ions in animals is due to interference with a number of calcium-ion channel dependent processes. The 50% lethal dose is about 100â€“200 mg/kg. Toxicities have not been reported following low dose exposure to gadolinium ions. Toxicity studies in rodents, however show that chelation of gadolinium (which also improves its solubility) decreases its toxicity with regard to the free ion by at least a factor of 100 (i.e., the lethal dose for the Gd-chelate increases by 100 times).[25] It is believed therefore that clinical toxicity of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs[26]) in humans will depend on the strength of the chelating agent; however this research is still not complete.[when?] About a dozen different Gd-chelated agents have been approved as MRI contrast agents around the world.[27][28][29]</p>
