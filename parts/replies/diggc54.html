			<div class="markdown"><p>Bizarre! Now I desperately want to know more about the &quot;why&quot; of this, but that Wikipedia article didn't say much. Are these sounds in any way under voluntary control? Do they change pitch when we actively try to listen to a specific sound/voice in a noisy environment?</p></div>		</li>

<p>The vibrations are related to the frequency selectivity of that part of the inner ear.  Different parts of the inner ear vibrate in response to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10946/" target="_blank">different frequencies of sound</a>, and the vibration rate of the outer hair cells is related to the vibration rate of the part of the inner ear they are found in.  They typically only vibrate when sounds are present around those frequencies.</p>
<p>As for &quot;why&quot;, they serve to amplify vibrations at the correct frequency for their location in the inner ear and attenuate vibrations at the wrong frequency. This <a href="http://physiologyonline.physiology.org/content/13/3/107" target="_blank">narrows the frequency tuning</a> of the ear, making a given part of the cochlea sensitive to a narrower range of frequencies and thus increasing our ability to tell different frequencies apart.  </p>
<p>The mechanism is not precisely known. It certainly is related to mechanisms similar to muscles, it is much too fast. It does some to be related to a protein called &quot;<a href="https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v405/n6783/full/405149a0.html" target="_blank">prestin</a>&quot;, since the lack of that protein is necessary and sufficient to abolish these contractions. It is thought to be due to changes in an electrical property of the cell called its &quot;capacitance&quot;, but there is still a lot of debate.</p>
