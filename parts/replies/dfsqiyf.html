<p>So the real question is, why is Jamaica nuts for track?</p>
<p>Part of the answer is institutional. The British first introduced organized and informal athletics, and interscholastic competition, to Jamaica and other colonies in the late 19th century. <strong>One of Jamaicaâ€™s founding fathers, N.W. Manley, was the greatest student athlete of his generation; later, as the revered head of state, he tirelessly promoted track and field.</strong></p>
<p>Jamaica quickly stood out from other Caribbean islands in extending these competitions from elite white schools <strong>to those of the nonwhite classes [ie: the majority of the population.</strong> So now this was a <em>national</em> thing]. Starting early in the 20th century, several outstanding athletes, like G.C. Foster, emerged as role models, mentors and promoters of the sport, and they identified and trained the next generation of talent.</p>
<p>By the time I went to high school in the 1950s, <strong>track and field was as popular among my friends as baseball was among kids my age in Brooklyn.</strong> My heroes were the runners who had triumphed at Helsinki.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There isn't really anything. most poor or small countries just pick 1 sport they are going to focus on. Jamaican neighbours just picked different sports I would assume.</p>
<p>Not everything has a definite cause. sometime its just dumb luck or the combination of an astronomical number of small coincidences ie dumb luck.</p></div>		</li>
