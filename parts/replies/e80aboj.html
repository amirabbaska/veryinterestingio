			<div class="markdown"><p>You want to know something weird? I just learned that I can't think easily of faces, my dog, or anything unless it's in a picture form.</p>
<p>As in, I can visualize the photo with little effort, but thinking of a face independently is much harder.</p>
<p>Huh.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly the same for me, although I realized that a long time ago. Whenever I try to visualize how, for example, my mom looks, I think of a picture of her and that I can see clearly in my head. If I try to visualize her face independently - no way. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Does it help if you manage to temporarily convince yourself that such a photo exists.. and then picture that photo? It does for me. (Actually.. I think this might be what you're saying, but you could be specifically talking about photos that do exist - you've left it open to interpretation a bit)</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As someone with aphantasia, visualizers come to our sub! I think it would make a better discussion if we could get info on what visualizing is like for others, since none of us can do it ourselves. </p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit. I have an extremely great memory and if I could project I could show you a movie of events. But I just realized...all the faces would be blurry. I know who it is...but I canâ€™t picture faces.</p></div>		</li>
