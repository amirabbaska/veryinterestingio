			<div class="markdown"><p>To add to this, doors that are typically high flow/traffic are generally opened outwards so in case of a fire and everyone panicking, the doors can be crowded up against and still be able to be opened outwards. For smaller rooms such as offices or bathrooms there is less traffic and less risk of people freaking out and crowding the door making it difficult to open so having them open inwards significantly reduces the risk of an obstruction outside the door preventing people from getting out.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The Canadian Building and Fire Codes say that is the occupant load for a room/area is greater than 60 the doors have to open out. If the occupant load is greater than 100 you need panic hardware. This is something we take really seriously in the fire service. </p></div>		</li>

Airflow when pushing to get in, pulling to get out would always make the air flow into the restroom, right? I know it's not airtight by any means, but it probably helps a little... doesn't it?</p></div>		</li>
