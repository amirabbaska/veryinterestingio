			<div class="markdown"><p>It does thank you! But to follow up on your question, is there any use of me putting coconut oil on my skin before sleeping at night or would my skin be better off with something else. And what would this something else be? (I have oily skin if that makes a difference at all). </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Coconut oil would act as a barrier to stop moisture from leaving your skin overnight. So if your goal was to improve moisture, you could wash your face first and before it's completely dry, then put the coconut oil on. I'd recommend washing your face first, because the only thing with occlusive barriers is that while they prevent moisture from leaving your skin, they also don't let your pores &quot;breathe&quot; - that could lead to trapped oil, debris, skin cells and lead to a breakout. It sounds like you've been using the coconut oil for awhile so if your skin is tolerating it, it's cool to continue, just something to keep in mind. Hope this helps but please don't hesitate to reach out with any other questions!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Pores don't breathe. Occlusives don't cause blocked pores, it's the molecular size of an oil that determines if it blocks pores. You can look up how comedogenic different oils are online. Coconut oil blocks pores, mineral oil or petroleum jelly doesn't. </p></div>		</li>
