			<div class="markdown"><p>I just want to respond to your edit on Rayleigh scattering because its wrong and we should strive not to spread false information. Rayleigh scattering IS the reason the sky is blue, but its not from water molecules (because there's relatively very little water in the atmosphere). It's from the scattering by the nitrogen and oxygen molecules. The reason the sky isn't violet, however, has nothing to do with our eyes lying to us. That would be true if all the wavelengths were present equally, but the light scattered by the atmosphere is from the Sun, which does not give off violet light very strongly (at least relative to the rest of the visible spectrum, the sun peaks somewhere between the red and green portion of the color spectrum depending on the way you want to measure it and then quickly drops off). The blue color in the sky is because the blue light is strong in the Sun's spectrum, and then nitrogen scatters that light (with a not-insignificant amount of green light added in, which is why the sky isn't a deep blue).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's none of the above. Air scatters a fairly complex spectrum of light, although mostly in the violet-blue range. It's not all violet wavelength or blue wavelength. Tat complex spectrum of light then hits the eyes, which causes cone cells to activate in combination. It turns out that combination is a metamer of blue light+white light; that is, they both result in the same response from our cone cells. </p>
<p>blue light+achromatic light=blue. It appears blue for exactly the same reason complex spectrum can look yellow despite being a mix of yellow, red and green. </p>
<p>Saying that it would appear more violet if the sun produced more violet light or less blue is rather tautological. If something shines more violet light at your face you'll unsurprisingly perceive more violet light. </p>
<p>The sky is blue because we perceive it as blue. Your eyes aren't lying to you, there is no objective colour. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Thank you! Most of this commentor's &quot;facts&quot; are pedantic and based entirely upon simply shunning frame-of-reference.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I may be wrong, but I was taught that the blue light scatters not because it's more abundant, but because it has a much shorter wave length and is more likely to collide with the molecules in the air. This also explains why sunsets are red and yellow, as the light with larger wave lengths is now scattering with more abundance as it is travelling a longer distance through the atmosphere, increasing the chance of scattering on oxygen and nitrogen. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That is right but violet light has a higher spatial frequency than blue so it should (and does) scatter even more than blue light. The reason we don't see a violet sky is a combination of the sun emmiting much more blue light than violet and that the eye is far more sensitive to blue light compared to violet light.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly, when people say &quot;air isn't blue, its Rayleigh scattering&quot;, they should be saying &quot;air is violet because of Rayleigh scattering, but since the sun is more blue green than red, it looks blue &quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to put the TL;DR up here: people should be saying &quot;The sky would be violet because of Rayleigh scattering, but because there's less violet in the sun's spectrum than other colours and because our eyes cannot see violet, the sky looks blue.&quot;</p>
<p>The &quot;air isn't blue, it's violet&quot; statement is all kinds of misleading (if I've understood this).</p>
<p>Instead of air, it should be sky as they're very different things. Instead of the sun being &quot;more blue green than red&quot; (because remember that red has nothing to do with violet), it should just say that there's less violet in the sun's spectrum.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Only partially true. Younger people, especially those who have used corrective lenses with uv-blocking on a regular basis, can see into the ultraviolet spectrum, the 'violet' it seems you're referring to here.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Well ultraviolet is not violet. It is past violet. Humans have blue receptors but all receptors bleed into neighboring wavelengths (colors are regions not points). </p>
<p>We don't have violet receptors and we &quot;see&quot; violet when red is activated - not only when the edge of blue is activated. People without red receptors would not distinguish blue and violet well. Thats the difference. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The point is that humans can perceive it. Vision definitely goes past 400nm down to at least 365nm which is inclusive of the region you're calling violet. Furthermore red cones are not sensitive below 450nm, so light below 400nm doesn't appear red at all, but intensely blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm 40 and I can still see ultraviolet. Example: my daughter grew a bunch of marigolds, they're a mixture of orange and ultraviolet, especially in sun light, wife just thinks they're orange.</p>
<p>Edit: I've worn glasses most of my life but have recently stopped bothering, I guess they were filtering the UV out and protecting my eyes</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I use filtered 365nm lights for work I do and I've tried people in their 20-30s and people in their 60s, and so far only the younger group has been able to see the UV light itself. I imagine there is a cutoff age group among people who wear corrective lenses where UV protection was included standard, and would in theory lead to less cataracts and retained UV perception.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No, it looks blue because ultraviolet registers on the blue cones. Human perception of purple occurs when a material reflects or emits red light and blue light together. Anything past 'blue' still appears to be blue.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>But black is the absorption of all visible colors. Hence if you're down in a cave and turn off the light, everything looks totally black. Because there are no light waves bouncing around, which is the same reason black looks black. </p></div>		</li>
