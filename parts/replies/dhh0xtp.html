			<div class="markdown"><p>It seemed to me that they were asking about fast rotating pulsars versus others as per the title. In any case, that's a tough problem to answer. Unlike with rotating black holes, solutions to rotating neutron stars in general relativity are still an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerr_metric#Open_problems" target="_blank">open problem</a> though I do recall seeing some people claim rather complicated solutions recently but I can't find the paper. For rough numbers, I suggest seeing other /r/askscience answers previously posted, such as this one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3uurur/does_gravitational_time_dilation_impact_a_stars/" target="_blank">here</a> of via <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/10089/gravitational-time-dilation-at-the-earths-center" target="_blank">physics stackexchange</a>. For something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lense%E2%80%93Thirring_precession" target="_blank">frame dragging</a>, the angular momentum comes into play so it depends on both the speed but also the mass/radius, which aren't known so it can't be compared to other neutron stars anyway.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I was talking about the disparity between the parts of the pulsar that are moving quickly and the other parts of the pulsar that are not. I would think that such a steep gradient in relativistic effects would have some rather dramatic effects on the behavior of the star. </p></div>		</li>
