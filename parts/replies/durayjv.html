<p>In my part of the country where electricity is $0.10/kWh, thats $3.50 per year of wasted money. And yes, it makes sense to think in terms of cost, because that gives us a perspective on what we should consider doing relatively speaking to solve these problems. Should you spend $12 on a plug strip you can turn off each day to save half of $3.50 in a year? Probably not. </p>
<p>Sure, millions of such devices add up. And sure it's good to reduce waste where practical. But in many cases it's simply not worth nipping this in the bud.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely correct, it's important to prioritize your efforts. Most homes are losing way more than that through doorways, windows, and/or lacking insulation in the walls or attic. I would much sooner see people replacing their windows and sealing their doorframes than buying power strips for the $4 their TV uses, or the pennies their phone charger uses.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eventually paying to fix the energy inefficiencies will be paid for by the amount you save. I say get those $4 - $10 power strips to completely unplug/ power off electronics and get your house inspected for air leaks and insulation. Fix it all, no matter how small the return of investment. Any return is better than continuing to pour money down the drain. It'll also help mitigate running that one in a million risk of an electrical fire from a faulty electronic, or unwanted creatures getting into your house... Although all of that stuff can happen anyway, but you're reducing chances a bit. </p>
<p>I just like saving money. Hahah.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lightbulbs are also another place where a lot of money is wasted. Incandescent lights are still really popular in the US at least and they use an insane amount of electricity. Nowadays, you can get warm light LEDs for only a couple bucks more than the incandescents. </p></div>		</li>

<p>But in u/gamebusters case it’s not just 4W, it’s 30W (262 kWh per year). And here in Austria it’s more like 0.2€/kWh. So it’s 52€/year. If you need a plug strip in any case, why not buy one with a power switch?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>This^ we also have 0,22€/kWh. And these are &quot;notable examples&quot;. There are likely many more devices in my home that silently consume electricity while unused.</p>
<p>Some of them I leave on, but most are in a powerstrip - I just unplug the powerstrip for my TV stuff after using my TV, and I unplug my computer stuff after using my computer.</p>
<p>It is a low-effort solution to easily shut-down a group of devices and it doesn't cost anything.</p></div>		</li>
