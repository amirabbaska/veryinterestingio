			<div class="markdown"><p>Same (pressing heads into walls) is seen in cats and dogs - also thought to be a symptom of headaches. </p>
<p>In some dog breeds (especially the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel), Syringomyelia is a known cause of very violent headaches - interpreted through some dogs howling in pain, holding their head at weird angles, scratching the head fiercly.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>So what's the typical nsaid dose for a horse? What do you usually give them?</p>
<p>Ps: I got a mental image of a horse chewing up a whole bottle of ibuprofen that it's handler was feeding it, one handful at a time... Like extra crunchy oats.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They can take aspirin but we have NSAIDs just for them, like Bute (phenylbutazone) and Banamine (flunixin meglumine) and Equioxx (firocoxib).  In the US, they all come in injectable (IV route) forms as well as oral pastes that can be squirted into the mouth like anthelmintics already are.  Some of them also come as powders or tablets sized for your average 1000 lb horse. These can be hidden in a treat or just mixed in with their feed depending on how suspicious your horse is. Some can also be dissolved or mixed with something tasty like applesauce or molasses, loaded into a syringe, and squirted into the mouth.  </p>
<p>But you can give horses Benadryl OTC and then youâ€™re right on: 10-20 25mg super crunchy tablets at a time. </p></div>		</li>
