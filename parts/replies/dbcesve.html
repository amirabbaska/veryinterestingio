<p>It's not that I believe it needs bubbles to work, but maybe similar to what you're describing:  I'm using bubble volume as an indicator of thoroughness.  If I don't see suds, then I believe I haven't used enough agitating action to actually get clean, or that the soap is still being overwhelmed by dirt.</p>
<p>I know suds are a marketing trick, but it's very tempting to say I reached this conclusion empirically.</p></div>		</li>
