<p>The most easily identifiable tones inside of any harmony are probably the lowest pitch, the highest pitch, or the root (which could be anywhere inside of the harmony) - however, often times your ear will also be attracted to another note if it's part of the melody, or if one note is played particularly louder than another, or is a distinctive instrument while others are playing (it's all still the same 'chord,' even if it's broken up between multiple instruments). There's a ton of things that factor which note is going to be the most recognizable in any harmony.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You don't use incorrect terms to explain things to people who don't understand things lol, that just makes it harder for them to understand. &quot;Bass note&quot; would've been a fine and easily understandable term.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The last part of your explanation is probably the most accurate one, as
sympathetic frequencies are highly dependent upon the instrument they come from : a saxophone or a distorted guitar produce a lot of overtones, whereas a flute only produce harmonics of root and fifth, thus limiting the diversity of overtones. It works the same with synthesizers, with sinusoidal/square waves.</p>
<p>So sometimes the instruments produces very few overtones and the root being predominant, that's what you hear the most.</p></div>		</li>
