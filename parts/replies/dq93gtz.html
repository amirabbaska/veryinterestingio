			<div class="markdown"><p>I hate to be the guy to tell you this but.... If this Net Neutrality stuff is repealed, and valve doesn't pay up then all steam server access will be significantly slowed.</p>
<p>Bottom line is internet is a network of sub-networks. These sub-networks are owned by ISPs and they make deals to allow one another to route packets through their cables. If this net neutrality stuff is repealed, although the rest of the routing around the world wouldn't be effected much, any routing via the US, or from the US will be subject to the bandwidth limits set by their ISPs.</p>
<p>Think of it as a pipe it doesn't matter how large the pipes are, if there is one section of the pipe that is really small then that is the limiter of the throughput of the entire system. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I would be shocked if they didn't already have servers outside the US, and if they don't, it wouldn't take much to do so. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As a former network operations technician for a Canadian ISP, this is correct, telegreenland's cable is the only subsea fiber I am aware of that does not enter the US before Canada, our other main access routes are in Toronto and Vancouver, but both connect to the US to access international networks. </p>
<p>I can also confirm that their network uptime is mostly ok, but when they do have issues it takes forever to get any progress and dealing with ongoing non outage issues is difficult, also Newfies and Scots have a serious language barrier even though they're both speaking &quot;English&quot;.</p></div>		</li>
