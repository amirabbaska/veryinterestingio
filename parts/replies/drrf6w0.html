<p>The energy released in a GRB obeys the same &quot;inverse-square law&quot; that all radiation does, so distance certainly matters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement mostly false.</p>
<p>Not all radiation obeys the inverse square law. Laser radiation, for example, does not fall off in intensity as one over the square of the distance from the source because it is a tightly focused beam of coherent light, not emission from an incoherent isotropically radiating point source.  What this means is that the effective origin of the light is not at the same point as the source of the radiation; the origin of the source rays is considered to be effectively very distant from the source of the radiation.  </p>
<p>When it comes to most gamma ray bursts, the example of laser radiation is actually rather apt. Most gamma ray bursts originate as tightly focused jets emanating from a central region but perpendicular to the rotation axis of a massive stellar object (aka a star collapsing into a black hole, a merging pair of binary neutron stars, etc). As such, their intensity (photons per second) does not fall off as the inverse square law in the traditional sense.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Eh... well, practically, at a far enough distance, lasers do follow the inverse Square law.  Practical Lasers, not theoretical ones, because we never really get every photon to travel in the exact same vector.  At a great enough distance even the most concentrated emission appears spherical.  But that distance is much greater than say a Super Nova which is basically just a spherical emission.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you had a <em>perfect</em> laser with no divergence (which is pretty much impossible) I would agree.  Realistically speaking, however, all lasers are going to diverge and show 1/r^2 behaviour.  Well, ignoring crazy nonlinear stuff.</p>
<p>Considering a GRB jet is a cone up to 20^o wide, I'm pretty sure 1/r^2 is going to apply there too.</p></div>		</li>

<p>It's actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system#Laser_beams" target="_blank">completely, theoretically impossible</a>, given the laws of optics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The confusion here lies in the definition of r, which is the distance from the origin to the measurement point.</p>
<p>For an isotropically radiating point source, r is the distance from the source to the measurement point because the source and the origin are one and the same. Thus &quot;small&quot; changes in your distance from the source have measurable impact on your measured intensity, because those changes are not so small compared to the distance between the measurement point and the origin.</p>
<p>For a tightly collimated source, r is much much greater than the distance from the source to the measurement point, because the effective origin of the rays emanating from the source lies far behind the source. Thus &quot;small&quot; changes in your distance from the source have very little impact on your measured intensity because those changes are quite small indeed with respect to the distance between the measurement point and the origin.</p>
<p>This may seem like an trivial distinction, but it has a very important role in understanding how GRBs work.  The luminosity calculation of a GRB must take into account the effective origin of the rays. If you treat a GRB as an isotropically radiating point source, your luminosity is so immense that it would imply a source of incomprehensible brightness.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am nobody, but I thought there was some sort of design for near light speed travel by shooting a laser at a small device that would receive the laser thus speeding up indefinitely, gaining more and more speed. So is that just as you say, theoretical, with a theoretical &quot;perfect&quot; laser?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the emission from GRBs is not coherent, and does fall of as the inverse square law. The photons are not emitted parallel to each other, as in a laser.</p>
<p>It is true that the photons (most likely) originate from a tightly collimated relativistic jet (i.e. a fast moving stream of plasma), but to a first approximation they are emitted radially within the cone that is defined by the jet angular size.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It actually doesn't have anything to do with coherence. Even in lasers the photons are not emitted exactly parallel to one another, and all lasers have an opening angle just like a GRB does (albeit much smaller).</p>
<p>The main point of my statement was that blindly applying the inverse square law to radiation emanating from a collimated source will get you the wrong intensity distribution. The intensity does not fall off as the inverse square of the distance from the source, it falls off as the inverse square of the distance from the <em>origin</em> of the rays emanating from the source, which in the case of a collimated beam of radiation is often well away from the source. People seem to bandy about the inverse square law without regard for where the origin is, and it gets them into trouble.</p>
<p>You are correct though that the GRB has had plenty of distance to diverge</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question. If a person were outside when the GRB hit would they feel it immediately, would they just die, or would they not notice at first and have lasting effects afterwards?</p></div>		</li>
