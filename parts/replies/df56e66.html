The problem is much worse than that because the amount of energy it takes to completely destroy and forcefully disperse an object is comparable to the amount of energy released by an equivalent mass of high explosives. And that amount of energy is released extremely early in the process of a nuclear bomb going off.</p>
<p>This has several important effects. One thing most people don't tend to fully appreciate is that when nuclear bombs are &quot;working&quot; they have already exploded, they are like Wile E Coyote hanging above open air next to the cliff. They are already falling apart, and they only have a narrow window of opportunity to operate. Most of the energy released by a fission bomb is released when the bomb core is operating as a gas-phase (fully vaporized) fast fission reactor and the amount of time it operates is about one single microsecond. The other big factor is that because of the multiplicative/exponential nature of energy generation in the bomb when it is going off the vast majority of the energy generated comes at the very end, in only the last few &quot;generations&quot;, each of which has a characteristic timescale of about 10 nanoseconds.</p>
<p>Meaning that if you push a fissile assembly just barely over the borderline into criticality it won't spend much time there because the moment it expands even the smallest amount it will become sub-critical, and will stop building up energy released. You need to have a sufficient buffer of criticality and/or forces acting against the explosion to maintain criticality for enough of that microsecond to get nuclear bomb level yields. In gun assembly bombs this is achieved with a lot of material in the form of much more than 1 critical mass of fissile material (achieved through careful design) and heavy tampers which restrict the expansion of the core for just a little while. In the very early stages of the bomb going off the core will become vaporized and will begin ablating and expanding the tamper like a balloon. But because the core starts off super-critical, it takes a while before it drops below strict criticality, releasing energy all the while. Similarly, in an implosion bomb the core is pushed inward and achieves a super-critical level of compression with the tamper following along, the inertia from the implosion helps maintain criticality for a little while until the bomb core expands too much.</p></div>		</li>
