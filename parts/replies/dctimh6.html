<p>I don't think it's a coincidence that my drawing skills are non-existent, very talented musically but my visualisation ability is awful.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how much it correlates, as I have &quot;full blown aphantasia&quot; or whatever you'd call it when you literally can't see anything in your mind,  but I am still pretty artistically talented and can draw pretty well. I prefer working from a reference photo or picture, but I can draw from scratch if I want.</p>
<p>My own theory is that the picture is there in my brain, I just can't access it consciously. I know all the information that people who can see the picture know, I just can't &quot;see&quot; it. It's incredibly irritating but I'm not sure whether it's as limiting as some people think.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting theory.... like, the screen is on, but only your subconscious is in the room, radio-ing through to your conscious mind with the details?</p>
<p>Reading these replies has shown me that aphantasia doesn't seem to have any correlation with artistic talent (musical or graphical).</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Aphantasia buddies :) I love trying to explain it to people and they are like &quot;but how do you.... KNOW .. what a green triangle is??!?&quot; </p>
<p>I mentioned this elsewhere, but my dad also has it. I have tried and tried to get visualization to work to no avail. I think we're stuck like this. </p></div>		</li>

<p>I don't think it's hopeless, the brain has plasticity up to old age. I wonder if there's also an aspect of atrophy, where we don't use a part of our brain because it's poor to begin with, so we use it less and it shrinks further. </p>
<p>So flipping that the other way, sure we're unlikely to become visualisation experts, but we might be able to improve it. Something else I've just gleaned is that I think there's also a similar element to teen boys all claiming they're Shaggy McShaggingpants (whilst actually being inexperienced). Like, very few people have a clear 'perfect' inner representation of what they're trying to see and we're trying to measure ourselves against a false premise? </p>
<p>Anyway I discovered this video, I'm going to give it a try... Can't hurt, right? :) <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3F2qjtwcMhA" target="_blank">image streaming technique</a> </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Strange.  Very strange.  I'm reminded of what is now called &quot;ASMR&quot;.  I had always assumed that everybody felt that pleasurable tingling sensation in certain scenarios and that it was just a normal part of human experience.</p>
<p>That's why I never talked about it with anyone.  And then I started seeing these videos on Youtube with pretty girls making soothing sounds, and they started talking about this thing called ASMR and I'm like, &quot;Wait, what?  You mean to tell me its a thing that some people don't experienc?&quot;</p>
<p>Freakin' crazy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>ASMR is intriguing, I'd never really gotten into it. But there was a post a few weeks back with a website that let you 'mix your own', it had a bunch of different sliders for different ASMRs.</p>
<p>I guess we're all just wired up different on a neuronal level, what's pleasurable to some people is seen as 'weird' to others. I'm not into BDSM <em>at all</em> but have recently discovered that a gentle slap in the face or being flicked under my jaw feels really nice, 'pleasurable tingling' is exactly how I'd describe it.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Is the tingling extended for a few seconds after the slap?</p></div>		</li>
