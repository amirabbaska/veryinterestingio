			<div class="markdown"><p>vapor is dangerous because contrary to drinking alcohol, once it's consumed there's no way to get it out, ie. puking which is a defense mechanism against poisoning. so once you consume a dangerous amount there's not much to do. same goes for butt chugging or comsumption through any membranes like the eyes, ears, nose, uterus. yes people do that</p></div>		</li>
