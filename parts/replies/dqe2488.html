			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, I represent parents who get their kids taken away for child abuse or neglect. During the initial hearings, the court must make a paternity determination. I had a case where the mother had 5 kids - some from one twin, some from another.  One baby was disputed and each twin claimed the other was the father.  The court ordered a DNA test and because they are twins, the results came out that both had a 99% chance of being the father.  </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also, that happens in mice, we don't know if it will happen in humans, and it very well may not. Humans change those &quot;imprints&quot; (methilation patterns) too, but those changes are local and tissue-specific. For example, there's no reason to change the dna of a muscle cell for an enzime that will only be expressed in the liver. Similarly, there's no reason to change the gametes (sperm cells) since they are not really functional to the parent.</p>
<p>Also, there are plenty of other reasons why you could see that in mice and not in the situation described in humans. First, it sounded like both mom and dad mice were starved. If the mom was starved during or close to the pregnancy, there may have been hormone signals to let the baby mice know they should turn on &quot;starving mode&quot;, so the &quot;imprints&quot; wouldn't really have been passed on, but generated independently in the second-generation mice.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Strangely it kinda does, in a way. He was wrong about the whole &quot;giraffe that stretches to reach high branches during life will produce taller offspring&quot; theory, but the basic idea wasn't completely wrong.</p>
<p>Until we have a much deeper understanding of whether or not there are concrete effects, he won't be fully vindicated. Even then people will still point out that he wasn't really correct and had a ballpark explanation by chance.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Trangenerational epigenetic inheritance does not vindicate Lamarckism. The capacity for these changes is an evolved one, which comes about via natural selection. It's effectively a form of phenotypic plasticity. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Lamarck was still wrong. Ignoring the bit where &quot;chopping off the body part of a parent&quot; should lead to the offspring not having that body part, there's still an issue of genetic variance.</p>
<p>Epigenetics is a modification of genetic function that's inheritable, but an easier way to explain it would be &quot;We didn't realize there was genes that could have multiple functions and have those modified functions passed down&quot;. But unlike what Lamarck thought, you're still hard limited to what genes can and can't do, even if there's more flexibility than we initially expected in the system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>While epigenetics would be different I don't think they test for that. Epigenetics just turns dna segments on or off, packing or unpacking around histone proteins. While this changes the expression of the DNA it does not change the actual code. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Correct, but we do have the ability to check for methylation/acetylation of specific histones. Of course I would imagine this isn't readily available for paternity tests, lol.</p></div>		</li>
