<p>It is important to realize that the rule in Lambert is: Notice is a requirement imposed by Due Process in situations where a penalty may ensue from an individualâ€™s failure to act.</p>
<p>It is important to note that using a Lambert defense is really a last resort--the only worse defense would be a public policy defense which you would use if you have absolutely nothing else.</p>
<p>Has a Lambert defense ever worked? It did at least one other time in the Ninth district--but it really is a very specific and unlikely defense.</p>
<p>An interesting question is whether the court would have ruled the same way if instead of being a local law--if the registration law was a state law. I believe that it would have been decided differently.</p></div>		</li>
