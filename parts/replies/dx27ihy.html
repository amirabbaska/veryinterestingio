			<div class="markdown"><p>Good answer. See also why elephants move relatively slow and never really make jumping motions when moving. The enormous weight means jumping has a good chance at destroying their knees or ankles.</p>
<p>It's not as extreme with adults and kids, but if you twist your ankle as a 200 pound adult male, it's going to do a lot more damage than if you're a 50 pound boy. Healing will take longer because of the extra damage, but also because people heal more slowly when they're old. </p>
<p>I would argue that things like that lead to adults being more careful in their movements, because making a mistake ends up having a bigger impact.</p>
<p>Anecdotally: I can say that when I twist an ankle now at 33, I feel it for much longer than when I was a young teen. It'll feel weakened for weeks instead of days.</p>
<p>-edit-
And it's even worse when you get really old. Slipping or tripping at 80 years old could literally shatter your bones, while it would just cause a nasty bruise at 30ish. Even if you have the capacity to move fast, you don't want to take that risk.</p></div>		</li>

<p>confirmed.  i'm 63.  i've always been very active but good gawd, i pay far more for accidents now than i ever used to.  something that used to keep me down for a few days now messes me up for weeks or months.  </p>
<p>plus, i find i'm revisited by the ghost of injuries long past.... that time i slammed my back 35 years ago, racing down the steepest hill in town when my front wheel dropped into a recessed sewer grating i didn't see in the dark?  it's back!!!   that knee i fell  on years ago?  meniscectomy!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Same. I'd recently starting feeling achy joints. So I'm doubling down on ice baths, glucosamine, omega 3s, turmeric, 81mg aspirin, and low carb. I won't go down without a fight goddamnit!!!</p>
<p>The ice baths are a miracle - 3-5 min in 45Â° water, and I'm pain-free for at least 3 days. It's nuts.</p>
<p>Inflammation is the enemy.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Try being 300 lbs. Things like jogging can become risky, and the extra g's while carving on skis is a HUGE toll on your quads. Just going down to 250 made a world of difference on moving. The squared cubed law ain't no joke.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I'm 250 myself (most i've been is 265). High impact exercise like running is usually not recommended when you're this heavy or heavier. Bicycling is much better for your joints until you lose a few pounds.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Edit: I'm going to risk going down a weird alley here, but I think I've also just realised part of what gives many dreams I have such a distinct 'feel' from waking life - I'm the adult I am now, but physics is more like it was when I was five.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>From personal experience, this is what I believe to be the best answer.  I recently visited a couple countries with, let's say, among the shortest populations in the world.  One thing that stood out to me was their energy.  It was perfectly normal for adults to run at any time.  I remember being woken up by the hotel receptionist running door to door to deliver checkout slips.<br />
It could be a case of 'correlation is not causation', but this explanation makes a lot of sense.</p></div>		</li>
