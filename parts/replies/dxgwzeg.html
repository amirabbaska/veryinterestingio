			<div class="markdown"><p>How do they not exist? Since it's all auditory frequencies, E is about 330Hz and F is about 349, can't E# be somewhere in between, maybe 340-ish?</p>
<p>And what is a &quot;semitone&quot;, versus a &quot;tone&quot;?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>E# is essentially the same note as F. E and F are a half-tone apart, and sharp is defined to mean &quot;a half-tone higher&quot;. </p>
<p>The other poster <del>is wrong</del> was oversimplifying in saying that those notes do not exist. E# is the 7th tone in an F# major scale, for example.</p></div>		</li>

<p>I was ELI5ing: I almost considered adding a note to explain further, but decided against it.</p>
<p>There are some specific cases where you might have the note E♯: specifically, if F♯ is in the key signature and you want to represent a note one <em>diatonic</em> semitone lower before an F♯, you would write an E♯. Writing an F♮ followed by an F♯ would be a <em>chromatic</em> semitone.</p>
<p>EDIT: I now realize, of course, that this includes the key signature of F♯ major which includes an E♯, so I do take your point.</p>
<p>However -- and the reason I chose to tell a little white lie here -- E♯ and F are <em>not</em> considered to be the same note, and in fact they can sound very slightly different. They only sound the same in equal temperament, where the octave is divided into 12 equal semitones; but other tunings are possible, such as quarter-comma meantone and Pythagorean tuning.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>technically they do exist, but it's redundant to call a note &quot;E sharp&quot; when it's the exact same note as &quot;F&quot;. There's no need to over complicate things by having multiple names for the same note</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>However, F# and Gb, A# and Bb, C# and Db, D# and Eb are the same notes. Iirc, it has to do with notation of the particular key. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>E# &quot;exists&quot; in the sense that a frequency of 340hz can be played, but it doesn't exist according to the rules of western music. What makes music is not the notes, but the distance between the notes. There are defined intervals between notes which makes an f different from a g. That's why a song can be played in all of the different keys and still sound exactly the same. The notes are different, but the distance between the notes are exactly the same.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A frequency of 340hz can be played, however this is <em>not</em> E#. In music, a sharp purely means &quot;one semitone above the written note&quot;. E# does exist within the rules of Western music, it's just easier to call it F. If you wrote a piece and included E#, it wouldn't sound any different than if you just wrote F, but you would <em>technically not</em> be incorrect to call it E#. This is just redundant in 99% of cases. If I were to play a note at a frequency of 340hz, this would be called E half-sharp, not E#. These single notes having different names is called <em>enharmonic spelling</em> and is a big part of advanced harmony and music theory.</p></div>		</li>
