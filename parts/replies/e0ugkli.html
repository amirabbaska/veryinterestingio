			<div class="markdown"><p>What is in that filter might not be fresh, but filter out things that were already in the air.  So every time air passes through that filter, there are few foreign bodies than the air you would get outside.</p>
<p>It's no different than filtering and then re-filtering the same water.  On subsequent filtering, it never comes out with more contaminants than it went in with.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The process of treating the air inherently dehumidifies it. So while you’re not wrong—a dirty system/filter can add contaminants—it will also be removing humidity, if nothing else. </p>
<p>I don’t think either one of our comments does much to answer OP’s question, though. </p></div>		</li>

<p>And most places will have filters, the filter in an A/C system is really there to protect the heat exchanger and stop the dust coating it and reducing its capacity and efficiency.</p>
<p>If you dont have filters, after a while you'll know it from the complaints</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The filters on an AC are very unlikely to be effective at improving air quality. Those filters are really just to prevent damage and dust buildup in the ducts and fan, and do little to remove contaminants. In any case, indoor air quality is generally worse than outdoor air quality.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what filter you put on your AC.  You can get some very good ones and even find HEPA filters for most furnaces and AC units.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>What I guess I failed to say is that the AC doesn't somehow make the air magically dirty.  The dirt in the filter comes from the air.  (I guess I wasn't thinking things like bacterial or fungal growth, either.)   </p></div>		</li>

<p>My HVAC units in my basement and I can open the windows down there and get some fresh air in the house because the HVAC unit will circulate the air through the house with fresh air from the windows.</p></div>		</li>
