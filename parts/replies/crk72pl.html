			<div class="markdown"><p>Where I live in California the coke in the glass bottles comes from Mexico. They use real cane sugar in their Coke down there. Unlike America which uses High Fructose Corn Syrup. I find the taste to be very different and prefer the cane sugar to the HFCS.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Coca-Cola claims that Mexican Coke exported to the United States is made with cane sugar, while some bottlers may use high-fructose corn syrup for drinks intended for sale in Mexico.[4] Therefore, while coke labeled &quot;Mexican&quot; in the US will be made with cane sugar, not all coke sold in Mexico will.&quot;</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I find the taste to be closer to what I remember as a kid, I can pop lids off with my Bic lighter (which was a skill I lacked) and it's a small enough serving that it's an attractive alternative to the 44 ounce bucket of brown fizzy gutsludge. I usually buy water and wont return to the store if the coolers aren't run full bore... and if they are super cold and I'm in the mood... I get a Mexicoke.</p>
<p>That's it for me, that's the whole mystique. Real Sugar soda sucks by the way 50% of the time. Real Sugar DP is great. Real Sugar Pepsi and Mountain Dew are awful requiring a MD 20/20 level of cold to even swallow. Also, best mass marketed root beer (Weinhardt's) uses HFCS... which blows the whole real sugar argument (media generated) out of the water.</p>
<p>ALSO... I wanted to bring up New York Seltzer which I just googled and as of a few days ago, they are evidently bringing back. Ever have New York Seltzer out of a can? It's why they went out of business. The bottles were great and people loved them... the cans literally made your fillings hurt with all the aluminium fizzing into it. There is no Glass vs. Can debate... there are only the advances made by beer companies that have the unfortunate side effect of bitchtits.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>AFAIK, the Heineken professional taste team isn't able to tell the difference between beer poured from a can and beer poured out of a bottle. (Or maybe it was Coca Cola, and not Heineken, either way, some massive beverage company)</p>
<p>So, quality perception is very much influenced by things that aren't part of the chemical makeup of a certain product. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It may also be safe to say the difference in taste would be much more notable when you are drinking strait from the container, if your lips are on the can you ate going to taste metal even if it does not affect the actual taste of the liquid.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe it's more subtle than that - the feeling of a different material creates a different experience, so to speak. The idea is that these peripheral sensations affect how we perceive the drink even if they don't directly impact the senses in question</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's actually a movement among beer geeks that cans are better than bottles because whatever taste effect the polymer lining in the can has on taste is more than compensated by the can's positive effect in freshness conservation from not letting light into the beer.<br />
This applies only if you pour into a glass before drinking, of course.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>It's not just a movement, it's the truth (but acceptance of cans is definitely a movement). Cans are inherently better at protecting a beer's flavor than bottles. They block 100% of UV light, rather than the ~95% that the brown bottles block. It's SCIENCE!</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The drink isn't in contact with the metal. All cans are lined with a polymere (some 'plastic') coating to avoid oxidization or the metal.</p>
<p>This is even more noticeable on food cans (beans etc.), where the coating can be a thick, white, rubbery layer. This is why it is so dangerous to heat a can of beans or alike directly over the fire without pouring it into a different container.</p></div>		</li>
