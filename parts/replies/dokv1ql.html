			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the fundamental flaw of the Euro is that each country in the EU controls their own budget - but they don't control money supply, which means they don't have the ability the influence the currency  they are transacting in and borrowing with. So, imagine it's your job to adjust Europe's money supply to keep the economy humming. You look at Greece, high deficit spending and rising unemployment. If you controlled money supply, the solution would be to start printing more money in an effort to lower interest rates, boost demand, and bring down the country's unemployment rate. But then you have another country Germany, where the economy is booming and they have low unemployment. Increasing money supply would just lead to inflation which would hurt their economy. In fact, Germany may even need a rise in interest rates to prevent their economy from overheating. So the exact opposite approach needed for Greece. </p>
<p>So there is a problem, in that Greece is able to embark on deficit spending and can assume a lot of debt, but it does not have the ability to influence interest rates and inflation. There is a central authority that controls money supply for all Euro countries, and yet there is no centralised control over budgets (fiscal policies on spending) banking regulations or a frictionless, common labour market. </p>
<p>This was fundamental design flaw from Day 1. It was done this way for political reasons, not economic, as no country in Europe would have accepted a single currency if it meant giving up sovereignty over their own budgets. So it was a compromise,  but we are seeing the impact of that now. </p>
<p>EDIT: i realized this comes across as a bit pessimistic. In my view there is a solution and it isn't the abandonment of the common currency. It is actually much tighter fiscal and labour integration of the common market. There needs to be more integration, not less. And that might be possible now the UK has left the EU. There is a bright side to Brexit. Countries are going to have to give up a fair degree of &quot;sovereignty&quot;. And there needs to be major reform of the EU political and administrative structures so that they are more streamlined, more efficient and much more responsive and in tune with the needs of individual regions. The alternative is complete disintegration of the EU - and in all likelihood a huge drop in the standard of living and a return to competitive, hostile national borders where it's every country for themselves. And in all likelihood a return to a constant state of conflict that defined Europe for centuries. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>You're pretty much spot on with all of that, but I think the <em>key</em> flaw in European integration is the lack of a substantial transfer payment system. In federal countries, like Canada or the US, there are systems to move money around from one region to another based on economic need, whether implicit (e.g. taxes and services) or explicit (e.g. transfer payment programs). A key feature of any government is to take taxes from wealthy parts of the country and spend on services in poorer parts in order to spread wealth around. For political reasons, however, this doesn't happen on nearly the same scale in the EU.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yes, exactly. I sort of alluded to that when i mentioned the need for a centralized fiscal/budgeting policy. It's a political hot potato though, and you already see in the US the push to devolve things to the State level - for the US to go more in the direction of the EU when it come to budgets, which makes no real sense. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, I wonder how many of Greece’s problems were caused by the fact that I don’t believe they actually met the requirements to enter the Eurozone. A centrally-controlled currency has seemed to work quite well for west European countries that are relatively close in wealth terms; it’s when they started letting less economically-developed countries in that problems started to appear</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>In fairness, Ireland would probably have been better off with control of her own currency and interest rates. The ECB basically ran monetary policy for the benefit of the economic conditions in major EU powers, and Ireland was booming while Germany wasn't. Holding interest rates low for the benefit of the German economy led to runaway overheating of the Irish economy, particularly the housing market. If Ireland had had independent control of exchange and interest rates, they could have applied the brakes, but the ECB was never going to do that when it would only benefit a minor economy. All of this happened at a time when Ireland was, by any per-capita standard, one of the wealthiest countries in Europe and wasn't &quot;less economically developed&quot; by any means. It was just out-of-synch in the economic cycle.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Ireland, Spain, Portugal.  Perhaps even Italy.</p>
<p>Any time you could have a recession in one area and a boom in another without a unified government to balance things with taxes and transfer payments then unifying the currency is a not a good idea.</p>
<p>They did it for political unity, not economics.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, the euro works well in parts of the Eurozone with similar types of economy less so in others. Whether that's an implementation problem or a massive fundamental flaw is up for debate.</p></div>		</li>
