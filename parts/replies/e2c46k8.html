			<div class="markdown"><p>A free neutron can decay into a proton because the weak force allows it to. When you have a bound nucleus with A &gt; 1, it’s meaningless to consider the stability of individual neutrons. It’s the stability of the nucleus as a whole that determines if and how it will decay.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>this is a harder concept to explain, but I'll throw my hat in to explain.</p>
<p>basically, a system (like an atom) wants to be in its lowest state. this is just a general law of physics and you see it all over the place. low energy states are often called &quot;stable&quot;. </p>
<p>it turns out if you have an atom with a neutron, keeping the neutron as a neutron is the lowest energy state.
however, if the neutron is by itself, there exists a lower energy state which is if the neutron splits up into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino. </p></div>		</li>
