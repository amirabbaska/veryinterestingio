<p>In smaller ships the first segment is heavy chain, precisely so the chain lays flat on the bottom and the anchor can do it's work (they work almost exclusively when you try to drag them horizontally, not because of their weight). The rest can be lighter chain, or many times rope.</p>
<p>The chain hanging the way you describe would only work to get the boat closer to the point where the anchor landed, but if the anchor itself is not doing it's work, the whole system would drift together.</p></div>		</li>

<p>Sorry, you are correct about the chain actually resting on the floor. It's not the entire length of anchor chain, mind you, but enough to make the anchor flukes turn horizontally and dig and for the chain itself to rest still and provide that hefty weight. </p></div>		</li>
