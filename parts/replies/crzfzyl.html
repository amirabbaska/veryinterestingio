			<div class="markdown"><p>Are the corn/soybean subsidies from the federal level or state level? Or are these subsidies available for only large productions such as feed lots? To my knowledge the reason for corn and soybean consumption is due to the high protein content rather than the subsidies for the crop. The only subsidies we have available, that I have heard of, deals with CRP ( Conservation Reserve Program) where you let your land go fallow for 10 years to document what native grasses will come back.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>As part of his sweeping mass of new deal legistlation, FDR  passed the Agricultural Adjustment Act.  The act identified seven key staple crops, where the federal government acted to indirectly manipulate the market by paying farmers not to grow crops in certain cases to keep market supply and demand in check.  In times when supply outpaced demand, farmers could sit on their extra crops, receive a check from the government, and then sell off the excess yield when supply markets rebounded.</p>
<p>Nixon gutted this system, and we're left with what we have today.  Farmers still receive federal subsidies, but instead of capping supply, the government has installed an artificial price floor for these crops.  Say that the real market price of corn falls to $1.00 because of so much production, but the farmer's variable cost is $1.50.  He has no incentive to sell on the open market; the government will buy those crops at $1.50.  Thus, the farmer is given a government subsidy and incentivized to produce as much quantity as possible, since the price will never sink below a guaranteed set point.</p>
<p>This is one of the contributing reasons why we're currently sitting on a mountain of corn and soybeans for all sorts of secondary uses we never could've imagined a hundred years ago.  Source: Omnivore's Dilemma.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>That actually got changed in the last farm bill.  Farmers no longer get Huge deficiency payments, they have to pay into federal crop insurance and if it is below the minimum price/yield, the insurance pays out.  Also the government does not go around and buy crops, they still get sold on the open market.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The book you are quoting is a terrible source and you don't quite have it right. The USDA used to set a price floor for grain crops which was intended to keep the market price above the cost of production. The price support was very rarely enacted. However this didn't make beef less expensive, on the contrary farm subsidies raise the price of beef by making corn more expensive. There are some ranches that benefit from access to federal lands for grazing, but for the most part, beef prices are based on the open market.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>people love to bitch about the government paying farmers not to grow crops, but it was necessary legislation at the time.  Thousands of people were buying cheap land and trying to farm without any idea what they were doing.  Overfarming and not rotating their crops ruined millions of acres of farmland and started the dust bowl.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The reason organic stuff is so expensive is because they don't use the farming practices that give good yields and limit spoilage, so more material and energy is required to get the same amount of food to you.  Yes, there are pesticides, but it's a trace amount that does not seem to make a difference. They can affect the local ecosystem if used improperly, but there are measures to limit those effects. </p>
<p>TL;DR: organic foods aren't eco-friendly, sustainable, healthier, or &quot;green&quot;</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Maybe I just should have said &quot;produce&quot;. Even if you don't buy organic, it's cheaper to buy a grocery cart full of junk foods full of corn syrup and trans fats (hydrogenated soybean oil) than fruits, vegetables, nuts, or pasture raised meat.</p>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people don't own property on which to grow food. You can grow a few herbs and tomatoes in containers on a balcony, but what if you only have shade or a northern exposure? Community gardens are a great idea, but they often do not exist in low income communities. And even if they did, how do you haul around a wheelbarrow and a shovel if you don't have a truck?</p>
<p>It's a bit harder than people think. BUT - I love to garden and I wish it were easier for everyone. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I believe corn and soybeans are far too valuable to be used as animal feed. Cattle are fed corn meal and soybean meal, which is the stuff leftover when the human usable components are extracted. Therefore the water required to grown soybeans and corn should not be completely added into the water requirements.
Also, cattle feed consists of wheat, oats, barley, rye, triticale, and few others grains. And alot of these grains are graded into different categories depending on their quality e.g. disease, kernel size, protein %, and the lowest grade is feed, which is the grain not suitable for human consumption.</p></div>		</li>
