			<div class="markdown"><p>Exactly this. Adding more checkout stations is difficult, so they build the most they think they could possibly ever need at the start and then man them as needed. </p>
<p>Also worth noting that OP may just always go at odd hours (week days, early morning, late evening, etc). If you go to a popular Walmart at like 11 am on a Saturday, they have well over half the registers open. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Not my Wal-mart. I've been there at 6pm on a Saturday and they have three lanes open besides self checkout and the lines for each are about 10 or 15 people deep.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They always under staff on Saturday nights. I don't know why, but it's definitely the worst time to go. Worked there for a few years as a customer service manager and I always worked saturday nights and it never went well.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>6pm on a saturday is not peak shopping time of day. Peak shopping times of day are around 2 pm and around 8pm. Saturday is also not a primary shopping day. Those tend to be Fridays, Sundays, and Wednesdays. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Even that is going to be dependent on the market. If a store has customers who don't stop shopping there because of lines, or don't have any other store to go to, why would they open another lane? You could have two equally popular Walmart stores by some arbitrary metric (customer satisfaction ratings, sales, etc), but wind up with different counts of open registers at peak times. </p>
<p>I'm studying business analytics, this kind of question gets me all excited inside. Now I need some Walmart data sets and a tub of KY. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>If you want some insight, in high school/first two years of college I worked at a retail store (however it wasn't Walmart, but principles should be similar). One thing is that lines are really bad for business. Yes, even monoliths like Walmart do not like seeing everyone in lines so they will always open more up (given that they have a good head cashier on duty). I was head cashier and my job was to always make sure I had cashiers where they needed to be and to call more up/jump on if lines started forming. There will always be more cashiers around even if they're not on the register at the moment, they could just be doing another task. So it's never usually an understaffing thing too. But to get to the point, retail companies figure that it's still better to always have extra cashiers handy because dealing with everyone (and I mean everyone) being cranky from standing in line is just absolutely not worth it, even in the biggest companies. And to add off topic, I'm also going into analytics! My major is math so I'm focusing more on the statistical side, especially inventory analytics. Really cool stuff.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Plus, it allow an easy change of shift. New employe get in, open a new lane. Ending staff finish their client, then can take time to close proprelly with no rush. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>They probably don't count the cash, but sometime it take some time to make the report, grab the coupons that some used and some paperworks. It take some minutes sometime, plus their personal belongings (water bottle for example).</p></div>		</li>
