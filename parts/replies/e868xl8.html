			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh you mean currency? The central bank can create as much money as it wants, since currency is issued in their name.</p>
<p>The Central bank has an interest rate for commercial banks. They can lower the interest rate &amp; encourage commercial banks to save less with them &amp; spend more in the economy, stimulating economic growth.</p>
<p>The central bank is expected to be prudent within their control over money supply. They have target levels of economic growth &amp; inflation, and try to balance the new money created to meet these targets.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>No. The money.</p>
<p>Whether it is in currency, or electric digits, where does the extra money come from, when you add up all the money together.</p>
<p>I can't just magically wave my hands over the ATM and change the electronic digits in my bank account, neither can anyone else.</p>
<p>If I gave 4 of my friends $1,000 each, and with the stipulation that they can only give that to each other to buy stuff from each other, it will always add up to $4,000.</p>
<p>I guess if I give one of the other 4 people an IOU, and charge them interest, then I create money for them. But it would seem, at <em>some</em> point, even in a complex dynamic system, it will <em>eventually</em> fall down like a house made of cards. I mean, as long as everyone is giving everyone else IOUs, then this can create enormous amounts of wealth generation. Especially when massive productivity gains are realized, like with computers and technology gains millions of times in increase of productivity, which would not be possible without credits and loans, because no one has that much money in cash on hand.</p>
<p>But, in some massive calamitous cataclysmic downturn, everything falls apart much harder than if this wasn't the case. I mean, what would happen if minor disruptions happened, like all truck lines couldn't get into Los Angeles for 5 weeks for a combination of factors. How would people eat? 7 million people would die. This would not happen in  a less sophisticated system, because you couldn't support a 7 million metropolis without modern efficient systems.</p>
<p>What the hell am I even talking about.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Oh in that sense it's quite simple.  Wealth is generated by owning things which generate more money than they cost to maintain.  If you own a business that is successful, that means it makes more money than it spends on its operating costs, and eventually you could pay off your startup cost and start making real money.  </p>
<p>Everybody owns stuff that can generate revenue, even if you're just a regular person, you own <em>yourself</em> and can work to generate money to offset your cost of living (operating costs) and hopefully pay down startup costs like loans or other debt.  </p>
<p>The two biggest sources of wealth creation are banks and investors.  Investors put their money in things they think will make them money.  Banks do the same, but can get money from the government to do it to drive the economy.  The more money banks get for loans, the more they can invest in businesses or individuals via loans, essentially providing the startup costs for people or businesses to start generating wealth.  You gotta spend money to make money.  </p>
<p>The world is one big balance sheet.  Understand a balance sheet and it's pretty simple.  Income, expenses, liabilities, equity.  That's pretty much it.  What you earn, what you spend, what you owe, and what you own.  </p>
<p>The currency itself is basically generated by the government to invest in the nation's economy.  Like anybody else, they are trying to turn a profit, but for the government, the profit is actualized in an improved economy, not a direct return on each investment.  The bank, instead, acts as the government's agent and makes the interest on the loan of that new cash.  </p>
<p>Why not just make more money for everyone?  Because bad investments are worse than no investments.  Making bad investments on a national level causes the &quot;bubbles&quot;.  The internet bubble burst when investors realized the internet startups they were investing in didn't actually know how to make money out of their amazing ideas.  The construction bubble burst when homes no longer constantly went up in value as expected.  The finance bubble burst when banks realized all the loans they gave to homeowners who couldn't pay had become unsustainable.  Bad investments.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, but the money from investors still has to be made somewhere. It doesn't magically appear in the investors' bank accounts, so that is not valid. Where does the extra money come from, if the economy is taken as a whole?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>A quick question. How do you have unlimited economic growth if the planet itself is limited in resources? Doesn't this value adding system signal an eventual collapse?</p>
<p>I don't understand much about economics but if I was an economist who wanted to see perpetual growth, what happens when reserves of something get really low?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I'm not going to argue that growth will literally be &quot;unlimited&quot;, but resource limitations aren't a great argument against it. Most innovations that create growth aren't about using more and more resources, but about more cleverly combining the resources we have. We had water and coal for a long time, but someone had to figure out how to design a steam engine before it could displace other forms of transportation. Today, we have the same number of photons showering down on us as ever before, and there's good reason to hope cleverness will allow those (and other power sources) to displace (largely) coal, petroleum, and natural gas. Cleverness may have its own limits, but I don't think we're very close to those.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There probably is some end to economic growth but I do not think we are close. There are a few factors that come to mind when I read your question and consider the &quot;end&quot; of growth:</p>
<p>1) The resources of Earth have not nearly been fully developed or utilized, there are still vast forests all over the globe, there is still a lot of ore beneath our feet, etc. and while we have to use these resources in a sustainable manner (and some have been more used than others), there are still a lot of resources available and new uses of what we think of as &quot;useless resources&quot; to be discovered.</p>
<p>2) Some resources are able to be replenished or recycled. (replanting forests, protecting a species of animal, etc.)</p>
<p>3) Technological advances allow us to use fewer resources at once. (We used to only know how to make 45,000 kWh of electricity with 14,000kg of coal, now we know how to do it with 1kg of uranium).</p>
<p>Outside of just natural resources I think the following elements should be considered as well when theorizing about the &quot;end&quot; of economic growth:</p>
<p>4) Population growth. A growth in population means an increase in the productive outputs of society. An example of this is that it is better to live in a booming city because there are new businesses opening, new customers arriving, culture is developing, etc, as opposed to living in a city where the population is decreasing where you are losing customers, losing businesses, there is decreasing demand in the local market making it more difficult for you to be able to sell your house or get a different car, etc. This same effect happens on the global scale although the effects will be more regional when considering the global scale.</p>
<p>5) Another resource to consider is time. We are able to reap the benefits from earlier generations or our own prior years of life.  The things we are building and developing right now will allow future generations to build and develop even more. (An earlier American generation built the interstate highway system and now the younger generation can just use that already existing output to improve shipping times to facilitate trade in a faster manner over larger areas, it has expanded the marketplace to which we have access)</p></div>		</li>

<p>That is a great question. Ideally, the invisible hand will make that thing get more expensive, creating an economic incentive for someone to create a way of obtaining/creating more, or finding an alternative to use. Look at silk then nylon. Silk is hard to make, the supply is always going to be limited. When people created more things to use silk in, the supply of silk got stretched thin. DuPont then spent quite a bit of money on developing a synthetic competitor, nylon. They did so because they thought it would make them very rich, which it did.</p></div>		</li>
