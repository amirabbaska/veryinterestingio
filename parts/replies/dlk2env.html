			<div class="markdown"><p>Me too! Right before my period I somehow have the nose of a God damn bloodhound. I can smell weird things too. Our dishwasher doesn't stink, but has a distinct dishwasher smell when you are loading it and have to get close. Sometimes I know my period is coming because that's all I can smell in our kitchen and it makes me nauseous, even with it closed and locked for washing. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I think the best way to describe it would be &quot;yogurty&quot;. </p>
<p>I love yogurt, too, but something about the smell of when I'm about to menstruate is just vile. </p></div>		</li>
