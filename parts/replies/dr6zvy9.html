			<div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, that has always made the most sense to me. But I have very little background in bio. Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the fact that it's something shared by plants, fungi, and animals pretty much prove that it started well before multicellular organisms? Second, doesn't that seem to imply that the increased variation was fundamental to multicellular organisms evolving?  Also wondered if there is a theory that cannibalism or parasitism might have evolved into sexual reproduction as counter strategies. Also, do they believe that sexual reproduction led to eukaryotes?</p></div>		</li>
