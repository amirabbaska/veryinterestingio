			<div class="markdown"><p>They do it in the gang world too, it's called fluffy fingers.  When someone gets in your face, you just start tickling them, and then he starts tickling you too.  Pretty soon you're laughing and hugging, and before you know it, you forget the whole thing and can go to church together and get an ice cream cone.</p>
<p>It's effective.</p></div>		</li>

This gives them the option to test me (they always do) but can also escape by uncontrollably throwing themselves off the couch to the ground.  Everyone wins.</p></div>		</li>
