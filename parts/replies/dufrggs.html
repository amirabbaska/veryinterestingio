			<div class="markdown"><p>Also please remember that generation time in mayflies is much longer than one day.  They are <em>adults</em> for a day, but live as nymphs under water for at least a year before that.  They spend the grand majority of their lives under water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>And thus selection would mostly occur with respect to mayfly larvae rather than adults right?</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Speculation, but I'd imagine that the genes that helped the adult find a mate as a fully formed insect would also be passed on to its offspring, so both. Mayflies with faulty genes when it comes to their adult form will not get to mate, and therefore will not pass on their genes. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There's no <em>a priori</em> way to know.</p>
<p>The adult form is the only chance they have to reproduce, and surviving without reproduction is an evolutionary failure.</p>
<p>If 80% of larvae survive to adulthood, but only 10% of adults manage to reproduce in that one day, then the pressure would be much higher on the adult phase.  If those percentages are reversed, then the pressure on the larval stage would be greater.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>The adults <em>only</em> live above water, for about a day or so.  Mayflies live aquatic lives, and they end it all in a one day splurge of reproduction then death.  They don't even eat after they emerge from the water.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>There are other species, like the Crustaceans adapted to Vernal Pond ecosystems, who spend the majority of their time in diapause. </p>
<p>The lifespan of the individual organism is from 8 to 12 weeks but an embryo in a cyst sits dormant for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>The European long-tailed triops are one of the candidates for oldest existing species but it's not really fair since they've spent most of that 360 million years sleeping.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Mayflies have a generation time of 1 year, not 1 day. I study parasitoid wasps which have a generation time of 12 days. They live on aphids , which are parthenogenic (100% female, born gravid) in the summer and have a &quot;generation time&quot; of 5 days. However the aphids only have sexual reproduction once, in the fall. </p>
<p>We have found evidence of resistance to neonicotinoids in the parasitoids but not the aphids, which may mean the parasitoids have evolved and the aphids have not.</p></div>		</li>
