			<div class="markdown"><p>The nursery business is also somewhat like this. When it comes to woody ornamental shrubs and certain trees you need to wait years for these things to grow. Many small nursery operations start off propagating fast growing perennials as well as purchase wholesale from other growers to supplement their own stock. </p>
<p>Eventually they can sell the trees that have taken years to mature. </p></div>		</li>

<p>Basically, this is why most real distillers (as opposed to people who just buy and relabel) have an entire product line.</p>

<p>This is why you've seen more small batch &quot;moonshine&quot; and rum in liquor stores recently.  Those companies need revenue while their whiskey ages.</p></div>		</li>
