			<div class="markdown"><p>Something I've taken to doing while snorkeling is wearing sunproof rashguards/shirts and leggings, which eliminates the need for sunscreen on most of your body (or you could wear one or the other to cut down on the amount necessary.)</p>
<p>I still use coral safe sunscreen for the little that's left, but now that I don't have to worry about missing a spot or reapplying my pasty ass gets burned less too, so everyone wins.</p>
<p>Also, if anyone's wondering it isn't hot even in the warmest water.</p></div>		</li>
