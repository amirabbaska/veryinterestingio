I'm on my phone so can't look up the numbers, but it think pap is something like 60% specificity and HPV DNA tests are 90+%. </p>
<p>Of course, because pap relies on someone physically looking at stuff through microscopes, it's not that easy to compare as it relies on the skill, or not, of the person doing it, and of course their mood, fitness, etc.</p></div>		</li>
