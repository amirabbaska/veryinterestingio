<p>To add to your answer, the period for France is 2 days, because some places vote the day before the election, like French citizen in the US, or other places still connected to France (not sure how they are called in English). That is the reason for it being 2 days, instead of a usual 1 day.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Everyone already knows what a shitstorm the last US election was. Do you think something like this would help us? I feel like in theory it would, but it would be hard to implement, maybe, because all of our &quot;freedom&quot; and stuff. But seriously, do you feel it makes a difference? Do people get upset over it? </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>I am, by no means, an expert, in fact, I am quite young to be giving opinion on this matter, but as any young adult, I will give it anyway, why not?</p>
<p>In the US, you have many weird laws, and I would say that trying to implement something like this, in an established process that you already have would be impossible, from what I can tell the people reaction would be. Here, as things have always been like this, we don't get upset, it's just how things work.</p>
<p>Also, regarding if it works, well, for the vast majority of people, and in the end, they are the ones electing the next government, it doesn't make a difference. People tend to vote like a club, or like a popularity contest. Most people have no idea what each candidate represents, other than the idea that the media gives, so, in my opinion, it doesn't make a difference, and in the US, it wouldn't make a difference at all, since you have a really weird election system. </p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>New Zealander here. We have a similar blackout, though it is only on the day of the election until 7pm, so it can be reported on that night.</p>
<p>Last time, a sports celebrity got in trouble for tweeting who he voted for on the day of the election. I don't think he was actually charged, just given a warning or something, but I think the point was that 'an ordinary member of the public' depends on how high profile the person is and who is going to see their comment. Sporting personalities obviously don't qualify as ordinary citizens in this context, but 'ordinary' people who happen to have a lot of followers ought to be carefull too.</p>
<p>The law applies to everyone from what I understand, but there is discretion in who is charged. They obviously wouldn't chase down random people no-one cares about for posting on facebook.</p>
<p>I think the only reason he wasn't charged was because this was a unusual situation that hadn't occured before and people weren't generally aware that this kind of conduct was illegal.</p></div>		</li>
