			<div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/472385_8" target="_blank">here you go</a>. highlights include:  In animals, an LD50  could not be established, even 800 mg/kg bodyweight (high dose) was not lethal, Studies of human subjects given varying doses of melatonin (1-6.6 g/day) for 30-45 days have concluded that, aside from drowsiness, all findings were normal at the end of the test period. but it isn't completely harmless, lots of other side-effects have been reported.</p>
<p>i google &quot;ld50 melatonin&quot;, in the future if you are looking for the lethal dose that may be the quickest way to get you in the right area, ld50 is the lethal dose for 50% of the subjects.</p></div>		</li>

</blockquote>
<p>&quot;One case of extremely high melatonin levels associated with delayed puberty and hypogonadism has been reported.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Recent experimental evidence demonstrates that melatonin reduces sperm motility...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Preliminary animal studies suggest that melatonin may accelerate the development of autoimmune conditions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Melatonin injections given in the morning stimulate tumor growth [in cancer patients]...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...melatonin administration that unduly prolongs the nocturnal melatonin rise, or that is given throughout the day, may exacerbate SAD and bipolar and classic depression.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Finally, animal studies have shown that moderately large doses of melatonin ... increased light-induced damage to retinal photoreceptors.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is also some concern regarding increased atherosclerosis in the aorta in hypercholesterolemic rats caused by melatonin.&quot;</p>
<p>At least one of these can cause death.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Thanks. I know what an ld50 is. My assumption was OP was asking for information on acute toxicity/overdose in humans, so that's why I used a clinical reference guide. I'm a little unsure why you replied to me instead of just responding to OP, since it seems you brought up a different topic.</p></div>		</li>

			<div class="markdown"><p>Also most don't know that too much melatonin can be achieved with as little as 1-3mg (depending on formulation, sublingual is a lot less), as proper dosing is in the micrograms range.</p></div>		</li>
