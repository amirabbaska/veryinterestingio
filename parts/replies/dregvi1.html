			<div class="markdown"><p>You’re welcome! Color film uses different chemicals for both the photo sensitive chemicals and the developer chemicals. It gets pretty complicated, But I’ll give a very short ELI3 version of it. </p>
<p>Basically there are a few different ways color films work, but I’ll use an example of the most common way. Instead of having one coating of light sensitive chemicals on the film, there are 3 different coatings that are sensitive to one color of light each. Red, blue and green. Each coating only picks up one of those colors, when they are all on top of each other they create a huge number of other colors like, like purple, yellow, orange etc.. it’s the combination of blue, red and green that makes all the other colors possible. </p>
<p>When color film was starting out, they used to shoot all three colors separately and then layer them on top of each other in post production. This was really expensive because it required 3 times as much film. Eventually they figured out how to do it all at once. </p>
<p>The same principals apply to color film as black and white, they just use different chemicals and processes.  </p>
<p>A lot of people also have trouble understanding how you can get a sharp image on the film. This is done through the lens of the camera, which focuses the light onto the film in the same way that your eyes focus light onto your retina. You’re eyes dilate or “open up” when there it is darker out to allow more photons to enter your eye. The same rule applies with a camera, when it’s darker, the hole in the camera needs to be bigger to allow more light photons in to expose the film.</p>
<p>Basically, from an optical position, a camera works exactly like your eyes.  The reason why a cell phone camera typically doesn’t work well in low light is because the camera hole is so small it can’t let very much light in if it’s dark out.</p>
<p>EDIT: You also asked how the “camera knows” which colors are which? Well the camera doesn’t actually “know” anything. A camera is simply an instrument that facilitates exposing film to light.  You can make a camera out of a shoebox, and if you have light sensitive paper in the box, you will get an image.  Look up shoe box pin hole cameras! </p></div>		</li>
